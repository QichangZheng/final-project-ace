Finally. The Feds — including ICE — appear to be investigating Ilhan Omar.,"On Oct. 30, I reported that the Department of Justice had assigned an FBI Special Agent in Charge, or SAC, to review Rep. Ilhan Omar's apparent, astonishing spree of felonies from 2009 to 2017.

Minnesota state Rep. Steve Drazkowski (R) had previously filed a complaint on the matter with the Minnesota District of the Department of Justice. That office — headed by U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald, a 2018 Donald Trump appointee — directed the FBI to review the complaint. An FBI SAC formally met with Rep. Drazkowski, and others, in mid-October to receive a prepared file of evidence and related information.

I can confirm that the FBI has taken additional steps since this October meeting.

***

In October, the FBI SAC stated that the wide range of criminal activity suggested by the evidence against Rep. Omar may lead the FBI to expand the review to other federal departments. In such situations, the SAC continued, the FBI often acts as a hub — sharing evidence, or coordinating a joint investigation, with several other investigative agencies.

Indeed, this has since occurred.

At least the following two federal agencies were contacted by the FBI with information regarding Rep. Omar. The FBI then placed the October meeting attendees in touch with selected investigators within these two agencies:

1. Department of Education Inspector General

This is related to evidence suggesting that Rep. Omar's 2009 marriage to a UK citizen may have been an attempt to facilitate federal student loan fraud, or other fraud involving higher education.

● Shortly after Omar's 2009 marriage, the new couple moved to Fargo, North Dakota. Omar enrolled at North Dakota State University in August 2009. Her husband enrolled the following year.

Omar received a degree in June 2011. According to Omar herself, she and her husband then permanentlyseparatedin June 2011. The marriage's start and end coincide with the start and end dates of Omar's NDSU enrollment.

Incredibly — according to address records, and a statement from Omar herself — she was also still living with her first husband, and their two kids, throughout this second marriage.

● In 2017, Omar finally filed for divorce. Under penalty of perjury, she submitted a nine-question form to the court attesting to having lost all contact with her NDSU husband in June 2011.

Dozens of verified social media posts, photos, and even a 2016 interview with the NDSU husband indicate otherwise. It appears Omar perjured herself eight times answering those nine questions.

(Click here for analysis of an additional court document Omar submitted, which suggests the likely motive for Omar taking such a risk. Each instance of perjury in Minnesota can receive a sentence of five years.)

2. Immigration and Customs Enforcement

● This is related to evidence suggesting a breathtaking number of possible immigration-related felonies. As I stated in an introductory passage within my July 18 article:

The [following] answers to those questions about [Rep. Omar's 2009 marriage] appear to give probable cause to investigate Omar for eight instances of perjury, immigration fraud, marriage fraud, up to eight years of state and federal tax fraud, two years of federal student loan fraud, and even bigamy.



To be clear: The facts describe perhaps the most extensive spree of illegal misconduct committed by a House member in American history.

The involvement of ICE with a possible criminal investigation could hardly be of greater political import to Omar.

For several years, Omar has vigorously supported the abolishmentof ICE. Her 2020 re-election platform — featured on her campaign site, and pictured below — targets ICE agents with vicious rhetoric that simply must be read by interested parties.

States Omar's site: ""Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is an unreformable organization that has become increasingly militarized, brutal, and unaccountable.""

--

Since August 2016, the remarkable story of Rep. Ilhan Omar's past has produced scarce political, law enforcement, or media activity. A near-perfect inversion of the Trump/""Russian collusion"" yarn, with which it is inseparable.

Consider how the Trump investigation was initiated, as former FBI Director James Comey tells it. (Recent statements from Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham suggest disagreement.) Comey treated an unverifiable claim, from a foreign diplomat, of a drunken remark by a low-level Trump staffer as predicate for spying on a presidential campaign.

Comey never did find stronger evidence. Yet the Democratic Party and supportive media hardly paused, for three years, covering this investigation.

Concurrently — in August 2016 — Minnesota reporters Scott Johnson and Preya Samsundar were publishing extensive, verified, still-unchallenged evidence implicating Rep. Omar in multiple felonies. Their exponentially more substantial evidence was ignored by the Democratic Party and supportive media. Their evidence was even ignored by law enforcement, per an extraordinary public dismissal shortly before Omar's 2016 election to the Minnesota House of Representatives.

FBI guidelines require only ""'articulable factual basis' of possible criminal activity"" to open an investigation. By September 2016, Johnson and Samsundar had objectively breached that threshold. Picture Comey applying his ""Crossfire Hurricane"" standards to their work — perhaps Omar's trial reaches the sentencing phase before the November election.

I followed up on Johnson and Samsundar's investigation in early 2018. A year later, the proportions of the verifiable case against Omar resemble that against a Batman villain. A comical number of likely felonies, all backed by gobsmacking evidence: Certified state and federal documents; certified UK government documents; archived state public school records; archived U.S. and UK address records; verifiably unmanipulated digital photographs; corroborating statements from Omar herself; corroborating statements from Omar's ex-husband himself; several years of social media posts from Omar's verified accounts; and several years of suddenly deleted social media posts from Omar's verified accounts.

And that's before we reach the good stuff.

Click here for what sure appears to be smoking-gun evidence. The only man on Earth with the same name and birthdate as Omar's ex-husband — appears to have been raised in the London home of Ilhan's verifiable sister. And has the same three family names.

Yet media continued to approach the developing story of Omar's background with zero rigor.

Literally zero.

Their distortions were provably deliberate, and their intentions blinking-red evident. Simply, Ilhan Omar's ""identity"" struck the Democratic Party and supportive media as being a best-case vehicle for selling progressivism. Omar's character? Worst-case. But they preferred the fantasy — they printed it, over and over, along with that other one sparked by drunken hearsay. The rule of law and the safety of Jews were roadblocks.

The Democratic Party and the media have not changed. Consider the coverage of the House Democrats' articles of impeachment, which do not even allege that the president committed a crime. However — much of the Obama-era, politically infected law enforcement leadership is indeed fired and gone. We have cause to believe many career federal investigators are honorable and were glad to see them go.

Rep. Omar now appears to be receiving the scrutiny her ""articulable facts"" have deserved since August 2016; perhaps a criminal investigation is open.",https://www.theblaze.com/contributors/feds-investigating-ilhan-omar,2020-01-16
Horowitz: Science mag that warned about danger of leaky vaccines in 2018 posts false editor’s note to cover for COVID shots,"Leaky vaccines are worse than no vaccine at all. That is the unmistakable conclusion one would derive from a May 2018 article in Quanta magazine, a top scientific publication, about the unsuccessful attempts to create vaccines for HIV, malaria, and anthrax that aren’t leaky and don’t run the risk of making the pathogens more dangerous.

Yet now that we are seeing such a microbiological Frankenstein play out in real life and people like Dr. Robert Malone have been citing this article to raise red flags about the leaky COVID shots, Quanta magazine took the unprecedented step of slapping an editor’s note on an article three and a half years later to get people to stop applying it to the leakiest vaccine of all time.

But the assertion that the shots reduce transmission is patently false, and the fact that these vaccines indeed don’t stop transmission or reduce viral load makes them the perfect candidate for the nightmare scenario the article’s author, Melinda Wenner Moyer, once warned about.

In order to distract from the failure of the shots to stop transmission, the injection cult focused on their purported ability to protect against severe illness. But as so many more vaccinated became severely ill as well – following like clockwork the timeline of events we witnessed from the leaky Marek’s disease chicken vaccine – they then focused on boosters to distract from the next failure. But any way you slice it, there is no way to run or hide from the fact that these shots have not reduced transmission one iota. In fact, some of the most prolific spreads are happening in places with near-universal vaccination rates among adults, often the most vaccinated region in the country having the highest number of cases per capita.

In many ways, this vaccine is much leakier than even the ones Moyer warned about in 2018. This is why Israel needs to authorize a fourth shot already for those with three shots, just to get them some protection from serious illness. The Pfizer CEO declared this week that in the U.S., “I think we will need a fourth dose.” At least 68 health care workers in a Spanish hospital got the virus despite already having been jabbed three times. 90% of those who recently rested positive on a flight from South Africa to the Netherlands were vaccinated, and all 14 who tested positive for Omicron were vaccinated. And of course, there is no denying the negative efficacy we are seeing on infection rates in the U.K. among the vaccinated.

Studies have consistently shown that transmission rates and viral loads were not different from vaccinated to unvaccinated people. An Oxford study even showed that the vaccinated did not experience lower rates of “long COVID” from infection. Researchers from the CDC’s COVID-19 Response Team recently posted a preprint study of prisoners and found that “no significant differences were detected in duration of RT-PCR positivity among fully vaccinated participants (median: 13 days) versus those not fully vaccinated (median: 13 days; p=0.50), or in duration of culture positivity.” They concluded, “Clinicians and public health practitioners should consider vaccinated persons who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 to be no less infectious than unvaccinated persons.”

So now that we’ve established that, contrary to the editors of Quanta, the vaccine is as leaky as it comes, what are the consequences? The 2018 article warns that unlike standard vaccines that drop in efficacy over time, leaky vaccine “failures caused by vaccine-induced evolution are different” because “these drops in vaccine effectiveness are incited by changes in pathogen populations that the vaccines themselves directly cause.” Moyer warns that RNA viruses have “a mutation rate as much as 100,000 times greater than that found in human DNA.”

But what if you threw 8.23 billion doses (and counting) of a leaky, non-sterilizing vaccine up against a mutant-prone RNA virus like a coronavirus? While the article focuses on potential leaky vaccines for HIV and malaria, working from the lesson of the Marek’s disease chicken vaccine, the concern that “these new vaccines may incite a different, and potentially scarier, kind of microbial evolution” should apply doubly for the COVID shots. Quoting professor Andrew Read of Penn State, Moyer shows how leaky vaccines in humans could potentially allow the virus to have its cake and eat it too – become very transmissible while remaining dangerously virulent, just like the learned experience with Marek’s chickens.

The problem with leaky vaccines, Read says, is that they enable pathogens to replicate unchecked while also protecting hosts from illness and death, thereby removing the costs associated with increased virulence. Over time, then, in a world of leaky vaccinations, a pathogen might evolve to become deadlier to unvaccinated hosts because it can reap the benefits of virulence without the costs — much as Marek’s disease has slowly become more lethal to unvaccinated chickens. This virulence can also cause the vaccine to start failing by causing illness in vaccinated hosts.

It's hard not to get goose bumps when observing that this is exactly what has been occurring since around July – roughly when the vaccines began leaking. The virus became extremely transmissible and was at least as virulent, as so many younger and healthier people were crushed by the virus. First it appeared to mainly affect the unvaccinated, then over time, as witnessed by the weekly data reports from the U.K., it began affecting even the protection from serious illness in the vaccinated – to the point that public health authorities could no longer hide the failure and had to throw a hail Mary calling for boosters.

Moyer notes that Read found a similar phenomenon with a leaky malaria vaccine in mice as with Marek’s disease vaccines in chickens:

In a 2012 paper published in PLOS Biology, Read and Vicki Barclay, his postdoc at the time, inoculated mice with a component of several leaky malaria vaccines currently being tested in clinical trials. They then used these infected-but-not-sick mice to infect other vaccinated mice. After the parasites circulated through 21 rounds of vaccinated mice, Barclay and Read studied them and compared them to malaria parasites that had circulated through 21 rounds of unvaccinated mice. The strains from the vaccinated mice, they found, had grown far more virulent, in that they replicated faster and killed more red blood cells. At the end of 21 rounds of infection, these more quickly growing, deadly parasites were the only ones left.

Now extrapolate that nightmare to humans, and you will understand the insane infection rates of a virulent virus creating death and mayhem since July at much higher rates than we saw before the vaccines ever appeared. Researchers at Queen Mary, University of London, noticed a strange phenomenon from ONS England mortality data that seemed to show a spike in deaths from the unvaccinated every time there was a large vaccination drive.

What would the two factors have to do with each other? Could this be the effect of those vaccinated with a leaky virus – before their protection from severe illness wears off – absolutely blasting the unvaccinated with a more virulent and aggressive virus made stronger by the suboptimal evolutionary pressure placed upon it by the vaccine?

Moyer ends the article by noting that, as Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche has warned, “the most crucial need right now is for vaccine scientists to recognize the relevance of evolutionary biology to their field.” However, she quotes Professor Read as saying that “researchers are afraid: They’re nervous to talk about and call attention to potential evolutionary effects because they fear that doing so might fuel more fear and distrust of vaccines by the public.”

So even three years ago, vaccination was just as sacrosanct in that you were not allowed to raise any red flags about flaws in some vaccines. And that is what we are seeing today. No matter how many red flags we see with this vaccine – from individual injuries to micro-evolutionary concerns about creating stronger resistant strains – you can never question any form of vaccine under any circumstance for any reason. And doing so will even get the publication to place an editor’s note three and a half years after publication wrongly suggesting that the leakiest vaccine of all time doesn’t leak.

Indeed, professor Read has already been forced to publicly denounce any comparison of COVID shots to his research on leaky vaccines, even if that required him to falsely assert that the COVID shots reduce transmission.



As New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern warned, “There’s not going to be an endpoint to this vaccination program.”

New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern says ""There’s not going to be an endpoint to this vaccination program"" www.youtube.com

She is correct. There is no endpoint to a leaky vaccine that directly induces viral immune escape. Precisely because those vaccines don’t work and actually make the virus stronger are why there is always a need for more vaccines that will make even more resistant pathogens so you can keep vaccinating and use the fear generated from the failures of the first round to facilitate the marketing of the second round. After all, we wouldn’t want a vaccine program to become a victim of its own success.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/horowitz-science-mag-that-warned-about-danger-of-leaky-vaccines-in-2018-posts-false-editors-note-to-cover-for-covid-shots,2021-12-09
The FBI released 22 pages of files it had on Bigfoot — here's what they said,"The FBI has released nearly two dozen documents it had on the mythical North American biped known as Bigfoot. These include descriptions of encounters and details of analysis that was done on hair samples.

What do the documents say?

The first document, a letter dated Dec. 15, 1976, from former Assistant FBI Director Jay Cochran Jr. to Peter Byrne, the director of the Bigfoot Information Center and Exhibition in Oregon, mentions 15 ""unidentified hairs and tissue"" samples that Byrne wanted the FBI to analyze. Cochran agreed, and asked Byrne to send the samples to an FBI lab in Washington, D.C.

In a letter dated Aug. 26, 1976, Byrne pleads with the FBI to ""set the record straight, once and for all, inform us if the FBI has examined hair which might be that of a bigfoot; when this took place, if it did take place; what the results of this analysis were.""

Afraid that the FBI might not take his request seriously, he added, ""[P]lease understand that our research here is serious. That this is a serious question that needs answering and that an examination of hair, or the opposite, by the FBI, does not in any way, as far as we are concerned, suggest that the FBI, is associated with our project or confirms in any way the possibility of the existence of the creature(s) known as bigfoot.""

The documents also contain scans of newspaper clippings and the infamous blurry photo of Bigfoot included at the top of this story.

On Feb. 24, 1977, Cochran sent a letter to Howard S. Curtis, the executive vice president of the Academy of Applied Science in Boston, with the disappointing results of the hair analysis. From this letter it appears that the Curtis had submitted the sample on behalf of Byrne.

After an ""examination,"" which ""included a study of morphological characteristics such as root structure, medullary structure and cuticle thickness in addition to scale casts,"" the FBI determined that ""the hairs are of deer family origin.""

Pictures included with the letter purporting to be scans of the sample, show about a dozen or so pieces of hair roughly 4 1/2 inches long, attached to what seems to be a small piece of flesh roughly an inch in length.

In the final letter in this batch of documents, Curtis thanks Byrne for the analysis, and promises to deliver copies of the communication he had with the FBI to Byrne when he returned from Nepal. Byrne had traveled to the Asian country more than once to search for Bigfoot's wintery cousin, the Yeti.

What else?

During one of his trips to Nepal, not mentioned in the documents, he employed actor Jimmy Stewart and his wife Gloria to help him smuggle a finger from an alleged Yeti hand from a Nepalese monastery into the United Kingdom for testing. This finger turned out to be from a human.",https://www.theblaze.com/furnace/ready-the-fbi-released-22-pages-of-files-it-had-on-bigfoot-heres-what-they-said,2019-06-05
Change My Mind: America is SUPERIOR,"""Louder with Crowder"" host Steven Crowder shared bonus footage Thursday from his recent installment of ""Change My Mind"" where he defended his belief that America is the greatest country in the world and asked a student named Elise to change his mind.

While Elise claimed that she believed that America is great, she also stated that America is good but that other countries were were as good or better based on the health care system.

Click here to watch the full clip.

Crowder focused on the First Amendment, in honor of Independence Day, and asked Elise to share her opinion regarding freedom of speech in America and whether or not freedom of speech is one of the key elements that have made America superior.

According to Elise, America is not a superior country because of the flaws in our current health care system.

""I just don't think that America can be called the greatest country on Earth when people are dying because they don't have access to medication,"" Elise said.

Crowder explained why free health care would actually a violation of individual rights and why America is indeed the greatest country in the world.

""Not only because our health care is better than in those countries, the deaths are seven times higher if you have a disease in the UK the health outcomes are not better in other countries,"" Crowder said. ""Not only do I believe America is superior to those countries, outside of health care, freedom of speech is a big one. How can a country be better when they do not allow people freedom of speech?""

""I feel like freedom of speech is very important but i feel like there are certain things that are more important than others,"" Elise said.

Crowder asked Elise if she is willing to give up her right to free speech for socialized health care.

Elise said that she felt there are some things that she believed people should not be allowed to say.

""I don't think that I should be allowed to go around saying the N-word,"" Elise said.

Crowder asked her to clarify why she felt this way. Elise claimed that because the N-word is offensive that she should not have the right to say use it in public.

""That guy just called me a f***ing idiot,"" Crowder said. ""Should I be able to have these guys haul him away in cuffs?'

Boris Johnson will face a vote of confidence to determine if he gets the boot as Prime Minister,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is scheduled to face a vote of confidence Monday.

CNN reported that this vote to determine whether or not Johnson gets the boot from office was triggered by lawmakers within the prime minister’s own party who have grown dissatisfied with his performance in the role.

Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench lawmakers in Parliament, said in a statement that the number of Conservative Party parliamentarians calling for a vote of confidence in Johnson had reached the necessary threshold.

The vote of confidence will reportedly be held in England between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. with results expected to be announced shortly thereafter.

If 180 Conservative lawmakers — a simple majority within the party — vote against Johnson, e will cease to be the leader of the party and will be forced to vacate the office of prime minister. If this is the case, Johnson will be getting the boot just three years after his party took parliament by winning parliament in a general election landslide.

Under current party rules, if Johnson is forced out of office, he will not be allowed to run in the leadership contest to determine his replacement.

If Johnson survives the vote of confidence, he will remain as both the leader of the party and continue serving as prime minister.

Johnson has fallen out of favor with many in the Conservative Party after the so-called “Partygate” scandal stemming from months of allegations of parties and intimate gatherings be hosted by the prime minster throughout England’s COVID-19 lockdown. Johnson participating and hosting these events is largely what has eroded confidence in his leadership.

Last month, a report released by Sue Gray, a senior civil servant, detailed a culture of partying and socializing among Johnson’s staff while millions of British citizens were banned from seeing their friends and relatives. Johnson has also been heavily criticized for his government’s response to the rapidly rising cost of living in Great Britain.

A spokesperson from Johnson’s administration said that the prime minister “welcomes the opportunity to make his case to MPs.”

The spokesperson said, “Tonight is a chance to end months of speculation and allow the government to draw a line and move on, delivering on the people's priorities.”

The spokesperson added that Johnson will “remind [the MPs] that when they’re united and focused on the issues that matter to voters there is no more formidable political force.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657464262,2022-06-06
Survey: 1 in 5 Europeans believe a secret Jewish cabal orchestrates global affairs,"One-fifth of Europeans believe an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that a secret Jewish cabal influences global political and economic affairs, a new survey found.

More than 16,000 citizens from 16 different European countries including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Belgium were interviewed over the last couple months as a part of the survey conducted by the Hungary-based Action and Protection League.

The results were disclosed at a conference on anti-Semitism in Paris on Monday, according to the Jewish Telegraph Agency, which also reported findings that one in five Europeans agreed with the statement that ""Jews exploit Holocaust victimhood for their own needs.""

Here are some of the other results from the survey:

A quarter of respondents agreed with the statement that Israel's policies make them understand why some people hate Jews.



More than a quarter concurred with the statement that ""Israel is engaged in legitimate self defense against its enemies."" A quarter of respondents disagreed and 46% did not express a position.



More than a third agreed with the assertion that ""During World War II, people from our nation suffered as much as Jews.""

A sample of 1,000 adults from each of the 16 countries were presented with 45 questions or statements in face-to-face interviews about Jews and Israel, the Action and Protection League told JTA. The survey reportedly has a margin of error of +/-0.8 percent.

Commenting on the results, Rabbi Slomo Koves, the chairman of the Action and Protection League, reported that Holocaust revisionism and stereotypes about Jewish people were more prevalent in Eastern European countries, while anti-Israel sentiments were more prevalent in Western Europe.

A complete breakdown of the survey results on a country-by-country basis is still being worked out, Koves acknowledged.

The survey follows a similar study conducted by the Anti-Defamation League, an international Jewish organization that aims to stop the defamation of Jewish people worldwide, last spring and summer. That study, which interviewed people living in 18 countries around the world, found that 1 in 4 Europeans ""harbor pernicious and pervasive attitudes toward Jews.""

Anti-Semitism is not isolated to European countries, though. A recent FBI statement titled, ""Confronting the Rise in Anti-Semitic Domestic Terrorism,"" noted that ""2019 was the deadliest year for domestic violent extremism"" since 1995.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/1-in-5-europeans-secret-jewish-cabal,2020-02-27
17-year-old who recorded viral video telling teacher there are only 'two genders' is kicked out of school,"First, the 17-year-old earned a three-week suspension after recording a viral video of him telling a teacher there are only ""two genders.""

But now the teen is no longer allowed to attend Mearns Academy in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the Evening Standard reported.

What's the background?

Citing an interview with the boy, the paper said the flap erupted when his teacher complained about a website that provided only two gender options and ""how old fashioned"" that was — and the student spoke up: ""But, sir, there's only two genders.""

""He instantly snapped back and said, 'Are you really going to go there?' and I was like, 'Yeah, there's two genders,' and he said, 'Murray, if you want to have this discussion, we can have it outside,'"" the student said, according to the Evening Standard.

Outside the classroom, the student hit record on his cellphone just prior to the teacher joining him — and their argument was captured for posterity.

""You're entitled to your opinion,"" the teacher said.

""If I am, then why did you kick me out of class?"" the student shot back. ""That's not very inclusive.""



""You aren't being inclusive,"" the teacher argued, adding that ""this is an inclusive school.""

The teacher added that the student's notion that there aren't any other genders except male or female ""is not inclusive.""

The student started arguing again, but the teacher interrupted by saying ""you're choosing to make an issue of this"" and that the student had an ""opportunity to keep quiet.""

'Could you please keep that opinion to your own house?'

When the student continued arguing the two-genders-only point, the teacher grew flustered and asked, ""Could you please keep that opinion to your own house? Thank you. Not in this school.""



But the student didn't. In fact, he pressed on, saying it's unfair that the teacher got to state his opinion in class but the student was silenced.

'I am stating what is national school authority policy, OK?'

""I am not putting my opinion out,"" the teacher replied. ""I am stating what is national school authority policy, OK?""

But when the student argued that the more-than-two-genders policy ""isn't scientific whatsoever,"" the still-flustered teacher offered that ""not every policy is scientific.""

""Take this somewhere else ..."" the teacher soon added. ""The authority's point of view is very clear … that we make no discrimination on the grounds of—""

Then the student cut off the teacher: ""I'm not making any discrimination. I'm simply saying there are two genders. Male and female.""

""I'm sorry,"" the teacher said, ""but you chose to make an issue of making a point which was contrary to policy.""

The teacher added in a lower voice that the student is ""making bad choices.""

My Teacher Kicked Me Out of Class for Saying There are Two Genders youtu.be

Punishments mount



The student said he first earned a weeklong suspension for recording his teacher, which he said wasn't a surprise since he knew about that rule, the paper said.

The school ""emphasized that I wasn't getting into trouble for what I said"" on the video about two genders only, the student also noted, according to the Evening Standard.

He then said the school soon extended the suspension by another two weeks and told him he could return after summer break, the paper said.

'No chance I can return'



""We got called back in for another meeting, and they said after having lots of talks with people higher up [that] it's not OK for me to finish my education at that school effectively, and they told me there's no chance I can return,"" the student said, the Evening Standard reported.

An alternate perspective



But an Aberdeenshire council spokesperson said the student wasn't ""permanently excluded from Mearns Academy"" as he'd ""reached the end of his time in compulsory education,"" which ends at age 16 in Scotland, the paper said.

""Staff from the school are working hard to ensure that the young man has a positive future placement either in further education or in an area that he chooses,"" the spokesperson added to the Evening Standard.

Now what?



The student said he's unsure what path to take at this point and is worried a new school might ask Mearns Academy for a reference: ""This won't just affect me in this school; this could affect me in getting into another school as well,"" he noted, according to the paper, adding that the circumstance is ""definitely a big speed bump in my life at the moment.""

39 found dead in refrigerated truck container in UK; human trafficking suspected,"Ambulance workers found 39 dead bodies, including one teenager, in the container of a truck parked at an industrial park in Purfleet, Essex, of the United Kingdom, according to CNN.

Police have arrested 25-year-old truck driver Morris Robinson of Northern Ireland on suspicion of murder. Paul Berry, the local councillor for Armagh in Northern Ireland, confirmed the driver's identity, although police are not commenting at this time.

Authorities believe the truck arrived by sea from the Belgian port city of Zeebrugge early Wednesday morning.

""Sickening news of 39 people found dead in a container in Grays,"" wrote Jackie Doyle-Price, the MP for the area in which the truck was found. ""People trafficking is a vile and dangerous business. This is a big investigation for Essex Police. Let's hope they bring these murderers to justice.""

Officials say the truck container was refrigerated, meaning temperatures could've been as low inside as -5 or -10 degrees Fahrenheit.

Police and the British Red Cross are working to identify the victims, including opening a hotline for anyone who believes a loved one may have been on the truck. The victims are not believed to be Bulgarian citizens, although the truck had been registered in Bulgaria in 2017, then left the country for good.

Critical to the investigation is tracking the route the truck traveled before the bodies were found in Essex, which police are now scrambling to do in order to gain more insight into who is responsible for the deaths.

According to the U.K.'s National Crime Agency, ""the past year has seen increasing use of higher-risk methods of clandestine entry"" including ""movement of migrants (including children) into the U.K. in containers, refrigerated [heavy goods vehicles] and small boats, at a high risk to life of those migrants smuggled.""

Nine people were found alive in a separate truck on a U.K. highway later Wednesday, and are receiving precautionary medical treatment before being turned over to immigration officers.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/39-dead-bodies-found-in-truck-in-uk-in-possible-human-trafficking-tragedy,2019-10-23
70 coronavirus vaccines are in development around the world — an Oxford scientist says one could be ready by September,"One of Britain's top scientists leading the effort to produce a COVID-19 vaccine recently said she is ""80%"" confident that a vaccine could be ready by September.

Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at Oxford University, told the Times of London over the weekend that her team is set to begin human trials on its potential vaccine by the end of April. By September, the product could be ready for distribution — but only ""if everything goes perfectly,"" she acknowledged.

""I think there's a high chance that it will work based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine,"" Gilbert said. ""It's not just a hunch and as every week goes by we have more data to look at. I would go for 80%, that's my personal view.""

Gilbert's team is one of numerous teams around the world working diligently — and at unprecedented speed — to come up with a working vaccine to fight the global coronavirus pandemic that has infected at least 1.8 million and killed over 115,000 people worldwide.

The World Health Organization announced Saturday that there are 70 vaccines currently in development around the world, with three of them already being tested in human trials.

According to Time magazine, the vaccine that is furthest along in the clinical process is being developed by Hong Kong-listed CanSino Biologics and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology That vaccine is in phase 2 of human testing. Two others being developed in the United States by Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Moderna, along with the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, are currently in phase 1 of human testing.

The University of Oxford vaccine candidate could be the fourth product to begin human trials in the coming weeks.

Another vaccine being developed in the U.S. by a team of researchers at the University of Pittsburgh are in the pre-clinical stage and are currently seeking fast-tracked approval for testing from the Food and Drug Administration.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, a leading health official on the White House coronavirus task force, previously cautioned Americans that it would likely be 12-18 months before a vaccine could be developed. Until further notice that conventional wisdom still stands.

But the hope is that scientific innovation and ingenuity will speed the process and shorten the time period.

Gilbert is certainly hopeful about her team's vaccine, but was careful to add that ""nobody can promise it's going to work.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/70-coronavirus-vaccines-oxford-scientist-september,2020-04-13
77-year-old man shows off impressive boxing skills after would-be mugger tries to attack him at ATM — and the video footage is incredible,"A 77-year-old United Kingdom man is being hailed a hero for the way he physically staved off an attempted mugging.

Video of the incident has hit the internet and has gone viral.

What are the details?

A 77-year-old man named Trevor boxed his way out of a potential knifepoint mugging earlier in February.

Trevor had just arrived at an ATM in Cardiff, Wales, when an unknown attacker approached the elderly gentleman and demanded cash, according to South Wales police.

Trevor was having none of it, and decided to fight back instead.

Breaking out some boxing moves, Trevor grabbed the man, held him in a shoulder lock, and began punching and jabbing the would-be assailant. The unidentified attacker apparently decided the holdup wasn't worth it, though, and began backing away from the elderly man. Law enforcement officials said that the attacker got away, but was unable to get any cash from Trevor.



Authorities released surveillance footage of the incident on Wednesday, lauding the elderly man for his bravery. Trevor was not hurt during the scuffle. Police are still searching for the suspect and encourage the public to reach out with any knowledge of the attempted assault and robbery.

South Wales Police Cardiff tweeted about the incident on TKTK, writing, ""Detectives have been checking in on him and he's doing okay. He was shocked & very shaky after the incident, but thankful nothing worse had happened.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/77-year-old-man-shows-off-impressive-boxing-skills-after-would-be-mugger-tries-to-attack-him-at-atm-and-the-video-footage-is-incredibleh,2020-02-19
A British warship foiled a plan by Iran to seize a British oil tanker,"The Iranian Revolutionary Guard tried, unsuccessfully, to take control of a British oil tanker on Wednesday, before they were foiled by a British warship.

Here's what we know

On Wednesday, the oil tanker British Heritage, which is owned by energy giant BP, was traveling through the Persian Gulf when it was approached by three Iranian gunboats. These gunboats attempted to get the British Heritage to stop before it could leave the gulf. According to the BBC, the British Heritage was not in Iranian waters at the time.

But, thankfully for its crew, the tanker had a powerful escort: the Royal Navy ship HMS Montrose which had been following at a distance of about five miles. The three Iranian gunboats backed off after the Montrose moved itself in between them and the tanker.

Iran has denied that the incident ever happened, with the country's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif claiming that the U.K. made up the entire thing for the sake of ""creating tension.""

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani accused the U.K. of being ""scared"" on Wednesday, due to its use of warships like the Montrose to escort its oil tankers as they pass near Iran.

But the U.K. is taking precautions, particularly since just a week ago a member of the Iranian Supreme Leader's council warned that a British oil tanker would be seized by Iran if an Iranian tanker seized by the U.K. on July 4 was not released. The U.K. had taken control of the tanker Grace 1 after suspecting it of violating sanctions and bringing oil to war-torn Syria.

In a statement, U.K. Defense Secretary Penny Mordaunt said, ""The UK government is concerned by this action and we urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-british-warship-foiled-a-plan-by-iran-to-seize-a-british-oil-tanker,2019-07-11
"Activist backs removal of controversial statues, but admits she doesn't know who Winston Churchill is","Activist Lorraine Jones, who is chair of the Lambeth Independent Police Advisory Group out of the United Kingdom, said that she's never ""personally"" met former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and she's not sure his London statue should remain standing.

What are the details?

During an embarrassing Saturday exchange, Jones, speaking with Channel 4 News host Cathy Newman, addressed the recent defacing of a Churchill statue in London, blaming it on ""far-right"" activists.

""They were not guarding the Churchill statue,"" Jones said. ""The thuggery which we all witness was horrifying and totally unacceptable, so that was just an excuse.""

Jones added that certain people should be seriously examined to determine whether they are placed on a ""high pedestal in this society.""

""I think what needs to happen — which I know has already started — we need to look at the people that are being placed on a high pedestal in this society, the reasons why they are, and honestly and rightfully [decide] if they are supposed to be removed,"" she said.

""The sooner the government can make the decisions to take down the statues, which shouldn't be there, place them in a museum, like there are some people have requested, the better,"" she said.

But what about the Churchill statue?

Newman pressed Jones as to whether she believed the government should remove the Churchill statue.

""I've heard many arguments on both sides,"" Jones responded. ""Some say that he's a racist, some say that he's a hero. I haven't personally met him, but what I would say is that that question of whether he should remain should be put to the community.""

Churchill, the former British Prime Minister who led the U.K. to victory in World War II, died in 1965.

A perplexed Newman then went on to ask Jones whether she personally believed the Churchill statue should be removed.

“Well, I'm going to be honest, I haven't done a lot of history work with Churchill, but if I was to do that, it will be based on my findings,"" Jones said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/activist-controversial-statues-winston-churchill,2020-06-15
Activists in fire truck try spraying red dye on UK treasury building to protest climate change. It doesn't go so well.,"You know the old saying: ""Let the buyer beware"" — i.e., caveat emptor.

Apparently some climate activists never took Latin.

You see, the good folks at Extinction Rebellion had it in mind to spray water colored with red food dye upon the British finance ministry building Thursday to drum up attention concerning what they said was the government's failure to stave off climate change, Reuters reported.

So they drove up to the British Treasury in a fire engine, grabbed a hose, and took aim.

Getcha popcorn ready

Keep in mind the outlet said Extinction Rebellion purchased the fire truck on eBay.

For a few seconds things appear to go as planned. The hose seems in fine working condition as the liquid starts hitting the building:

Then — boom:

A malfunction, putting it gently, apparently befalls the group as the hose appears to explode in the faces of the gents aiming it at the treasury.



And soon the hose is spraying red dye everywhere — except upon the building's outside wall:

Image source: YouTube screenshot

A couple of intrepid folks try to get things under control — but to no avail:

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The hose of the eBay-purchased fire engine is just too powerful — and soon the street is drenched:

Oh, and did we fail to mention there's video?

Yes, indeed, there is. Check it out:



Extinction Rebellion spray 'fake blood' at the Treasury from fire engine www.youtube.com

What happened afterward?

Reuters said activists stood atop the fire engine sporting a banner which read, “Stop funding climate death.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

One activist was seen spray painting the same slogan on the walls of the building — albeit employing a much more controllable method:

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Extinction Rebellion added to the outlet that they sprayed 1,800 liters of fake blood at the Treasury — although ""at"" may be stretching it a tad, prepositionally speaking.



“The Treasury has been frustrating efforts by other government departments to take action against climate change because it cares only about economic growth,"" one activist who called himself Ben told Reuters. “It doesn't see that eternal economic growth leads to climate death. The red symbolizes the people dying now in the global south and also the people who are going to start dying from climate change all around the world if we do nothing.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Police told the outlet they arrested four people on suspicion of criminal damage and that some roads had been closed. Reuters also said police weren't sure what to do with the fire engine as the driver removed the keys.

It wasn't clear if Extinction Rebellion will ask eBay for a refund.

"Actor in rainbow-colored monkey costume with fake penis, nipples, bare bottom appears at children's event at London library — and outrage erupts","An actor dressed in a rainbow-colored monkey costume outfitted with a fake penis, nipples, and bare bottom appeared at a children's event at a library in the United Kingdom, after which outrage erupted.

What are the details?

Video and images shared on social media over the weekend showed members of Mandinga Arts at Redbridge Libraries Summer Reading Challenge event at Goodmayes Library in east London, the Evening Standard reported.

The paper said the monkey costume included a fake penis and bare bottom; the Daily Mail reported that the costume also was adorned with fake nipples.

The event was meant to encourage children to read, the Evening Standard added.

Conservative campaigner Has Ahmed tweeted, ""Apparently this is meant to encourage kids in Redbridge to pick up reading for summer. Please tell me the rationale behind these indecent costumes that were shown to families and done so publicly. Is this really necessary?""

Columnist Janice Turner tweeted that she ""would really love a detailed breakdown of the commissioning process"" that let loose ""Rainbow Dildo Butt Monkey as a means to teach children to read.""

Redbridge Libraries have apologized and ensured it ""will never happen again.""

""During an event put on at the library today there was a performance by a Carnival Arts Company. Unfortunately one of the animal costumes was inappropriate which we were not aware of at the time of booking,"" the library tweeted. ""We deeply apologize for the offense caused. This is being looked into ...""

However, the Daily Mail reported that the libraries initially said on social media, ""if you've got it, flaunt it"" in reference to the event.

Redbridge Council said that it did not arrange the event and that it was organized by Vision Redbridge Culture and Leisure (RCL), a registered charity and a non-profit organization, which has ""since apologized to residents,"" the Evening Standard said.

Labour councillor Jas Athwal tweeted: 'I was appalled by the incident in Redbridge Libraries on Saturday. Completely inappropriate and deeply offensive performers were hired by independent contractor Vision who manage Redbridge libraries and leisure centers. As soon as I was made aware of the performers, I immediately contacted Vision and the event was stopped. I have launched a full and thorough investigation into how these performers were hired by Vision and will put stringent measures in place to ensure something like this can't happen again.""

Website of group behind monkey costume is down

Mandinga Arts tweeted, ""We apologize for the offense caused while raising awareness of the reading campaign by Redbridge Libraries on 10 July. We never intended to offend residents. We respect everyone's individual opinion with no offense to any part. Actions are being taken, more information to follow.""

And while the group's website as well as its Facebook and Instagram pages were down Tuesday, it appears folks already got a look at some of what the group features and shared their findings.

Here's another tweet with an image we elected to not show. Content warning: Potentially offensive imagery.

Actor Kevin Spacey pleads not guilty to sexual assault charges in UK,"Academy Award-winning actor Kevin Spacey pleaded not guilty in U.K. court Thursday to charges of sexually assaulting three men at least a decade ago.

Spacey, 62, entered the plea at a hearing at London's Central Criminal Court, the Associated Press reported.



The famous actor — best known for his roles in ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""American Beauty,"" as well as the hit Netflix series ""House of Cards"" — was charged with four counts of sexual assault in May and one count of ""causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.""

Spacey has denied all of the charges against him.

The assaults allegedly happened in London between March 2005 and August 2008 and one in western England in April 2013. During this time, Spacey was serving as the artistic director for London's Old Vic theater.

The alleged male victims are now in their 30s and 40s.



At a preliminary hearing in June, Spacey's attorney Patrick Gibbs said the actor ""strenuously denies any and all criminality in this case."" The presiding judge then granted Spacey bail and permitted him to return to the United States.

After deliberation on Thursday, Justice Mark Wall set a trial date of June 6, 2023. Spacey was permitted to remain on unconditional bail until then, allowing him to freely move in and out of the U.K. until his trial.

The scandal-plagued actor has said he is ""confident"" he will be able to prove his innocence in court.

Spacey's career went into turmoil beginning in 2017, when fellow actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of making sexual advances towards him at a party in the 1980s, when Rapp was just 14 years old. Spacey said at the time that he didn't remember the alleged incident, but he apologized for ""deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.""

However, shortly thereafter, filmmaker Tony Montana claimed that Spacey had groped him at a bar in Los Angeles in 2003. And Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos then alleged that Spacey would frequent the Old Vic theater in London, where he would ""squeeze whoever caught his attention.""

That year, the Old Vic acknowledged it had received 20 allegations against Spacey that spanned ""a range of inappropriate behavior"" while he was employed as artistic director.

These allegations against Spacey came at the height of the #MeToo movement, after disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein's predatory behavior was exposed. Spacey was subsequently written out of the final season of ""House of Cards,"" and his role in Ridley Scott's 2017 film ""All the Money in the World"" was cut out of the film, while he was replaced by Christopher Plummer.

"Actress Evan Rachel Wood accuses musician-actor Marilyn Manson of underage grooming, 'horrific' abuse — and then more women come forward","Actress Evan Rachel Wood says that her ex-fiancé, musician and actor Marilyn Manson, ""horrifically abused"" and ""brainwashed"" her, even grooming her as a teenager.

Wood and Manson began dating in 2007 when she was 19 years old and he was 38.

What are the details?

Wood, 33, says that Manson — real name Brian Warner — carried out heinous acts of abuse on her during their relationship.

In a Monday morning Instagram post, Wood wrote, ""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson. He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.""

Her post continued, ""I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.""

Indeed, in 2009, Manson told Spin magazine that he often ""fantasized about smashing [Wood's] skull in with a sledgehammer"" after they broke up at one point during the tumultuous affair.



Wood first spoke of experiencing partner abuse during a 2016 Rolling Stone interview. She did not announce the name of her alleged abuser at the time, saying only that she endured disturbing abuse.

In 2018, Wood testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee in support of the Sexual Assault Survivors Bill of Rights, saying that she personally experienced ""toxic mental, physical, and sexual abuse"" and more. She did not announce the name of her alleged abuse at that time, either.

Wood's latest allegations opened up a floodgate of other women who reported having been abused by the performer.

Some of the women report experiencing rape, torture, physical abuse, death threats, and more.

What other women are saying

According to a Monday Vanity Fair report, a bevy of other women have come forward with alleged experiences of their own.

In a since-deleted Instagram post, Ashley Walters, a woman who was seen in public with Manson in 2011, writes, ""I continue to suffer from PTSD and struggle with depression. I stayed in touch with quite a few people who went through their own traumas under his control. As we all struggled, as survivors do, to get on with our lives, I'd keep hearing stories disturbingly similar to our own experiences. It became clear the abuse he's caused; he continues to inflict on so many and I cannot stand by and let this happen to others. Brian Warner needs to be held accountable.""

Another woman, Sarah McNeilly, said that she, too, suffered from PTSD after her entanglement with Manson.

""I have been afraid to bring any spotlight upon myself as to avoid winding up in his crosshairs again,"" she admitted. ""As a result of the way he treated me, I suffer from mental health issues and PTSD that have affected my personal and professional relationships, self-worth, and personal goals. I believe he gets off on ruining people's lives. I stand in support of all that have and all will come forward. I want to see Brian held accountable for his evil.""

McNeilly said that she was initially lured in as Manson posed as ""the perfect boyfriend,"" ""claiming he was just misunderstood.""

""I was locked in rooms when I was 'bad,' sometimes forced to listen to him entertaining other women,"" she wrote. ""Kept away from certain friends or if I didn't he would threaten to come after them. I was told stories of others who tried to tell their story and their pets ended up dead. I wasn't allowed to go near other artists working on the same set, as he told me they had aids and were disgusting and if I did so he would be very upset and 'I wouldn't want that.'""

She later wrote, ""I was thrown up against a wall and he threatened to bash my face in with the baseball bat he was holding, for trying to get him to pick out a pair of pants prior to a music video.""

A woman named Gabriella added, ""It has taken me five years to speak out and say that I was in an abusive relationship. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and still suffer from nightmares. I blocked out a lot of the memories, but the feelings remain and manifest in different ways. The reason I'm finally sharing this traumatic experience is for my healing and because I'm done being silent. I don't believe it's fair for someone to not be held accountable for their horrific actions. I'm not a victim. I'm a survivor.""

She also insisted that the performer forced her to take drugs, made fun of her black heritage, and cut her while the two had sex.

A woman by the name of Ashley Lindsay Morgan wrote, ""I have night terrors, PTSD, anxiety, and mostly crippling OCD. I try to wash constantly to get him out or off of me. ... I am coming forward to he will finally stop,""

What else?

In 2011, a police report was issued against Manson for ""alleged sex crimes,"" according to Vanity Fair. He denied all accusations of wrongdoing through his attorney, the outlet reported, and later issued a statement in 2020 denying any such allegations by Wood.

""Unfortunately we live in a time where people believe what they read on the internet, and feel free to say what they want with no actual evidence,"" a spokesperson for the performer said at the time. ""The effects can be catastrophic and promoting non-fact-based information is wholly irresponsible.""

In November, Loudwire asked Manson to respond to reports of abuse.

In a lengthy statement, a spokesperson for the entertainer said:

Personal testimony is just that, and we think it's inappropriate to comment on that.



You then go on to talk about Manson being accused of ""terrible things"" by unnamed ""critics"" but offer no guidance on who these critics are and what these things are, so it's not possible to comment.



You then mention Mickey Rourke. It is my understanding that Evan Rachel Wood dated multiple people around the time she was dating Manson. Basic internet research will give you a host of other names that have not come up in any of our discussions.



Your next couple of points deal with comments Manson made in Spin magazine in 2009. Your confusion around the timeline of this is extremely worrying. The comments in Spin where Manson had a fantasy of using a sledgehammer on Evan and he cut himself 158 times was obviously a theatrical rock star interview promoting a new record, and not a factual account. The fact that Evan and Manson got engaged six months after this interview would indicate that no one took this story literally.



You go on to talk about Manson commenting on sexual harassment, Me Too and specifically the experiences of his ex partner Rose McGowan. These are all issues that Manson has publicly addressed and are available online. Please see Channel 4 interview from 15th December 2017.



Manson has never shied away from public comment – equally he does not have to make the same comment twice.



There will be no further comment on specific songs. Your journalist had the opportunity to ask Manson about his music – one of only two interviews granted in the UK – and he chose not to. Trying to weave one section of one song from an artist with a 30 plus year career to fit a narrative is both disingenuous and troublesome.

You mention Manson's ex fiancée Rose McGowan in your questions. Rose is one of the bravest and most outspoken figureheads of the Me Too movement. Manson remains friends with McGowan and she talks very fondly of their three a half years together. There are multiple sources worldwide. I link to a Washington Post article on McGowan's memoir 'Brave' (2018).



You fail to mention Manson's ex-wife Dita Von Teese, who remains good friends with Manson. Quoting from a Female First article published in 2018, 'Dita admits she has been “lucky"" to avoid any abusive episodes in the entertainment industry in her career'.



There are also numerous articles over multiple years where Evan Rachel Wood speaks very positively about her relationship with Manson. In NetAPorters.com's The Edit (2015): “I wouldn't trade any of [our relationship],"" Wood told the mag. “I appreciate everything he taught me. I just don't think we were right for each other.""



Finally you talk about death threats. Manson knows all about those – he has had many. He has spent his career being blamed for everything from Columbine to teenage suicide. Unfortunately, we live in a time where people believe what they read on the Internet, and feel free to say what they want with no actual evidence. The effects can be catastrophic and promoting non fact based information is wholly irresponsible. All we can try and do, as the media and individuals, is to use facts and truth and not hide behind gossip and conjecture to further our own agendas.

A spokesperson for Manson did not respond to TheBlaze's request for comment in time for publication.

Actress Jessica Alba says Marvel superhero movies are still too 'caucasian' since she starred in 'Fantastic Four',"Hollywood actress Jessica Alba opined that Marvel superhero movies are still too ""caucasian"" since she starred in the ""Fantastic Four"" movie series.

The 41-year-old actress was speaking about diversity in the superhero movie world with Glamour UK magazine.

“Even if you look at the Marvel movies – that’s the biggest driver of fantasy and what’s happening right now in entertainment, because it’s sort of the family thing – it’s still quite Caucasian,” Alba said.



She went on to talk about her experience as one of the few minority actresses in a superhero movie when she portrayed Sue Storm in the Fantastic Four movies from 2005 and 2007

“I would say I was one of the few back in the day… And it was before Marvel was sold to Disney, but it’s still quite more of the same.”

Alba is Mexican American.

“I just think more for the younger people who are coming up, who are going to be our future leaders,"" she continued, ""it’s important for them to see the world on screen, or in stories, in the dreams that we create as entertainers; it reflects the world that they’re in.”

She had previously complained about being cast for ""exotic"" roles because she didn't quite look caucasian enough, but also didn't look Latina enough for a Latina role.

Diversity has been a concern for many of the creators of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Producers of the mega-popular ""Avengers: Endgame"" movie admitted that they were forced to reshoot a scene involving a group of female superheroes because it seemed to be ""pandering"" to the audience.



It has been rumored that Marvel Studios is looking to reboot the ""Fantastic Four"" movie franchise.

"After seventh child dies in UK from strep throat complications, experts warn parents to be on the lookout for serious complications","Every parent with a child in school is likely aware of the scourge of strep throat, the highly contagious bacterial infection that regularly makes the rounds throughout schools and households, and usually causes mild symptoms including fever, sore throat, and rash. But a recent wave of deaths due to complications from the bacteria in the UK has experts warning parents to be vigilant about the potentially fatal complications of this usually mild infection.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed last Friday that at least six children had died of strep A complications since September, and the Guardian reports that another child in the UK was reported to have died over the weekend, raising the total to seven.

Health experts in the UK cautioned that, sadly, children are always at a very small risk of death from strep complications, and that some deaths do occur every year. However, they did note that this year's total was higher than normal, prompting the agency to issue a rare alert asking for parents to be vigilant regarding the signs of potentially serious complications.

Parent vigilance regarding potentially serious complications is especially important, the agency said, because even doctors can have a difficult time predicting which cases will turn into serious ones. ""Even if you had all the time in the world and you weren’t pressed or hurried, it’s still difficult to tell which child is going to get ill,"" said Dr. Helen Oxbury, a GP in Oxford.

Oxbury said that parents who have a child who is ill with strep should become concerned if their children display ""continued raised temperature, lethargy or floppiness, not eating or drinking as usual, and lack of urination.""

The CDC states that strep A can become serious when strep A causes ""invasive disease,"" which means that germs invade parts of the body that are usually free from disease. Although the CDC has not yet issued an alert for this year in particular, it does note that an estimated 14,000 to 25,000 cases of invasive strep A occur each year in the United States, and that in the last five years, a total of between 1,500 and 2,300 people have died annually from complications due to invasive strep A diseases.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/after-seventh-child-dies-in-uk-from-strep-throat-complications-experts-warn-parents-to-be-on-the-lookout-for-serious-complications,2022-12-04
Video: UK autistic boy forced covid test to fly Ryanair,"An airline company has apologized for allegedly forcing a young boy with autism to endure a COVID-19 test in order to board a flight despite having an exemption letter from his doctor.

Ryanair, an Irish-owned airline carrier, issued an apology to a family after an alleged incident involving a 12-year-old autistic boy. Callum Hollingsworth, who was flying home with his family from Spain to the U.K., was subjected to a COVID-19 test on Aug. 3. Katy Hollingsworth, the boy's mother, purportedly explained to the Ryanair staff that her son was autistic.

Hollingsworth said her autistic son had to take a coronavirus test in January, which had been a ""nightmare."" To avoid future issues, the mother requested a medical exemption letter from the boy's doctor.

The mother presented the medical exemption letter to the Ryanair staff, but she claims they still insisted the boy undergo a COVID-19 test.

Hollingsworth told the BBC that her son, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ""lost it"" and suffered a ""meltdown because he thought it was his fault.""

""He started hitting the chair and then started hitting himself,"" she told the British news outlet. ""The staff were just ignoring us. All they kept saying was 'It's not our problem.'""

""My husband then had to physically restrain my son with two members of staff to try to get him to have a test,"" Hollingsworth continued. ""Callum tried to be brave but he was petrified.""

""They said if you don't have a COVID test you can't go home, so we had no choice,"" Hollingsworth claimed.

The boy's father recorded a video of the incident, which shows the staff coaxing the visibly distraught boy into agreeing to take the nasal swab COVID-19 test.

A spokesman for Ryanair said the airline ""regrets to hear of the stress"" caused to the boy and his family.



""Ryanair fully complies with EU and government travel restrictions, which are constantly changing in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the airline's statement said. ""We continue to make improvements and implement procedures to ensure the health and safety of our passengers and our crew is prioritized while complying with each country's government guidelines at all times.""

The guidance for travelers returning to the U.K. from Spain: ""Everyone aged 11 or over will still have to take a private test within three days before returning – the UK government says this should preferably be a PCR test.""

Callum allegedly struggled with the coronavirus lockdowns, so the family took him to his ""happy place"" in Valencia, Spain.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/airline-autistic-boy-covid-test-fly,2021-08-15
Amnesty International's USA director says Israel 'shouldn't exist as a Jewish state',"Nonprofit human rights group Amnesty International's USA director, Paul O'Brien, told an audience Wednesday that Israel ""shouldn't exist as a Jewish state"" and argued that most American Jews want the country to be ""a safe Jewish space"" based on ""core Jewish values.""



O'Brien, who is not Jewish, made the comments at a Women's National Democratic Club lunch event, speaking in front of about 20 people in person and another 30 virtual attendees, Jewish Insider reported. He was discussing a recent report published by his organization that accused Israel of ""apartheid"" in its treatment of Palestinians. The purpose of the report was to ""collectively change the conversation"" regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, O'Brien reportedly said.

Addressing support for Israel among American Jews, O'Brien rejected the results of a 2020 survey conducted by the Ruderman Family Foundation that found that eight in 10 Jewish Americans identify as ""pro-Israel"" and two-thirds feel emotionally ""attached"" or ""very attached"" to the world's lone Jewish state, according to Jewish Insider.

“I actually don’t believe that to be true,” O'Brien reportedly said of the survey results. “I believe my gut tells me that what Jewish people in this country want is to know that there’s a sanctuary that is a safe and sustainable place that the Jews, the Jewish people can call home.”

He argued that American Jews want ""a safe Jewish space"" rather than a Jewish state. ""I think they can be convinced over time that the key to sustainability is to adhere to what I see as core Jewish values, which are to be principled and fair and just in creating that space,” O'Brien reportedly said.

Jewish Insider interpreted these remarks as an argument for the ""one-state solution"" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, noting that the pro-Israel community rejects such arguments as ""a cover for the dissolution of a Jewish state.""

O'Brien affirmed that Israel ""shouldn't exist as a Jewish state,"" according to Jewish Insider, although he added that ""Amnesty takes no political views on any question, including the right of the State of Israel to survive.""

“The right of the people to self-determination and to be protected is without a doubt something that we believe in, and I personally believe that,” O'Brien reportedly said. But he added, “We are opposed to the idea — and this, I think, is an existential part of the debate — that Israel should be preserved as a state for the Jewish people.”

Amnesty International, a nonprofit international human rights group, has consistently criticized Israel and in its 2022 report accused the Jewish nation of maintaining ""an institutionalized regime of oppression and domination of the Palestinian population for the benefit of Jewish Israelis."" The report was slammed by Israel's foreign ministry, which said it ""absolutely rejects all the false allegations"" and accused Amnesty of regurgitating ""lies, inconsistencies, and unfounded assertions that originate from well-known anti-Israeli hate organizations.""

""The report denies the State of Israel's right to exist as the nation state of the Jewish people. Its extremist language and distortion of historical context were designed to demonize Israel and pour fuel onto the fire of anti-Semitism,"" Israel's foreign ministry said in a statement.

The Palestinian government, on the other hand, embraced the report and said it was a ""detailed affirmation of the cruel reality of entrenched racism, exclusion, oppression, colonialism, apartheid, and attempted erasure that the Palestinian people have endured.""

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration rejected the claim that Israel has committed apartheid through its actions towards the Palestinians.

""We think that it is important as the world’s only Jewish state that the Jewish people must not be denied their right to self-determination, and we must ensure there isn’t a double standard being applied,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters in February.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/amnesty-international-usa-director-israel-should-not-exist-as-jewish-state,2022-03-11
Animals stabbed and painted with satanic symbols causing concern in a British community,"Recent occurrences of animals being stabbed and then painted with apparently satanic symbols has raised concerns among a community in Hampshire, England, that the incidents might be connected, according to The Independent.

In fact, the combination of the peculiar animal violence with the area's alleged history of occult activity has some suspecting darker causes than simple crimes.

""People are concerned. I've been here 15 years and seen a lot of stuff, but nothing like this,"" said the Rev. David Bacon, the vicar at St. Peter's Church. ""It could just be kids, but I don't think it is, given the context. There's been witchcraft round here for hundreds of years – the New Forest is well known for witchcraft and black magic happening, and this has obviously gone up a level.""

A sheep was stabbed and killed recently, and then painted with pentagrams in the village of Bramshaw. Several cows were also found nearby with stab wounds, and police are investigating another report of a stabbed and painted sheep. Other satanic symbols, such as an inverted cross and the number ""666"" were painted onto the St. Peter's Church doors.

The late author and occultist Gerald Gardner claimed that a coven of witches used to meet in the New Forest at the start of the 20th century.

Locally-owned livestock are allowed to freely roam in the 220-square-mile community of the New Forest. The New Forest depends on these grazing animals to maintain the way of life.

""Any harm to New Forest livestock hurts everyone,"" said Tony Hockley, a resident and the chairman of the New Forest Commoners Defence Association. ""We all depend upon the vocational commitment of 700 local people to turn livestock out to graze the landscape. Most have just a few animals, and there are only 200 sheep in the whole of the New Forest.

""It is devastating to lose one in this way, and it is the sort of thing that will make commoners give up. If the grazing goes then the accessibility, culture and biodiversity go too. We'd implore anyone with any information on these terrible incidents to help the police.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/animals-stabbed-and-painted-with-satanic-symbols-causing-concern-in-a-british-community,2019-11-26
Second UK woman comes forward to say she was criminally investigated for 'misgendering' child of a transgender person,"A United Kingdom woman revealed that authorities investigated her after she called the child of a transgender activist by the wrong gender.

This is the second woman in as many months to come forward and reveal that they have been the subject of a criminal investigation for ""misgendering"" a person.

What are the details?

Caroline Farrow, a British journalist, revealed the incident on her Twitter page.

Farrow, who appeared on a September episode of ""Good Morning Britain,"" spoke with transgender activist Susie Green, who reports to have a ""trans child.""

Directly after the discussion, Farrow said she inadvertently referred to the child with the wrong gender pronoun while posting a few remarks about the discussion on Twitter. Green took issue with this and apparently reported it to police.

Farrow revealed what happened next in a series of tweets.

""Had a message from Guildford police tonight about my tweets following an appearance on @GMB with Susie Green and Piers Morgan,"" she wrote. ""Susie Green has reported me for misgendering her daughter.""

Police reportedly told Farrow that they would be interviewing her ""under caution for misgendering"" the child.

""I have pointed out to the police that I am a Catholic journalist/commentator and it is my religious belief that a person cannot change sex,"" she wrote in a subsequent tweet. ""That we are in the middle of a national conversation about what it means to be male and what it means to be female.""

Farrow also revealed that she has been subjected to harassment online because of the misgendering.

""There are real questions to be asked about how much power and influence Susie Green is able to exercise over the police force,"" Farrow noted. ""A man doxed my children & ex. Made violent & sexually humiliating threats. Nothing done.""

Farrow maintained her position that she did absolutely nothing wrong.

""I have done nothing wrong, nothing illegal, and will happily do jail time for my right to say that people cannot change sex,"" she insisted.

""'You misgendered Susie Green's daughter.' In the U.K., using the wrong nouns/pronouns constitutes police intervention. Very clear who the bigots are in this situation. I am raging and will not take this quietly,"" Farrow added.

The investigation is apparently ongoing.

What else?

In February, a U.K. mom was arrested and jailed for several hours after referring to a transgender activist as a man.

Thirty-eight year-old Kate Scottow of Hertfordshire said that officers visited her home and took her to a police station for questioning over a Twitter exchange with Stephanie Hayden, the trans activist.

""I was arrested in my home by three officers, with my autistic 10-year-old daughter and breastfed 20-month-old son present,"" Scottow said. ""I was then detained for seven hours in a cell with no sanitary products (which I said I needed) before being interviewed then later released under investigation.""

Scottow said that she was arrested for ""harassment and malicious communications.""

Scottow insisted that she did not harass or defame Hayden because she holds a ""genuine and reasonable belief"" that men and women ""cannot practically speaking change sex.""

New anti-lockdown songs from Van Morrison labeled 'dangerous' by Irish government health minister,"Famous Irish singer-songwriter Sir Van Morrison's new anti-lockdown lyrics have been labeled ""dangerous"" by a health minister in Northern Ireland.

The singer said on Friday that he recorded three new ""protest songs"" in which he reportedly claims the U.K. government is using COVID-19 lockdowns to ""enslave"" the people. The new songs are called ""Born to Be Free,"" ""As I Walked Out,"" and ""No More Lockdown"" and will be released in two-week intervals beginning Sept. 25, AFP reports.

""Born To Be Free, As I Walked Out, and No More Lockdown are songs of protest which question the measures the Government has put in place,"" a statement on Morrison's website said. ""Morrison makes it clear in his new songs how unhappy he is with the way the Government has taken away personal freedoms.""

""I'm not telling people what to do or think, the government is doing a great job of that already,"" Morrison said. ""It's about freedom of choice, I believe people should have the right to think for themselves.""

According to the statement, Morrison ""feels strongly that lockdown is in danger of killing live music.""

The lyrics to ""No More Lockdowns,"" as reported by the BBC, give an explicit idea of what Morrison thinks of the COVID restrictions adopted in the U.K.

""No more lockdown / No more government overreach,"" goes the chorus. ""No more fascist bullies / Disturbing our peace.""



""No more taking of our freedom / And our God given rights / Pretending it's for our safety / When it's really to enslave.""

Morrison's lyrics also accuse scientists of ""making up crooked facts"" and, according to the BBC, refer to a viral Facebook post of a screenshot from a U.K. government website saying, ""Covid-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease (HCID) in the UK.""

""While it is true that Covid-19 does not meet the criteria for an HCID — which typically has a high fatality rate (as much as 50% in the case of Ebola) — the disease is still considered highly infectious, with no specific vaccines or treatment currently available,"" the BBC reports.



The health minister for Northern Ireland, Robin Swann, described the new songs as ""dangerous.""

""I don't know where he gets his facts,"" Swann said. ""I know where the emotions are on this, but I will say that sort of messaging is dangerous.""

This is not the first time the ""Brown Eyed Girl"" singer has created controversy over coronavirus lockdown policies. In August, Morrison tried to rally other musicians to ""save live music"" and campaign against socially distanced gigs.

""I call on my fellow singers, musicians, writers, producers, promoters and others in the industry to fight with me on this. Come forward, stand up, fight the pseudo-science and speak up,"" Morrison said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/anti-lockdown-songs-van-morrison,2020-09-18
Anti-monarchy protesters arrested in UK,"In the wake of Queen Elizabeth II’s death, at least two people in the United Kingdom have been arrested in separate incidents for protesting the British royal family.

Author and activist Symon Hill, 45, said he was arrested for protesting King Charles III's ascension to the throne, in what Hill called ""an outrageous assault on democracy.""

Hill told the Independent he shouted, “Who elected him?” when Charles III was officially proclaimed king.

""It was only when they declared Charles to be 'King Charles III' that I called out 'Who elected him?'"" Hill said. ""I doubt most of the people in the crowd even heard me. Two or three people near me told me to shut up.""

A police spokesperson responded to news of the arrest, saying, “A 45-year-old man was arrested in connection with a disturbance that was caused during the county proclamation ceremony of King Charles III in Oxford. He has subsequently been de-arrested and is engaging with us voluntarily as we investigate a public order offence. The man was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence [under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986].”

Section 5 applies to behavior deemed likely to cause harassment, alarm, or distress, according to the Guardian.

Hill remained defiant, stating, “The police abused their powers to arrest someone who voiced some mild opposition to a head of state being appointed undemocratically.”

In Scotland, police arrested a 22-year-old woman holding a sign that said ""fuck imperialism, abolish the monarchy"" outside St. Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh, where Queen Elizabeth II is currently lying at rest.

A police spokesperson confirmed the arrest of a 22-year-old woman ""in connection with a breach of peace."" According to the Independent, she was charged under a 2010 law that covers actions “likely to cause a reasonable person to suffer fear or alarm.” Police told BuzzFeed News that the woman was arrested for her alleged behavior, not because of the anti-monarchy sign.

Asked about the incidents, the prime minister’s official spokesperson responded, “This is a period of national mourning for the vast, vast majority of the country, but the fundamental right to protest remains the keystone of our democracy.”

In reaction to the police response, Silkie Carlo, the director of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, told the Independent, “Police officers have a duty to protect people’s right to protest as much as they have a duty to facilitate people's right to express support, sorrow, or pay their respects.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/anti-monarchy-protestors-arrested-in-uk,2022-09-12
Arizona Republicans to seek more data and materials from Maricopa County as officials slam uncertified auditors,"Arizona State Senate Republicans will seek additional material and data from Maricopa County as part of a now three-month audit of the 2020 election results, Senate President Karen Fann (R-Prescott) said Thursday.

During a hearing at the state Capitol, witnesses from Cyber Ninjas, the uncertified Florida-based cybersecurity firm contracted by Fann to conduct the outside audit, told her and Sen. Warren Petersen (R-Gilbert) they have finished auditing the 2.1 million ballots cast in the November election but need wireless routers and voting machine tokens from the county, or else their review will be ""incomplete."" Cyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan also recommended that canvassers go door to door to question some registered voters on whether they actually voted by mail, the Arizona Republic reported.

""Based on the data we're seeing, I highly recommend we do the canvassing because it's the one way to know for sure whether the data we're seeing are real problems,"" Logan said.

Previously, the state Senate has held off on dispatching canvassers after the U.S. Department of Justice warned that such an effort might be directed primarily at minority communities and that it could be a form of voter intimidation and violate federal civil rights laws.

If Maricopa County officials refuse to comply with the requests for additional materials, it is likely the Senate will take them to court, which could delay the publication of a final report on the audit for weeks or months. Senate Republicans already sued once for access to ballots and tabulation machines from the county and were only able to begin the audit after a judge ruled in their favor in February. Republicans argued the delay brought on by more litigation might be necessary to deliver an accurate report.

""We need to get the additional information because how do you do a final report if you don't have all the information?"" Fann said.

County officials contend that they have already turned over everything a qualified auditor would need to complete an election audit and refuse to deliver further materials to auditors who are not certified by the Elections Assistance Commission.

Allegations of voting irregularities

Witness testimony on the findings from the audit raised several concerns about the integrity of the 2020 election. Logan testified alongside Ben Cotton, the founder of CyFir, a cybersecurity company that is subcontracting for the audit.

Logan claimed that nearly 4,000 Maricopa County voters who cast ballots in the presidential election registered to vote after a court-ordered deadline of Oct. 15.

""Based on the registration information that we found in the voting rolls, we have 3,981 individuals who show having voted in this election [who] were registered after Oct. 15,"" he said.

According to Logan, there were 11,326 individuals who did not appear on the version of the voter rolls made the day after the Nov. 6 election but did appear on voter rolls prepared on Dec. 7.

He also testified that 18,000 voters who cast ballots in November were removed from voter rolls after the election.

The auditor further alleged that 74,243 early votes were received, but ""there is no clear record of them being sent."" Logan emphasized that the discrepancy could be a ""clerical issue"" but added there is no real way to know without contacting voters directly.

""I think when we've got 74,000 it merits knocking on a door and validating some of this information,"" said Logan.

Officials from Maricopa County responded to several of these claims in real time on social media. The county pointed out that the 74,000 early ballots are explained by the fact that you can vote early by mail or in person at voting centers. Anyone who votes in person receives a ballot at the center, so ""it's not unusual that we would have more early votes than mail-in ballots sent.""

Logan also raised concerns over the way ballots were printed, explaining that because voters were provided with felt-tipped markers on Election Day, there was a possibility that the ink bled through to the opposite side of the ballot, which could alter how the vote was counted. County officials have insisted that this ""bleed-through"" effect is of no concern because the ballots are printed in such a way that the ""bubbles"" were aligned. If it did happen, poll workers would easily recognize it and correct the ballot, they said.

But Logan provided images that he says show that the ballots on Election Day were misaligned and that stray marks could have resulted in a ballot cast for the wrong candidate or an invalidated ballot because it appeared someone cast their vote twice. According to the Arizona Daily Star, as many as 168,000 ballots were printed and cast at voting centers on Election Day.



Concerns over security

Cotton testified that the voting machines used in Maricopa County had not received a security patch since 2019, when they were certified. He said it was ""critically important"" that the county turn over its routers for examination to determine what security risks were present on Election Day.

He noted that days before the election, the FBI raided a home in Fountain Hills as part of its investigation into a cyber attack on the county's voter registration system. The county had identified the attack and reported it to the authorities, but Cotton said the incident shows that at least one part of the county's election system had been ""hacked.""

Responding, county officials said Thursday that the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission prohibits uncertified individuals such as Cyber Ninjas and CyFir from handling certified election equipment, which is why they have refused to turn over the requested materials. The county added in a tweet that ""we cannot update our systems through security patches. That is why we maintained an air gapped system. Installing security patches would be changing the system that was certified.""

County officials have also previously said that turning over the information on its routers could compromise law enforcement data. If Fann presses for those materials, Maricopa County is almost sure to fight the request in court.

Republican Infighting



The controversy over Maricopa County's election results has pitted state Republican lawmakers against locally elected GOP officials in what was once a GOP stronghold.

President Joe Biden shocked Republicans by winning Maricopa County by more than 45,000 votes, narrowly defeating Donald Trump in the state of Arizona by about 10,000 votes total. Trump's insistence that the election was stolen despite multiple machine audits that verified the results has frustrated Maricopa County officials, who have defended the integrity of their election.

In a statement, Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jack Sellers blasted the Senate audit hearing and criticized Senate Republicans for contracting auditors who were not certified by the EAC.

""It's clear the people hired by Arizona Senate leadership to supposedly bring integrity to our elections are instead just bringing incompetence,"" Sellers said.

He accused Logan and Cotton of asking ""open-ended questions, portraying as suspicious what is actually normal and well known to people who work in elections.""

""In some cases, they dropped bombshell numbers that are simply not accurate,"" he added.

""What we heard today represents an alternate reality that has veered out of control since the November General Election. Senate leadership should be ashamed they broadcast the half-baked theories of the 'Deep Rig' crowd to the world today,"" he continued.

""To Senate leaders I say, stop accusing us of not cooperating when we have given you everything qualified auditors would need to do this job. Finish your audit, release the report, and be prepared to defend it in Court.""



Speaking at the hearing, Fann defended the actions of Senate Republicans from critics who say their efforts are a waste of time and are feeding conspiracy theories that the election was stolen.

""This is not about Trump. This is not about overturning the election. This has never been about anything other than election integrity,"" Fann insisted.

She cited a poll that found 45% of the people in Arizona thought there were serious problems with the election and reminded critics that as elected officials, lawmakers have a duty to respond to those concerns.



""Whether that is true or not, whether they are rumors and unfounded accusations or legitimate problems, for whatever reason, as a Senate body, we felt that it was our obligation and our duty to answer,"" said Fann.

""Our voters are constituents. Answer those questions and either confirm what they were afraid of or thought or heard, or that we prove that those things were not true so that they could go back to the polls and they could vote with confidence knowing that their ballot is sacred.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-republicans-to-seek-more-data-and-materials-from-maricopa-county-as-officials-slam-uncertified-auditors,2021-07-16
Australians erupt after PM takes advantage of COVID double standards to see family while millions remain in lockdown: ‘What a disgrace of a leader’,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is facing intense backlash from many of his own constituents this week after the leader took advantage of his position to skirt COVID-19 lockdown measures.

What are the details?

Morrison traveled to New South Wales over the weekend in a private jet to visit family on Australian Father's Day even as millions in the country remained in lockdown and were unable to visit out-of-state family members, the New York Times reported.

The prime minister spent time in Sydney before returning to Canberra to partake in a national security meeting, an action which critics immediately labeled as an example of double standards.

Yet instead of owning up to the blunder, Morrison defended the move in an interview published Tuesday, telling Sky News that while he understood people's frustration, his trip did not violate any lockdown rules.

Health authorities reportedly approved Morrison's trip due to his unique role as an ""essential worker."" Politicians in the country have been permitted to bypass certain public health measures in order to conduct official business.

What has been the reaction?

Though Morrison's trip may have been technically valid, it was certainly not a wise public relations move. After news broke about the trip, Australians took to social media to denounce the prime minister's hypocrisy.



""One rule for all the other dads separated by border closures and one rule for the PM!"" wrote one user.

""What a disgrace of a leader,"" added another.

""True leadership is hard. Sometimes it means putting country before family,"" wrote Labor MP Andrew Leigh. ""Whether it's holidaying in Hawaii during bushfires, visiting UK pubs, or popping interstate on Father's Day, Morrison often struggles to make the sacrifices the job demands.""

""Scott Morrison took a private jet to see his kids over father's day while the rest of Australian families suffered through [one] the worst lockdowns on the planet,"" another commenter jousted, adding, ""Top bloke.""

Labor opposition MP Bill Shorten criticized Morrison for exercising ""appalling judgment.""

""It's not that he doesn't deserve to see his kids, but so does every other Australian. And I think when your people are doing it tough, you've got to do it tough too,"" Shorten said. ""You can't have one rule for Mr. Morrison and another rule for everyone else.""

What else?

In his interview with Sky News, Morrison called Shorten's criticism a ""cheap shot.""

""Well, it's a bit of a cheap shot, to be honest. I mean Bill knows full well what these rules are ... in fact he took advantage of them. He went home and spent the last three weeks there rather than being in parliament,"" the prime minister noted.

It's not clear at this point whether Morrison's lines of defense will prevail. The leader is already in hot water with constituents for allegedly mismanaging the country's vaccine rollout and keeping draconian lockdown measures in place.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/australian-prime-minister-covid-lockdown-trip,2021-09-07
"Calling a man 'bald' is now considered sexual harassment, UK judge rules","Calling a man ""bald"" is sexual harassment, a U.K. tribunal ruled earlier this week.

What are the details?

A U.K. tribunal said that calling a man bald is akin to commenting on the size of a woman's breasts, Sky News has reported.

As such, the term — when used in an apparently derogatory manner, as it was in the case of U.K. man Tony Finn — can now be classified as sexual harassment.

A CNBC report noted that three members of the tribunal alluded to their own personal experiences with hair loss and said that baldness was ""more prevalent in men than women,"" therefore arguing that the use of the term ""bald"" is an insult that is related to a ""protected characteristic of sex.""

According to reports, former electrician Finn said that his former shift supervisor, Jamie King, called him a ""bald c***."" Finn also alleged that King — who is approximately three decades Finn's junior — threatened him on at least one occasion.

""I was working on a machine that I had to cover awaiting specialist repair,"" Finn said in his testimony. ""The covers were taken off, and it was apparent that Jamie King had done this. When I spoke to him about it, he began to call me a stupid bald c*** and threatened to deck me.""

The argument, Finn said, left him fearing for his safety.

The U.K. judge ruled that using the insult was a ""violation against the claimant's [Finn] dignity, it creating an intimidating ... environment for him, it was done for that purpose, and it related to the claimant's sex.""

Tribunal members added that King ""crossed the line by making remarks personal to the claimant about his appearance which is often found amongst men.""

Finn, who was fired from the position in 2021, will reportedly receive employment compensation related to the claim.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bald-man-sexual-harassment,2022-05-13
"Ban on 'harmful gender stereotypes' — like women who can't park cars, men who can't change diapers — takes effect for UK advertisers","Advertisements that depict ""harmful gender stereotypes"" — such as women who can't park cars and men who can't change diapers — are now officially banned in the UK.

The new rule from the Committee of Advertising Practice — the regulator tasked with writing UK advertising codes — states that ads ""must not include gender stereotypes that are likely to cause harm or serious or widespread offense."" The rule applies to broadcast and non-broadcast media, including online and social media, according to the Advertising Standards Authority, CAP's sister organization.

The ASA conducted a review of gender stereotyping and ""found evidence suggesting that harmful stereotypes can restrict the choices, aspirations, and opportunities of children, young people, and adults""; its findings were announced last year — and advertisers were given until this year to come into compliance.

The ASA added that it now will deal with complaints ""on a case-by-case basis and will assess each ad by looking at the content and context to determine if the new rule has been broken.""

What kinds of ads might be problematic?

According to the ASA, the following could be a problem now:

""An ad that depicts a man with his feet up and family members creating mess around a home while a woman is solely responsible for cleaning up the mess.""

""An ad that depicts a man or a woman failing to achieve a task specifically because of their gender (e.g., a man's inability to change [diapers]; a woman's inability to park a car).""

""Where an ad features a person with a physique that does not match an ideal stereotypically associated with their gender, the ad should not imply that their physique is a significant reason for them not being successful, for example in their romantic or social lives.""

""An ad that seeks to emphasize the contrast between a boy's stereotypical personality (e.g., daring) with a girl's stereotypical personality (e.g., caring) needs to be handled with care.""

""An ad aimed at new moms which suggests that looking attractive or keeping a home pristine is a priority over other factors such as their emotional well-being.""

""An ad that belittles a man for carrying out stereotypically 'female' roles or tasks.""

""Our evidence shows how harmful gender stereotypes in ads can contribute to inequality in society, with costs for all of us,"" ASA CEO Guy Parker said. ""Put simply, we found that some portrayals in ads can, over time, play a part in limiting people's potential. It's in the interests of women and men, our economy, and society that advertisers steer clear of these outdated portrayals, and we're pleased with how the industry has already begun to respond.""

What if advertisers don't comply?

Those who refuse to comply with the updated codes, which is rare, could face sanctions from the ASA.

What's the background?

The ASA was criticized in 2015 for not banning a controversial Protein World advertisement featuring a thin, bikini-clad woman along with the text, ""Are you beach body ready?"" Despite receiving over 300 complaints, the ASA allowed the ad to remain.

Sexist adverts to come under scrutiny - BBC News youtu.be

However, the ASA said evidence doesn't show that gender stereotypes are always problematic — and the new rule won't be banning such ads completely.

The following scenarios are allowable, according to the ASA:

""A woman doing the shopping or a man doing DIY.""

""Glamorous, attractive, successful, aspirational, or healthy people or lifestyles.""

""One gender only ... in ads for products developed for and aimed at one gender.""

""Gender stereotypes as a means to challenge their negative effects.""

CAP will review the new rule after a year to make certain it's ""meeting its objective to prevent harmful gender stereotypes,"" the ASA said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ban-on-harmful-gender-stereotypes-women-who-cant-park-cars-men-who-cant-change-diapers-takes-effect-for-uk-advertisers,2019-06-17
BBC altered alleged rape victim's quotes to avoid 'misgendering' her trans biological male attacker: Report,"The British Broadcasting Company is under fire after staff complained that the news agency altered a rape victim's quotes to avoid ""misgendering"" her biological male transgender attacker's pronouns, according to the Times London.

The paper reported that the BBC's diversity team made the ""unethical and disrespectful"" decision to change a rape victim's quotes in an October 2021 article about lesbian women who feel pressured to have sex and relationships with biological men who present as transgender women.



In the article, one lesbian victim recounted her experiences with a transgender woman who physically forced her to have sex with him after a date and allegedly threatened to ostracize her if she refused.

She discussed the horrifying experience with the BBC using ""he"" and ""him"" pronouns; however, the news agency changed those pronouns to ""they"" and ""them"" upon publication. The BBC's style guide reportedly dictates that writers use an individual's preferred pronouns in their reporting.

""[They] threatened to out me as a terf and risk my job if I refused to sleep with [them],"" the alleged victim's altered quote reads. ""I was too young to argue and had been brainwashed by queer theory so [they were] a 'woman' even if every fibre of my being was screaming throughout so I agreed to go home with [them]. [They] used physical force when I changed my mind upon seeing [their] penis and raped me.""

According to the Times, the decision was hotly contested at the time, as several senior journalists and other staff argued that altering the pronouns conflicted with BBC's responsibility to produce accurate and unbiased reporting.

""They were originally all male references but the woke bros at the news website wanted to make them female because of misgendering,"" a source reportedly told the Times, adding, ""It's quite shocking. I can't think of any other situation where we would change the words of an alleged rape victim.""

Following its publication, the article quickly became subject to a massive number of complaints. More than 20,000 people, including members of the BBC's staff, reportedly signed an open letter accusing the story of being ""deeply flawed"" and ""incredibly dangerous,"" the Daily Mail reported.

The BBC issued a statement following an ECU ruling on the article last year, stating in part: ""While the ECU ruling today rightly confirms the focus of the article was a legitimate area for journalistic scrutiny, it is also a reminder that the precision of our language and the caveats we place around third-party research are very important in our journalism, particularly when covering topics of highly polarised debate. In the light of the ECU ruling, the BBC has now made some amendments to the story to reflect where we got things wrong.""

Complaints pour into the BBC after hit show 'Strictly Come Dancing' debuts its first same-sex dance pair,"A same-sex routine on the U.K.'s ""Strictly Come Dancing"" reality show sparked nearly 200 complaints to the BBC according to reports.

""Strictly Come Dancing"" is a wildly popular British show much like America's ""Dancing with the Stars.""

What are the details?

Dance professionals Johannes Radebe and Graziano Di Prima — the dance show's first same-sex pair — danced together during the show's Nov. 3 episode.

The BBC announced that at least 189 viewers protested the routine and filed a complaint with the network. According to The Guardian, the network reported that viewers were displeased by the pairing and insisted that they would ""no longer watch the show if same-sex pairings became a regular occurrence."" The complaints also stated that some viewers found it ""offensive to feature two men dancing as a pair.""

In a statement, the BBC defended the show.

""Strictly Come Dancing is an inclusive show and is proud to have been able to facilitate the dance between Johannes and Graziano during the Professionals' Dance,"" the statement read. ""They are dancers first and foremost, and their sex had no bearing on their routine.""

Radebe, who is gay, said that he was thrilled to be able to perform alongside Di Prima, his straight best friend.

“For the first time in my life, I feel accepted for who I am,"" he told Hello! magazine. ""That says so much about the people of this country. To be able to dance with a friend I respect and adore is joyous. There's bromance galore between us, but there were no male and female roles, just free movement. It was beautiful, classy and elegant.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bbc-dance-show-same-sex-pair,2019-11-21
"BBC poll: Fewer than half of UK Christians believe Jesus died, rose again for forgiveness of their sins","With Holy Week upon us, a new BBC poll found that fewer than half of Christians in the U.K. — 46 percent — believe Jesus died and rose again for the forgiveness of their sins.

A BBC Radio program that aired Sunday said the online poll was taken in early March and surveyed more than 2,000 British adults. The host said the results raise the question: ""How much of the traditional Easter story is actually optional for Christians?""

'It just doesn't make sense'

The program aired commentary from Dave Tomlinson — an Anglican priest and author of ""How to Be a Bad Christian ... and a Better Human Being"" — who said the reason why it appears fewer people believe the traditional Easter story as the Bible presents it is because ""it just doesn't make sense.""

""I think it makes God out to be some kind of weird monster, really,"" Tomlinson said, adding that he sees some Evangelicals also questioning the Easter story and Christ's atonement for our sins.

But wait

The program added that, according to poll, 82 percent of Christians who attend worship services at least once a month overwhelmingly agree that the Easter story is true.

So it would seem the numbers depend greatly on how individuals define themselves: Respondents can say they identify as Christians, insist they don't believe Christ died and rose from the dead for the forgiveness of their sins — but it appears most of them don't identify as Christians enough to attend church at least once a month.

The BBC program also featured a pair of guests who debated the issue. The bulk of the content can be heard after the 34-minute mark.

Pushback



Among the replies to the BBC tweet about the new poll's findings were those who questioned the Christian faith of those who don't believe the traditional Easter story:

""Um.... then they are not Christians.""

""How can they say they're Christian if they don't believe in the main part of the story?""

""This makes them not Christians.""

But one commenter countered, ""What do you call someone who lives their life in the way Jesus did (loving everyone, fighting injustice, following the Sermon on the Mount), but who doesn't think Jesus was/is God and didn't rise again after his death?""

That was met with following reply: ""Tragic. Because if you're living the way Jesus did, it's impossible that He wouldn't have inspired your soul to search for Him and understand that being holy is infinitely more than just being nice and good. That means you've turned down His invite for you to really follow Him.""

Anything else?



A similar poll was taken two years ago, and a quarter of survey respondents who identify as Christians said they don't believe in Christ's resurrection — but 57% of ""active Christians"" (again, those who attend church at least once a month) believe the resurrection took place.

And believe it not, that 2017 BBC poll said 9% of non-religious people believe in the Resurrection — and 1% of them say they believe it literally.

Belgium introduces compulsory monkeypox quarantines as its spread continues to baffle global leaders,"Belgium has become the first country to introduce a compulsory quarantine for people diagnosed with monkeypox, as the disease continues to spread seemingly randomly across the globe.

Belgian health authorities said that if they are diagnosed with monkeypox, Belgian residents will be required to self-isolate for 21 days, the Daily Mail reported.

Belgium recorded its first infection of monkeypox this past Friday, and it is believed that all subsequent cases are connected to a festival that was held in the port city of Antwerp.

The Belgian quarantine policy comes as European doctors have warned that Great Britain is facing a “significant” rise in monkeypox infections and that the British government’s response is “critical” in containing the spread.

This past weekend, 11 British residents tested positive for the virus, bringing the country’s total up to 20. The infected include a child who is currently in critical condition in a London hospital.

There are currently 100 recorded infections in Europe.

Suggesting that the disease might be spreading through sexual transmission, Dr. Claire Dewsnap, the president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said that the recent monkeypox outbreak could have a “massive impact” on access to sexual health services in the United Kingdom.

Dr. Susan Hopkins, a chief medical adviser to the U.K. Health Security Agency, also warned that monkeypox is spreading through community transmission.

Dewsnap recently said that “[Britain’s] response is really critical here. There is going to be more diagnoses over the next week.”

She said, “How many is hard to say. What worries me the most is there are infections across Europe, so this has already spread. It’s already circulating in the general population. Getting on top of all those people’s contacts is a massive job.”

Dewsnap suggested that case numbers could greatly increase in the coming weeks. She said, “It could be really significant numbers over the next two or three weeks.”

President Joe Biden is also concerned about the growing case numbers of monkeypox.

This past weekend, just before he left South Korea, Biden said, “Everybody should be concerned about it.”

He said, “We’re working on it, hard to figure out what we do.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/belgium-introduces-compulsory-monkeypox-quarantines-as-its-spread-continues-to-baffle-global-leaders,2022-05-23
Biden administration set to ban imports of Russian oil and gas,"The Biden administration plans to ban imports of oil and natural gas from Russia as soon as Tuesday.

Two people reportedly with knowledge of the matter told the Washington Post that President Joe Biden intends to punish Russia for invading Ukraine by implementing an import ban.

Biden is scheduled to speak Tuesday morning and announce “actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.”

These new sanctions will ban imports of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal, Markets Insider reported.

The administration’s decision to ban these products came after lengthy discussions with European allies. However, at this time, those European nations are not joining the United States in banning Russian energy imports with the exception of the United Kingdom, per Politico.

Western nations have been particularly hesitant to stop importing oil from Russia since Russia provides them with a substantial amount of their energy. The European Union, for instance, gets around 40% of its natural gas from Russia. Russia accounts for roughly 12% of global oil production.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak warned that a Western ban on Russian oil would yield “catastrophic consequences” for the global market and cause oil prices to surge beyond $300 a barrel.

Oil prices were already reaching historic highs before the White House considered barring the import of Russian energy.

Last week, crude oil futures listed prices at more than $113 per barrel. This is the highest that oil has traded since 2011.

And for the first time since 2008, the average price of gas in the U.S. is over $4 a gallon. In some states, like California, gas is well over $5 a gallon.

Despite the skyrocketing costs of energy consumption, the Biden administration is adamantly opposed to increasing domestic oil production.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki argued that instead of increasing domestic production, the U.S. should pivot away from fossil fuels altogether.

“It’s a reminder that real energy security comes from reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,"" Psaki said. ""Domestic production has not insulated us from the price volatility of fossil fuels or the whims of those who control them such as President Putin. Americans know that.""

The Biden administration has even floated the possibility of buying oil from countries that are openly hostile to the United States, like Iran and Venezuela, instead of increasing domestic oil production.

Senior American officials are even meeting with representatives of the Maduro regime in Venezuela to discuss the possibility of purchasing oil from the Venezuelan reserves.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-set-to-ban-imports-of-russian-oil-and-gas,2022-03-08
President Biden announces trilateral pact with Britain and Australia to counter Chinese influence,"President Joe Biden announced that the United States would join in a pact with Britain and Australia in what is considered a effort to counter the rising influence of China.

Biden made the joint announcement on Wednesday with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom live-streamed on either side.

The pact is called AUKUS.

""Today we join our nations in a next generation partnership, built on a strong foundation of proven trust,"" said Morrison.

""We have always seen the world through a similar lens. We have always believed in a world that favors freedom, that respects human dignity, the rule of law, the independence of sovereign states and the peaceful fellowship of nations,"" he added.

Morrison said that the alliance would support peace in the Indo-Pacific region, broadly defined as the area surrounding Australia to the north, east and west, to China, India, Africa, and to Hawaii.

""Our world is becoming more complex, especially here in our region, the Indo-Pacific,"" Morrison continued.

""This affects us all. The future of the Indo-Pacific will impact all our futures,"" he explained. ""To meet these challenges, to help deliver the security and stability our region needs, we must now take our partnership to a new level.""

Morrison said the first major endeavor by AUKUS will be to create a new nuclear-powered submarine fleet for Australia.

Biden and Johnson emphasized that the submarines would not be armed with nuclear weapons, only powered by nuclear energy.

Johnson also emphasized the hundreds of highly skilled jobs that would be supported by efforts supporting AUKUS.

""This is about investing in our greatest source of strength: our alliances,"" said Biden,"" and updating them, to better meet the threats of today and tomorrow.""

While none of the three global leaders mentioned China specifically in their statements, many commented on how the agreement was likely to be perceived as a challenge to the growing Chinese influence in the region.

""For more than a century, we have stood together for the cause of peace and freedom,"" Morrison concluded, ""motivated by the beliefs we share, sustained by the bonds of friendship we have forged, enabled by the sacrifice of those who have gone before us, and inspired by our shared hope for those who will follow us.""

In 2018, China announced a similar military alliance with Russia and specifically mentioned their agreement was meant to show the United States the level of cooperation the two nations had with each other.

"President Biden gaffes at the G7 summit, world leaders laugh","When on the world stage with his peers at the G7 summit this weekend, President Joe Biden had several mental lapses and gaffes. At one point, fellow world leaders openly laughed at Biden over his forgetfulness at the G7 conference in Cornwall, England.

During a press conference on Sunday, Biden stumbled while speaking about Russia ahead of his June 16 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, Switzerland.

""We can work together with Russia – for example, in Libya. We should be opening up the passage to be able to go through, provide food assistance, and economic... I mean, vital assistance to a population that's in real trouble,"" Biden said, confusing Libya with Syria. Biden confused Libya for Syria on two more occasions in his meandering diatribe.

Previously, first lady Jill Biden proclaimed that her husband was ""so well prepared"" for the conference.



""He's been studying for weeks working up for today,"" she said. ""He knows most of the leaders that will be here. Joe loves foreign policy. This is his forte.""



Time magazine was ridiculed last week for an extremely flattering cover featuring an illustration of Biden appearing years younger and a headline that read, ""Taking on Putin.""

Biden already said he won't hold a joint press conference with Putin because he doesn't want to get ""diverted"" by who ""talked the most.""

Also during the presser, Biden said, ""I'm sorry, I'm going to get in trouble with staff if I don't do this the right way,"" before selecting Bloomberg to ask him a question. At a prior press conference at the White House, Biden was using a ""cheat sheet"" to determine which reporters to call on.

When asked a question by the press, Biden responded in a strange whispering voice, ""120 days, gimme a break. I need time.""

Biden delivered a befuddling comment during the presser, saying, ""COVID, I know you all know, but a lot of people may not know what COVID is, that is a system whereby they're going to provide funding for states to get access to vaccines.""

The White House issued a correction for the president, saying that when he said ""COVID,"" he meant to say ""COVAX."" Biden reportedly made this same error on three different occasions during the press conference. COVAX is a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to coronavirus vaccines.

During the summit, there was a conference between the G7 leaders of the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and Japan, along with other leaders from India, South Korea, and South Africa.

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced the leaders, who were not G7 members, ""Welcome, those who have just joined us, we have some pretty spectacular weather. We have Prime Minister Modi [India], President Ramaphosa [South Africa], President Moon [South Korea] in just a minute.""

A confused Biden interrupted Johnson to inform him that he didn't introduce Ramaphosa, despite Johnson introducing the president of South Africa literally seconds earlier.

""And the president of South Africa,"" Biden said, who was sitting next to Johnson.

Johnson replied, ""And the president of South Africa as I said early on.""

The world leaders laughed at Biden's forgetfulness at the G7 roundtable. Then the press was rushed out of the room.

There was another awkward moment during the G7 conference when Biden was walking through a section and was asked a random and easy question, ""How are your meetings going in Cornwall, Mr. President?""

Jill Biden quickly interrupted the impromptu question, and frantically said, ""Joe, c'mon,"" as she waved her hands for him to come with her, which elicited laughter from the people nearby. She then grabbed his hand and lead him away.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-covid-adviser-virus-hurricane,2021-06-14
"Biden reportedly ghosted UK, ignored PM Johnson for 36-plus hours amid Afghanistan fallout","As chaos unfolded in Afghanistan over the last week, President Joe Biden reportedly left America's greatest ally and leading partner in the region in the dark.

According to fresh reports from the Times and the Telegraph this week, the United Kingdom — despite having suffered the second most casualties in the Afghanistan war — had very little input regarding Biden's decision to withdraw from the region and was put on hold after the situation unraveled.

The abject failure of communication has allegedly sparked outrage among British lawmakers, who in recent days have taken to reminding the U.S. president that the war in Afghanistan was not a solo campaign, but a NATO effort.

What are the details?

In the Times report published Thursday, political editor Steven Swinford stated that ""senior military commanders have also not been party to key discussions between the U.S. and the Taliban, so were left in the dark about when they could be forced to pull out.""

That report was later confirmed by Politico London, which cited an unnamed British official who claimed ""the U.S. did not communicate to the U.K. how it planned to withdraw nor the pace of its withdrawal,"" a decision which has fueled anger within the British government.

But the Biden administration didn't just cut the U.K. out of talks prior to the wholesale troop withdrawal. As things grew more dire, Biden reportedly ghosted U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson for more than 36 hours, as well.

According to the Telegraph, ""Johnson had been attempting to get Biden on the phone to discuss Kabul falling from Monday morning. The pair eventually talked at close to 10 p.m. on Tuesday.""

The reports were highlighted in Tuesday's edition of Politico London's Playbook newsletter. In the newsletter, editor Alex Wickham called Biden's failure to communicate nothing short of ""astonishing.""

Most of the British troops exited in July when the U.S. troops left. The U.K. had decided it did not want to remain without U.S. support. About 900 British troops are currently in Afghanistan to help evacuate British passport holders and other local staff from the Kabul airport.

What else?



Biden's chaotic and hasty departure from Afghanistan has not gone over well across the pond. The New York Times reported Wednesday that the president's actions have ""left British officials embarrassed and embittered.""

""He hasn't just humiliated America's Afghan allies,"" Rory Stewart, a former British cabinet minister with lengthy experience in Afghanistan, told the Times. ""He's humiliated his Western allies by demonstrating their impotence.""

""I hope 'America First' hasn't become 'America Alone,'"" Tom Tugendhat, a conservative member of Parliament and chairman of the foreign affairs committee, added.

Tugendhat, a British military veteran who served alongside U.S. and Afghan troops, lashed out at Biden in a fiery floor speech Wednesday, calling Biden's recent questioning of the courage of Afghan troops ""shameful.""

""Those who have never fought for the colors they fly should be careful about criticizing those who have,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-gaffes-g7-summit-video,2021-08-19
Biden points to conservative wins in UK elections as warning to Democrats not to go too far left,"Former Vice President Joe Biden pointed to conservative victories in Thursday's United Kingdom elections as an example of why the Democratic Party should not move too far to the left, according to Politico.

During a campaign fundraiser in San Francisco, Biden, who has presented himself as a relatively moderate candidate in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, said that the Conservative Party in the U.K. won so convincingly because the liberal Labour Party went too far left.

""Boris Johnson is winning in a walk,"" Biden said of the British prime minister. ""Look what happens when the Labour Party moves so, so far to the left. It comes up with ideas that are not able to be contained within a rational basis quickly.""

Biden is indeed moderate on some major issues compared to the candidates polling in second and third place, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders is an open socialist, and Warren, although she claims to be a capitalist, favors the same far-left, big-government policies as Sanders.

While Sanders and Warren favor a federal government takeover of health care through Medicare for All, Biden believes that program is too expensive and not what most Americans are looking for. Biden is running on a health care plan that expands on Obamacare.

Biden regularly expresses optimism about his ability to work with Republicans to get things done if elected president, while Warren and Sanders take a more adversarial tone toward their political rivals, showing much less desire to seek compromise. But Biden points out that he has a significantly stronger resume of legislative accomplishments than either of them.

The success of Boris Johnson, the prime minister who has been compared to President Donald Trump, will boost the belief that Trump can be re-elected, Biden said.

""You're also going to see people saying, 'My God, Boris Johnson, who is kind of a physical and emotional clone of the president, is able to win,'"" Biden said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-ghosted-uk-boris-johnson,2019-12-13
"Bill Gates – who caught COVID despite 4 shots – says people over age 50 need vaccine boosters every 6 months, calls popular conspiracy theory about him 'tragic'","Bill Gates – the software developer – continued his media blitz to promote his new book about how he believes the world could prevent the next pandemic. Gates' latest appearance was on CNN – where he called for people over the age of 50 to get COVID-19 vaccine boosters every six months. The Microsoft co-founder also presented his thoughts regarding a popular conspiracy theory about him.

Gates, 66, revealed last week that he was infected with COVID.



""I've tested positive for COVID. I'm experiencing mild symptoms and am following the experts' advice by isolating until I'm healthy again,"" Gates wrote on Twitter. ""I'm fortunate to be vaccinated and boosted and have access to testing and great medical care.""

Gates caught COVID despite receiving four doses of the vaccine – two original doses and two booster shots.

CNN host Anderson Cooper told Gates that he had ""only gotten three shots total,"" but had also been infected with COVID-19 in April.

Cooper asked the software developer, ""So I've been trying to figure this out for myself, but I assume you know the answer to this, so I'll just ask you, when do you get boosted again?""



Gates responded, ""Yeah, so an infection where you'll get a high viral load would be like vaccination, but you know to be safe, every six months you're probably going to be vaccinated.""

“For people who are 50 or 60, they will probably have to be boosted every six months until we get even better vaccines,” Gates said during a Friday night appearance on ""AC360.""

""As we get more data, they might even make that shorter for people, you know, say 60 or over 70, where the duration seems to be a bit lower,"" Gates continued. ""So we're in for ongoing vaccination to stay absolutely safe.""

Cooper also asked Gates about the popular conspiracy theory that has plagued him over the years.

In the late spring of 2020, unsubstantiated rumors began circulating that the COVID-19 vaccine had tracking microchips in it, and that the Gates Foundation was spending billions of dollars to ensure that all medical procedures implanted microchips into patients.

A YouGov poll from May 2020 found that 28% of Americans believed that ""Bill Gates wants to use a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 to implant microchips in people that would be used to track people with a digital ID.""

The conspiracy theory of Gates using COVID-19 vaccines and medical procedures to implant microchips has been debunked by PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, Reuters, and the BBC.

Cooper told Gates, ""You rightly champion [the vaccine], obviously it’s a wonder of modern science, but there's this paradox that the speed at which it was created also increased perhaps some hesitancy, and I guess and has fueled these conspiracy theories.”



Cooper then asked, ""How do you deal with conspiracy theories? People believe you're tracking people through microchips inserted into the vaccine.""

Gates responded, ""Simple explanations are kind of fun to click on. The one about tracking people, I don’t know why they think I’m interested in knowing people’s locations.""

He added, ""If it's holding people back from getting vaccinated, then that's tragic.""

On the topic of COVID vaccine hesitancy, Gates said, ""Well, the hesitancy did go down somewhat, you know, initially it was like at 60% of the population, but as they saw their friends getting vaccinated and very rare side effects, as they saw their friends being protected and the people with severe disease were overwhelmingly the unvaccinated, most people came around.""

""Now, the U.S. still has a lower full vaccination rate than many other countries, so we still need to figure out: Who do those people trust? Are they open-minded? Because it's to their benefit and to the people around them,"" he continued. ""So I'm surprised that the U.S., it's been this tough, and, you know, even somewhat a political thing.""

Gates addressed another conspiracy theory that he is pushing vaccines to make a profit.

""You know, we've given billions for vaccines and saved millions of lives,"" he stated. ""If you just kind of invert that and say, 'No, we’re trying to make money from vaccines, you know, not trying to save lives,' that’s a popular conspiracy theory.""

Earlier this month, Gates made headlines for admitting that COVID is ""kind of like flu."" He also conceded that the vaccines are ""imperfect in two very important ways.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-points-to-conservative-wins-in-uk-elections-as-warning-to-democrats-not-to-go-too-far-left,2022-05-15
Bill Clinton: I had sex with Monica Lewinsky to cope with my anxieties,"When some people experience anxiety, they go for a walk or meditate. Others binge on their favorite comfort food. But former President Bill Clinton has his own coping mechanism: Having sex with interns.

According to the UK's Daily Mail, the country's 43rd president described his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky as one of the ""things I did to manage my anxieties.""

In what the British newspaper describes as an ""explosive documentary"" seen by DailyMailTV, the former president suggested that his romantic relationship with Lewinsky helped him deal with his own problems.

'Something that will take your mind off it for a while'

""Bill reveals that at the time he met Lewinsky the pressure of the job made him feel like a boxer who had done 30 rounds and he looked at Lewinsky as 'something that will take your mind off it for a while,'"" reported the Daily Mail.

Clinton is said to have made the statement in a candid interview included in a Hulu documentary about his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, called ""Hillary.""

While Clinton does not appear to share the other issues he was facing that led him to resort to the affair with Lewinsky, he clarified that they do not excuse his conduct.

""It's not a defense, it's an explanation. I feel awful,"" he said in the Hulu documentary, the Daily Mail reported.

Clinton even offered Lewinsky, who has said her relationship with the former president ruined her reputation, an apology. The Daily Mail reported the former president feels ""terrible"" that Lewinsky, who was 22 years old at the time, is permanently associated with their fling which is said to have begun in November 1995 and lasted through March 1997.

However, according to the Daily Mail, Clinton suggested Lewinsky should just move on with her life. When things do not return back to ""normal,"" you have ""got to decide how to define normal,"" he is reported to have said.

'I feel terrible about it'

Although Clinton originally denied the affair with Lewinsky, both publicly and privately, he explained in the documentary how he eventually admitted it to his wife.

""I went and sat on the bed and talked to her. I told her exactly what happened, when it happened. I said I feel terrible about it. We've been through quite a bit in the last few years. I said I have no defense, it's inexcusable what I did.""

Hillary said she felt ""devastated"" by what had occurred. ""I could not believe it. I was so personally just hurt and I can't believe this, I can't believe you lied,"" she said, in the documentary.

"Billionaire suggests BLM created 'more bigotry,' blasts affirmative action and quotas: 'Positive discrimination is dangerous for society'","British billionaire businessman John Caudwell revealed this week that he is no fan of affirmative action or quotas, and questioned the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement, suggesting that it might have made things worse.

Caudwell, the founder of Phones 4u, a UK chain of cellphone stores, told the Times of London that he believes quotas are not good for society and that winners should be determined by talent, not race or gender.

The man who claims to be the U.K.'s biggest taxpayer made his comments while taking part in the Times of London's Education Commission, which is looking at whether the nation needs radical change in its education system.

Commission members asked Caudwell, who opposes efforts to ""brainwash"" students to believe college degrees are necessary to get good jobs and supports apprenticeships, about reported pay imbalances between men and women, particularly in apprenticeship opportunities.

""I'm not very keen on unbalancing society by having quotas,"" Caudwell told the Times. ""I always think the best person should win, whether they're black, white, male or female.""

""I don't like positive discrimination,"" he added.

Though he admitted that ""there's a time and a place where that is beneficial, for instance, post-apartheid in South Africa"" and that he understood where it comes from, overall, he said, ""I think positive discrimination is dangerous for society.""

According to Caudwell, positive discrimination ""leads to resentment,"" which, he said, he has personally witnessed happen ""a lot.""

Then he used the Black Lives Matter movement as an example and posited that social justice efforts just might have made things worse.

""Did Black Lives Matter improve the cause of black people, or did it cause more resentment and more bigotry?"" Caudwell asked. ""And that's a good debate to have.""

Instead of the so-called positive discrimination promoted by much of the left and woke society, he noted, cultures should be pushing for creating new opportunities.

""I'm not into positive discrimination but I am into creating opportunities as much as possible for people,"" Caudwell said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill_clinton_monica_lewinsky_sex_anxieties,2021-07-07
"CDC says reports of a new strain of coronavirus in the US are false, contradicting Dr. Birx","Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention refuted reports of a new strain of coronavirus in the U.S. based on what they said was speculation from White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Deborah Birx.

Birx suggested to other members of the task force that there might be a new strain in the United States based on the rapid increase of infections. That hypothesis was included in a summary sent to state governors.

""This fall/winter surge has been at nearly twice the rate of rise of cases as the spring and summer surges. This acceleration suggests there may be a USA variant that has evolved here, in addition to the UK variant that is already spreading in our communities and may be 50% more transmissible,"" the report read according to the New York Times.

""Aggressive mitigation must be used to match a more aggressive virus,"" she added.

The Times reported that the CDC reached out to Birx in an attempt to have that suggestion removed from the summary sent to governors. A source told the Times that the request was denied, to their great frustration.

A spokesman for the CDC explained in an email to CNBC News why they believed Dr. Birx's hypothesis was premature.

""Researchers have been monitoring U.S. strains since the pandemic began, including 5,700 samples collected in November and December,"" wrote Jason McDonald.

""To date, neither researchers nor analysts at CDC have seen the emergence of a particular variant in the United States as has been seen with the emergence of B.1.1.7 in the United Kingdom or B.1.351 in South Africa,"" he added.

Black Lives Matter activist — who said 'the police is no different from the KKK' — shot in head in London,"Prominent Black Lives Matter activist Sasha Johnson was left in critical condition after being shot in the head in London, her political party told BBC News.

What are the details?

The Taking the Initiative Party, which Johnson helps lead, told the network she was taken to intensive care with life-threatening injuries after being ""brutally attacked"" early Sunday.

The party told BBC News that the attack followed ""numerous death threats.""

However, police said there was no evidence yet that the attack on the 27-year-old was targeted or that she received credible threats, the network added. BBC News also said they have not confirmed her identity.

Imarn Ayton, a friend of the victim, told the network that Johnson had been at a party or gathering when she was shot but did not believe she ""was the intended victim.""

""As far as I am aware ... this incident is more related to rival gangs as opposed to her activism,"" Ayton added to BBC News.

Detective Chief Inspector Jimi Tele said: ""This was a shocking incident that has left a young woman with very serious injuries. Our thoughts are with her family who are being provided with support at this terribly difficult time,"" according to the network.

'The police is no different from the KKK'

As it happens, Johnson was caught on video last year giving a speech during which she noted that ""the police is no different from the KKK.""

She also said police ""stand around and protect statues and buildings instead of people"" and that ""we need a black militia.""

""We need our own political party,"" Johnson also declared, adding that the ""back of racism is capitalism.""

Black Lives Matters UK said it was shocked by the shooting of ""a young mother and fearless political campaigner who was at the forefront of many BLM protests last summer,"" the network said — and that while Johnson isn't part of BLM UK, ""she impressively founded a new Black-led political party and was dedicated to resist anti-Black racism.""

"Black Lives Matter statue taken down, Colston statue removed","A statue dedicated to a British Black Lives Matter activist was installed on a plinth in the U.K. that was once occupied by a statue of a wealthy merchant trader who was involved in the slave trade. However, within 24 hours, the Black Lives Matter sculpture was taken down.

During a protest on June 7 in the city of Bristol in southwest England, vandals tore down a statue of Edward Colston. He was a 17th-century member of Parliament, philanthropist, and merchant involved in the transatlantic slave trade. In the wake of the George Floyd protests, rioters toppled the 125-year-old statue of Colston and dumped it into the harbor.

On Wednesday, a new statue was raised on the pedestal where Colston's monument once stood. The new statue was a tribute to Jen Reid, a Bristol-based Black Lives Matter activist. The life-size black resin and steel sculpture of the BLM protester was created by British artist Marc Quinn, who titled the artwork ""A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020.""

On Thursday, Reid's statue was removed by Bristol City Council contractors within 24 hours of being erected.

Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees explained his decision to remove the statue.

""I prefer to say we're not taking down the statue of a Black Lives Matter protester, we are taking down the work of a London-based artist who erected it without permission and without any conversation with the city,"" Rees told Sky News.



Rees previously called the Colston statue ""an affront,"" but added that he did not approve of how the statue was torn down.

""As an elected politician, obviously I cannot condone the damage and I am very concerned about the implications of a mass gathering on the possibility of a second COVID wave,"" Rees said.

""I can't and won't pretend the statue of a slave trader in a city I was born and grew up in wasn't an affront to me and people like me,"" said Rees, who is black. ""People in Bristol who don't want that statue in the middle of the city came together and it is my job to unite, hear those voices and hold those truths together for people for who that statue is a personal affront.""

""The future of the plinth and what is installed on it must be decided by the people of Bristol,"" Rees tweeted.



""This will be critical to building a city that is home to those who are elated at the statue being pulled down, those who sympathize with its removal but are dismayed at how it happened and those who feel that in its removal, they've lost a piece of the Bristol they know and therefore themselves,"" Rees added. ""We need change. In leading that change we have to find a pace that brings people with us.""

Rees revealed that a commission of historians would help decide on what the new monument will be, and the replacement will tell ""the full story of Bristol so that the city is much more informed and is in a better position to collectively decide who it wants to honor and where.""

The Bristol City Council said the statue of Reid ""will be held at our museum for the artist to collect or donate to our collection.""



Quinn said that if the Black Lives Matter statue is sold, the proceeds will be donated to two charities promoting Black history that were chosen by Reid.

The Colston statue was fished out of the harbor. City officials say it will be exhibited at a museum, along with placards from the Black Lives Matter protest.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/black-lives-matter-activist-shot-in-head-in-london-left-in-critical-condition-said-last-year-the-police-is-no-different-from-the-kkk,2020-07-16
"Black Lives Matter protesters chant in DC: 'Israel we know you, you murder children too'","Black Lives Matter protesters marching through Washington, D.C., on Wednesday were captured on video chanting, ""Israel we know you, you murder children too.""

What are the details?

Nic Rowan, a reporter for The Washington Examiner, posted the footage online with the caption, ""It was only a matter of time before the DC protests turned anti-Semitic.""

Rowan noted that the crowd ""immediately switched to the more standard 'Black Lives Matter' chant after the 'Israel kills children' one.""

The anti-Israel chant by BLM protesters comes days after Black Lives Matter U.K. sparked outrage by publicly declaring on Twitter, ""As Israel moves forward with the annexation of the West Bank, and mainstream British politics is gagged of the right to critique Zionism, and Israel's settler colonial pursuits, we loudly and clearly stand by our Palestinian comrades. FREE PALESTINE.""

Fox News reported that the tweets by BLM's U.K. group have caused organizations in Great Britain to distance themselves from the movement. The outlet noted that ""the radical bent of the Black Lives Matter movement is not a secret, and the primary U.S. organization boasts of its desire to 'disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure' and to promote the defunding of police.""

BLM has gained nationwide influence in the wake of George Floyd's death in police custody, organizing protests across the U.S. against police brutality that have continued for weeks. A number of U.S. corporations have publicly declared their support for the movement, which one BLM founder boasts was created by ""trained Marxists.""

In reaction to the video of BLM protesters chanting, ""Israel we know you, you murder children too,"" Turning Point USA's Benny Johnson tweeted, ""I wonder if all the GOP Senators (@MittRomney & @SenatorBraun) and corporations who support and endorse BLM also support the idea that Israel 'murders children?'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/black-lives-matter-colston-statue-jen-reid,2020-07-02
"Tech companies that publicly supported Black Lives Matter had fewer black employees, according to new study","A new study says that tech companies that displayed public support for the Black Lives Matter movement also had fewer black employees than other tech companies that did not express support for the movement.

The study of 240 prominent tech companies was conducted by Blendoor, a startup that advocates for greater minority representation, and published Monday.

The study found that the pro-BLM companies had 20% fewer black employees than those who did not express support for the movement.

Despite the disparity between outward support and actual hiring practices, the report said support for Black Lives Matter led to billions in donations that would have an even greater impact on obtaining the goals of the movement.

The website for the Black Lives Matter movement posted a new set of demands earlier in May that included a permanent ban on former President Donald Trump from holding any future political office and from all social media platforms. They also demanded that he be ""immediately convicted"" in the U.S. Senate.

One software company that took the opposite stance was Basecamp, where a number of employees quit after the leadership banned political talk from their official business channels in order to keep their focus on work. A third of their employees reportedly quit because of the controversy.

The BLM movement also got a boost from former first lady Michelle Obama, who said that blacks in America are still afraid for their lives and the lives of their children.

""Many of us still live in fear as we go to the grocery store, or worry about — walking our dogs, or allowing our children to get a license,"" Obama said in an interview with Gayle King of CBS News.

However, even many on the left are blaming the extremist policy demands of the BLM movement for some of the loss in support for Democrats among some Hispanics who refused to back their demands to defund the police.

Boom in make-up for men as cosmetics industry becomes 'gender inclusive',"The male cosmetics industry is exploding, according to the BBC, who asked on Friday: ""Is men's make-up going mainstream?""

What are the details?

As evidence, the BBC points to the fact that the male-grooming business was valued at $57.7 billion in 2017, and ""is growing exponentially."" The publication adds, ""We're not just talking Nivea; we're talking moisturizing foundation and bronzers, concealers and brow definers — proper cosmetics.""

One of the celebrated modern catalysts of men's make-up is 19-year-old YouTube star James Charles, whose popular online tutorials led to him developing a merchandise and clothing line. He is now a face of CoverGirl, and his recent presence at an event in England drew such a crowd that traffic was gridlocked for hours.

Charles refers to his following as his ""sisterhood"" — and they are 14 million strong. Here he is explaining how he found his perfect foundation match:

According to online beauty publication Byrdie, male influencers like Charles are proving that ""makeup is in the early stages of becoming more gender-inclusive,"" after generations of cosmetics being seen as a ""'girls-only' enterprise.""

Byrdie points out that ""for millennia, stretching from 4000 BCE through the 18th century, men traditionally used makeup in myriad ways,"" and that ""it wasn't until the mid-1800's that makeup was relegated to one end of the gender spectrum.""

The magazine went on to outline the uses of male cosmetics throughout history, and its fall from favor during the Victorian era when Queen Victoria I and the Church of England deemed such embellishments ""vulgar.""

Anything else?

The BBC also noted that former soccer star David Beckham will grace the cover of LOVE magazine this month, wearing a similar bright blue eyeshadow to that donned by the late singer David Bowie in his Life on Mars music video in 2016.

That same year, The Huffington Post asserted that it's ""becoming quite common"" for straight men to wear makeup, and that ""it's time we stopped empowering fear and insecurity with archaic gender ideas or destructive hashtags.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blm-tech-company-hires-hypocritical,2019-02-08
Tennis legend Boris Becker says player's fiancee is 'very pretty' — and is accused of 'objectification of women',"Tennis legend Boris Becker stands accused of ""objectification of women"" after calling a player's fiancee ""very pretty"" during his BBC commentary on a Wimbledon quarterfinals match Wednesday.

What are the details?

During the contest, in which top-seeded Novak Djokovic beat 48th-ranked Marton Fucsovics in straight sets, a camera trained on Fucsovics' fiancee in the stands — and main commentator John Inverdale didn't let the moment pass.

Image source: Independent UK video screenshot

""That's Fuscovics' fiancee. Her name is Anett Boszormenyi,"" he said before cracking an old joke. ""If you're a tennis player, always good to have a partner called Anett.""



With that Becker added, ""They do say they have the most beautiful women in Hungary. I wouldn't know that, but she's certainly very pretty.""

'Objectification of women'

Stephanie Hilborne — chief executive of Women in Sport — was among a number of individuals and diversity-oriented groups to accuse Becker of ""objectification,"" the Telegraph reported.

""The charity Women in Sport has worked for decades to change sporting culture including to end the objectification of women,"" Hilborne told the Telegraph. ""When two men are comfortable talking about women in this way, never mind on live TV, it shows there is still more to do. We need everyone to understand how this impacts on women and girls, how it makes them feel. Shouldn't we be inspiring the next generation of girls to play sport rather than talking about what women look like?""

The outlet added that Flo Williams — a Wales international rugby player who founded the Perception Agency — said that ""it's changing room chat rather than commentary chat. Straightaway it shows that commentary around women in sport can be so much around what they look like, whether they are playing or not.""

What did the BBC have to say?

The Telegraph said the BBC declined to issue criticism but did say that ""Boris Becker made a lighthearted comment that was not intended to cause offense.""

Anything else?

The outlet added that Inverdale once got in trouble for criticizing the looks of former women's tennis player Marion Bartoli and ""caused alarm"" in 2016 after likening Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios to a ""character from the Jungle Book.""

Here's more on Becker from the Telegraph:

Twice-married Becker became Wimbledon champion at 17 — but is also famed for his girlfriends, his celebrity lifestyle, his love child, and a bankruptcy ruling. ""I've lived a pretty intense life,"" he said in a 2017 interview. ""Do I go borderline, sometimes over the border? Of course. Otherwise I wouldn't have won Wimbledon at 17. I wouldn't have become No. 1 in the world. I wouldn't have done what I have done if that wasn't part of my personality. And that means I take chances. I take chances because this is who I am.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boom-in-make-up-for-men,2021-07-08
Boris Johnson celebrates 'historic' victory in UK as projected results point to landslide for Conservatives,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave a celebratory speech early Friday morning after projections appeared to show a landslide victory for his Conservative Party.

Rival Labour Party leader and longtime socialist Jeremy Corbyn announced he would not lead his party into another general election as results continued to pour in, after what he called a ""very disappointing night.""

What are the details?

The BBC forecasted Conservatives (known as the Tories) leading with 362 seats compared to Labour's 199 as of this writing, with Labour losing several seats in areas where they had historically enjoyed strongholds.

According to Fox News, if those numbers hold, it would mean the greatest Tory victory since Margaret Thatcher won 397 seats for Conservatives in 1983.

Johnson has been a passionate champion for following through with Brexit, the divorce from the European Union that British voters approved in 2016. His Conservative Party made it the focus of Thursday's general election.

""At this stage,"" Johnson told supporters Friday, ""it does look as though this one-nation Conservative government has been given a powerful new mandate to get Brexit done.""



In his election night speech, Corbyn announced he would step down as leader following a period of ""reflection,"" and directed partial blame toward ""media intrusion"" for the results. The socialist further asserted, ""Brexit has so polarized debate it has overridden so much of normal political debate.""

Anything else?

Corbyn has been accused of being an anti-Semite and a communist sympathizer, themes that dogged him during the campaign. Even members of his own party called for him to step down before he announced his departure.

Meanwhile, just a few days before election day, Johnson released a campaign ad that went viral, where he recreated a scene from the popular 2003 film, ""Love, Actually.""

The ad acknowledged that United Kingdom voters were sick of hearing about Brexit and wanted to be done with it, before Johnson himself made his case by showing up at a ""voter's"" door to plead using cue cards without uttering a word while ""Silent Night"" played in the background.

At the end, he looks into the camera and simply says, ""Enough. Enough. Let's get this done.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boris-becker-pretty-fiancee-objectification,2019-12-13
"Outgoing UK prime minister Boris Johnson claims 'deep state' wants to undo Brexit, reiterates pangolin COVID origin theory in latest speech to Commons","UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who announced his resignation on July 7 and who will remain in office for seven more weeks, gave a fiery speech to the House of Commons on Monday, recalling his accomplishments in his three years as prime minister, predicting that the ""deep state"" will not succeed in undoing Brexit, and reiterating that COVID may have originated from Chinese pangolins.

In one of his final addresses to the Commons as prime minister, Johnson enumerated all the ""very remarkable"" successes the Tories have had under his leadership, especially Brexit and the government's handling of COVID-19.

""We got Brexit done and though the rejoiners and the revengers were left plotting and planning and biding their time – and I’ll have more to say about the events of the last few weeks and months in due course – we delivered on every single one of our promises,"" he said.

But he also issued a warning to his opponents in the Labour Party and in ""the deep state"": Brexit is here to stay.

""Some people will say as I leave office, they will say, 'This is the end of Brexit,'"" he told MPs, ""'and [that] the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Keir Starmer) and the deep state will prevail in its plot to haul back us into alignment with the EU as a prelude to our eventual return.'

""We on this side of the House will prove them wrong,"" he pledged.

He also claimed that Starmer has repeatedly attempted to ""overturn the will of the people"" regarding Brexit and that, given the chance, he and the Labour Party and deep state would attempt to do so again if Starmer were made prime minister.

However, Starmer insisted earlier this month that, should he succeed Johnson, he would not try to undo Brexit.

“So let me be very clear: with Labour, Britain will not go back into the EU. We will not be joining the single market. We will not be joining a customs union,” Starmer said.

In his speech, Johnson also weighed in on his government's accomplishments during COVID, which he said likely originated in a Chinese wet market.

COVID was ""[a] pandemic that was global, whose origins we do not fully understand but were nothing to do with the British people — and if anything the result of distant misbehavior involving bats or pangolins — and whose spread was appallingly difficult to manage, and this Government never gave up through wave after wave,"" Johnson remarked in his speech (emphasis added).

Johnson is likely to step down officially on September 6. Fellow conservatives Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordaunt, Liz Truss, Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat are now attempting to become the leader of the Tory Party.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boris-johnson-celebrates-historic-victory-in-uk-as-projected-results-point-to-landslide-for-conservatives,2022-07-18
"Boris Johnson ends England's COVID restrictions, including mask mandates and vaccine passports, amid scandal","England will end its mandatory face masking and COVID-19 vaccine passport requirements on Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced to applause from Parliament.

Speaking in the House of Commons Wednesday, Johnson said scientists believe the wave of coronavirus cases caused by the Omicron variant had peaked nationally and as such the country would revert to its ""Plan A"" response to the virus, according to the BBC.

The end of ""Plan B"" lifts many coronavirus restrictions Johnson imposed on England. The prime minister said that beginning Thursday, COVID passports for entering nightclubs and large events would no longer be required, though private venues can continue to use them if they wish. People will no longer be advised to work from home, and employers may coordinate a return to offices.

Face masks will no longer be mandated in England, though the government is encouraging people to wear coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces or when meeting strangers, Johnson said. And starting Thursday, schoolchildren will no longer have to wear face masks in classrooms.

The prime minister cited data from a coronavirus infection study by the Office for National Statistics in his announcement that shows infections are falling in England and hospitalizations have stabilized.

""We will trust the judgement of the English people,"" Johnson said. ""We are the first to emerge from the Omicron wave.



There were loud cheers in Parliament after Johnson finished making these announcements.

""This is a moment we can all be proud of,"" Health Secretary Sajid Javid said at a press conference. ""It is a reminder of what this country can accomplish when we all work together.""

U.K. health officials warned that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not eradicated and that future variants will lead to surges of viral infections. But the nation will respond to COVID as an endemic virus, rather than a pandemic.

""We must learn to live with COVID in the same way we live with the flu,"" Javid said.

The change in coronavirus policy comes as many British lawmakers are calling for Johnson's resignation, following reports of parties and other supposedly prohibited gatherings at the prime minister's residence during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Labour leaders opposed to Johnson have accused him of hypocritically flouting coronavirus restrictions with ""industrial scale partying."" Members of Johnson's own party are also fed up with him, with prominent Conservative lawmaker and former Brexit secretary David Davis telling Johnson Wednesday, ""In the name of God, go.""

Johnson admitted to Parliament last week that he had attended a gathering with alcoholic drinks at the prime minister's office at Downing Street in May 2020 but said he believed it was a ""work event.""

But public backlash to Johnson's excuse has led a number of Conservative Party lawmakers to call for his resignation, fearing that the prime minister has lost the trust of voters and will be unable to lead the party in future elections.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boris-johnson-deep-state-wet-markets,2022-01-19
Boris Johnson admits he attended infamous Downing Street 'drinks party' but claims he thought it was a 'work event.' No one is buying the explanation.,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing renewed calls for his resignation for attending a government staff ""drinks party"" last year while the rest of the country remained in a strict government-imposed COVID-19 lockdown.

What are the details?

Several senior members of the U.K. Parliament angrily demanded that Johnson step down Wednesday after he finally admitted to attending a garden drinks gathering at No. 10 Downing Street last May, BBC News reported.

Johnson had previously been coy about his involvement in the party while an investigation into it — and several other alleged government parties — took place. But on Wednesday, the prime minister admitted his attendance and offered his ""heartfelt apologies"" to the nation in a speech before a packed House of Commons.

Johnson said he was well aware of the ""rage"" that many U.K. residents feel toward him and the government he leads when they see that ""in Downing Street itself, the rules are not being properly followed by the people who make the rules.""

Though at the same time, he defended himself for attending the ""bring your own booze"" shindig by saying he only stayed for 25 minutes in order to “thank groups of staff” for their hard work, and he added that he “believed implicitly that this was a work event.”

In May 2020, the U.K. government, at Johnson's direction, restricted people from leaving their houses without a reasonable excuse and only allowed people to meet with one person outside their households in an outdoor setting while exercising.

What was the reaction?

As Johnson attempted to ease concerns over the party in his House of Commons speech, jeers and boos could be heard in the chamber from members of Parliament.

The response afterward was much sharper. Addressing Parliament, opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer called Johnson’s excuse “so ridiculous that it’s actually offensive to the British public” and demanded that Johnson “do the decent thing and resign.”

In a tweet Wednesday, Starmer said, ""The party is over Boris Johnson. Resign.""

Four lawmakers from Johnson's own party publicly demanded he quit, the Wall Street Journal reported.

William Wragg characterized the prime minister's position as ""untenable,"" adding, ""I don't think it should be left to the findings of a civil servant to determine the future of the prime minister and indeed who governs this country.""

A fellow Conservative MP, Caroline Nokes, reportedly said Johnson should resign now, as he was ""damaging the entire Conservative brand.""

CNBC reported that Johnson's leadership was on a ""knife's edge.""

What else?

The May rendezvous was not the only party that government officials are alleged to have held amid lockdown conditions for the rest of the country.

According to BBC News, in November 2020, at least one other party for Downing Street staff members took place in the residence where the prime minister lives.

Just a week prior, Johnson had told people in England that “we are once again asking you to stay at home” amid a new national lockdown. He ordered people only to leave their homes “for work if you can’t work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies"" and banned indoor gatherings with other households.

British PM Johnson offers 3 million Hong Kong citizens refuge in the UK to hit back at China,"U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that his country will offer 3 million Hong Kong residents refuge and a path to citizenship in the United Kingdom in retaliation to China's new national security law, which effectively ends autonomy in the city.

According to Business Insider, Johnson told the House of Commons Wednesday that the law is in violation of the Sino-British joint declaration, which was signed by the U.K. and China in 1984.

The new law, which was met with global opposition, outlaws ""foreign interference"" and cracks down on pro-democracy demonstrations within the city. On Wednesday, it was put into effect as police arrested nearly 200 Hong Kong residents after thousands participated in a rally against the legislation.

Under the U.K. order, Hong Kong citizens eligible to apply for a British national overseas passport, along with their dependents, will be able to seek 5 years of limited right to remain in the U.K. — that number amounts to about 3 million.

After their 5-year stay and an additional year of settled status, arrivals will be eligible to apply for full U.K. citizenship.

""The enactment and imposition of this national security law constitutes a clear and serious breach of the Sino-British joint declaration,"" the prime minister told Parliament. ""It violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and is in direct conflict with Hong Kong basic law. The law also threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration.

""We made clear that if China continued down this path we would introduce a new route for those with British national overseas status to enter the U.K., granting them limited right to remain with the ability to live and work in the U.K. and thereafter to apply for citizenship — and that is precisely what we will do now,"" he added.

According to BBC, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said there would be no limit on numbers or quotas, telling members that the U.K. ""will not look the other way on Hong Kong"" and ""will not duck our historic responsibilities to its people.""

Pro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong sounded the alarm over the new law last month, saying it marked the end of the ""one country, two systems"" agreement between Beijing and the autonomous city.

Soon after, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo agreed, officially declaring that with the imposition of the new law, Hong Kong could no longer be considered autonomous.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boris-johnson-faces-calls-to-resign-over-lockdown-party,2020-07-01
British PM facing heat — again — for attending a birthday bash while the rest of the country remained in lockdown,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing renewed calls to resign following a report that he attended a birthday party in June 2020 while the rest of the country struggled under government-imposed COVID-19 lockdown rules that forbade such gatherings.

What are the details?

ITV News reported this week that Johnson and his wife, Carrie Johnson, joined up to 30 guests in the Cabinet Room of 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's official residence, on June 19, 2020, for a surprise gathering put on to celebrate Johnson's birthday upon his return from an official visit to Hertfordshire.

According to the British news outlet, the Johnsons further breached lockdown protocols later that evening when they hosted family and friends upstairs in the prime minister's residence.

ITV said the Cabinet Room shindig lasted roughly 30 minutes and that guests enjoyed food and other refreshments while a birthday cake was presented to the prime minister. The outlet claimed that the party was organized by Johnson's wife and his interior designer, Lulu Lytle.

In a statement to the Washington Post on Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesperson admitted that staff members ""gathered briefly in the Cabinet Room after a meeting to wish the Prime Minister a happy birthday,"" but said, ""He was there for less than 10 minutes.""

In response to other claims — such as that Carrie Johnson organized the party and that it included 30 guests, cake, and singing — the spokesperson said, ""This is totally untrue. In line with the rules at the time, the Prime Minister hosted a small number of family members outside that evening.""

What's the background?

News of the birthday gathering sparked further backlash against the prime minister, who was already under fire for attending a separate ""drinks party"" at 10 Downing Street last May, again amid his own government's lockdown.

Johnson apologized for his attendance at the latter party in front of a packed House of Commons earlier this month, acknowledging the ""rage"" that many U.K. residents may feel when they believe that ""in Downing Street itself, the rules are not being properly followed by the people who make the rules.""

But he defended himself, as well, claiming that he only stayed at the party for 25 minutes in order to ""thank groups of staff"" for their hard work and added that he ""believed implicitly that this was a work event.""

CNN tries to get Boris Johnson to bash the US — but he refuses to take the bait: 'A shining city on a hill',"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson refused to bash the United States on Sunday when asked if he is ""worried"" about a decline of democracy in America.

What happened?

Speaking with CNN anchor Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" Tapper claimed his international friends are voicing concern that American democracy is eroding. Johnson promptly dismissed such concerns.

""When I talk to friends in Canada, the U.K., Australia, and elsewhere, people express concern about the United States— in terms of our ability and our institutions to thrive and continue after what happened with the election of 2020,"" Tapper began. ""They’re worried that democracy is on life support in the United States.""

""Are you worried at all?"" Tapper asked.



""No!"" Johnson immediately responded.

""You're not?"" Tapper followed up.

""I want to say this to the people of the United States: I'm not,"" Johnson confirmed.

""I guess get back to what I have been trying to say to you throughout this interview, I think that reports of the death of democracy in the United States are grossly, grossly exaggerated. America is a shining city on a hill,"" Johnson explained. ""And it will continue to be so.""

When Tapper pressed Johnson further about the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, Johnson admitted it was ""pretty weird"" but refused to criticize America.

""Looking from the outside, it was pretty weird,"" Johnson said. ""But I don't believe that American democracy is under serious threat, far from it. I continue to believe that America is the greatest global guarantor of democracy and freedom.""

Anything else?

Earlier in the interview, however, Johnson reaffirmed his declaration that America took a ""big step backwards"" when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

Johnson described the high court ruling as ""important psychologically for people around the world,"" but he denied that it diminishes the U.S. as the global symbol of freedom.

""The United States for me, it remains a shining city on the hill,"" Johnson said. ""And it's an incredible guarantor of values, democracy, freedom around the world.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boris-johnson-lockdown-birthday-party,2022-06-27

Boris Johnson was released from St. Thomas' Hospital in London, 16 days after he announced that he contracted the coronavirus. The 55-year-old prime minister was taken to the hospital last Sunday after suffering from coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and high fever.

Last Monday, Johnson's conditions worsened, and he was moved to intensive care, where he received treatment until Thursday. While at the ICU, Johnson was supported with oxygen but was not put on a ventilator.

On Sunday, a spokesperson for 10 Downing Street said: ""The prime minister has been discharged from hospital to continue his recovery at Chequers.""

""He wishes to thank everybody at St. Thomas' for the brilliant care he has received,"" the spokesperson continued. ""All of his thoughts are with those affected by this illness.""

""I owe them my life,"" Johnson said of the NHS medical staff at the St. Thomas' Hospital. ""I can't thank them enough.""

Johnson will not immediately return to work ""on the advice of his medical team."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has been the ""stand-in"" for Johnson while he recovers.

Johnson's fiancee, Carrie Symonds, said that ""there were times last week that were very dark indeed."" Symonds, who is pregnant with their first child, sent words of gratitude to the staff at St. Thomas' Hospital on Twitter.

The party's over for Boris Johnson: UK prime minster resigns amid scandal,"U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation Thursday and will step down as leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister following multiple scandals and significant loss of support from members of his party. Johnson indicated that he would remain as prime minister until the Tories can elect a new leader.

In a short address delivered from the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street in London, Johnson said it was ""clearly now the will of the parliamentary Conservative Party that there should be a new leader ... and therefore a new prime minister.""

He thanked voters for handing Conservatives ""the biggest Conservative majority since 1987"" in the landslide election of 2019 and said he was grateful for the accomplishments of his government, which include Brexit, managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and ""standing up to Putin"" after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Johnson said he would have preferred to remain prime minister, but that ""the herd instinct is powerful and when the herd moves, it moves.""

He was referring to the fact that dozens of Conservative ministers had resigned from his government this week, following revelations that Johnson had named Conservative MP Chris Pincher to his government even though he was aware of sexual misconduct allegations against him. Pincher resigned from Parliament last week amid new allegations that he sexually assaulted two men at a club.

Conservative lawmakers were already on the verge of breaking from Johnson after the so-called ""Partygate"" scandal — allegations that Johnson had hosted parties and other intimate gatherings at his residence during the pandemic in violation of the U.K.'s lockdown rules. Last month, Johnson faced a vote of no confidence in Parliament, but survived by winning simple majority support from Conservative lawmakers.



However, the new Pincher scandal was the straw that broke the camel's back. Beginning with Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Chancellor Rishi Sunak's resignations Wednesday morning, at least 59 of Johnson's ministers exited his government, leaving him scrambling to find enough new ministers to continue governing.

When it became clear he could not fill his government, Johnson resigned.

""In the last few days I've tried to persuade my colleagues that it would be eccentric to change governments when we're delivering so much, and when we have such a vast mandate, and when we're actually only a handful of points behind in the polls even in midterm after quite a few months of pretty relentless sledging,"" Johnson said.

""I regret not to have been successful in those arguments and, of course, it's painful not to be able to see through so many ideas and projects myself,"" he continued.

Adding that no politician is indispensable, Johnson said, ""our brilliant and Darwinian system will produce another leader,"" to whom he will pledge his full support.

UK company develops breathalyzer device designed for early cancer detection,"Researchers in the United Kingdom announced Thursday the launch of a clinical trial for a breathalyzer device that the company believes could be used for early cancer detection in patients.

""We urgently need to develop new tools, like this breath test, which could help to detect and diagnose cancer earlier, giving patients the best chance of surviving their disease,"" professor Rebecca Fitzgerald, the lead trial investigator at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Centre, said in a news release.

Owlstone Medical has developed its non-invasive Breath Biopsy technology that's designed to help doctors detect early changes in volatile organic compounds, known as VOCs, exhaled from a patient's breath.

What are the details?

The initial two-year trial plans to recruit 1,500 patients suspected of having esophageal and stomach cancers. It plans to expand the study to include prostate, kidney, bladder, liver, and pancreatic cancers in the coming months, according to the release.

Trial participants will be asked to breathe into the breathalyzer device for 10 minutes. The device will collect VOCs, which scientists will analyze for breath-based biomarkers with aims to detect and identify various types of cancer.

Cancer cells alter metabolism even at the very earliest stage of disease, affecting the pattern of the VOCs exhaled, the release said.

""Through this clinical trial we hope to find signatures in breath needed to detect cancers earlier — it's the crucial next step in developing this technology,"" the release continued. ""Owlstone Medical's Breath Biopsy technology is the first to test across multiple cancer types, potentially paving the way for a universal breath test.""

British ambassador to US resigns after criticizing President Trump in leaked documents,"The United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States has resigned, after leaked documents revealed he criticized President Donald Trump and the Trump administration in secret communications with Downing Street.

What are the details?

Over the weekend, Britain's Daily Mail published excerpts from a cache of leaked diplomatic cables sent from Ambassador Kim Darroch, showing he called the Trump administration ""dysfunctional"" and ""inept."" Sir Kim also warned that President Trump's career could end in ""disgrace.""



President Trump reacted to the leaked memos on Twitter, calling Darroch a ""very stupid guy,"" and announcing that the United States ""will no longer deal with him."" The president also criticized outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May over her handling of Brexit.

The BBC reported Wednesday that Darroch submitted a letter of resignation to the Foreign Office, wherein he wrote, ""Since the leak of official documents from this Embassy there has been a great deal of speculation surrounding my position and the duration of my remaining term as ambassador. I want to put an end to that speculation.""

He continued, ""The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like. Although my posting is not due to end until the end of this year, I believe in the current circumstances the responsible course is to allow the appointment of a new ambassador.""

He also said the situation ""has brought home to me the depth of friendship and close ties between our two countries.""

According to the Guardian, Sir Kim ""concluded that his position was untenable"" after Conservative Boris Johnson stopped short of defending him during a debate on Tuesday. Johnson is the frontrunner in the race to replace Prime Minister May.

Speaking to Parliament Wednesday, May said she told Darroch that it is a ""matter of great regret that he has felt it necessary to leave his position,"" the Washington Post reported.

British Army millennial recruitment ads encourage 'snowflakes' to sign up,"The British Army wants to recruit ""snowflakes,"" ""phone zombies,"" ""binge gamers,"" and ""me me me millennials,"" according to posters, billboards, and TV ads popping up in the United Kingdom.

Why are they doing this?

In recent years, the British Army has seen a decline in recruits as it struggles to maintain its target level of 82,000 troops, NBC News reported.

The posters have a design similar to the iconic World War I ""Your Country Needs You"" ads. But in this campaign, the slogan is ""The Army spots potential. Even if others don't.""

Under the campaign, millennial stereotypes typically viewed as negative are cast as being positive. For example, ""phone zombies"" have focus and ""binge gamers"" have drive, NBC News reported. Similarly, ""snowflakes"" are viewed as having compassion and ""me me me millennials"" have ""self-belief.""

One of the TV ads contrasts a millennial playing a video game with soldiers providing rescue efforts for survivors of a natural disaster, for example. The campaign is targeting gamers for their ""interest in technology.""

""The video game Fortnite is considered the most popular computer game ever made and is currently thought to have over 200 million users,"" the Telegraph explained. ""The Army is hoping to tap into this market of gamers.""

New figures from the Entertainment Retailers Association show that video games now represent more than one-half of the entertainment market.

What is their main selling point?

""The 'Your Army Needs You' campaign is a powerful call to action that appeals to those seeking to make a difference as part of an innovative and inclusive team,"" U.K. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said in a statement. ""It shows that time spent in the army equips people with skills for life and provides comradeship, adventure and opportunity like no other job does.""

According to the U.K. Ministry of Defence, 72 percent of young people say they are ambitious yet feel undervalued and want a job that makes a difference and has meaning.

Thursday marks the official kick-off of the British Army's ad campaign.

British comic suggests tossing battery acid on 'easy to hate' political figures instead of milkshakes — and gets big laughs,"British comic Jo Brand suggested tossing battery acid upon ""easy to hate"" political figures instead of trendy milkshakes — and got some big laughs.

The 61-year-old appeared on the BBC radio show ""Heresy"" Tuesday night, the Irish Examiner reported, and was asked about UK politics — which of late have featured woke leftists publicly pelting conservative figures such as Brexit leader Nigel Farage with milkshakes.

Listeners howled with laughter.

""That's just me ... I'm not gonna do it, it's purely a fantasy,"" Brand added, ""but I think milkshakes are pathetic, I honestly do, sorry.""

Here's the clip of her comments:

British Conservative lawmaker stabbed to death at constituency meeting in local church,"British Conservative lawmaker Sir David Amess has died after being stabbed ""multiple times"" during a constituency meeting, CNN reports.

The 69-year-old Parliament member represented Southend West in Essex and leaves behind a wife and five children.

What are the details?

According to reports, a male suspect walked into a meeting with voters from his electoral district, which was being held in a local Methodist church, and stabbed Amess to death.

In a statement, Essex police said that Amess was ""treated by emergency services,"" but succumbed to his injuries at the scene.

Authorities took into custody a 25-year-old suspect and recovered a knife that is believed to have been used in the attack.

According to CNN, Amess entered Parliament in 1983, which made him one of the longest-serving lawmakers in the chamber.

Flags outside Parliament were lowered to half staff after his death, CNN reported.

Former British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted about Amess' murder, writing, ""This is the most devastating, horrific & tragic news. David Amess was a kind and thoroughly decent man — & he was the most committed MP you could ever hope to meet. Words cannot adequately express the horror of what has happened today.

British foreign minister fires back over accusation that critical gate at Kabul airport was left open for UK personnel,"A senior British official denied accusations that a key gate was left open at the Kabul airport prior to the ISIS-K terror attack to allow British personnel to pass through the gate.

What is the background?

Politico reported Monday that top American commanders wanted to close the Abbey Gate — the location of the terror attack — but kept ""the gate open longer than they wanted in order to allow their British allies, who had accelerated their withdrawal timeline, to continue evacuating their personnel, based at the nearby Baron Hotel.""

The reporting is based on classified notes taken during a meeting hosted by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin shortly before the attack. The allegation, as the report explained, is that American officials had a ""detailed plan"" to shut the Abbey Gate, but kept it open to help British allies.

How did Britain respond?

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab categorically denied the accusation.

""Look, we coordinate very closely with the U.S., in particular around the ISIS-K threat that we anticipated, although tragically were not able to prevent,"" Raab said on Sky News. ""But we, it's certainly right to say that we got our civilian staff out of the processing center by Abbey Gate — but it's just not true to suggest that other than securing our civilians staff inside the airport that we were pushing to leave the gate open.""

""In fact, and let me just be clear about this, we were issuing changes of travel advice before the bomb attack took place and saying to people in the crowd, which is what I was particularly concerned that certainly U.K. nationals and anyone else should leave because of the risk,"" he added.

In fact, Raab explained in a separate interview with BBC News that British operations never necessitated leaving the Abbey Gate open at the Kabul airport.

""We also shifted the civilian team that we had in the Baron Hotel to the airport, because [being] a stone's throw away from where the terrorist attack took place, it clearly wasn't safe, but none of that would have required or necessitated Abbey Gate to be left open,"" Raab explained.

Anything else?

The Pentagon strongly rebuked Politico for publishing its story, but did not deny the material facts.

""This story is based on the unlawful disclosure of classified information and internal deliberations of a sensitive nature,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a statement, according to Politico.

""As soon as we became aware of the material divulged to the reporter, we engaged Politico at the highest levels to prevent the publication of information that would put our troops and our operations at the airport at greater risk,"" he added.

British-Iranian prisoner released home after UK negotiates payment of $500 million to Iran,"A British-Iranian woman held prisoner in Iran for nearly six years has been freed and is returning home to the United Kingdom after the U.K. government negotiated to pay a historic debt the Iranian government claimed was owed to the Islamic theocracy.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a charity worker with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was imprisoned in Iran in 2016 after the authoritarian regime accused her of being a spy and of plotting to overthrow the government. She and her family denied the charges, insisting she was on vacation with her daughter to visit family in Tehran.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe spent nearly five years in prison before she was released to house arrest in her parents' home, the Washington Post reports.

Iranian state media reported Wednesday that Zaghari-Ratcliffe and another dual national, Anousheh Ashouri, left the country after the U.K. government paid more than $500 million to Teharn, according to Reuters.

That money was part of a debt Iran's theocratic rulers claimed the British government owed after the shah of Iran purchased 1,750 Chieftain tanks and other weapons from the United Kingdom in the 1970s. But the U.K.'s International Military Services never delivered those weapons because the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the U.S.-backed Shah. The order was canceled even though the previous Iranian government had paid in advance for it, and the Islamic regime that replaced the shah's government has since demanded the repayment of those funds.

Richard Ratcliffe, Nazanin's husband, who has tirelessly protested and advocated for his wife's release, had previously accused Iran of using his wife as a political hostage in the country's dispute over the debt.



U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss confirmed in a statement Wednesday that ""we have also settled the IMS debt"" after announcing Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release.



The British government has denied that the two issues are related.

Earlier this year, however, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not deny there were efforts to negotiate Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release by settling the debt dispute with Iran.



On Feb. 9, British member of Parliament Tulip Siddiq said she had learned of a deal signed between the U.K. government and Iranian authorities in the summer of 2021 ""that would have resulted in the payment of the £400m that we owe Iran and the release of my constituent Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe,"" but that deal had fallen through, according to Sky News.

Siddiq asked Johnson to meet with her and Richard Ratcliffe to explain why the deal had collapsed.

""The International Military Services, or IMS, debt is difficult to settle and square away for all sorts of reasons to do with sanctions. But we will continue to work on it and I will certainly make sure that we have another meeting with Richard Ratcliffe in due course,"" Jonson said in response, suggesting the IMS debt was in-fact part of the negotiations to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release.

Foreign Secretary Truss said in her statement that resolving the IMS debt payment and securing the release of detained British nationals were ""my top priorities"" upon assuming office in September 2021.

""Last month I spoke twice to Iranian Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian in a final push to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion. Our officials then held a last round of negotiations to sign off an agreement allowing Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori to return to the UK, and Morad Tahbaz to be released on furlough to his house in Tehran,"" Truss said.

""The IMS debt has been settled in full compliance with UK and international sanctions and all legal obligations. These funds will be ring-fenced solely for the purchase of humanitarian goods.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/british-foreign-minister-fires-back-over-accusation-that-critical-gate-at-kabul-airport-was-left-open-for-british-personnel,2022-03-16
British journalist tries to bash the US for ease of gun sales and faces merciless online mockery,"A British journalist faced a swift retaliation of mockery and ridicule after he tried to bash the United States for the supposed ease of gun and ammunition sales.

Pádraig Belton, a BBC reporter, tweeted on Tuesday that he couldn't find an adapter for his laptop at a Walmart but that they were selling rifles and ammunition.

Twitter users immediately noted that Belton had posted photographs of BB guns, not real guns as he had posited and mocked him for the bizarre failed attempt to criticize U.S. gun policies.

""First, those are BB guns Second, our guns are the reason we don't bow to a queen,"" read one popular response with more than 8k likes.

""Tell me you had a sad childhood AND never watched A Christmas Story in one tweet,"" replied another critic.

The reporter did not respond to the thousands of replies.

I was only referring to the book below ['Father Christmas' by Raymond Briggs] but it's left me a little confused/on edge about what we are aloud [sic] to say.""

The mother added, ""I have a small child and don't really want to raise him saying 'Father Christmas' if it's hurtful to some.""

The original message stream on Facebook has not been disclosed, but as other media outlets have picked up the story, debate over the incident has gained momentum online.

Fox News reported that one user reacted by saying of Santa, ""Seriously! He's a guy, quite clearly a guy. I would have bitten back by calling him St. Nicholas to be honest. The clue's in the name, Nicholas not Nicola.""

Another wrote, ""Glad my kids grew up knowing Father Christmas is based on St. Nick...a man! All for personal identities and encourage it but come on! How messed up is this world we live in?""

British officials seize hundreds of child sex dolls at border,"Officials have seized hundreds of child sex dolls at Britain's borders over the last 18 months, according to the Crown Prosecution Service.

However, there are no specific laws prohibiting the possession of the dolls. British prosecutors have implemented Victorian law to prosecute suspects caught trying to import child sex dolls into the country, the New York Post reported.

Prosecutors are going after suspects using the Customs Consolidation Act of 1876, along with the Customs and Excise Acts of 1979, which prohibit the import of indecent or obscene articles, in an effort to stop the trade.



Suspects who are caught trying to bring the dolls into the country could face up to seven years behind bars.

The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children hopes that the move would hinder the sales of the dolls.

""There is no ambiguity that they are designed to depict children and their purpose is to stimulate sex,"" a spokesperson told the New York Post. ""We have serious worries that adults who use sex dolls could become desensitized and their behavior would become normal to them so that they go on to harm children.""

Has anyone been prosecuted?

Earlier this week, a 61-year-old man was sentenced to 18 months in jail for possession of a doll and making indecent photos.

Donald Styles of Newton Abbot in Devon, England, claimed that he bought his 3-foot doll from China for an art project.

After the doll was seized by customs officials, police raided his home where they reportedly found nearly 150 films and images of child abuse, including rape.

British prime minister front-runner ‘ready’ to push nuclear button,"Liz Truss, Britain’s Foreign Secretary and front-runner to become the nation’s next prime minister, said she would be ""ready"" to use the U.K.'s nuclear arsenal if she was to become prime minister.

Truss was speaking at a debate (known in the U.K. as a “husting”) hosted by Times Radio’s John Pienaar. Pienaar asked Truss how she would react if she were put in a situation where she had to consider activating the UK’s nuclear arsenal.

Pienaar laid out the scenario: ""Your orders to our Trident boat captain on whether you, prime minister Liz Truss, is giving the order to unleash nuclear weapons. It would mean global annihilation. I won't ask you if you would press the button, you'll say yes, but faced with that task I would feel physically sick.""

""How does that thought make you feel?"" Pienaar asked.

Truss replied, “I think it’s an important duty of the prime minister and I’m ready to do that,” adding, “I’m ready to do that.”

Truss’ response was met with applause from the live audience. Rishi Sunak, Truss’ opponent, reportedly was not asked the same question at the debate.

The issue of nuclear war has become more pressing since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.

Truss has taken a hardline position against Russia. “I will go further as prime minister by doing everything possible – including declassifying more intelligence – to expose Putin’s playbook to the world,” Truss wrote in the Daily Telegraph. She added, “My government will use intelligence strategically to reveal the Kremlin’s attempts to undermine and destabilize freedom-loving democracies.”

The U.K. first developed and tested nuclear weapons in 1952, making it the third nuclear country (after the U.S. and Soviet Union.) It is one of five officially recognized nuclear states under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

Nuclear weapons have been used twice in warfare — in the U.S. bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. About 13,400 nuclear weapons reportedly remain today. There have been over 2,000 nuclear tests conducted since the original Trinity test in 1945, according to the United Nations.

The U.K. currently has a self-imposed limit of 225 nuclear warheads.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/british-pm-boris-johnson-tests-positive-for-covid-19-names-a-designated-survivor,2022-08-27
British Prime Minister Theresa May resigns over outcome of Brexit negotiations,"British Prime Minister Theresa May has announced that she will be stepping down, citing her inability to get Parliament to agree on a Brexit deal.

What's the background?

The European Union is a group of 28 European countries who agree to abide by an ever-growing and changing set of mutual rules and regulations. The United Kingdom joined the EU in 1969.

On June 23, 2016, citizens of the United Kingdom voted 52 to 48 to leave the European Union. Then-Prime Minister David Cameron, who had campaigned against Brexit, resigned the day after the vote. Theresa May was elected on July 13 of that year to replace Cameron and take the role of prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party.

Over the next three years, May would struggle to get Parliament to agree on the terms of the British exit, or ""Brexit,"" from the EU. In June 2017, she tried unsuccessfully to hold a national election to earn her party a more solid majority in Parliament. This backfired, when the Conservatives lost seats. Members of her own party tried to oust her in December, but she managed to win that vote 200 to 117. In a desperate bid in late March, May offered to resign if Parliament could pass her version of a Brexit deal. Parliament rejected that deal two days later.

What happened today?

May said on Friday morning that she would be resigning as Conservative Party leader effective June 7, but that she would continue to serve as prime minister until her replacement is elected.

""Back in 2016, we gave the British people a choice,"" May said on Thursday, standing in front of the prime minister's official residence at 10 Downing Street. ""Against all predictions, the British people voted to leave the European Union. I feel as certain today as I did three years ago that in a democracy, if you give people a choice you have a duty to implement what they decide. I have done my best to do that. ... Sadly, I have not been able to do so.""

She continued, ""It is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new prime minister to lead that effort. So I am today announcing that I will resign as leader of the Conservative and Unionist party, on Friday the 7th of June, so that a successor can be chosen.""

The UK's deadline to leave Brexit was extended to Oct. 31, 2019, since the British government could not agree on a deal.

What's next?

Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis has announced that nominees to replace May will be chosen by June 10. The vote to elect one of these nominees is expected to held by mid-July.

Since prime ministers in the U.K. always represent whichever party (or coalition of parties) has the majority in Parliament, whoever the Conservative Party elects as its leader will become the next prime minister. Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the queen.

When May herself was running for prime minister, her sole opponent dropped out of the race, making an election unnecessary. She was the 13th to gain this position without an election.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/british-prime-minister-front-runner-ready-to-push-nuclear-button,2019-05-24
90-year-old British woman first to receive COVID-19 vaccine: 'I feel so privileged',"Margaret Keenan, a British woman who will turn 91 years old next week, is the first woman to receive a vaccine against coronavirus, according to ABC News.

What are the details?

Keenan, a retired shop clerk, received the country's first shot from its vaccination program.

Keenan was the first person in line at University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire in Coventry, England, the outlet reported, which is one of the hospitals across the region that is handling the country's initial phase of the vaccination program.

""I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against COVID-19,"" Keenan said. ""It's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the New Year after being on my own for most of the year.""

May Parsons, the nurse who administered Keenan's shot, said of the vaccine, ""I'm just glad to be able to play a part on this historic day. The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS, but now it feels like there is a light at the end of the tunnel.""

ABC News reported, ""The U.K. is the first Western country to start a mass vaccination program after British regulators last week authorized the use of a COVID-19 shot developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech.""

""Britain has received 800,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, enough to vaccinate 400,000 people,"" ABC notes. ""The first shots will go to people over 80 who are either hospitalized or already have outpatient appointments scheduled, along with nursing home workers and vaccination staff.""

Most other people will likely have to wait until 2021 before receiving a vaccination.

According to ABC, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC that the vaccination program is likely to take ""many months"" to roll out.

""We still have a long road ahead of us, but this marks the route out,"" Hancock said.

National Health Service Medical Director Stephen Powis said that the first shot was an ""emotional"" moment.

""This really feels like the beginning of the end,"" he said. ""It's been [a] really dreadful year, 2020 — all those things that we are so used to, meeting friends and family, going to the cinema, have been disrupted. We can get those back. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not next month. But in the months to come.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/british-prime-minister-theresa-may-resigns-over-outcome-of-brexit-negotiations,2020-12-08
Bryan Cranston defends role as quadriplegic in 'The Upside'; others argue part should've gone to disabled actor,"Actor Bryan Cranston — widely known for playing a high-school-teacher-turned-meth-dealer in ""Breaking Bad"" — is defending his latest role as a quadriplegic in new movie ""The Upside"" while others argue the part should have gone to a disabled actor.

Cranston — who is not disabled — told Sky News he's aware of the latest debate in Hollywood over ""the need to expand opportunities"" for minority actors, but that him landing the role as a quadriplegic was a ""business decision.""

""As actors, we're asked to be other people, to play other people,"" he told the outlet. ""If I, as a straight, older person — and I'm wealthy, I'm very fortunate — does that mean I can't play a person who is not wealthy? Does that mean I can't play a homosexual? I don't know; where does the restriction apply, where is the line for that? I think it is worthy for debate to discuss those issues.""

The actor — who stars opposite comedian Kevin Hart in the new flick — added to Sky News that the situation is a ""case of catch-22.""

Bryan Cranston poses at the premiere of 'The Upside' at the Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto, Ontario, Sept. 8, 2017. GEOFF ROBINS/AFP/Getty Images

Cranston added in an interview with Yahoo Movies UK that him getting the part in ""The Upside"" underscores ""the lack of diversity in disabled actors and the lack of opportunity in order to be even considered to play the lead role in a film like this. Are there any actors who have reached any kind of star status to be able to be considered? I think by not coming up with an answer to that is the answer to that. There is a dearth of opportunity for actors with a disability.""

What are detractors saying?



But others are saying Cranston essentially stole a role from a disabled actor.

A Vice writer said Cranston ""prevented a lesser-known disabled actor from getting the opportunity to play the role and gain celebrity. It's no wonder, then, that disabled actors in Hollywood have a hard time landing enough roles to amass the name recognition of a franchise leader like Cranston.""

Maysoon Zayid — a comedian, actor, and disability advocate who has cerebral palsy — told BBC News that too many disabled actors are left out of productions.

""We are by far the largest minority in the world,"" Zayid said. ""We are 20 percent of the population, and we are only 2 percent of the images you see on American television — and of those 2 percent, 95 percent are played by non-disabled actors.""

Other examples

An amputee actress criticized Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson last year for his role as an amputee in ""Skyscraper"" — which came on the heels of Scarlett Johansson bowing to social media pressure and pulling out of a movie in which she was to play a transgender character.

Sky News added that Johansson in 2017 faced criticism after being cast as the lead in ""Ghost In The Shell,"" a remake of a Japanese anime classic, as over 100,000 people signed a petition saying the part should have gone to a Japanese actor.

More from the outlet:

Straight actor Darren Criss, who is known for playing gay characters including Blaine Anderson in ""Glee"" and killer Andrew Cunanan in ""American Crime Story: The Assassination Of Gianni Versace"" — for which he picked up a Golden Globe award earlier this week — recently ruled himself out of playing another homosexual part so as not to deprive an LGBT performer of a job.

Vaccinated PGA star forced to withdraw from major tournament for merely being exposed to person who tested positive for COVID,"PGA superstar Bubba Watson announced Sunday that he would miss an upcoming major tournament, The Open Championship, which is slated to take place this next weekend at the Royal St George's Golf Club in Sandwich, England.

Watson's announcement triggered mockery over the COVID-19 protocols.

What did Watson say?

Despite being vaccinated against COVID-19, Watson explained he would not compete at The Open — one of the PGA's four annual ""major"" tournaments — next week because he was exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

Watson said in a statement:

I am disappointed to announce I will not compete at The Open Championship next week due to having direct exposure to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. While I am vaccinated and have passed the required pre-travel COVID test, not enough time has passed for me to comfortably join the charter flight and risk exposure to the other players and personnel on board. I appreciate the R&A's guidance and help navigating UK policy for such situations.

COVID rules are stricter in the U.K., which explains why Watson was forced to withdraw from the tournament despite being vaccinated and passing COVID-related travel requirements.



""Rules for close contacts are stricter in the United Kingdom for golfers deemed to be a close contact than in the United States. Close contacts in the U.K. are forced to withdraw from tournaments. In the U.S., close contacts undergo daily testing,"" ESPN reported.

In fact, Watson confirmed this is why he cannot play in the tournament next week.

""For those wondering, the UK and US Covid-19 guidelines are quite different. Getting on the charter or a commercial flight was not an option available to me after my recent exposure. I don't make the rules but do have to follow them,"" he said.

What was the reaction?

Watson's announcement was denounced by many on social media preciously because being vaccinated against COVID was meant to stop people from being blocked from participating in ""normal life.""

""That's just crazy. That's the purpose of being vaccinated,"" one person said, sentiment that was echoed by dozens of others.

""So you are vaccinated, have no symptoms and have a negative covid test and that's still not enough? When does the insanity end? We will miss watching you - but wish you would call out these crazy nonsensical rules,"" another person said.

Fellow golf star Phil Mickelson said, ""I'm so sorry. You've been playing some great golf and the course is such a great one for you.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bryan-cranston-disabled-actor,2021-07-11
Burger King seemingly endorses protesters throwing milkshakes at conservative politicians,"Pro-Brexit British politician Nigel Farage was hit by a milkshake during a campaign event Monday. This comes just two days after Burger King seemed to egg on the milkshake-throwing protesters, before backtracking and warning customers to ""drink responsibly.""

What's the story?

According to The Guardian, police asked a McDonald's location near a Farage speaking engagement Friday to temporarily stop selling milkshakes. Scott Macdonald, an online coordinator for the Scottish Socialist Party, posted a sign he said was from the McDonald's window that stated, ""We will not be selling milkshakes or ice cream tonight. This is due to a police request given recent events.""

This was in direct response to other members of the U.K.'s political right being pelted with milkshakes by protesters.

In response, Burger King's United Kingdom account tweeted Saturday ""Dear people of Scotland. We're selling milkshakes all weekend. Have fun. Love BK. #justsayin.""



Five-and-a-half hours later, Burger King followed up with a tweet that said, ""We'd never endorse violence — or wasting our delicious milkshakes! So enjoy the weekend and please drink responsibly people.""

The police's efforts failed to keep Farage from being hit with a banana and salted caramel milkshake from Five Guys during a campaign stop in Newcastle, England, on Monday, Fox News reported.

A 32-year-old man named Paul Crowther was arrested in connection with the incident, according to the BBC. Crowther said that when he heard that Farage would be in town, he ""thought this is my only chance."" He was unrepentant, saying that ""the bile and the racism [Farage] spouts out in this country is far more damaging than a bit of milkshake to his front.""

In a tweet Monday morning, Farage said: ""Sadly some remainers have become radicalised, to the extent that normal campaigning is becoming impossible. For a civilised democracy to work you need the losers consent, politicians not accepting the referendum result have led us to this.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bubba-watson-misses-open-championship-covid-exposure,2019-05-20
"Cambridge University rescinds Jordan Peterson’s visiting fellowship after backlash from students, faculty","Cambridge University rescinded Jordan Peterson's offer for a visiting fellowship after students and faculty complained that Peterson wasn't ""inclusive"" enough for their institution, The Guardian reported.

What are the details?

Peterson, a conservative professor, psychologist, and best-selling author from Toronto, was supposed to begin a fellowship in October at Cambridge in the United Kingdom.

Peterson announced the fellowship Monday in a YouTube video. In his announcement, he said, ""In October, I am going to Cambridge University in the U.K. for two months and I will be a visiting fellow there at the divinity school and should give me the opportunity to talk to religious experts of all types for a couple of months, as well as students.""

""It's a thrill for someone academically minded ... to be invited there, to sit in and participate for a few months,"" he added.

The university, however, reversed its decision to extend the fellowship to Peterson because of the backlash the administration received over the offer.

In a Wednesday tweet, the university's Faculty of Divinity wrote, ""Jordan Peterson requested a visiting fellowship at the Faculty of Divinity, and an initial offer has been rescinded after a further review.""

A spokesperson told The Guardian that the school felt that Peterson was apparently unable to ""uphold"" the principles of the school.

""[Cambridge] is an inclusive environment and we expect all our staff and visitors to uphold our principles,"" a spokesperson for the school said in a statement. ""There is no place here for anyone who cannot.""

The Cambridge University student union also issued a statement on the matter.

""We are relieved to hear that Jordan Peterson's request for a visiting fellowship to Cambridge's faculty of divinity has been rescinded following further review,"" the statement read. ""It is a political act to associate the University with an academic's work through offers which legitimise figures such as Peterson.""

""His work and views are not representative of the student body and as such we do not see his visit as a valuable contribution to the University, but one that works in opposition to the principles of the University,"" the statement concluded.

What has Peterson said about this?

Peterson, who often rails against needless political correctness, said he found out that the fellowship offer was reversed through social media.



""It's incomprehensible to me,"" Peterson told the Daily Caller. ""I think it's despicable.""

Peterson added that the move is nothing more than ""cheap, political posturing.""

""I thought collaboration would be in our mutual interest,"" Peterson said. ""Divinity schools are trying desperately hard in the modern world to retain their credibility, authority, and voice, and I don't think there is a phenomena comparable to what happened when I released my lectures on Genesis.""

Peterson noted that his critics would be better served listening to what he actually had to say instead of hopping on a misplaced bandwagon.

“I think if the people that are inspired toward enmity by me spend more time reading what I'm saying and less time parroting the same lies, they'd find they have far less reason to oppose my existence,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/burger-king-conservatives-attacked-with-milkshakes,2019-03-20
Report: Some CDC officials disagree with data behind new mask guidance; more reliable study bucks CDC conclusion,"Some officials inside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reportedly disagree with the public health agency's basis for reversing its face-mask guidance, asserting that data driving the revision is flawed or skewed.



What is the background?



The CDC reversed its mask guidance last week, citing a spike in COVID-19 cases that it attributes to the Delta variant. Whereas CDC guidance had said that fully vaccinated individuals did not have to wear a face mask indoors, the CDC now says that even fully vaccinated Americans in regions with hig- transmission rates of COVID-19 should mask up.

Meanwhile, the CDC has released data that officials claimed show that fully vaccinated people spread COVID-19 as readily as unvaccinated people, pointing to data that allegedly showed similar levels of viral load in vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

What are the officials saying?

According to the Wall Street Journal, some officials inside the CDC disagree with the agency's public communication.

From the WSJ:

The meaning of some of the viral load data has been disputed. Inside the CDC, some officials disagree with the agency's conclusion that vaccinated people who become infected may spread the virus as readily as the unvaccinated, and argue that more testing needs to be done, including tests that measure how infectious virus particles are, according to a person familiar with the matter.

At the center of the issue is the study the CDC released as evidence to justify its mask guidance reversal.

""They're making these decisions on the basis of extremely weak and unreliable data, and at the same time not doing the necessary work to reduce uncertainty among the population,"" Vinay Prasad, a physician and professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, told WSJ. ""When there isn't a lot of study data, the CDC should be conducting these studies.""

The study — centering on a COVID-19 outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts, last month — found that nearly three-quarters of those who became breakthrough cases, meaning they contracted COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated. Because the CDC allegedly found the viral load among infected vaccinated people to be similar to the viral load in unvaccinated people, the CDC concluded that vaccinated people are probably as contagious as unvaccinated people.

But, as TheBlaze reported, that study was ripe with skewed variables. For example, 85% of those infected were male, a statistic that raises eyebrows. But it makes sense considering that an annual gathering of thousands of gay men took place in Provincetown just prior to the outbreak there.

As critics have pointed out, the Provincetown study may be further skewed by a small, but not random, sample size.

Another study reviewing cases in one Wisconsin county found similar results to the CDC's Provincetown study, concluding that vaccinated people are as contagious as unvaccinated people. However, the sample size in that study was anemic at best: just 83 people.

Any legit studies out there?

A recent study conducted by scientists in the United Kingdom may confirm the suspicions of the dissenting CDC officials.

That study, using a sample of about 50,000 vaccinated people, found that vaccinated people are not, in fact, as contagious as unvaccinated people, and do not transmit the Delta variant as readily.

""[Cycle threshold] values among vaccinated people indicate lower infectiousness, consistent with transmission studies conducted when the Alpha variant was dominant, in which vaccinated individuals were at substantially lower risk of passing on infection,"" the paper explained.

As statistician Nate Silver pointed out, the UK study also used a random sample of people, not just people who self-report. This is an important distinction because those people who self-report likely have symptoms (which initiated their self-reporting) and, therefore, a higher viral load than asymptomatic vaccinated people.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cambridge-university-rescinds-jordan-peterson-fellowship,2021-08-04
Top Biden economic adviser actually blames inflation crisis on Biden's 'effective response to the pandemic',"Cecilia Rouse, the top economic adviser to President Joe Biden, suggested this week that Americans are facing an economic crisis because Biden expertly handled the COVID-19 pandemic.

What are the details?

Americans are battling skyrocketing prices across the market in the face of record levels of inflation. But Rouse claimed on CNN's ""New Day"" Tuesday that the crisis is a net positive because adequately addressing the pandemic resulted in these economic woes.

The remarks came after CNN host Brianna Keilar asked Rouse about concerns from some Democrats about Biden's policies. Specifically, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Larry Summers, a top economic adviser to Barack Obama and treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, have attributed the inflation crisis to Biden's spending.

""I wonder, looking back, were Larry Summers and Joe Manchin right about spending and inflation?"" Keilar asked.



Rouse responded that she was ""not sure what the right is"" and charged that economic problems facing Americans today are directly caused by the pandemic. When Keilar asked again, Rouse blamed an ""effective"" pandemic response.

""What we've seen is that all advanced countries are trying to address inflation, and they have historic levels of inflation. That has been the consequence of mounting an effective response to the pandemic,"" Rouse said, ""because while we supported households and businesses, got shots into arms, which allowed people to start to come out of their homes and regain their lives, our supply chains could not support that demand.""

""We are not alone; all advanced countries are addressing with this,"" she reiterated. ""So this is a consequence of having an effective strategy against the pandemic.""

With each passing month, inflation has trended in the wrong direction.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed Wednesday the consumer price index rose 8.3% last month compared to April 2021, which means inflation remains at a near 40-year high. The increase of inflation surpassed the Dow Jones prediction of 8.1%, CNBC reported, and was slightly less than the 8.5% seen in March.

The San Francisco Federal Reserve published a study in late March attributing the inflation crisis, in part, to Biden's spending policies.

""Estimates suggest that fiscal support measures designed to counteract the severity of the pandemic’s economic effect may have contributed to this divergence by raising inflation about 3 percentage points by the end of 2021,"" the study said.

The study also found that inflation is a problem in many developed nations. But the rate of inflation in the U.S. is significantly higher than in those countries.

Because of inflation, Americans should expect to spend an ""extra $5,200 this year ($433 per month) compared to last year for the same consumption basket,"" Bloomberg reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cdc-officials-disagree-mask-guidance-data,2022-05-11

On November 6, the 50-year-old runner, known only as Uncle Chen, completed the Xin’anjiang Marathon in Jiande, a region in eastern China. During and after the 26.2-mile race, several images of Uncle Chen appeared on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, and each image showed Chen either smoking away on a cigarette or lighting up a new one.

Marathon administrators eventually released official times from the race, and Uncle Chen clocked in at a respectable three hours, 28 minutes, and 45 seconds, good enough for 574th place out of 1,500. According to Grayson Weir of sports outlet OutKick, Chen's time is at least an hour faster than the average 50-year-old male marathoner, who usually finishes a race in about four hours and 34 minutes — ""without ripping a full pack of lung darts on the route,"" Weir noted.

Though some have criticized Uncle Chen for exposing himself and others to dangerous carcinogens, Uncle Chen appears to know what he's doing. This is Chen's third marathon since 2018, and he has improved his time with every race. In 2018, he finished in three hours and 36 minutes, and a year later, he finished in three hours and 32 minutes. Now, in 2022, he shaved yet another four minutes off his time, which regular runners know is no small feat.

People around the world have taken to social media to express their appreciation for Uncle Chen's unorthodox methods:

""Could this man be the world's fastest chain smoker?"" tweeted Metro UK.

""A Chinese marathon runner named 'UncleChen' has shocked the running world after being seen chain-smoking during his races,"" wrote Breitbart.

ETimes Lifestyle noted that ""this is not [Chen's] first time! He in an ultra-marathon runner with years of experience in running 50km marathons.""

ETimes Lifestyle is correct. Uncle Chen is not only a marathoner, he's an ultra-marathoner, meaning he regularly runs distances of 30 miles or more. However, Weir reported that Chen is not actually a chain smoker. He's not even a regular smoker. Chen smokes only when he runs, perhaps, Weir speculated, because the nicotine in cigarettes can act as as stimulant.

Aside from his running and smoking habits, not much is known about Uncle Chen, though the New York Post reported that ""Uncle"" Chen is actually a grandfather — and that still images of Chen running and smoking remind writer Ben Cost of ""a health-conscious Edward R. Murrow.""

"Charles Barkley, speaking on race in America, says both parties are 'designed to make us not like each other so they can keep their grasp of money and power'","Outspoken commentator and NBA Hall-of-Famer Charles Barkley spoke out about race relations in America during a Saturday night broadcast before a nationally-televised broadcast of the Final Four game between Gonzaga and UCLA, and his comments were not in line with what many sports commentators and professional athletes have been saying lately.

Saturday was the 53rd anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and during the course of the broadcast, a clip of Robert F. Kennedy's famous speech announcing the assassination was played. Reacting to the moving speech, Barkley said, ""Man, I think most white people and black people are great people.""

""I really believe that in my heart,"" Barkley continued. ""But I think our system is set up where our politicians, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, are designed to make us not like each other, so they can keep their grasp of money and power. They divide and conquer.

""I truly believe in my heart most white people and black people are awesome people. But we are so stupid, following our politicians, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, and their only job is, 'Hey, let's make these people not like each other. We don't live in their neighborhoods. We all got money. Let's make the whites and blacks not like each other, let's make rich people and poor people not like each other, let's scramble the middle class.' I truly believe that in my heart.""

Barkley, an Alabama native, has toyed with the idea of a political career in the past. In 2008, he seriously considered running for governor of his home state of Alabama as a Democrat. Since then, every electoral cycle, he has faced rumors that he will seriously enter the political fray. Last year, in two separate interviews, he attempted to put those rumors to rest for good as he unloaded on both political parties, and saved special scorn for Democrats.

""I think both of these political parties are crap,"" Barkley told ESPN reporter Zach Lowe in a podcast last year. ""They do nothing for actual people. The Democrats and Republicans are both full of crap. You see now with this pandemic. They aren't doing anything for these people.""

Later, in an interview with University of Kentucky basketball coach John Calipari, Barkley said, ""I've been a Democrat all my life. I just realized now they have done an awful job of taking care of poor people. They make the same boasts every four years, come to the black community and (say) they're going to make things better. But they don't really make things better. I'm still a Democrat, but I don't fall for stupidity.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chain-smoking-uncle-lights-up-the-competition-at-yet-another-marathon-impressing-keyboard-runners-on-social-media-everywhere,2021-04-04
Children as young as 3 could soon get sex change advice from a doctor via Skype in the UK,"The United Kingdom's National Health Service is considering a plan that would allow patients, including young children, to consult with a doctor about gender transition remotely via video conference services, according to the Daily Mail.

A clinic in the U.K. that evaluates patients for potential gender transition treatments has seen an increase in patient volume of more than 400 percent since 2013, resulting in a waiting list of about two years. More than 2,500 children were referred to the clinic just last year, including some 3- and 4-year olds.

In order to deal with the volume, the clinic is considering a plan for patients to be able to consult with a doctor using services such as Skype or Apple's Facetime function, allowing doctors to diagnose and prescribe gender transition issues and treatments such as hormone therapy remotely.

The Daily Mail reported that the clinic has already faced criticism ""from psychologists who say it uses untested drugs on troubled children and 'rushes' them toward becoming transgender.""

The Gender Identity Development Service, run by an NHS trust, is advocating for the necessity of remote consultations for gender confusion issues.

""The Trust is working to minimize waiting times and make clinical support easier to access, including eliminating travel time for young people and their families, which will also allow us to offer appointments earlier and later in the day,"" a spokesman said. ""As with the rest of the NHS, innovations like telemedicine are an addition and will not mean the removal or inability to access face-to-face consultations.

""The Trust and GIDS welcome all open and informed discussion and decision-making around the best way to support young people experiencing difficulties or distress around their gender identity,"" the statement continued.

The statement did not address concerns about the ability of a medical professional to accurately diagnose gender confusion or dysphoria remotely, particularly in young children who may not even have fully formed concepts of gender.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/charles-barkley-speaking-on-race-in-america-says-both-parties-are-designed-to-make-us-not-like-each-other-so-they-can-keep-their-grasp-of-money-and-power,2019-08-27
"Children reportedly using fake IDs to share disturbing, explicit sexual content on OnlyFans","Children as young as 13 years old are reportedly using fake IDs to sell explicit content on OnlyFans, allegedly ""tricking"" the adults-only site's age verification system.

The BBC reported that OnlyFans requires all applicants to ""pose next to an ID card and then submit a photograph holding it up to their face."" The age verification system in place, however, ""failed to distinguished between [fakes] at any stage of the process.""

What are the details?

According to the report, law enforcement officials and child protective services agents received reports of children as young as 13 saying that they were able to use the site to share explicit content of themselves.

The news agency found that children under the age of 18 were able to set up accounts using fake IDs or identification cards belonging to family members.

According to the Daily Mail, a 14-year-old girl was able to set up an account using her grandmother's passport and bank details, and a 17-year-old was able to sell videos of herself performing sex acts and using sex toys by using faked credentials.

""The teenager used a fake ID to set up her account and in one week received £5,000 [approximately $7,100] in payments from the site, prompting the bank to freeze her account,"" the Daily Mail reported. ""There have also been reports of underage girls participating in videos on adult accounts in the U.S. which is against the company's terms and conditions.""

The outlet also reported that children as young as 12 years old were ""using the site to contact ... adult content creators and asking to meet up.""

One child told the U.K.'s Childline, ""I don't wanna talk about the types of pictures I post on there, and I know it's not appropriate for kids my age to be doing this, but it's an easy way to make money. Some of the girls have thousands of followers on Instagram and they must be raking it in — I wanna be just like them.""

The BBC reported, ""Schools have shared anonymous reports of pupils using the site, including a 16-year-old who boasted to her careers adviser about the amount of money she made on the site, and showed off her 'exuberant' spending on Instagram.""

""Underage creators and users of the site include victims of prior sexual abuse and those with mental health issues and suicidal thoughts, according to Childline counsellor notes,"" the report said.

Chief Constable Simon Bailey — the U.K.'s national lead for child protection policing — said that it is ""increasingly clear"" that children are using the site.

""The company is not doing enough to put in place the safeguards that prevent children exploiting the opportunity to generate money, but also for children to be exploited,"" Bailey insisted.

Missing children linked to OnlyFans

The BBC also reports that missing kids are ""increasingly being linked to OnlyFans videos,"" according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

""In 2019 there were around a dozen children known to be missing being linked with content on OnlyFans,"" NCMEC Vice President Staca Shehan told the outlet. ""Last year the number of those cases nearly tripled.""

The news organization added, ""While much of the content on OnlyFans featuring children involves teenagers uploading their own content, NCMEC says it is also finding evidence of child sexual exploitation and trafficking.""



OnlyFans speaks out

In a statement on the investigation, a spokesperson for OnlyFans said, ""OnlyFans is a subscription based social media platform for all content creators with over 120 million users. As it is paid social media, users have to be over the age of 18 to access the site. We have a team that manually reviews every application.""

Chilean 'tourists' responsible for hundreds of burglaries in the US,"Law enforcement agencies are sounding the alarm over a growing trend: Chilean crime syndicates taking advantage of visa waivers for ""burglary tourism."" Authorities believe the sophisticated operations are responsible for ""hundreds and hundreds"" of heists across the U.S., resulting in losses totaling millions of dollars.

What are the details?

Officials are working to determine how many people are involved in the rings, but methodical patterns have emerged linking Chilean nationals to a crime circuit with international scope. According to the Daily Mail, the root of the operations have ""been linked to a corruption scandal in the Chilean capital Santiago, involving bribes to police.""

""There are many Chileans who, being criminals here, travel abroad because they can obtain better treasures,"" Chilean journalist Javiera Rodriguez told the Los Angeles Times. ""In addition, they are very ingenious and create new forms of theft.""



The perpetrators use innovative, signature tactics for jamming car key fobs so they won't lock, disabling or circumventing security systems, and disguising their identities with fake documentation even when they are caught. Their efforts appear to be worth it, too; more than $1 million in jewelry was lifted during a single Chilean-linked raid in California last month. An LAPD captain said it's not uncommon for homeowners to lose $30,000 or $40,000 worth of property if they become victims of the gangs.

In Ventura County, California, such thefts by tourist burglars are ""in the hundreds and hundreds,"" Sheriff's Detective Theodore Stern told the Times. ""It's a huge issue. They're taking advantage of our immigration laws. Officers are working hard to catch these guys.""

While Southern California has become a popular target for the malicious visitors seeking easy-pickings of luxury goods, dozens of Chilean ""tourists"" are believed to be responsible for home, vehicle, and business invasions across the U.S. The problem has been flagged by law enforcement in several other states, including Texas, Arizona, Colorado, and New York.

Anything else?

Chilean ""tourist"" gangs have also been blamed for recent waves of burglaries across England, Canada, and Australia. Not only have the operatives earned a reputation for their savvy stealing, they are adept at using visas to legally enter wealthy nations and freely pillage for months.

In spite of their elusive ways, dozens of Chilean suspects have been apprehended in what officials say are widespread, well-coordinated gangs of professionals. Law enforcement agencies across the globe are taking notice, while calling for more stringent background checks on tourists entering their countries.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/children-fake-id-explicit-content-onlyfans,2019-04-25
China mandates anal swab COVID-19 tests for all foreign arrivals after US slams exam as 'undignified',"China has decided to require international travelers entering the country to undergo anal swab procedures to test for COVID-19, a method the communist nation insists is more accurate than other on-the-spot mechanisms for detecting the disease.

The Times out of the UK reported Wednesday that China has now made the tests ""compulsory,"" in a move the newspaper says deepened ""a row with other countries over a practice many have described as humiliating.""

What are the details?

According to the New York Post, the Times claims that ""as part of the new travel requirement, there will be testing hubs in Beijing and Shanghai airports."" The Sun reported that ""the procedure involved inserting a cotton swab about three to five centimeters into the anus and gently rotating it.""

Beijing insists that anal swabs are more accurate than nasal or throat swab tests.

Li Tongzeng, a Chinese respiratory and infectious disease expert, explained to the media last month that the anal swabbing can ""avoid missing infections as virus traces are detectable for a longer time than the more common COVID tests used in the mouth and nose.""

As TheBlaze previously reported, Li insisted at the time ""that the tests were only necessary for certain populations, such as those under quarantine orders.""

But the news of the widespread mandate comes after the United States and Japan issued separate complaints to China after diplomats from both nations were forced to provide fecal samples via the invasive method.

American diplomats cry foul

Last week, the U.S. State Department protested to China's Minister of Foreign Affairs after American diplomats cried foul over being subjected to anal swab tests, which ""Washington has slammed as 'undignified,' according to The Sun.

The Chinese Communist Party has denied that it subjected American diplomats to rectal probing, but then Japan complained this week that the anal swabs were conducted on their diplomats upon entry to China.

Katsunobu Kato, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, said during a news conference, ""Some Japanese reported to our embassy in China that they received anal swab tests, which caused a great psychological pain.""

However, Chinese physician Lu Hongzhou suggested on state-run media that foreigners do have an alternative to the swab test upon arrival in the country: providing a stool sample.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chilean-tourists-responsible-for-hundreds-of-burglaries-in-the-us,2021-03-04
"Report: Chinese communists operating covert police operations in the US, Canada, and Europe","Chinese communist agents are reportedly conducting extralegal and clandestine policing operations across the globe to intimidate and hunt down persons wanted by Beijing. The United States, Canada, and Europe are among the countries home to the CCP ""police service stations"" involved in this work.

According to a new report, these police stations, while purportedly created to combat fraud, are a means to extend the genocidal communist regime's influence and powers of ""transnational repression."" This confirms the acceleration of a well-documented trend of the communist power infringing upon the ""rights and freedoms of overseas Chinese and minority communities in exile.""

Parallel policing mechanisms

Safeguard Defenders, a European pan-Asian human rights NGO, issued a September report entitled ""110 Overseas: Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild,"" detailing how the communist Chinese regime has employed ""overseas police service stations"" on five continents.

On January 22, Liu Rongyan, director of the Overseas Chinese Police Office of the Public Security Bureau in Fuzhou City, announced that the ""first batch"" of 30 overseas police services in 25 cities across 21 countries had been opened. There are now reportedly 54 such CCP-backed centers.



There are allegedly one station in New York, three in Toronto, and dozens across Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia.

Whereas China contends that these stations serve expats in the capacity of micro-consulates, aiding with administrative tasks (e.g., filing police reports or renewing drivers' licenses), Safeguard Defenders indicated that the primary function of these forward operating bases is instead to compel persons to return to China whenever the regime has determined them to have broken Chinese law.

""These operations eschew official bilateral police and judicial cooperation and violate international law,"" said the report. Furthermore, they may ""violate the territorial integrity of third countries involved in setting up a parallel policing mechanism using illegal methods.""

The development of these centers occurred alongside the CCP's campaign to intimidate and extort Chinese nationals and expats to return to China to face criminal proceedings. Between April 2021 and July 2022, communist authorities claimed 230,000 nationals were ""persuaded to return.""

Safeguard Defenders identified two methods frequently used to prompt nationals to return.

First, CCP agents track down a target's family in China ""in order to pressure them through means of intimidation, harassment, detention or imprisonment into persuading their family members to return 'voluntarily'.""

Second, CCP agents or proxies are dispatched to threaten and harass the target into returning ""voluntarily.""

For proxies and willing co-conspirators, Freedom House reported last year that communist officials rely upon ""a broader framework of influence that encompasses cultural associations, diaspora groups, and in some cases, organized crime networks.""

The Safeguard Defenders report stressed that these methods and the stations that may provide support to their executors leave ""legal Chinese residents abroad fully exposed to extra-legal targeting by the Chinese police, with little to none of the protection theoretically ensured under both national and international law.""

Chinese authorities claim that the hundreds of thousands of people persuaded to return to China were suspected of fraud and telecom fraud; however, there have been recent indications that such intimidation campaigns have been utilized against political dissidents, religious minorities, and refugees fleeing communist oppression.

Growing infrastructure of repression

Pastor Pan Yongguan and 61 Christian congregants belonging to the Shenzhen Holy Reformed Church fled China in 2019, seeking refugee from communist persecution. Yongguan's family, who remained in China were penalized as a result of his actions.

Pressure was similarly applied to other congregants' families (e.g., a newborn's legal status was denied by authorities), with the expectation that the expats would return to face charges of treason and ""collusion with foreign forces.""

Although Yongguan suggested CCP agents were stalking him in Thailand, he has not yet been captured. Other targets of the CCP who fled to countries with closer Chinese ties were, however, quickly apprehended.

For instance, many of the estimated 1,500 ethnic Muslim Uyghurs who were hunted down and detained in the Near East and North Africa have been extradited back to China.

A 2021 Freedom House report stated, ""China conducts the most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world."" The CCP ""targets many groups, including multiple ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, human rights activists, journalists, and former insiders accused of corruption.""

It may be expedient for the communists to accuse those in these groups instead of fraud, the alleged focus of their foreign police service stations.

Regardless of the accusation, the tactics utilized are the same, ranging from ""direct attacks like renditions, to co-opting other countries to detain and render exiles, to mobility controls, to threats from a distance like digital threats, spyware, and coercion by proxy.""

American operations

While New York City may be the only known American location of a CCP police service station administered by the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau, there is nevertheless a great deal of communist interference and intimidation nationwide.

In September 2020, NYPD officer and U.S. Army reservist Baimadajie Angwang (of Tibetan descent) was allegedly conscripted by Chinese officials to spy on the Tibetan community in New York City on behalf of the communist regime. He was charged with acting as an illegal agent of the CCP as well as committing wire fraud, making false statements, and obstructing an official proceeding.



In October 2020, eight illegal Chinese agents were charged for surveilling, locating, and intimidating targets of the CCP. They intended to coerce their targets back to China, where ""they would face certain imprisonment or worse following illegitimate trials.""

On July 7, five men including one current and one former Department of Homeland Security agent, Craig Miller and Derrick Taylor, were indicted for crimes related to a communist Chinese transnational repression scheme to silence critics of the regime.

On September 26, a Chinese national, 31-year-old Ji Chaoqun, was found guilty of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government. The former U.S. Army reservist had informed on individuals targeted for recruitment to the Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security. These individuals included other Chinese nationals operating as engineers and scientists in the U.S.

Governments looking the other way

The Globe and Mail reported that one of the three CCP stations allegedly operating in Toronto was the office belonging to the Canada Toronto FuQing Business Association. This association was reportedly ""established 'under the guidance' of a number of Chinese and Fujianese government organizations, including a municipal committee of the United Front Work Department, the body that projects the Chinese Communist Party's influence overseas.""

It remains unclear whether these alleged communist police service stations operate ""with the imprimatur or even knowledge of the host government.""

Camille Boily-Lavoie, a spokesman for the RCMP, told the Globe that the federal police force was aware that ""foreign states may seek to intimidate or harm communities or individuals within Canada.""

According to the National Post, dissidents targeted by the CCP have long warned Canadian authorities of organized harassment by communist agents.

Canadian critics of the CCP's genocide of Uyghurs in Xinjiang have been targeted by CCP proxies in harassment campaigns.

Cherie Wong, for instance, faced rape and death threats from communist activists in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Wong indicated that critics of the CCP and its murderous policies can expect their family members back in China to get a threatening ""tea visit"" from Chinese officials.

Chinese dissident Shen Xue, who moved to Canada fleeing communist persecution, was allegedly threatened by CCP agents in Toronto. ""I thought that I escaped from the fear,"" she said. ""But I realized that they are here, their people, their network, their power, and everything is here.""

In light of a cabinet letter, the House of Commons is reportedly ""aware that foreign states, including the People's Republic of China or its proxies, may attempt to harass, threaten and intimidate Canadians, persons residing in Canada or their families, in Canada or abroad.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who publicly stated that he admired China's ""basic dictatorship,"" was warned last year by Canada's spy agency that the communist Chinese interference campaigns ""have become normalized.""

The Canadian Coalition on Human Rights in China called the Trudeau government's response to communist interference and influence campaigns weak and ""piecemeal at best, and, more often, unsatisfactory and ineffective at identifying and addressing the sources of these violations.""

The group stated that ""many individuals fear that Chinese government or consular agents are monitoring their speech or their activities. ... Chinese state actors have almost certainly become emboldened by the inadequate responses of Canadian officials.""

Charles Burton, a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, called the presence of the CCP police stations in Toronto ""an outrage.""

""Chinese police setting up offices in Canada, then 'persuading' alleged criminals to return to the motherland to face 'justice' — while our own government and security services apparently choose to look the other way — represents a gross violation of Canada's national sovereignty, international law and the norms of diplomacy,"" he wrote.

Burton added, ""China is extending the grip of its Orwellian police state into this country.""

It's not just Canada that has permitted CCP agents to put up shop.

According to the Italian publication Il Foglio, there is a ""Fuzhou Overseas Police Station"" in the Tuscan city of Prato. Some Chinese expats reportedly use the station as an alternative to a legitimate Italian court, much like the Sharia law courts that operate extralegally in Britain.

The communist-linked police station is reportedly ""not of particular concern"" to the real Italian police because it ""only deals with administrative practices and not public security.""

According to the Safeguard Defenders report, there are communist Chinese-linked police stations in the following British, European, and Balkan countries: The Netherlands; Ireland; Portugal; Czech Republic; Hungary; Italy; France; Germany; Slovakia; Austria; Ukraine; Serbia; Sweden; Spain; Scotland; England; and Greece.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-mandates-anal-swab-covid-19-tests-for-all-foreign-arrivals,2022-09-30
British supermarket pulls chocolate ducklings from store inventory after complaints of racism,"U.K. supermarket Waitrose has issued an apology after selling chocolate ducklings that many people said promoted racism.

What are the details?

According to a Tuesday report by CNN International, the item in question featured three chocolate ducklings in milk, white, and dark chocolate varieties. The three ducklings were named, respectively, ""Crispy,"" ""Fluffy,"" and ""Ugly.""

One social media user pointed out the store's apparent gaffe, and wrote, ""Crispy, Fluffy and Ugly — trio of Easter ducklings at #waitrose. Ugly is the dark one on the right. Overheard women saying 'this is not right', I agree, doesn't look good at all. Thousands of other options... why #ugly?????""

Another user wrote, ""Yeh, definitely a balance to be found with identity politics and colour blindness. Chocolate ducks seem silly but for me I feel showing 3 shades of light to dark where the dark is labeled ""ugly"" is a problem, no matter the object. I guess I just wanted people to understand why.""

What else?

A spokesperson for the store told CNN International that they did not mean to cause offense in selling the Easter-themed item.

The statement read, ""We are very sorry for any upset caused by the name of this product, it was absolutely not our intention to cause any offence. We removed the product from sale several weeks ago while we changed the labeling and our ducklings are now back on sale.""

On Tuesday, the Daily Mail reported that the store did restock the items both online and in stores after changing the packaging and marketing. The new product simply reads ""Waitrose Trio of Easter ducklings,"" with no mention of ""Fluffy,"" ""Crispy,"" or ""Ugly.""

Christian mom tells gay man on morning TV that homosexuality is a choice. Social media lashes out in response.,"A Christian mom told a gay man that she believes homosexuality is a choice, and social media users roasted her for her stance.

What are the details?

The mom — Izzy Montague of South London — appeared on ITV's ""Good Morning Britain"" Thursday, where she sat with Tom Cox, a gay father and blogger.

According to the Daily Mail, the two were going head-to-head over the teaching of LGBT lessons in schools. Most notably, schools in Birmingham recently suspended lessons on LGBT relationships after Muslim parents and leaders protested.

Montague said that she didn't believe schools should teach children such lessons, but Cox disagreed, saying that not teaching LGBT lessons on diversity will harm kids in the long run.

The Christian mom countered that her beliefs prevented her from having a homosexual relationship and explained that she never even questioned whether she was gay or straight because of those beliefs. She added that she believes homosexuality is a choice.

Cox, however, insisted that people are born into their sexual preferences.

""I think you're doing a child a disservice by not allowing them to have that education to see that families come in all different shapes and sizes,"" he said. ""We live in such a diverse time. Gay people are everywhere, so they're going to get on a bus and that bus driver is going to be gay.

""They're going to be served food in a restaurant by a gay woman, a gay person may be delivering your child's baby one day,"" Cox added. ""We are everywhere.""

Montague insisted that she's not teaching her child to be ignorant — she simply wants to have a say over their education.

""What makes you think that my child is going around in a world thinking that nobody is gay?"" she asked. ""I never said that I would not teach my child. I'm Christian, so we have our own ways of teaching about the world. It's not about living in a vacuum. It's not about saying 'This person doesn't exist,' it's nothing like that. It's our opinions of the world around us.""



Montague later revealed that she doesn't believe that people are born gay.

""I don't agree with that you're born, you know, anything, no,"" Montague said. ""Of course, I believe it's a choice. I've made a choice on what I think is right or wrong. I don't remember ever thinking to myself 'Am I gay, am I straight?' It's something that I have done based on how I believe.""

She added, ""Even if I was gay, I do personally believe — based on my belief — that I feel that a heterosexual relationship is the right course of action for me.""

What was the response to her remarks?

Montague's interaction with Cox was reasonable and fair, with both sides hearing out the other's point of view, but social media took her to the woodshed for her Christian beliefs.

Many users called her ""homophobic"" and ""bigoted,"" while others simply called her beliefs outdated.

The Daily Mail reported that Montague received heavy criticism from viewers on Twitter.

One person wrote, ""Wow, lost for words with this debate. Who in their right mind would choose to be gay with the amount of hate and abuse they would endure?""

Another attacked Montague directly and said, ""Wow, this woman's views are absolutely disgusting to say people who are gay have a choice. The more she talks the more I dislike her. She is blatantly homophobic!""

Others did stand up for Montague and express their gratitude for staying true to her beliefs, but the majority of social media users discussing the segment did not take to Montague's stances kindly.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chocolate-easter-ducklings-pulled-over-compaints-of-racism,2019-03-21
Christian nurse who was taught critical race theory in UK sues NHS for 'forcing racist ideology' on students,"A Christian nurse in the United Kingdom is suing a health clinic in North London, claiming the National Health Service-affiliated organization is ""forcing racist ideology"" on students.

The nurse, Amy Gallagher, claims that the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust has discriminated against her on the basis of race and religion because she refuses to accept the teachings of critical race theory.



""They are forcing Critical Race Theory onto people - you're not allowed to disagree with it, or they will bully you for two years,” Gallagher, a second year student in the trust's forensic psychology program, told the Telegraph in an interview.

The 33-year-old nurse has objected to course lectures that have emphasized ""the reality of white privilege,"" including an Oct. 2020 lecture titled, ""whiteness — a problem of our time."" Gallagher also claimed that a lecturer told her ""Christianity is racist because it is European,"" which offended her as a white Christian woman.

She further claims she has suffered from victimization and harassment because because of her ""lack of belief"" in doctrines of critical race theory — a school of thought that claims racism is institutional in Western Civilization and that the foundations of classical liberalism are rooted in the oppression of non-white people. Gallagher filed her lawsuit against the trust in January of last year.



“I'm bringing this legal case to protect my career but it's also the first test of woke ideology in the courts. The NHS is forcing someone to adopt a racist ideology and it needs to be stopped,"" Gallagher said.

According to The Telegraph, her case escalated in March this year when an external speaker at the trust complained to the Nursing and Midwifery Council, alleging that Gallagher could not work with ""diverse populations"" and had ""inflicted race-based harm.""

Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust CEO Paul Jenkins has reportedly said his organization ""has committed itself to an explicit ambition of becoming an anti-racist organization.""

Gallagher is crowdfunding to support her lawsuit. As of Monday, she has raised more than £36,000, roughly $41,000, on GoFundMe.

A legal expert told the Telegraph that Gallagher's case is unique because of her ""lack of belief"" argument.

""The ‘lack of belief’ draws attention to something that people are not talking about in the free speech world in the West, which I think is covered by the Equality Act under lack of belief, which is you have the right not to be forced to sign up a set of values or ideology with which you do not agree,"" Dr. Anna Loutfi said. Loutfi is an equality and human rights barrister with King's College London.

“It’s quite one thing to censor somebody for wanting to say things that people find objectionable or offensive, but it’s really another thing substantively to force somebody to articulate a view that they do not hold, as if they hold it. That is what has happened to Amy,” Loutfi explained.

A spokesman for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust declined to comment on pending litigation to the Telegraph.

“We cannot comment on an ongoing legal case. As a trust, we have made a public commitment to work to become an anti-racist organization,” the spokesman said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-mom-on-tv-homosexuality-is-a-choice,2022-10-03
Christian school fires pastoral assistant for petitioning against transgender lessons at her young son's school,"A Christian school in Britain fired a pastoral assistant who posted online her objections to the transgender lessons being taught at her son's Church of England school.



The Farmor's School in Fairford, Gloucestershire, fired Kristie Higgs after she urged her Facebook followers to sign a petition against the government's relationships and sex education, which goes into effect in September 2020. The United Kingdom Department of Education's new guidelines dubbed ""No Outsiders"" would require children as young as 5 to receive LGBT lessons about relationships and gender reassignment.

On Tuesday, a disciplinary panel dismissed the 43-year-old mother, who worked at a separate school from the primary school her young son attended, after it found her guilty of ""gross misconduct"" and ""illegal discrimination,"" the Christian Legal Centre said in a press release.

What did she write on Facebook?

Higgs wrote on her personal Facebook page that children are being brainwashed by educators. She asked other parents to sign the petition that she shared.

""Please sign this petition, they have already started to brainwash our innocent wonderfully created children and its [sic] happening in our local primary school now,"" she wrote, according to a press release the Christian Legal Centre sent to TheBlaze.

""Which means, for example, that children will be taught that all relationships are valid and 'normal,' so that same sex marriage is exactly the same as traditional marriage, and that gender is a matter of choice, not biology, so that it's up to them what sex they are,"" Higgs wrote.

""At the same time it means that expressing and teaching fundamental Christian beliefs, relating to the creation of men and women and marriage, will in practice become forbidden — because they conflict with the new morality and are seen as indoctrination into unacceptable religious bigotry,"" Higgs added.

In a separate post, the mother of two also voiced her objections to a pair of children's books at her son's school which feature LGBT stories. One story is about a boy who wants to wear a dress and the other is about a red crayon that learns it's really a blue crayon.

The panel determined Tuesday that Higgs' comments ""could bring the school into disrepute and damage the reputation of the school,"" according to the press release.



Higgs had worked at the secondary school for six years before her firing. Her employee record was unblemished up to her firing.

Was she fired because of her Christian beliefs?

Higgs, who is challenging her firing, said she believes she was fired because of her Christian faith and beliefs. She is represented by the Christian Legal Centre.



""I have been punished for sharing concerns about Relationships and Sex Education. I hold these views because of my Christian beliefs, beliefs and views which are shared by hundreds of thousands of parents across the UK,"" she said in a statement via Christian Legal Centre. ""My number one concern has always been the effect that learning about sex and gender in school will have on children at such a young age.""

""As soon as the investigation into the posts began I was repeatedly told: 'this is nothing to do with your religion.' That was clearly a legal tactic and of course it has everything to do with my religion,"" she continued. ""I am determined to fight this case and to stand for Christians and all parents across the country who are being silenced for sharing and holding these views.""

The school claims it received a single email complaint about Higgs' comments. The complainant accused the woman of ""posting homophobic and prejudiced views.""

""We concluded that no action was taken because of your religion,"" the disciplinary panel said, according to the Christian Legal Centre. ""The disciplinary occurred for reasons other than your religion.""



""As an inclusive employer, Farmor's school recognizes and protects the statutory rights of its staff,"" the panel said. ""Such rights however are not absolute and we are concerned that you did not demonstrate an appropriate understanding of the school's requirement to respect and tolerate the views of others and to role model such behavior.""

The panel admitted that no damage had occurred to the school because of Higgs' Facebook posts.

""Regarding bringing the school into disrepute … we agree that there is no direct evidence that as a matter of fact that the reputation of the school has been damaged to date,"" the panel said in its decision.

What else?

Muslim parents at a Birmingham school have also protested against the ""No Outsiders"" program, which some have called indoctrination.

""This is nothing but indoctrination of our children,"" Razina Mahmood, 40, told the Sun in an earlier interview. ""You are using our children as an experiment.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-nurse-sues-nhs-crt,2019-04-17
Report: Christians are most persecuted religious group in the world,"Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world, according to an interim British report.

The Anglican Bishop of Truro the Right Rev. Philip Mounstephen recently published an overview of his findings that showed the persecution of Christians in some parts of the world has neared genocide levels.

""Evidence shows not only the geographic spread of anti-Christian persecution, but also its increasing severity,"" the Bishop wrote. ""In some regions, the level and nature of persecution is arguably coming close to meeting the international definition of genocide, according to that adopted by the UN.""



An estimated ""80% of persecuted religious believers are Christians,"" according to Mountstephen.

The findings come after 359 people were killed and more than 500 wounded in attacks at hotels and churches in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday.

Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt ordered the report in late December. A full report of the findings are expected in June. The situation in Europe and Eurasia remain to be analyzed, Mountstephen wrote.

What are the details?

The findings estimated that about 1 in 3 people around the world are persecuted for their faith with Christians being the most mistreated group.

""Though it is impossible to know the exact numbers of people persecuted for their faith, based on reports from different NGOs, it is estimated that one-third of the world's population suffers from religious persecution in some form, with Christians being the most persecuted group,"" the report read.

In some areas of the Middle East, Christianity has declined dramatically in recent years and the faith is at risk of disappearing entirely, the bishop warned.

The main impact of such genocidal acts against Christians is exodus. Christianity now faces the possibility of being wiped-out in parts of the Middle East where its roots go back furthest.



In Palestine, Christian numbers are below 1.5 percent; in Syria the Christian population has declined from 1.7 million in 2011 to below 450,000 and in Iraq, Christian numbers have slumped from 1.5 million before 2003 to below 120,000 today.



Christianity is at risk of disappearing, representing a massive setback for plurality in the region.

What has caused the discrimination against Christians?

Hunt told BBC News that he believe the atmosphere of political correctness among governments could be part of the problem.

""What we have forgotten in that atmosphere of political correctness is actually the Christians that are being persecuted are some of the poorest people on the planet,"" he told the news outlet.

""I think there is a misplaced worry that it is somehow colonialist to talk about a religion that was associated with colonial powers rather than the countries that we marched into as colonizers,"" he added.

What else?

Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, told BBC that Jews could empathize with Christians who are persecuted.

""Whether it is in authoritarian regimes, or bigotry masked in the mistaken guise of religion, reports like the one launched today remind us that there are many places in which Christians face appalling levels of violence, abuse and harassment,"" she said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-school-fires-employee-for-petitioning-against-transgender-lessons,2019-05-03
Middle Ages food and drink of Medieval Christmas feast,"The word ""Christmas"" was first recorded in 1038, and it comes from the word ""Cristes Maesse,"" meaning ""Christ's mass."" The church in Rome formally began celebrating Christmas on December 25 in A.D. 336.

The four Sundays leading up to Christmas is the season of Advent – a solemn time of prayer and fasting. While modern Christmas festivities last one day, celebrations lasted for 12 days during the Middle Ages. Christians in medieval Europe would hold elaborate festivities with sumptuous feasts and roisterous activities starting on Christmas and lasting until Epiphany on January 6 – where they commemorated the arrival of the Magi after the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem.

""In the Early Middle Ages, Christmas was not as popular as Epiphany on 6 January, the celebration of the visit from the three kings or wise men, the Magi, to the baby Jesus bearing gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh,"" according to Historic UK. ""Indeed, Christmas was not originally seen as a time for fun and frolics but an opportunity for quiet prayer and reflection during a special mass. But by the High Middle Ages (1000-1300) Christmas had become the most prominent religious celebration in Europe, signaling the beginning of Christmastide, or the Twelve Days of Christmas as they are more commonly known today.""

Christmas feast with a boar's head

Boar's head was arguably the most coveted Christmas food – for those who could afford it.

""The boar's head was the heart of the medieval feast for England's elite,"" according to English Heritage. ""As a desired target of the great medieval hunt, the boar was considered difficult to catch and kill, and therefore worthy of esteem; indeed, boar in royal forests were protected by specific laws since at least the 12th century.""

The boar's head was so beloved during the holiday feast that there is a Christmas carol celebrating the swine aptly titled: ""Boar's Head Carol.""

The boar’s head in hand bring I,

Bedeck'd with bays and rosemary.

I pray you, my masters, be merry01

Quot estis in convivio02

Caput apri defero

2. The boar's head, as I understand,

Is the rarest dish in all this land,

Medieval Christmas menu

""For a Christmas dinner held at the Reading Abbey in 1226, King Henry III ordered 40 salmon, heaps of venison and boar meat, and 'as many lampreys as possible,'"" History.com noted. ""Henry V, who ruled in the early 1400s, included even more exotic delicacies on his Christmas menu like crayfish, eels and porpoise.""

On Dec. 25, 1406, Richard Mitford – Bishop of Salisbury – entertained 96 people who enjoyed a special carnivorous Christmas dinner of ""half a cow, three sheep, 24 rabbits, a pig, half a wild boar, seven piglets, two swans, two woodcocks, four mallard ducks, 20 snipes (long-beaked wading birds that bleat like goats), 10 capons (castrated cockerels), and three teal ducks.""



Other foods on the medieval Christmas menu include venison, pease pudding, mincemeat pies, and even peacock.

""During the Medieval ages, some wealthy Europeans dined on peacock at Christmas dinner. The colorful, plumed bird was often baked into a pie, or roasted with its head and tail still intact. Adding to the flamboyant display, the peacock’s feathers were reattached (or the skinned bird was placed back inside its intact skin), and its tail feathers were fully fanned out,"" Mental Floss reported. However, the meat was said to be ""tough and coarse.""



Christmas spirits for the Middle Ages

The 12-day celebration not only had food but also drink. The wealthy enjoyed wine while everyone indulged in ale.

A popular Christmastime adult beverage was a spiced wine called ""hippocras.""

""One thing that comes out very clearly is that drinking was as important as eating, if not more so,"" Anne Lawrence-Mathers – a historian at the University of Reading in the U.K., where she specializes in medieval England – told History.com, which added, ""In just one year, Henry III ordered 60 tons of wine for Reading Abbey with one ton being equal to 1,272 bottles.""



English Heritage noted, ""In 1296, 2½ sesters of wine were consumed on Christmas day at Goodrich Castle: this amounts to between 84 and 120 modern wine bottles.""

The outlet added, ""For most festive revelers, however, including those outside the privileged occupiers of high tables in the kingdom’s castles, abbeys, great houses and manorial centers, the choice of beverage was limited to ale, and from about the 16th century, beer.""

Christmas revelers would go wassailing – a tradition of drinking a spiced mead or hot mulled apple cider drink from a giant bowl and go door-to-door singing carols.

""At Christmastime, the poor expected privileges denied them at other times, including the right to enter the homes of the wealthy, who feasted them from the best of their provisions,"" Robert Doares – an instructor at Colonial Williamsburg – told Mental Floss. ""The poor would either ask to sip from their rich neighbor’s wassailing bowl or would bring their own bowl, asking for it to be filled. According to Doares, “At these gatherings, the bands of roving wassailers often performed songs for the master while drinking his beer, toasting him, his family, his livestock, wishing continued health and wealth.""

There is a Christmas carol ""Here We Come a-Wassailing,"" which gives insight into the tradition.

Here we come a-wassailing

Among the leaves so green;

Here we come a-wand’ring

So fair to be seen.

Chorus:

Love and joy come to you,

And to you your wassail too;

And God bless you and send you

A Happy New Year

And God send you a Happy New Year.

Our wassail cup is made

Of the rosemary tree,

And so is your beer

Of the best barley.

(Chorus)

We are not daily beggars

That beg from door to door;

But we are neighbours' children,

Whom you have seen before.

(Chorus)

Good master and good mistress,

While you're sitting by the fire,

Pray think of us poor children

Who are wandering in the mire.

(Chorus)



We have a little purse

Made of ratching leather skin;

We want some of your small change

To line it well within.

(Chorus)

Call up the butler of this house,

Put on his golden ring.

Let him bring us up a glass of beer,

And better we shall sing.

(Chorus)

Bring us out a table

And spread it with a cloth;

Bring us out a mouldy cheese,

And some of your Christmas loaf.

(Chorus)

God bless the master of this house

Likewise the mistress too,

And all the little children

That round the table go

(Chorus)

And all your kin and kinsfolk,

That dwell both far and near;

We wish you a Merry Christmas

And a Happy New year

(Chorus)",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christians-most-widely-persecuted-religious-group-in-the-world-report-says,2021-12-25
Church of England apologizes for saying God only approves sex for heterosexual married couples,"The Church of England somehow surprised and angered people with a recent statement of its belief that God only approves of sex between a man and a woman in the context of marriage — a belief that literally dates back to the beginning of Christianity.

Bowing to that social backlash, the church responded by apologizing last week for the statement, even though it did not change its stance on the issue.

""We as Archbishops, alongside the bishops of the Church of England, apologize and take responsibility for releasing a statement last week which we acknowledge has jeopardized trust,"" a statement by Archbishops Justin Welby and John Sentamu released Thursday read. ""We are very sorry and recognize the division and hurt this has caused.""

The controversy began with the pastoral statement, ""Civil Partnerships — for same sex and opposite sex couples,"" which is still published on the Church of England's website. It addresses a 2019 change in British law that allows heterosexual couples to enter civil partnerships, something already available to same-sex couples.

""With opposite sex civil partnerships, and with those for same sex couples, the Church's teaching on sexual ethics remains unchanged,"" the statement concludes, after detailing legislative changes and how they impact the church. ""For Christians, marriage — that is the lifelong union between a man and a woman, contracted with the making of vows — remains the proper context for sexual activity. In its approach to civil partnerships the Church seeks to uphold that standard, to affirm the value of committed, sexually abstinent friendships and to minister sensitively and pastorally to those Christians who conscientiously decide to order their lives differently.""

The statement essentially says that while civil partnerships are not inherently against church teachings, since they can be between a man and a woman in a nonsexual context, the ambiguity of such partnerships prevents the church from outright endorsing them as a concept.

Some prominent bishops, after the release of the statement, sent an open letter to the church criticizing the statement.

""The Church of England has this week become a laughingstock to a nation that believes it is obsessed with sex,"" the letter read. ""More importantly this statement has significantly damaged the mission of the Church and it has broken the trust of those it seeks to serve … it seems our trust has been misplaced and we feel badly let down.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christmas-middle-ages-food-drink-feast,2020-02-04
Church of England offers new guidance for clergy on approved transgender 'baptisms' — through traditional Affirmation of Baptism,"The Church of England is offering guidance to its clergy on how to perform ""baptisms"" on transgender parishioners who want to celebrate their new gender identity.

In 2017, the church voted to approve these ""baptism-style"" services for transgender people to honor those congregants who have electively changed their sex.

What are the details?

According to the BBC, the Church of England has recommended the Affirmation of Baptism service to permit transgender Christians to honor their transition to their new sexual identity.

The House of Bishops approved such guidance, which will be integrated into Common Worship.

Such a service would allow the transgender person to be addressed and recognized by their chosen name and gender, and not that of their biological birth.

The Affirmation of Baptism is traditional in welcoming people to the church as they renew, or make a new declaration, of faith.

The rites are generally preceded by a person's public declaration of faith and renouncing of sin, and is followed by holy communion.

The outlet reported that the guidance provided ""emphasizes that the Church 'welcomes and encourages the unconditional affirmation of trans people, equally with all people, within the body of Christ, and rejoices in the diversity of that body into which all Christians have been baptized by one Spirit.""

What are people saying about this?

A spokesperson for the Church told The Guardian that the new guidance is geared toward encouraging Church clergy to work along with transgender people to cultivate services to tell the story of each transgender person.

One chaplain consulted about the decision is the Rev. Dr. Tina Beardsley, a retired chaplain and — as the outlet notes — ""one of three trans clergy who were consulted on the guidelines.""

Beardsley said, ""For me, the most important thing was actually having this certificate to say that I had renewed my baptism vows, and it had my chosen name on it.""

The Bishop of Blackburn Julian Henderson said, ""We are absolutely clear that everyone is made in the image of God and that all should find a welcome in their parish church.""

""This new guidance,"" Henderson continued, ""provides an opportunity, rooted in scripture, to enable trans people who have come to Christ as the way, the truth, and the life, to mark their transition in the presence of their Church family, which is the body of Christ.""

A Church statement obtained by Newsweek read, ""Collectively, we have sought to ensure that these new Pastoral Guidance notes provide a rich and generous space for trans people to locate their lives in the existing liturgy for the Affirmation of Baptismal Faith.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/church-of-england-apologizes-for-saying-god-only-approves-sex-for-heterosexual-married-couples,2018-12-11
"Climate change 'accelerating' brain infections, claims UK outlet the Telegraph","U.K. outlet the Telegraph recently published an article claiming that climate change is accelerating the advance of a Japanese brain infection due to increased mosquito breeding.

The journalist claims that the Japanese encephalitis virus that affects upwards of 68,000 people annually has seen an increase in infections because climate change is causing more monsoons, which is allowing for more stagnant water to be breeding grounds for mosquitoes that spread the disease in Asia.

The article reads, ""JEV is becoming more common in northeast India as the region contends with intensifying monsoon seasons and storms – the fallout of climate change.""

The article also blames a ""rise in global temperatures"" that has ""shortened the life cycle of mosquitoes, experts say, which means the bugs breed at a faster rate.""

But JEV isn't the only fallout from climate change, according to the author; dengue fever is also. Cases will ""rise as climate change worsens,"" she writes, adding that ""unplanned urbanisation, deforestation, rapid population movement, and climate change"" are reasons why the illness will remain a threat come winter.

The author, who describes herself as an ""independent environment journalist largely reporting on climate change, environment and wildlife,"" is a recipient of the Climate Tracker Fellowship, a grant program that pays young journalists to write about climate change. The program states that it helps journalists ""develop a core thematic and journalistic understanding of the issues"" and promises to ""publish two stories in national media.""



Nonprofit organization Climate Tracker's stated goal is paying and training young people to become climate journalists. ""Support, train and incentivise better climate journalism globally,"" the website reads.

Some of the ""core values"" listed are of course ""diversity"" along with ""equality"" that promises equal pay for all employees, no matter the location. ""All of our team members are paid the same, regardless of their location. So are all of our journalism fellows. are c [sic] We offer benefits that can be customised based on what our team members want. When one person does well, we all succeed,"" it explains.

The organization's founder Chris Wright, who says he has ""worked on climate change"" since around 2010, blames bushfires brought on by fossil fuel companies exacerbating the ""climate crisis"" for the burning of his family's farm.

Another article written by Wright in 2021, titled ""2030 just became the new 2050,"" praises Joe Biden's climate platform for accelerating policy, stating that under the years of Donald Trump and Brazil's Jair Bolsonoro, a 2050 goal was a ""far off horizon of hope, as we drift off into hopelessness.""

In June 2020, Wright also authored the article ""Why we must support #BlackLivesMatter as environmental journalists.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/church-of-england-offers-guidance-on-transgender-baptisms,2022-12-09
"Climate change activist stands atop London train, infuriating delayed commuters.

But the activist was grabbed around his legs and dragged off the roof of the train as commuters cheered. BBC News said the protester appeared to be kicked and hit by the swearing crowd on the platform.



A second protester was chased along the top of the train by a commuter before being dragged off as well, the outlet said.

Here's a clip showing both incidents:

""I have to get to work, too,"" one commuter was heard saying, BBC News reported. ""I have to feed my kids.""



A third Extinction Rebellion activist broadcasting the protest on the group's social media accounts said he was attacked and ""kicked in the head,"" the outlet reported.



The radical, left-wing outfit has been staging demonstrations in the U.K. to force attention on climate change.

What did Extinction Rebellion have to say?

""Was it the right thing to do? I am not sure,"" Extinction Rebellion spokesman Howard Rees said, according to BBC News. ""I think we will have to have a period of reflection. It is too early to say.""

The group previously said the disruption was ""necessary to highlight the [climate change] emergency,"" the outlet said.

What did authorities have to say?

London Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned the protesters for their ""dangerous,"" ""counterproductive"" actions that proved an ""unacceptable disruption to Londoners who use public transport to get to work,"" CNN reported.

British Transport Police said they were investigating the Canning Town station incidents and that it was ""concerning to see that a number of commuters took matters into their own hands, displaying violent behavior to detain a protester,"" BBC News reported.

Eight protesters were arrested, police said, according to the outlet.

""It is important that commuters and other rail users allow the police, who are specially trained, to manage these incidents,"" Assistant Chief Constable Sean O'Callaghan said, BBC News reported. ""Unfortunately, there is still a risk that Extinction Rebellion will target the rail network during this evening's peak. We will continue to have extra officers on patrol and will work to disrupt any potential criminal action before it happens.""



Anything else?

British television host Piers Morgan has displayed absolutely no patience for Extinction Rebellion.

Last week he blasted the group's co-founder as a hypocrite for not reducing her ""own carbon footprint"" while telling others to do so. ""Why don't you give your computer, give up your television, give up your air conditioning, walk your kids to school, get a bike to the studio?"" he asked Skeena Rathor.

Climate change activists lights himself on fire at Laver Cup,"A climate change activist disrupted the 2022 Laver Cup by lighting himself on fire only hours before tennis legend Roger Federer was set to compete in the final match of his illustrious career.

A climate change activist set himself on fire during the Laver Cup. The disturbing disruption occurred in the middle of the match between Stefanos Tsitsipas and Diego Schwartzman at the O2 Arena in London, England.

The climate change activist was wearing a white shirt that said: ""End UK private jets.""

He managed to get on the tennis court, sat on the ground, and lit his right arm on fire with a lighter. There was also a small flame on the tennis court.

The protester was quickly removed from the court by security guards who also put out the blaze.

The publicity stunt delayed the start of the second set between Tsitsipas and Schwartzman.

Sports journalist Sam Street shared a video of the self-immolating man.

(WARNING: Graphic images)

The Laver Cup released a statement on the incident, ""A man accessed the court this afternoon and was promptly removed by security. Play was stopped briefly, he has been arrested and the situation is being handled by the police.""

Tsitsipas – the runner-up at the 2021 French Open – told reporters after the fiery incident, ""It came out of nowhere ... I never had an incident like this happen on court. I hope he's all right.""

Tsitsipas would go on to a 6-2, 6-1 victory – providing Team Europe with a 2-0 lead over Team World.

The climate change activist's self-immolation happened only hours before the heavily-anticipated final match of tennis legend Roger Federer.

Federer – who has captured 20 Grand Slam men's singles titles – is scheduled to compete in his final match of his legendary career in a doubles match with longtime rival Rafael Nadal against American tennis players Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe.

In June, a 22-year-old climate change activist named ""Alizée"" chained her neck to the tennis net and attempted to glue herself to the clay court at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France. The environmental activist was wearing a doomsday climate shirt that read: ""We have 1028 days left.""

Climate change protester bent on delaying flight gets heckled by fellow passengers while a BBC editor on board and points out some serious irony,"A climate change protester boarded a plane at London City Airport on Thursday morning, but hecklers were neither impressed nor moved by his one-man protest.

The climate change protester is believed to be a part of Extinction Rebellion. The activist group planned to protest the airport's plans to expand.

Extinction Rebellion group spokesman Rupert Read expressed an intent to shut down the airport in a statement:

Air travel is an icon of our fragile ""just-in-time"" economic system. That system will break, as Climate Chaos hits. By non-violently shutting down this airport, in homage to the style of the Hong Kong democracy protesters, we are demonstrating the utter frailty of the transport systems that countries such as ours, unwisely, have come to depend upon.

What are the details?

Footage of the incident hit the internet later Thursday morning, which featured the man staunchly refusing to take his seat.

Throughout the video, the unnamed man stands in the aircraft aisle, lecturing his fellow passengers on climate change despite a flight attendant's continued requests for him to sit down.

Hecklers can be heard mildly telling the man to sit down. None of them appear to be interested in what he has to say about climate change.

One passenger can be heard asking the unnamed protester, ""How long are you gonna be, mate?""

Another passenger can be heard threatening the protester as he insists, ""I don't wish to travel with you, but I don't wish to get off [the plane].""

""You'll be thrown off by me,"" the passenger grouses.

The protester can be heard responding, ""I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I'm extremely sorry for the inconvenience,"" adding, ""We have two generations of human civilization left if we carry on doing what we're doing.""

Police eventually escorted the man from the aircraft without further incident.

What else?

Twitter user Nicholas Watt, a ""BBC Newsnight"" political editor, addressed the incident on the social media platform.

""My flight from London City airport to Dublin has just been grounded by a climate change protester,"" he revealed in a lengthy Twitter thread. ""On runway and about to take off when smartly dressed man in late middle age stood up with iPhone to deliver lecture on climate change up and down aisle.""

""Cabin crew calmly and very politely asked protestor to resume his seat,"" he continued. ""Politely but persistently he declined and proceeded to deliver his lecture on climate change in aisle. Some passengers annoyed, others listened to lecture with humor as cabin crew alerted pilot.""

""Plane was at the end of runway. So the pilot taxied back to gate where plane was met by throng of police. They came on board and escorted the protestor off the plane,"" Watt added. ""No skirmish and protestor left the plane.""

Watt said that the flight, of course, had been delayed because of the protester, and then a second time when the aircraft had to refuel.

He wrote, ""And the final irony of the climate protest on our flight. We cannot take off until we have taken on extra fuel ... to replace the fuel used up during the protest, our pilot notes with humour.""

Watt also pointed out that law enforcement were out in full force at the airport because of the Extinction Rebellion protests.

According to Newsweek, police have made at least 842 arrests in connection with Extinction Rebellion protests as of Thursday morning. You can read more about Extinction Rebellion's protests here.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/climate-change-activist-fire-roger-federer-video,2019-10-10
Climate extremists Extinction Rebellion descend to ironic new low — digging up lawn at UK college over 'destruction of nature',"Climate extremists Extinction Rebellion — not content with halting working peoples' commutes and getting their tails yanked from the top of train cars or dressing up like broccoli in front of Piers Morgan or being told by a judge to get a job to pay a fine for vandalizing a World War II memorial — just can't seem to help themselves.

For their umpteenth encore, the left-wing activists decided to spend part of their day recently digging up a lawn outside Trinity College over its role in a major development in the Suffolk countryside in the United Kingdom, BBC News reported.

Their reason was more than a bit ironic: Extinction Rebellion, you see, was fighting back against ""destruction of nature,"" the outlet said.

Here's a clip of the lads and lasses hard at work:

youtu.be

Ere's mud in yer eye, luv

While the outlet said a Cambridgeshire police spokeswoman indicated officers were working with the college and that ""a crime has been recorded for criminal damage,"" Extinction Rebellion seemed unfazed.



Which is to say the activists transported excavated mud to a local Barclays Bank branch, BBC News said — and made a deposit, of sorts.

Indeed a Barclays Bank spokeswoman confirmed the activists spread wheelbarrows full of mud across the banking hall of its St. Andrew's Street branch, BBC News said.

Keeping a stiff upper lip, the staff made sure customers stayed safe while keeping the bank open for business, the outlet said.

But wait, there's more!

The BBC added that Extinction Rebellion activists also chained themselves to an apple tree on Trinity's front lawn and insisted they ""were careful to ensure that the digging took place a safe distance from the tree so as not to cause any damage to it.""

Not that it matters, but the activists claimed on Twitter that the college invested more money in oil and gas companies than any other Oxbridge college, the outlet said.

""The idea that a rich institution like Trinity College, which tells the world it is serious about tackling this crisis, is looking for profit from environmental destruction is quite simply astonishing,"" Derek Langley of Extinction Rebellion Cambridge told BBC News.

Local businessman Tim Norman told the outlet the stunt was ""counterproductive vandalism.""

What did Trinity have to say?

A Trinity spokeswoman told BBC News that the school ""respects the right to freedom of speech and non-violent protest but draws the line at criminal damage and asked the protesters to leave.""

What about the bank?

After the mud-spreading incident, a Barclays spokeswoman was nothing if not cordial, telling the outlet ""we recognize that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world today, and are determined to do all we can to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, while also ensuring that global energy needs continue to be met.""

Anything else?

"Climate protesters throw tomato soup at famous van Gogh painting, glue themselves to wall","Two climate activists were arrested Friday after throwing tomato soup at a famous Vincent van Gogh painting and gluing themselves to the wall at the National Gallery in London.

The female protesters belong to a group called Just Stop Oil, a coalition of climate alarmists demanding that the U.K. government halt all new oil and gas projects. They entered room 43 in the National Gallery, in which van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" is displayed, at approximately 11 a.m. local time and threw the contents of two cans of Heinz tomato soup over the painting.

""What is worth more, art or life? Is it worth more than food? Worth more than justice? Are you more concerned about the protection of a painting or the protection of our planet and people? The cost of living crisis is part of the cost of oil crisis. Fuel is unaffordable to millions of cold, hungry families. They can't even afford to heat a tin of soup,"" one of the activists said, according to video of the protest filmed by Just Stop Oil activists.

London Metropolitan Police said the protesters were arrested for criminal damage and aggravated trespass. Specialist officers were sent to the scene to unglue them, and they were taken into custody to a central London police station.

There was some minor damage to the frame, but the $80 million painting was unharmed, police said.

Van Gogh paintings that are displayed in museums are kept behind protective glass to shield them from light, touching, or vandalism.

Just Stop Oil said that the National Gallery protest followed ""two weeks of continued civil resistance"" by the group ""in response to the government's inaction on both the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis.""

Earlier this month, the U.K. North Sea Transition Authority, an agency in charge of oil and gas reserves in the North Sea, began awarding new licenses for companies conducting underwater fossil fuel exploration, CNBC News reported.

The government had paused the issuance of new licenses in 2020 for a ""climate compatibility check,"" but Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss recently announced the process would resume.



""This is not a one day event. This is an act of resistance against a criminal government and their genocidal death project,"" Just Stop Oil said. ""Our supporters will be returning – today, tomorrow and the next day – and the next day after that – and every day until our demand is met: no new oil and gas in the U.K.""

The group in recent weeks has disrupted traffic at various locations in London, infuriating drivers. Videos from an Oct. 9 protest show frustrated motorists exiting their vehicles and dragging the protesters off the street to clear the roads.



""I have to go to hospital for an appointment, I'm deaf, let me get on with my life and stop interfering with us,"" one man says in the video.

Truss' government has also lifted a 2019 ban on hydraulic fracking in response to the energy crisis affecting all of Europe due partly to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Conservative members of Parliament have called for increases in domestic energy production, including use of fossil fuels, to reduce reliance on natural gas exports from Russia.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/climate-extremists-extinction-rebellion-descend-to-ironic-new-low--digging-up-lawn-at-uk-college-over-destruction-of-nature,2022-10-14
Climate activists deflate tires on Portland mom's SUV; note on door says her 'gas guzzler kills' and not to take 4 newly flat tires 'personally',"Nicole Driscoll had no time to spare Thursday morning. The Portland mom needed to get her kids to school and then had a 10 a.m. meeting, KGW-TV reported.

But when she got to her SUV, she found a note on one of the door handles, the station said, which read, in part: ""Attention, your gas guzzler kills. We have deflated one or more of your tires. You'll be angry, but don't take it personally. It's not you, it's your car.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Driscoll told KGW she was ""in disbelief"" over the words and quickly exited her vehicle to check her tires.

'Holy crap'

""I looked, and I was like, 'Holy crap, they did; they deflated my tires,'"" she recounted to the station.



All four of them, actually, KGW reported.

The note in question came from the website of an international climate movement spreading to cities across the world, the station said, adding that people are encouraged to deflate SUV tires in the name of climate change and pollution reduction.

Driscoll, who works for a nonprofit, told KGW she understands activism — but this act was taking things too far and put her ""in total emergency mode"" during which her AAA service came to fix her tires.

""I get activism, I appreciate it, but not in this form,"" she told the station. ""Don't mess with people's property.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

She added to KGW that there are plenty of other ways to create change that don't include property damage.

""We need volunteers,"" Driscoll told the station. ""We need a lot of volunteers. There's a lot of good things that can be done in this city, and this is not one of them.""

She added to KGW that the tires on vehicles belonging to her neighbors were also deflated.

The station said Oregon law indicates that deflating a tire is a Class C misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail and subject to fines that can reach $1,250.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/climate-protesters-throw-tomato-soup-at-famous-van-gogh-painting-glue-themselves-to-wall,2022-11-07
Clinicians quit transgender clinic over concerns about controversial treatments on kids as young as 3,"Five former clinicians who worked at the National Health Service's transgender therapy clinics in England have quit their jobs over ethical concerns and harms caused by controversial treatments prescribed to children as young as 3 years old.

The former staffers told the Times that they believed the Gender Identity Development Service had haphazardly diagnosed children with gender dysphoria and that they felt pressured into prescribing harmful hormone therapy to block the onset of puberty.

""This experimental treatment is being done on not only children, but very vulnerable children,"" one former GIDS staffer told the newspaper.

Each of the unidentified former employees said they were members of a team of clinicians who would determine whether or not to prescribe irreversible and harmful treatments for children.

They also alleged that many of the children diagnosed with gender dysphoria at the clinic were more likely gay kids who were victims of homophobic bullying.

What happens when the children get older?

At 16, the clinic prescribed a mix of sex hormones to help them develop the physical characteristics that match their preferred gender identity, the former employees told the Times.

Why didn't the clinicians quit sooner?

Some reportedly stayed at the clinic because they believed they could somehow protect children from harmful treatments.

""I felt for the last two years what kept me in the job was the sense there was a huge number of children in danger,"" another former staffer told the Times. ""I was there to protect children from being damaged.""

What did the GIDS say?

A GIDS official told newspaper that its staff considers carefully whether or not hormone therapy would be an appropriate treatment for each individual child.

What else?

Referrals to the GIDS clinics in London and Leeds has surged over the last 10 years. Last year, the clinic saw 2,519 child referrals. In 2010, there were only 94.

At least 18 staff members have reportedly left the clinic citing similar circumstances involving irresponsible diagnosis and treatments.

CNN ran two stories saying Trump opposes Russia sanctions as he was about to sign one into law,"CNN's nakedly partisan reporting may have sunk to new lows this week.

The news network ran, not just one, but two stories reporting that President Donald Trump is balking at sanctions targeting Russia for its 2016 election interference and annexation of Crimea. However, what CNN did not report is that the 45th president signed tough sanctions on Friday that target the Kremlin's expansion into European oil markets.

Even the UK's BBC covered Trump approving the measures targeting a major Russian pipeline while the so-called ""most trusted name in news"" in the United States ignored.

Why did the U.S. target a Russian pipeline?

According to the BBC, the sanctions that Trump signed were part of an annual defense spending bill and specifically target firms that support the construction of Nord Stream 2, an undersea pipeline that would allow Russia to increase energy exports to Germany and the European Union.

The US considers the project a security risk to Europe. Both Russia and the EU have strongly condemned the US sanctions. Congress voted through the measures as part of a [defense] bill last week and the legislation, which described the pipeline as a ""tool of coercion"", was signed off by Mr Trump on Friday.

The British network added that the Russian pipeline project has strong bipartisan opposition in the U.S. Congress. Sanctions targeting it were sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). BBC noted that the Trump administration is concerned the pipeline will allow Moscow to control Europe's energy supply and reduce America's share of the European natural gas market.

Russia is said to currently supply 40% of the European Union's liquified natural gas. The new pipeline would allow Russia to bypass Ukraine and Poland and deliver gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea to Germany, according to Reuters. In addition, lawmakers in Washington say that Nord Stream 2 would likely deprive Ukraine of billions of dollars in fees.

What was CNN talking about then?

The Russian sanctions that CNN was referring to is a separate set of sanctions known as the Defending American Security from Kremlin Aggression Act that would not even be up for a full vote until next year. DASKA would slap Russia with a wide range of sanctions in retaliation for its interference in American elections and aggression in eastern Europe.

While it is true that the State Department has balked at the measures, CNN's headline—claiming ""Trump administration opposes bill meant to deter Russia""—overstates the White House's opposition.

In a 22-page letter detailing its position on the matter, the State Department says it ""shares the goal of deterring and countering Russian subversion and aggression,"" but says it ""strongly opposes the bill in its current form"" for a variety of reasons. Among them is that the bill ""would divert resources from the ongoing aggressive targeting of Russian malign actors under existing authorities...as well as from efforts with respect to Iran, North Korea, ISIS, Venezuela, Hezbollah, counterterrorism, human rights and corruption and other (US government) priorities.""

Although CNN explained some of these nuances in its coverage, as of the writing of this article, it has not yet reported on Nord Stream 2 sanctions on its website.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/clinicians-leave-transgender-clinic-over-controversial-treatments-on-kids,2019-12-21
College students in UK get trigger warning about George Orwell's iconic '1984' — a novel that features 'thought police' and censorship as a primary theme,"A college in the United Kingdom has issued a trigger warning to its students — pretty much all of whom are considered adults — about the content in George Orwell's iconic novel ""1984.""

Turns out the powers that be at the University of Northampton are saying the dystopian tome about totalitarianism contains ""explicit material,"" which some students may find ""offensive and upsetting,"" the Daily Mail reported.

One of the many ironies stemming from the school's trigger warning decision is that ""1984"" features ""thought police,"" ""Big Brother,"" and pervasive censorship among a number of dark forces controlling humanity.

What are the details?

Indeed, critics of the college's decision say it runs counter to the themes in the book, the Daily Mail added.

However, ""1984"" isn't the only work to come under Northampton's thumb in connection with the ""Identity Under Construction"" module which ""addresses challenging issues related to violence, gender, sexuality, class, race, abuses, sexual abuse, political ideas, and offensive language,"" the outlet said.

Others getting flagged as potentially ""offensive and upsetting"" include the Samuel Beckett play ""Endgame,"" the graphic novel ""V for Vendetta"" by Alan Moore, and ""Sexing the Cherry"" by David Lloyd and Jeanette Winterson, the Daily Mail reported.

What did critics have to say?

""There’s a certain irony that students are now being issued trigger warnings before reading Nineteen Eighty-Four,"" member of Parliament Andrew Bridgen said, according to the outlet. ""Our university campuses are fast becoming dystopian Big Brother zones where Newspeak is practiced to diminish the range of intellectual thought and cancel speakers who don’t conform to it. Too many of us — and nowhere is it more evident than our universities — have freely given up our rights to instead conform to a homogenized society governed by a liberal elite 'protecting' us from ideas that they believe are too extreme for our sensibilities.""

Orwell biographer David Taylor added to the Daily Mail that ""13-year-olds might find some scenes in the novel disturbing, but I don’t think anyone of undergraduate age is really shocked by a book any more.""

What did the college have to say?

""While it is not university policy, we may warn students of content in relation to violence, sexual violence, domestic abuse, and suicide,"" a school spokesman told the Daily Mail. ""In these circumstances we explain to applicants as part of the recruitment process that their course will include some challenging texts. This is reinforced by tutors as they progress through their program of studies.""

Northampton also issued warnings in other modules on its English degree course, the outlet said, adding that the likes of Mark Haddon’s 2003 novel ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"" was marked with a warning that it includes the ""death of an animal, ableism, and disability, and offensive language.""

Northampton is ranked 101st in a list of the UK’s 121 universities, the Daily Mail said.

Anything else?

The outlet added that earlier this month Salford University students were given a ""trigger warning"" over Charlotte Bronte’s ""Jane Eyre"" and Charles Dickens’ ""Great Expectations"" — and that English literature undergraduates were warned they might find ""distressing ... scenes and discussions of violence and sexual violence in several of the primary texts.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-ignores_trump_russia_sanctions,2022-01-26
New 'consent condoms' require four hands to open special packaging,"An Argentinian manufacturer has launched a line of condoms packaged in a way that it requires four hands to open the box.

Tulipan designed ""consent condoms,"" which can be accessed only when two people using both of their hands press down simultaneously on four pressure points along the sides of the package, the New Zealand Herald reported. The package design is intended to promote mutual respect.

""If it's not a yes, it's a no,"" Joaquin Campins, general director of BBDO Argentina, said, according to the New Zealand Herald. BBDO worked with Tulipan on the brand. ""Tulipan has always spoken of safe pleasure but for this campaign we understood that we had to talk about the most important thing in every sexual relationship — pleasure is possible only if you both give your consent first.""

The company plans to hand out its limited-edition condoms packs at bars and other events in Buenos Aires for free before selling the product in stores.

Where did the idea come from?

The idea came about after the AIDS Healthcare Foundation Argentina released its results of a survey that showed fewer than 15 percent of the nation's men regularly used condoms during sex. AHF Argentina is a nonprofit organization that advocates for the rights of those who are HIV positive.

An estimated 120,000 people in the country are HIV positive, according to the AHF website.

About 65 percent of the men said they used condoms occasionally. And nearly 21 percent said they had never used a condom.

What do experts say?

""Medicos del Mundo,"" which translates to ""doctors of the world,"" has stressed the use of condoms in the fight against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.

Argentinian psychiatrist and sexologist Walter Ghedin said that sexual consent and the type of prophylactic used should be something that both people agree on.

""The agreement in sexual relations should be a guideline that begins before, during and after any relationship, it implies respect, mutual pleasure and confidentiality,"" Ghedin said, according to the Mirror. ""The use of contraceptive methods is one of the issues that should be agreed upon, and the use of the prophylactic appears as a necessary question in both fleeting and stable relationships.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-trigger-warning-george-orwell-1984,2019-04-03
'Conservative Review' podcast host Daniel Horowitz is one strike away from a permanent Twitter ban,"Blaze podcast host Daniel Horowitz of ""Conservative Review"" said Monday that his Twitter account has been temporarily locked after he tweeted about patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were fully vaccinated.

In an op-ed, Horowitz wrote that a tweet he sent ""around 3 p.m. Eastern on Friday afternoon"" was flagged as ""misleading"" by Twitter and taken down.

The offending tweet discussed how a family told Horowitz that one of their own who has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 has nevertheless been hospitalized with a coronavirus infection and is ""getting crappy treatment"" at the hospital.

""[Gov. Larry Hogan] stop lying about the statistics. 72% of covid deaths in the UK were vaccinated from weeks 49-52,"" Horowitz tweeted.

Horowitz explained to TheBlaze that his tweet was responding to a claim made by Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who said last week that a small minority of his state's unvaccinated population is ""overwhelming hospitals.""

Twitter labeled the tweet ""Misleading"" and prevented other users from replying to, sharing, or liking the tweet.



Horowitz wrote that his account was temporarily suspended ""without warning or notice for cause"" shortly after the tweet was flagged and taken down.



Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The social media platform has strict rules prohibiting users from sharing ""false or misleading information about COVID-19 which may lead to harm.""

""When Tweets include misleading information about COVID-19, we may place a label on those Tweets that includes corrective information about that claim,"" Twitter's Help Center states. ""In cases where we determine there is potential for harm associated with the misleading claim, we will disable the ability for others to Retweet, Quote Tweet, or engage in other ways to prevent the spread of the misleading information."" Such tweets will cause one strike against a user's account.



According to Twitter, tweets that will earn a label include, ""False or misleading information that misrepresent the protective effect of vaccines, to make claims contrary to health authorities. Claims that misrepresent research or statistical findings pertaining to the severity of the disease, prevalence of the virus, or effectiveness of widely accepted preventative measures, treatments, or vaccines.""

In his op-ed, Horowitz elaborated on his tweet and argued that Maryland's governor is wrong to solely blame the unvaccinated for a surge in coronavirus hospitalizations while data suggests that even people who are fully vaccinated can still be infected and hospitalized with COVID-19.



The notion that everyone in the hospital with COVID is unvaccinated was always an illogical proposition. Take Maryland, for example. According to Maryland’s COVID dashboard, nearly every senior alive has at least one shot, and over 92.5% of all those above 18 have at least one shot. Even if the unvaccinated still compose a relatively disproportionate share of the hospitalizations, there are simply not enough of them to go around to “flood the hospitals.” You can still say there is a degree of efficacy for some people for serious illness (pre-Omicron) without fully lying to people and exaggerating to the point that they believe almost nobody with the shots gets clinically ill.

The data cited in his deleted tweet included raw data from the latest U.K. Health Security Agency vaccine surveillance report that shows during weeks 49-52 of 2021 (December), a significant number of COVID-19 positive people who died had received at least one vaccine dose.

""If you add up all of the unvaccinated deaths reported following 60 days from a positive COVID test within that window (928) and divide it by all the total deaths (3,718), you get 24.95% of the deaths being unvaccinated. In other words, 75% of the deaths recorded during that period were indeed vaccinated, nearly all of them double-vaccinated,"" Horowitz wrote. ""So, if anything, I do apologize for the misinformation in the tweet where I said the vaccinated accounted for 72% of the deaths. It was actually slightly higher.

""Obviously, given the age-stratified vaccination rates, this still shows some degree of efficacy against mortality for the shots,"" he argued. ""For example, 83% of all deaths among those ages 80+ were vaccinated, but almost everyone in that age cohort is vaccinated. None of us discount that fact. But that is a very different story from saying that the overwhelming majority of deaths in raw numbers are among the unvaccinated.""



Horowitz told TheBlaze his account has been locked for seven days. According to Twitter's Help Center, that means there are at least four strikes against his account. A fifth strike levied for violating Twitter's COVID-19 misinformation policy will result in a permanent suspension.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/consent-condoms-require-four-hands,2022-01-10
"Conservative UK official tweets photo of himself with container of tea. Of course, woke leftist mob freaks out with threats to boycott brand.","The crazy train of the woke left apparently is continuing its runaway pace down the tracks.

What, pray tell, is it this time?

Rishi Sunak — the United Kingdom's chancellor of the exchequer and a Conservative member of parliament — tweeted a photo of himself with Yorkshire Tea a few days ago. The caption read, ""Quick Budget prep break making tea for the team. Nothing like a good Yorkshire brew.""



Well, that sent the woke leftist mob over the edge.

Yorkshire Tea received a mountain of online abuse over the photo, including a weekend full of calls to boycott the brand, the Guardian reported — despite the inconvenient fact that Yorkshire Tea had nothing to do with the photo.

""Nothing to do with us — people of all political stripes like our brew,"" the brand tweeted at one point.

What were some of the nutty Twitter messages the tea brand received?

""I've stopped using Yorkshire Tea since then as I don't want to use a product that received publicity from an xenophobic fascist racist political party. I got rid of Yorkshire Tea from all three of my offices and from home. All staff and other family and friends feel same.""

""If I was Yorkshire Tea, I'd be very worried about my supporters being racist Brexiteers.""

""Looks like buying Tetley is back on. Shame on you Yorkshire Tea.""

""You can tell a lot about a company by the people that endorse it. Parasitic hedge funds.""

""No longer buying your products.""

""Goodbye from me to Yorkshire Tea.""

""Never buying Yorkshire Tea again.""

""Being endorsed by the @Conservatives is not a good look. Thankfully, other teas are available. #AvoidYorkshireTea #BoycottYorkshireTea.""

""You may not endorse racist and bigoted MPs, particularly those without scruples, but you could publicly object to this unauthorized endorsement.""

What did Yorkshire Tea say next?

On Monday, posts from the company's Twitter account said the tea brand endured a weekend's worth of cyber dragging:

But Yorkshire Tea also thanked those who stood up for the brand:

“Speaking directly now, as the person who's been answering these tweets, I know it could have been much worse. It's easier to be on the receiving end of this as a brand than as an individual,"" the curator of the thread also noted. “There's more emotional distance, and I've had a team to support me when it got a bit much. But for anyone about to vent their rage online, even to a company — please remember there's a human on the other end of it, and try to be kind.""

Controversial ad shows severely sick COVID-stricken Santa Claus. Parents are outraged.,"United Kingdom health officials have apologized for a controversial advertisement depicting Santa Claus with a severe case of COVID-19 that outraged parents say could be terrifying for children.

The short ad, titled ""The Gift,"" shows National Health Service staff and volunteers working to save an elderly man's life after he's wheeled into a hospital by paramedics and put on oxygen, the UK Daily Mail reports. Health care workers in full PPE work diligently to nurse the man back to health.

Eventually, the man makes a full recovery and at the end of the video a Christmas gift left for his nurses reveals it was old St. Nick who frontline health workers saved.

The video ends with a slogan, ""Give back to those who've given everything.""

The ad was put together by NHS Charities Together, a group representing and supporting the work of NHS' official charities. It was published as part of the Gifts That Give Back Campaign encouraging people to send gifts to NHS staff for Christmas this year.

""We're delighted to share our Christmas campaign and video, which has been made possible thanks to generous brand partners,"" the charity group said in a social media post. ""We adore the ad and dedicate it to all NHS workers who've given everything to care and keep us safe.""

""Hundreds of thousands of NHS staff will be working over Christmas and New Year,"" said NHS Charities Together CEO Ellie Norton. ""The public has responded magnificently so far to our appeal, helping us raise over £150million. But with the ongoing impact of COVID, the need is still there.""

While some members of the public received the ad well, with the Daily Mail referring to it as ""emotional"" and ""touching,"" others on social media slammed it as harmful to children's' mental health.

NHS Charities Together on Dec. 12 issued a statement in response to the negative feedback, clarifying that the ad was not targeted at children.

The charity said, ""When we launched the ad earlier in the week, we had an overwhelmingly positive response to it. Some subsequent media coverage of it has generated criticism of the ad on social media and some people have expressed their concern about it upsetting children. The ad has been made to engage charity supporters and those who may want to buy products that generate donations to the appeal. It isn't aimed at children and hasn't been shown on TV. We are sorry to the parents of any young children who have been upset by watching the ad and to the young children themselves, they were not the intended audience for it.""

The ad was subsequently pulled down from YouTube, Business Insider reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/conservative-uk-official-tweets-photo-of-himself-with-container-of-tea-of-course-woke-leftist-mob-freaks-out,2020-12-14
'I'll make something up': UK cop suspended after video catches him threatening to fabricate charge against man and throw him in jail,"A police officer in the United Kingdom has been suspended from duty after he was caught on video Friday threatening to throw a man in jail and adding that he would fabricate a charge against him, Lancashire Live reported.

What are the details?

Police officials said in a statement that officers were on their way to execute a search warrant at an address when they ""stopped to speak to a group of males with a quad bike"" in Accrington, Lancashire, BBC News reported.

The man the officer spoke to in the video was buying the quad bike for his stepson and was pulled over by police, the Lancashire Telegraph noted.

Soon the man accuses the officer of harassment and says, ""I've done nothing wrong.""

With that the officer asks, ""Do you want me to show you the definition of harassment?"" He then tells the man, ""Give me the keys and sit in the car and shut up.""

The officer then turns back and gets in the man's face.

""If you wanna f***ing step to me, and push your chest out and something like that, then fine, I'll lock you up. We'll do that, shall we?"" the officer says.

The man again insists, ""I've done nothing wrong,"" to which the officer replies, ""I'll make something up. Public order. Squaring up to a police officer. Shall I do that? Who are they going to believe, me or you?""

The officer then repeats the question, this time screaming it: ""Who are they going to believe, me or you?""

The aftermath

Lancashire Constabulary publicly apologized after the video went viral on social media and confirmed the unnamed officer was suspended from duty, Lancashire Live reported.

""We absolutely recognize the impact this footage has had on public confidence,"" the police force said in a statement to Lancashire Live, adding that ""we have also taken the decision to voluntarily refer the matter to the Independent Office of Police Conduct. We hope these actions go some way to reassuring the public how seriously we are treating this matter. We will be speaking to the man in the footage to keep him fully informed regarding the actions we are taking.""

There have been a number of headline-grabbing incidents involving police across the pond as the coronavirus lockdown there drags on.

U.K. police were caught on video tearing into a journalist documenting cops removing a woman from a public park because they believed she wasn't there to exercise. One officer told the journalist he was ""not authorized to go around videoing"" before letting loose with some hollering: ""You're killing people! Go home!""

Last week an expletive-filled video was posted to Twitter showing a man berating ""British f***ing police"" who allegedly bashed through his front door ""to make sure there's nothing going on"" amid the COVID-19 lockdown.

"Cops threaten expensive fines — for snowball fighting, sledding — amid strict COVID-19 lockdown in UK","Police in the United Kingdom are threatening to hand out £200 fines (about $275) for those who dare venture outdoors to enjoy the recent snowfall that reached half a foot in some places, the Mirror reported.

And sledding or snowball fighting? That'll earn you a ticket from the sheriff of Nottingham, mate.



What are the details?

The paper said the snowfall attracted large outdoor crowds over the weekend, but police in London, Surrey, and Wiltshire warned winter revelers to not disobey COVID-19 lockdown rules even with members of their own households.

Cops in Swindon broke up a Sunday sledding soiree of 200 people at Coate Water Country Park, the Mirror said, and Surrey Police handed out £200 fines to two carloads of men ""out looking at the snow.""

The paper said Home Secretary Priti Patel and police have vowed to ""get tougher on people flouting rules aimed at curbing the spread of the disease and saving lives.""

Government guidance says citizens can leave their residences for exercise but only once daily, the Mirror noted, adding that approved forms of exercise include but are not limited to running, cycling, walking, and swimming. When others are around, people must stay two meters apart from all those not in your household, the paper added.



Alarm bells ringing

""We are currently responding to reports of about 150 children and about 50 adults gathering in the Sevenfields area of Swindon and concerns have been raised that they are not abiding by the coronavirus guidelines,"" Swindon Police wrote Sunday on Facebook, the Mirror said. ""Please do not gather in large groups — you are reminded that Fixed Penalty Notices may be issued to those who do not abide by the regulations. We are in the midst of a pandemic and failing to socially distance and wear face masks could aid the spread of the virus.""

Wiltshire Police Inspector Louis McCoy on Sunday wrote, ""I don't want to be dealing with [sledders] and snowball fights. There's still a lockdown on. Think about it; don't be tempted,"" the paper reported.

The Surrey Police Roads Policing Unit said it fined two carloads of men who were out for a drive to and said they were ""looking at the snow,"" the Mirror said.



""We stopped two cars that were traveling in convoy with each other in Guildford,"" the tweet read, according to the paper. ""The cars contained four men, all from different households ... Four £200 COVID fines issued.""

Surrey Police also tweeted: ""We are currently receiving lots of calls and reports relating to snowballs being thrown and people outside [sledding]. Enjoy the snow today, but please don't involve other people, particularly more vulnerable residents. Please stay safe and remember that COVID regulations do still apply,"" the Mirror said.

Derbyshire Roads Policing Unit said it handed out fines after a family's car spun into a ditch, the paper reported, adding that ""3 police cars, 2 ambulances, 1 doctor car, and 2 fire crews"" were called, and that ""tickets were issued.""

The Mirror said officers in Merton, south London, wrote: ""Sorry to be 'that grumpy relative,' but with the snow coming down the way it is, please drive carefully. And if you're going to have a snowball fight, please stick to your bubbles. Also do not eat yellow snow.""

Not everyone took it well

There was some pushback against police interfering in the fun — and some figured officers might have better things to to:

""Any chance you could use the time when you're not stopping snowball fights and [sledding] to find my stolen car?"" one person wrote back, the Mirror said.

Another asked, ""So is taking the kids out sledging not exercise?"" the paper noted.

""Do you think maybe it's about time the police stopped disgracing themselves by enforcing laws that don't actually exist?"" another person asked, the Mirror reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cop-suspended-after-video-catches-him-threatening-to-fabricate-charge-against-man,2021-01-26
"Cops in UK ask for help finding man who kissed woman on cheek, call it a sexual assault","Derbyshire police in the United Kingdom posted an appeal on its website and social media accounts Saturday asking for help finding a man who kissed a woman on the cheek — and called it a sexual assault, BBC News reported.

What are the details?



Police said the man's kiss was in thanks to the woman — who's in her 70s — for helping him when his truck got stuck under a bridge, the outlet said.

The woman was ""very distressed, especially at a time when close contact with strangers is to be avoided,"" police said, referring to the coronavirus, and added that the unwanted kiss fell under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, BBC News said.

""We take all allegations of this nature extremely seriously,"" police said, according to the outlet.

How did readers react?

The police appeal was ridiculed, BBC News said, as a Twitter commenter asked the department if it was a joke while another offered, ""Giving someone a kiss on the cheek isn't a crime nor is it sexual assault.""

The force later pulled the request for help from its accounts since ""the post drew a significant number of comments that were counterproductive to the nature of the appeal,"" the outlet said.

Derbyshire police also have faced criticism for using drone footage to ""lockdown shame"" walkers, BBC News said. In addition, Peter Goodman, the force's chief constable, is retiring after a police watchdog probe into his personal conduct, the Daily Mail reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cops-fines-for-snowball-fighting-sledding-covid-lockdown,2020-05-18
WHO: No evidence antibodies give COVID-19 survivors immunity,"The World Health Organization issued a warning that there is currently no evidence that people who recovered from the coronavirus and have antibodies in their blood plasma will be immune to the deadly virus, which suggests that people who have contracted the disease once might not be immune from being reinfected by the virus.

The WHO cautioned that serological tests, which look for the presence of antibodies in blood plasma, might not be as helpful in identifying immunity because there is no proof that humans can build up immunity to prevent being reinfected by COVID-19.

During a Friday news conference in Geneva, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said, ""There are a lot of countries that are suggesting using rapid diagnostic serological tests to be able to capture what they think will be a measure of immunity. Right now, we have no evidence that the use of a serological test can show that an individual has immunity or is protected from reinfection.""

""These antibody tests will be able to measure that level of seroprevalence - that level of antibodies - but that does not mean that somebody with antibodies means that they are immune,"" said Van Kerkhove, head of WHO's emerging diseases and zoonosis unit.

""What the use of these tests will do will measure the level of antibodies,"" Van Kerkhove said. ""It's a response that the body has a week or two later after they've been infected with this virus.""

Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies program, noted that ""nobody is sure"" if humans with coronavirus antibodies could be reinfected.

""Nobody is sure whether someone with antibodies is fully protected against having the disease or being exposed again,"" Ryan said on Monday. ""Plus some of the tests have issues with sensitivity. They may give a false negative result.""

""With regards to recovery and then reinfection, I believe we do not have the answers to that. That is an unknown,"" Ryan said. ""One would expect that a person who generates a full-blown immune response with detectable antibodies should have protection for a period of time. We just don't know what that period of time is.""

Van Kerkhove referenced a preliminary study of the blood plasma of 175 patients in Shanghai who had recovered from the coronavirus.

""And that found some individuals had a strong antibody response,"" Van Kerkhove stated. ""Whether that antibody response actually means immunity is a separate question. That's something that we really need to better understand is what does that antibody response look like in terms of immunity.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rolled out a plan to do serologic testing in ""more areas with high numbers of people with diagnosed infections."" But the CDC also warned that ""serologic test results have limitations that make them less than ideal tools for diagnosing people who are sick."" The tests are ""limited"" because ""it typically takes one to two weeks after someone becomes sick with COVID-19 for their body to make antibodies; some people may take longer to develop antibodies.""

Professor John Newton, Director of Health Improvement at Public Health England, said the public should not use any unproven antibody tests.



""We are breaking new ground with this work every day, and I am confident this major research effort will make a breakthrough,"" Newton said. ""Until then, please don't buy or take any unproven tests. They may not be reliable for your intended use; they may give a false reading and put you, your family or others at risk.""

Over 582,000 people of the more than 2.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide have recovered.

"Coronavirus has significantly weakened, could disappear without vaccine, top doctor reveals","The coronavirus has significantly weakened and could even disappear on its own, according to a top Italian doctor.

Dr. Matteo Bassetti, the head of the infectious diseases clinic at the San Martino hospital, said in an interview Sunday that COVID-19 patients who would have died two or three months ago are now recovering.

""The clinical impression I have is that the virus is changing in severity,"" Bassetti told the Telegraph UK.

""In March and early April the patterns were completely different. People were coming to the emergency department with a very difficult to manage illness and they needed oxygen and ventilation, some developed pneumonia,"" he explained. ""Now, in the past four weeks, the picture has completely changed in terms of patterns.""

Bassetti attributed the strength differences to potential genetic mutations, which are common for viruses. He explained that increased scientific understanding about the virus has also aided efforts to mitigate its impact.



""It was like an aggressive tiger in March and April but now it's like a wild cat,"" Bassetti said. ""Even elderly patients, aged 80 or 90, are now sitting up in bed and they are breathing without help. The same patients would have died in two or three days before.""

""I think the virus has mutated because our immune system reacts to the virus and we have a lower viral load now due to the lockdown, mask-wearing, social distancing,"" he explained.

In fact, Bassetti said COVID-19 may disappear even without a vaccine.

""Yes, probably it could go away completely without a vaccine. We have fewer and fewer people infected and it could end up with the virus dying out,"" he told the Telegraph.

Coronavirus cases worldwide continue to climb, an increase that is attributed to widespread testing. However, hospitalizations and deaths are generally decreasing, with the exception of Latin and South America, where Brazil and Mexico have seen COVID-related deaths skyrocket.

Mexico, for example, reported more than 1,000 new COVID-19 deaths on Monday.

According to former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the increase in positive cases can be attributed to younger people taking more risks when venturing outside, while medically vulnerable and elderly people are better protecting themselves.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/coronavirus-antibody-tests-immunity-who,2020-06-22
Coronavirus model used to justify shutdowns found to be 'totally unreliable' by experts,"The coronavirus outbreak projection model that predicted more than 2 million U.S. deaths has been deemed ""totally unreliable"" by experts who have examined its coding, Fox News reported.

The model programmed by Neil Ferguson of the United Kingdom's Imperial College helped convince the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom to implement severe lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus, and the frightening projections the model created also motivated public support of such measures early on.

But the Imperial College model appears incapable of meeting even the lowest scientific standards. If scientists run the model two times with the same data, it produces different results. From Fox News:

The Imperial model works by using code to simulate transport links, population size, social networks and healthcare provisions to predict how coronavirus would spread. Researchers released the code behind it, which developers have criticized as being unreadable.



Scientists from the University of Edinburgh have further claimed that it is impossible to reproduce the same results from the same data using the model. The team got different results when they used different machines, and even different results from the same machines.

""Models must be capable of passing the basic scientific test of producing the same results given the same initial set of parameters,"" Oxford University mathematical biology professor Michael Bonsall said, according to Fox News. ""Otherwise, there is simply no way of knowing whether they will be reliable.""

One tech company founder told the Daily Telegraph that such poor work wouldn't be acceptable in any business context.

""In our commercial reality, we would fire anyone for developing code like this and any business that relied on it to produce software for sale would likely go bust,"" David Richards, co-founder of the British tech company WANdisco, said.

Ferguson did step down from his advisory role with the UK government, but not because of his failed model — it was because he violated coronavirus lockdown rules to cheat on his wife with a married woman.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/coronavirus-has-significantly-weakened-could-disappear-without-vaccine-top-doctor-reveals,2020-05-18
Cosmopolitan magazine hit with fierce backlash over covers praising obesity despite coronavirus risk,"Cosmopolitan magazine faced fierce online backlash and mockery for its latest cover that dabbled in body positivity during a global pandemic where obesity has been identified as a high-risk precondition.

The fashion and entertainment magazine geared toward women highlighted an article touting ""11 women on why wellness doesn't have to be one-size-fits-all,"" on its cover for the February issue.

The article interviews several women who have become advocates for body positivity.

""Body-shaming was one of the first things I learned to do. I grew up in a community where all of my physical attributes – wide nose, big belly, big ass, big lips, dark skin – were deemed ugly,"" said Jessamyn Stanley, a yoga teacher. ""I've had to accept that's how the mainstream sees me and not try to change. For me, that's been very therapeutic.""

The article also includes stories from a woman who had to deal with body issues stemming from an accident that left her in a wheelchair permanently, a woman with a genetic condition that causes dwarfism, and others unrelated to weight issues.

Many on social media found the article to be problematic given how obesity has been identified as a high-risk precondition for complications from the coronavirus pandemic.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls obesity a ""common, serious, and costly chronic disease,"" and identifies it as a precondition that increase the risk of serious illness from the coronavirus.

""A very irresponsible PR stunt in the middle of a public health crisis,"" tweeted one Twitter user.

""We know diabetes puts people more at risk of Covid and obesity is the main cause of contracted diabetes in the world. Wokeness at its worst,"" she added.



""Obesity is the second most significant risk factor for death from COVID-19, after elderly age, and Cosmopolitan honestly thinks this ascientific rubbish is an appropriate cover,"" responded Jonathan Witt.

Tone deaf and extremely ignorant,"" he added.



Supporters of the body positivity movement, however, were outraged at the criticism of the larger-sized women.

""Damn. People are BIG mad about the Cosmopolitan cover. BIG mad. They are literally foaming at the mouth. 2021 let's have more fat women on the front covers of magazines please. Keep it GOING,"" tweeted Stephanie Yeboah, a body image activist.

""I'm sorry but it just pisses me off that out of all 11 women featured in Cosmopolitan magazine, people are relentlessly abusing, harassing and bullying the two plus sized ones,"" she added.

Numerous countries ban travel from the UK as mutated strain of coronavirus is reportedly raging 'out of control',"Multiple countries, including France, Germany, Spain, and India, have suspended all flights from the United Kingdom as officials there grapple with an outbreak of a ""mutant"" strain of the novel coronavirus that some worry is more contagious than COVID-19.

According to Bloomberg News, some countries — including Saudi Arabia and Oman — have canceled all international flights for a week due to panic over the new strain of the virus.

The new, mutated strain of the virus was discovered in September and sparked fears that it was even more contagious than COVID-19; however, some experts caution that it is too early to make such a determination with any level of certainty and that it is normal for viruses to mutate.

However, whether the virus is actually more contagious than COVID-19 or not, the British government has warned that it is spreading ""out of control,"" particularly in the southern areas of England and Wales, which have seen huge increases in the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the last few weeks.

The sudden closure of travel to and from the U.K. has disrupted shipping, as trucks bearing containers lined up at the port of Dover with nowhere to go.

During the course of announcing a series of strict new lockdown measures on Saturday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the new virus is up to 70% more transmissible than COVID-19, and Italy's foreign minister alleges that confirmed cases of the new virus have shown up on the European mainland. Health officials in Europe have also conceded that the prevalence and spread of the new virus may negatively impact the efficacy of the coronavirus vaccines that are currently being distributed by Pfizer and Moderna, although it is too early to determine that for certain.

The new strain of the virus was initially discovered via genome sequencing in a British patient in September and was initially believed not to be a source of serious concern. However, the extent to which this mutation has spread has caused serious concern, particularly within the European continent, about interaction with the U.K.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cosmopolitan-obesity-coronavirus-backlash,2020-12-21
COVID-19 patients' ICU death rates are quickly dropping: Study,"ICU patients who are being treated for coronavirus are dying less often than they were when compared to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

What are the details?

New research published in medical journal Anaesthesia reports that a significant decrease in COVID-19 mortality has occurred since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.



Researchers add that the decrease is at least partially due to better hospital care.

The study is based on analysis of 24 studies that involved more than 10,000 patients across Asia, Europe, and North America.

The research, led by Professor Tim Cook of England's Royal United Hospitals Bath, revealed that the overall mortality rate of coronavirus ICU patients fell from approximately 60 percent since the end of March to 42 percent by the end of May.

Cook is also a consultant in anesthesia and intensive care medicine at Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust.

Cook and other study authors said that ""rapid learning that has taken place on a global scale due to the prompt publication of clinical reports early in the pandemic"" has impacted the disease's mortality rate for the better.

""It may also be that ICU admission criteria have changed over time, for example, with greater pressure on ICUs early in the pandemic surge,"" authors wrote.

The study added, ""There were no significant effects of geographical location, but reported ICU mortality fell over time. Optimistically, as the pandemic progresses, we may be coping better with COVID-19.""

The study also notes that its key findings regarding COVID-19 and ICU stints are likely to indicate that lengthy ICU stays take time to be reflected in the data. The research points out that 20 percent of U.K. ICU admissions have lasted more than 28 days, while 9 percent have gone beyond 42 days.

""The important message, however, is that as the pandemic has progressed and all these factors combine, survival of patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 has significantly improved,"" the study added.

Cook, in a statement of his own, said, ""The important message is that as the pandemic has progressed and various factors combine, survival of patients admitted to ICU has significantly improved."" He also cautioned, however, that while mortality rates in ICU patients seem to be decreasing, the disease is still more dangerous and damaging when compared to other viruses that cause pneumonias.

""The in-ICU mortality from COVID-19, at around 40 per cent, remains almost twice that seen in ICU admissions with other viral pneumonias, at 22%,"" the report added.

Anything else?

Dr. Eric Cioe Pena, director of global health at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, New York, issued a statement on the research, warning people against complacency.

In a statement to Health Day, Pena said, ""Any successful treatment, when not coupled with good public health measures to keep the new case rate below the limit of existing health care resources, will erase any gains made over the last few months by simply overwhelming the ICUs that have just become better at treating COVID-19.""

Pena added that the study, on the whole, ""rightly concludes something that we expect: As we learned more about this virus and its effect on the critically ill, we became better at treating it and its complications.""

"Worldwide COVID-19 deaths linked to obesity, new study says","The vast majority of worldwide COVID-19 deaths have been in countries that have high obesity levels, according to a new study involving scientists, medical professionals, and researchers from over 50 regional and national obesity associations.

Analysis by the World Obesity Federation found that 2.2 million of the 2.5 million global coronavirus deaths, or about 90%, were in countries with high levels of obesity. For the study, researchers examined COVID-19 mortality data from Johns Hopkins University and the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory.

In nations where at least 50% of adults are overweight, COVID-19 death rates spiked 10 times higher. Tim Lobstein, senior policy adviser to the WOF and the study's author, said the death rates in countries with large obese populations were ""dramatic.""

""The report, released ahead of world obesity day on Thursday, did not find a single example of a country where less than 40 percent of the population was overweight having high death rates,"" the Financial Times reported. ""On the other hand, no country with high death rates — at least 100 per 100,000 — had less than 50 percent of its population overweight.""

The United States has 152.49 coronavirus deaths per 100,000, and 67.9% of adults overweight. The United Kingdom has 184 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000, and 63.7% of adults overweight, according to the WHO. For comparison, Vietnam has the lowest coronavirus death rate in the world at 0.04 deaths per 100,000, and the second-lowest level of overweight people at only 18.3% of the adult population.

Lobstein applauded countries such as Japan and South Korea, who ""prioritized public health across a range of measures, including population weight, and it has paid off in the pandemic.""

Age has been the biggest predictor of severe outcomes regarding coronavirus infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states: ""Risk for severe illness with COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk.""

Now the World Obesity Federation proclaims that the results of the research ""shows for the first time that overweight populations come a close second"" to advanced age. The WOF calls for obese individuals to be prioritized for the coronavirus vaccine like the elderly are currently being prioritized.

""[This] must act as a wake-up call to governments globally,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the Financial Times. ""The correlation between obesity and mortality rates from COVID-19 is clear and compelling.""

""Investment in public health and coordinated, international action to tackle the root causes of obesity is one of the best ways for countries to build resilience in health systems post-pandemic,"" Ghebreyesus added. ""We urge all countries to seize this moment.""

"Accidental COVID-19 laboratory-leak theory must be taken seriously and investigated, leading scientists declare","The theory that the novel coronavirus was unleashed upon the world through a laboratory leak must be taken seriously until proven wrong by a data-driven investigation, Reuters reported, citing a group of leading scientists.

What are the details?

The outlet focused on a Friday letter from 18 scientists that was published in the journal Science indicating ""more investigation is still needed to determine the origin of the pandemic.""

Authors of the letter include Ravindra Gupta, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Cambridge; Jesse Bloom, who studies the evolution of viruses at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; and David Relman, professor of microbiology at Stanford.

Their letter states that ""theories of accidental release from a lab and [animal-to-human transmission] both remain viable,"" and that ""knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.""

Lab-leak theory not taken seriously enough

The scientists who penned the letter called attention to the findings of a China–World Health Organization joint study released in November that indicated animal-to-human virus transmission from an intermediate host was ""likely to very likely"" while a laboratory incident was ""extremely unlikely.""

However, the letter states that ""the two theories were not given balanced consideration. Only 4 of the 313 pages of the report and its annexes addressed the possibility of a laboratory accident"" and that WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said as much while offering ""to provide additional resources to fully evaluate the possibility.""

The scientists who penned the letter indicated they possess ""relevant expertise"" on the subject and that they ""agree with the WHO director-general, the United States, and 13 other countries, and the European Union that greater clarity about the origins of this pandemic is necessary and feasible to achieve.""

""A proper investigation should be transparent, objective, data-driven, inclusive of broad expertise, subject to independent oversight, and responsibly managed to minimize the impact of conflicts of interest,"" the letter adds. ""Public health agencies and research laboratories alike need to open their records to the public. Investigators should document the veracity and provenance of data from which analyses are conducted and conclusions drawn, so that analyses are reproducible by independent experts.""

The letter from the scientists ended with kudos to China, saying that ""in this time of unfortunate anti-Asian sentiment in some countries, we note that at the beginning of the pandemic, it was Chinese doctors, scientists, journalists, and citizens who shared with the world crucial information about the spread of the virus — often at great personal cost.""

Anything else?

The notion that COVID-19 was leaked from a Wuhan, China, laboratory has long been a point of contention. Reports emerged in April 2020 reflecting that very theory.

Former President Donald Trump said last spring he was very confident that the coronavirus originated from a Wuhan virology lab, as did the majority of American intelligence agencies and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

In September, Twitter reportedly suspended the account of Chinese virologist Dr. Li-Meng Yan just hours after she told Fox News host Tucker Carlson that China intentionally manufactured and released the COVID-19 virus.

And just prior to President Joe Biden taking office in January, the U.S. State Department said it had new evidence possibly pointing to the coronavirus coming from a Wuhan lab — and that Chinese lab researchers might have been infected with COVID-19 before the first identified case of the outbreak.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/covid-deaths-obesity-study,2021-05-14
"Study says vaccinated people easily spread Delta variant in households, COVID vaccine protection wanes earlier than previously believed","The Delta variant of COVID-19 can transmit easily from vaccinated people to members of their households, a year-long British study found. Scientists at the Imperial College London published a study in the Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal on Thursday that discovered that the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine wanes earlier than previously believed.

The study involved 621 people in the U.K. and found that their peak viral load was similar regardless of vaccination status.

The study found that of 205 household contacts of people who had the Delta infection, 38% of household contacts who were unvaccinated tested positive for COVID-19, and 25% of vaccinated contacts tested positive for the Delta variant of coronavirus.

""By carrying out repeated and frequent sampling from contacts of COVID-19 cases, we found that vaccinated people can contract and pass on infection within households, including to vaccinated household members,"" Dr. Anika Singanayagam, co-lead author of the study, said.



Ajit Lalvani, a professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London who co-led the study, said, ""Vaccines are critical to controlling the pandemic, as we know they are very effective at preventing serious illness and death from COVID-19. However, our findings show that vaccination alone is not enough to prevent people from being infected with the Delta variant and spreading it in household settings.""

""The ongoing transmission we are seeing between vaccinated people makes it essential for unvaccinated people to get vaccinated to protect themselves from acquiring infection and severe COVID-19, especially as more people will be spending time inside in close proximity during the winter months,"" Lalvani added.

The study revealed that the median length of time since vaccination that the vaccinated infected contacts were recruited for the study was 101 days compared to an average of 64 days for uninfected contacts. This could point to a timeframe when COVID-19 vaccines lose their protective immunity — which is a much shorter time period than previously reported.



Lalvani, who is the director of the Health Protection Research Unit in Respiratory Infections for the National Institute for Health Research, was shocked by how quickly the vaccine lost its efficacy and advised people to get booster shots.

""What we found, surprisingly, was that by three months after the second vaccine dose, the risk of acquiring infection was high compared with being more recently vaccinated,"" Lalvani stated. ""This suggests that vaccine induced protection is already waning by about three months after the second dose.""

""We found that susceptibility to infection increased already within a few months after the second vaccine dose — so those eligible for COVID-19 booster shots should get them promptly,"" he recommended.

Imperial epidemiologist Neil Ferguson said, ""Immunity wanes over time, it is imperfect, so you still get transmission happening, and that is why the booster program is so important.""

Singanayagam hypothesized, ""Our findings provide important insights into... why the Delta variant is continuing to cause high COVID-19 case numbers around the world, even in countries with high vaccination rates.""

In April, Pfizer and BioNTech proclaimed that their COVID-19 vaccine provides protection for at least six months.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that eligible people get the booster at least six months after their second shot. The CDC says those who are eligible to receive a booster shot include anyone age 65 and older and anyone over 18 who is in long-term care settings, has an underlying medical condition, or works/lives in high-risk settings.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/covid-laboratory-leak-taken-seriously,2021-10-29
Dan Crenshaw pummels Jen Rubin on her claims that Trump bungled coronavirus response,"Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) took on Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin over her claims that President Donald Trump bungled the response to the coronavirus pandemic and cost the U.S. trillions in tax funds and many American lives.

Rubin made the accusations in a Washington Post editorial that Crenshaw dismantled in a detailed Twitter thread.

""STOP. REWRITING. HISTORY,"" the conservative Texan tweeted.

""Instead of attempting to spin the public into a hateful, frightened frenzy, let's try reporting some facts with the correct context,"" he said.



Crenshaw pointed out that the World Health Organization was downplaying the threat of the coronavirus on March 3, the date Rubin opined that Trump should have shut the economy down.

""Would the America public really have accepted millions of jobs destroyed for a virus that had infected just 102 people by March 2? Especially considering Italy would not lock down until March 10th, Spain on March 14th, and the UK on March 23?"" he asked.

Crenshaw then took issue with Rubin's quote: ""Because we did not act earlier to ramp up testing at a massive scale and prepare our health-care system, social distancing — shutting down most of the economy — was required.""

Not sure where the magic COVID-19 testing switch is. The truth is that long-standing regulations - in place for decades - prevented us from doing so. https://t.co/fDtnnbLg0i

""First, you argue that we should have shut down the economy weeks before we did. Then, you argue that the shut down, resulting job loss, and economic devastation are his fault too. Which is it? You can't have it both ways,"" Crenshaw continued.

""Your analysis makes it seem like our government deliberately decided not to buy more PPE. The truth is there was a global production shortage when China began stopping exports, and demand soared. This is still happening,"" he added.

Crenshaw cited headlines from the Washington Post, where Rubin contributes, to support his argument.

""When it's all said and done, this bad-faith analysis isn't fact-based and lacks important context,"" Crenshaw said in the last tweet of the thread.

When it's all said and done, this bad-faith analysis isn't fact-based and lacks important context. Hating Trump is not an excuse for lazy argumentation and emotional reasoning.

UK authorities install knife surrender box to help ‘knife control’ efforts. It went as well as you thought it might.,"Avon and Somerset Police are seeking a group of men who broke into a knife surrender box and took the bin's contents.

The bin — which was bolted to the side of the building like a Sharps Disposal Container in the doctor's office — was filled with a bunch of knives that had recently been surrendered.

What are the details?

According to a report in the U.K.'s Metro, the theft took place March 13, and the suspects were caught on a CCTV camera. Police had been collecting the knives through the surrender box as a move to promote knife control, after a ""52 percent spike in knife crime"" over the last year.

Just a day after local authorities installed the knife box, a group of men broke into the bin and stole all the knives.

""On the evening of March 13, the knife surrender bin in Weston was broken into by a number of people,"" PC Jon Biggins told the outlet. ""The contents were recovered a short distance away, and the whole incident was caught on CCTV.

""We are in the process of identifying those responsible in order to bring about a prosecution,"" Biggins added.

The outlet reported that the Avon and Somerset Constabulary implemented the use of the knife boxes as part of 2015's ""Operation Sceptre"" — a nationwide effort to address knife crime. The Metro noted that about 1,000 knives have been surrendered to the knife bins over the last few years.

What else?

In 2017, U.K. law enforcement introduced bins with Cookie Monster's visage printed on them, which read, ""Only Cowards Carry"" to raise ""weapon awareness.""

In 2018, London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted about knife violence, writing, ""No excuses: there is never a reason to carry a knife. Anyone who does will be caught, and they will feel the full force of the law.""

He also implemented ""knife control"" to combat the crimes.

That same year, The Evening Standard reported that 21,484 people were either prosecuted or cautioned for knife offenses in England and Wales in 2018.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/crenshaw-blasts-jen-rubin-trump-coronavirus,2019-04-03
Daily Mail blasts U.K. government for heavily redacting emails related to origins of COVID-19,"Details of a teleconference on the COVID-19 pandemic response held in early 2020 between leading scientists including Dr. Anthony Fauci remain shrouded in secrecy after the U.K. government heavily redacted documents requested by a newspaper.

The U.K. Daily Mail submitted a Freedom of Information request to its government for emails relating to the secretive meeting between British and American health officials. The requestwas answered by a cache of 32 emails that were almost entirely redacted, leaving the details of what was discussed on that teleconference call unknown, the paper reported.

What is known is that in the early days of the pandemic, a group of scientists led by Fauci, Dr. Jeremy Farrar, the director of the London-based megacharity Wellcome Trust, and Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance, among others, held the call ""in total confidence"" and that after the call, the public campaign by many of the participants to stifle discussion of the lab-leak theory intensified.

Before the conference call, some of the world's top virologists who participated had raised concerns that the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus had features that ""(potentially) look engineered"" — but after this call those scientists reversed their opinions and publicly condemned the hypothesis that COVID-19 escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology as a conspiracy theory.

Since the call was held on February 1, 2020, EcoHealth Alliance's ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology have come to light, and Fauci's repeated assurances that the U.S. National Institutes of Health did not fund risky virus research at the Wuhan lab have been shown to be false. It is in the public interest to learn what was discussed on the call, to know if top health officials had a conflict of interest in publicly discrediting the lab-leak theory.

However, the Daily Mail reports how the U.K. government is obscuring the details of the call:

The Mail on Sunday requested emails, minutes and notes on the call between Sir Patrick Vallance – Britain's chief scientific adviser – and its organisers Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust medical charity, and Anthony Fauci, the US infectious diseases expert and presidential adviser.



Yet when the documents were released they had page after page redacted with thick lines of black ink by Whitehall officials. Even the names of experts copied in on discussions were blocked – and exchanges as trivial as one Edinburgh biologist's 'thank you' for being invited – leaving only a few basic details about the call visible.



The lines left intact include a demand for the discussions, involving 13 participants around the world, to be conducted in 'total confidence', and an intriguing email line suggesting 'we need to talk about the backbone too, not just the insert'.



That was possibly sent by Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans, a member of the World Health Organisation team that produced a widely criticised report into Covid's origins.

According to the Daily Mail, a request for communications on the origins of COVID-19 between Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K.'s chief scientific adviser, Farrar, and Fauci were ""rejected on cost grounds,"" even though the government said it had the information requested.

""Such absurd state secrecy is highly contemptuous towards taxpayers and to a world that wants to know what caused this devastating pandemic to guard against similar catastrophes in the future,"" the paper complained.

""Such official obfuscation only serves to fuel concerns over a possible cover-up on Covid's origins – and about Britain's strange silence on issues of such global importance, which surprises some close international allies.""

Reporters first learned of the conference call from a Freedom of Information Act request for Fauci's work-related emails issued by BuzzFeed News. Emails detailing the specifics of what was discussed were redacted. In an interview with USA Today, Fauci said the call was a ""productive back-and-forth conversation where some on the call felt [SARS-CoV-2] could possibly be an engineered virus.""

Details of the call were also discussed by Farrar in his book on the pandemic, where admits to being ""50-50"" on the question of the lab-leak theory after the Feb. 1 call, even though days later he would sign a highly influential statement by leading scientists condemning the lab-leak hypothesis as a conspiracy theory.

Another participant on the call, Dr. Kristian Andersen, a virologist at Scripps Research, had studied the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and wrote in an email to Fauci just before the call that ""some of the features (potentiallly) look engineered."" He also said that several experts who had looked at the virus ""find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory,"" though he would later claim that these scientists changed their opinions as new evidence convinced them it was more likely the virus originated in nature.

A mere three days after the conference call, Andersen emailed Daszak to strategize about pushing back against ""crackpot theories"" suggesting ""this virus being somehow engineered with intent"" when that was ""demonstrably not the case.""

The public ought to know why these scientists changed their opinions so rapidly in light of the fact that many of them were connected to 2014 and 2019 NIH research grants for gain-of-function research in China.

Gain-of-function research involves genetically manipulating a virus to make it more transmissible among mammals, particularly among humans, to study how virus might evolve in nature and develop vaccines or strategies to prevent a pandemic. The 2014 research grant was funded at a time when the U.S. had established a moratorium on federal funding for such research, which had been deemed risky because of the possibility that a lab accident might cause a pandemic.

The 2019 grant proposal revealed that Daszak's group EcoHealth Alliance had sub-awarded NIH money for bat coronavirus research in Wuhan, China.

Documents published by DRASTIC further revealed that in 2018, EcoHealth Alliance applied for a grant to study pathogens to create infectious bat coronaviruses in the Wuhan lab that would be altered to boost their ability to infect human cells. Daszak had proposed to work with Shi Zhengli, the top virologist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, to insert ""appropriate human specific cleavage sites"" into SARS-like viruses, demonstrating that EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan lab were interested in conducting exactly the kind of research that is hypothesized to be related to the origins of COVID-19.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/crooks-raid-uk-knife-surrender-box,2021-10-04
Daily Mail pulls Jedediah Bilah op-ed arguing COVID vax mandates are 'unjustified',"A Daily Mail op-ed arguing that U.S. President Joe Biden's COVID-19 vaccine mandates are unjustified and discriminatory was published on Monday and then taken down by the outlet without explanation.

Conservative commentator Jedediah Bilah, a former Fox News host, said Tuesday that the Daily Mail solicited an op-ed from her on how vaccine mandates are facing resistance. After writing an article that got approved and was published, she said the outlet pulled it down without notifying her.

""I was approached by the Daily Mail to write an opinion piece on how Covid-19 vaccine mandates are facing resistance from freedom advocates, pushback by courts and companies, and non-compliance. I was asked to discuss my opposition to the mandates and why I believe they're ineffective. I agreed to the topic and wrote a column,"" Bilah said in a statement.

""The column was approved, published online, then pulled down overnight without notification,"" she said, providing a link to an Internet Archive snapshot of her op-ed taken while it was still live.

In her lengthy op-ed, Bilah called Biden a ""cowardly president"" and accused him of using ""unhinged, increasingly divisive rhetoric because coercion wasn't getting the compliance he had hope for.""

She also criticized use of the term ""anti-vaxxer"" to describe anyone opposed to regulations mandating vaccination, noting that many people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 nevertheless support the rights of unvaccinated people to refuse vaccination.

""Good faith objections to vaccine mandates are met with unscientific ridicule,"" Bilah observed, noting that in a recent appearance on ""The View"" to promote her new book, she was accused of spreading ""misinformation"" after stating that the vaccines do not prevent COVID-19 transmission, though she said it was ""created to prevent severity of disease and to prevent hospitalization.""

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance warns that the ""risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated people cannot be completely eliminated as long as there is continued community transmission of the virus.”



""Early data suggest infections in fully vaccinated persons are more commonly observed with the Delta variant than with other SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, data show fully vaccinated persons are less likely than unvaccinated persons to acquire SARS-CoV-2, and infections with the Delta variant in fully vaccinated persons are associated with less severe clinical outcomes,"" the CDC states.



""Infections with the Delta variant in vaccinated persons potentially have reduced transmissibility than infections in unvaccinated persons, although additional studies are needed,"" the agency adds.

Last August, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told CNN that fully vaccinated people who get a COVID-19 breakthrough infection can still spread the virus to others, even if they do not show symptoms.

""I am not anti-vaxx,"" Bilah wrote.

""I am fighting for each of us, with our unique medical histories, risk factors, and beliefs, to have the chance to make the best decision for ourselves,"" she argued.

""Because both the vaccinated and unvaccinated can get and transmit the disease, vaccine mandates are not only unjustified, but also promote active discrimination.""



The Daily Mail did not immediately respond when asked why Bilah's op-ed was removed.

UK teenager brutally stabbed two sisters to death over a satanic pact to win the lottery,"A teenager was convicted and sentenced for the brutal stabbing murder of two women over a satanic pact he believed he had made with a demon to win the lottery.

Police said 19-year-old Danyal Hussein attacked the two sisters, Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, in June 2020 as they were celebrating a birthday in a park in London.



Hussein stabbed Henry eight times and stabbed Smallman 28 times.

He later said to police that he had made a pact with a demon to kill six women every six months. In return, he believed that the demon would make him win the Mega Millions Super Jackpot lottery.

When police searched his home, they found a hand-written ""agreement"" where Hussein outlined what he believed Satan wanted in return for the lottery victory.

""Perform a minimum of six sacrifices every six months for as long as I am free and physically capable,"" the note read.



""Sacrifice only women,"" the chilling note continued. ""Build a temple for you.""

Hussein signed the pact in blood and left a signature spot for the demon open to sign.

Part of the pact also asked for protection for Hussein from police investigation. He was convicted in July 2020 for the two murders.

On Thursday, Hussein was given two sentences of 35 years in prison each, to be served concurrently. In Britain, people under the age of 21 cannot be sentenced to life in prison. The court also said that it decided on a shorter sentence for Hussein because he was diagnosed on the autism spectrum.

A report from the BBC documented how Hussein might have been directly inspired to commit the murders through an online forum dedicated to magic spell casting that specifically tells how to make online pacts with demons.

Assassination of British conservative lawmaker declared a terror attack by UK police,"The assassination of a British conservative lawmaker was declared a terror attack by police on Friday.

69-year-old Parliament member Sir David Amess was stabbed multiple times by a man who walked into a ""meet and greet"" Amess was having with his constituents in a Methodist church.

Officials said Amess died at the scene.

Police arrested a 25-year-old suspect and recovered a knife at the church.

""The early investigation has revealed a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism,"" read a statement from Metropolitan Police at New Scotland Yard.

Official sources said that the suspect arrested was a British national with Somali heritage.

""It will be for investigators to determine whether or not this is a terrorist incident. But as always, they will keep an open mind,"" said Essex Police Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington.

Police went on to say that they believed the suspect acted alone, but that the investigation was ongoing. The identity of the suspect has not been released.

This is the second attack in Europe this week that is suspected to be motivated by Islamic terrorism. On Wednesday a man armed with a bow and arrow attacked random strangers in a town near the capital of Norway, killing 5 and seriously injuring 3 others. Authorities say the suspect in that attack had been flagged for possible radicalism and had posted a video about his Islamist faith containing a threat.

Amess was first elected to parliament in 1983 and is survived by his wife, Julia, and five children. He was known as a champion for animal rights, brexit, and the pro-life cause. He was also one of the longest-serving members in the chamber.

""I think all our hearts are full of shock and deep sadness today,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a video statement about the murder of Amess. ""He was one of the kindest, nicest, most gentle people in politics.""

"Defense sec under Obama, Bush admits Trump 'got it right' on China: 'He basically awakened Americans'","Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served in the Cabinets of both Barack Obama and George W. Bush, admitted in a new interview that former President Donald Trump's assessment of China was correct.

Conversely, Gates was heavily critical of President Joe Biden's foreign policy competence.

What did Gates say about Trump?

During a ""60 Minutes"" interview with Anderson Cooper, Gates explained that he believes China poses the greatest military and economic threat to the U.S. — and that Trump correctly diagnosed the threat.

""I think this is a place where President Trump got it right. He basically awakened Americans — and I would say especially the business community — to a China that the assumptions about which we had gotten wrong,"" Gates admitted.

""The assumption for 40 years was that a richer China would be a freer China — and that's clearly not going to happen,"" Gates explained.

""But there's another piece of this puzzle with China and that is the economic side. Chinese now manage something like three dozen major ports around the world. They are the biggest trading partner of more than half of South America. They are everywhere,"" Gates continued. ""And what are we doing in these non-military arenas to compete with the Chinese?""

Robert Gates: The 2021 60 Minutes Interview www.youtube.com

Gates' remarks are even more significant considering that he detests the former president.

Gates has described Trump as a ""thin skinned, temperamental, shoot from the hip and lip, uninformed commander-in-chief."" Gates told Cooper that he would not edit that criticism and expressed hope that Trump does not run for president in 2024.

What about Biden?

In the interview, Gates also reaffirmed criticisms of Biden.

In 2014, Gates said Biden ""has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades."" Gates told Cooper of Biden, ""He opposed every one of Ronald Reagan's military programs to contest the Soviet Union. He opposed the first Gulf War. That list goes on.""

Gates also said Biden made a ""mistake"" for how he facilitated the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which resulted in the Taliban regaining power and a terrorist attack that killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghan civilians.

The former defense secretary, however, conceded that Biden did agree with him on issues relating to Libya, China, and Russia. Gates also praised Biden for his recent submarine deal with Australia, which angered France.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/david-amess-terror-islam-uk,2021-10-18
Democrats call on CDC and FAA to impose vaccine requirement on domestic air travel,"Democratic lawmakers on Monday called on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Federal Aviation Administration to implement new requirements for air travelers to show proof of vaccination or negative COVID-19 test results in order to fly domestically in the United States.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and House Reps. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Don Beyer (D-Va.), and Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), wrote a letter to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson urging them to act quickly, as Americans prepare to travel for the holidays and the Omicron variant poses a ""major public health threat.""

""We urge you to implement new requirements for airline passengers to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result to board a domestic flight,"" the Democrats wrote.

They said that the additional coronavirus restrictions would ""improve public health and address concerns that passengers have about flying.""

""International travelers arriving in the United States must already submit COVID-19-related documentation to airlines before boarding their flight, and airlines are demonstrating they have the capacity to implement these vaccine and testing requirements. For example, Delta Airlines and American Airlines have adopted their FlyReady and VeriFLY verification systems, and United Airlines has introduced similar requirements. CDC has also already published guidance on what types of COVID-10 tests and proof of COVID-19 vaccination are acceptable for this process,"" the lawmakers wrote.

Earlier this month, the Biden administration tightened restrictions on international travelers, requiring that anyone outside the U.S. seeking to fly here show a negative pre-departure COVID-19 test taken the day before they board a plane to the U.S. The restrictions were adopted as a pre-emptive measure taken to reduce transmission of the Omicron variant.

Other countries are enacting strict travel restrictions in response to fear of Omicron, which evidence suggests transmits between people rapidly.



Germany on Saturday announced that it will soon classify the United Kingdom as an ""area of variant of concern"" because of Omicron's spread. The designation is the highest risk category defined by German officials and would ban travel from the U.K. for all but German citizens, who must quarantine for two weeks if they return home. France issued a similar travel ban a week before, and more European countries are expected to follow suit.

Israel's health ministry on Sunday added several European countries to its COVID-19 ""red list"" and recommended banning Israeli residents from traveling to the United States. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has promised to continue imposing travel restrictions to avoid further lockdowns as the nation deals with its fifth wave of COVID-19.

Retired Kansas farmer gets honorary degree after his touching gesture toward NYC medical professionals,"Dennis Ruhnke, a retired farmer from Kansas, has been awarded an honorary degree from Kansas State University after his gesture toward New York City medical professionals went viral last month.

Ruhnke first made the news when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) tweeted out a picture of a letter Ruhnke wrote along with an enclosed unused N95 mask that he had kept from his days as a farmer. Cuomo's tweet has had more than 40,000 retweets and 200,000 likes.

In the letter, which Cuomo praised as ""humanity at its best,"" Ruhnke says, ""I seriously doubt that you will read this letter as I know you are busy beyond belief with the disaster that has befallen our country. We currently (as of March 26, 2020) are a nation in crisis. Of that there is no doubt.""



Ruhnke states in the letter that he is ""hunkered down in N.E. Kansas with my wife who has but one lung and occasional problems with her remaining lung. She also has diabetes. We are in our 70's now and frankly I am afraid for her.""

Ruhnke went on to state, ""Enclosed find a solitary N-95 mask left over from my farming days. It has never been used. If you could, would you please give this mask to a nurse or doctor in your city. I have kept four masks for my immediate family. Please keep on doing what you do so well, which is to lead.""

Ruhnke's story came to the attention of Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly (D), who attended a presentation Tuesday in which Ruhke was awarded an honorary degree from Kansas State University.

According to a post on Kelly's Facebook page, ""In 1971, [Ruhnke] was two credits away from earning his degree in agriculture when his father passed away. He chose to leave school to take care of his mother and the family farm. Dennis' kindness and lifelong career in agriculture make him more than qualified to receive a degree.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-call-on-cdc-and-faa-to-impose-vaccine-requirement-on-domestic-air-travel,2020-05-06
"Fla. Gov. DeSantis blasts press for double standard in COVID-19 coverage: 'You don't care as much when it's a peaceful protest, a Biden election'","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) defended sports fans who celebrated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Super Bowl victory. DeSantis ripped the media for alleged hypocrisy after being critical of the Super Bowl LV celebration in Tampa, with regard to safety during the coronavirus pandemic. DeSantis slammed the media's perceived double standard for seemingly giving a pass to crowds that assembled at a ""peaceful protest"" or a ""Biden election.""

Following the Buccaneers' 31-9 triumph over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, fans flooded the streets of Tampa to revel in the Super Bowl LV win. There were thousands of maskless people assembling in large crowds, which was covered heavily by the media, hinting that the Super Bowl would become a ""superspreader"" event.

Jane Castor, the Democratic mayor of Tampa, vowed to have the Tampa Police Department ""handle"" maskless football fans.

On Wednesday, the media asked DeSantis if enough was being done to stop the spread of COVID-19 during the celebrations, especially since there is an increase in cases of the B.1.1.7 variant of the COVID-19 virus, mostly known as the '""U.K. variant.""

""The media's worried about that, obviously. You guys really love that,"" DeSantis replied during the news conference in Venice, Florida, regarding vaccinating senior citizens.



""You don't care as much if it's a 'peaceful protest' ... and then it's fine,"" the Republican governor pointed out. ""You don't care as much if they're celebrating a Biden election. You only care about it if it's people you don't like.""

""So, I'm a Bucs fan. I'm damn proud of what they did on Sunday night,"" he proudly declared.

DeSantis then explained that the current coronavirus vaccines would be effective against the U.K. variant.

""In terms of the U.K. variant, here's what we know, we know, based on all the evidence, that these vaccines are going to be effective against that,"" DeSantis said. ""And that's really the main concern, I mean we're getting our seniors vaccinated. We've not seen any data, or any evidence to suggest that these vaccines are not effective and so if we get the seniors vaccinated.""

In the United States, Florida has the most confirmed cases of the U.K. variant, with at least 343 infections identified overall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as reported by WBBH-TV.

Overall, cases of the coronavirus are dropping fast in Florida. COVID-19 cases were down 21.3% last week compared to the previous week in the Sunshine State.

""Current COVID-19 hospitalizations have been declining from a high of more than 7,600 in January,"" the Orlando Sentinel reported.

During the Super Bowl, DeSantis was spotted without a face mask and questioned by the media. Marc Caputo, a politics reporter for Politico, shared the Florida governor's response to being maskless.



""Someone said, 'Hey, you were at the Super Bowl without a mask,'"" DeSantis reportedly said on Monday. ""But how the hell am I going to be able to drink a beer with a mask on? Come on. I had to watch the Bucs win.""

The Super Bowl celebrations in Tampa were relatively peaceful. There were reports of a few street signs being removed, some smashed fences, and electric scooters tossed into retention ponds, according to WTSP.



""I really think overall it went well,"" Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan said. ""When you look at the big picture, the thousands of people who are celebrating, a very small group of people cause problems.""



""I think we made a total of 18 arrests for the entire game and evening, so that's what we're sifting through; exactly what those arrest were,"" Dugan said. ""But, we were stretched thin. Our officers are working 16-hour days.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dennis-ruhnke-honorary-degree-covid-coronavirus,2021-02-11
"Despite 'correction,' Wuhan virologist's 2015 paper on bat-to-human coronaviruses still references mystery strain","A scientific paper concerning the creation of a novel infectious pathogen by way of gain-of-function research — one that could infect human cells — was published in ""Nature Medicine"" in 2015. It documented how researchers manufactured a ""chimeric virus"" by placing the ""spike of bat coronavirus SHC014"" into the molecular structure of the SARS virus, which could replicate in human airway cells and possibly be transmitted to humans.

That paper, by University of North Carolina epidemiologist Ralph Baric and Wuhan Institute of Virology top coronavirus researcher Zhengli Shi, has been subject to two corrections, the latter of which contains a glaring aberration.

The first correction was made in April 2016, noting that the paper's authors omitted to mention that they had been partly funded by scandal-plagued EcoHealth Alliance, which in turn was partly funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development.



This funding came through despite an earlier announcement by the Obama administration that a pause had been placed on the funding of any new studies involving gain-of-function experiments with influenza, SARS, and MERS viruses. The paper's authors noted that this study was initiated before the pause on gain-of-function research and that its continuation was approved by the National Institutes of Health.

The second correction was made in July 2020, noting that ""the sequence of the mouse adapted SHC015-MA15 virus had not been deposited in GenBank. The sequence has now been deposited in GenBank under accession number MT308984."" GenBank is the NIH database of all publicly available DNA sequences and their protein translations.

The accession number provided in the correction is connected with ""Mutant SARS coronavirus Urbani clone SARS-Urbani-MA_SHC014-spike, complete genome.""

The sequence referenced in the so-called correction, SHC015-MA15, does not, however, exist; certainly not in the corresponding academic literature.

TheBlaze reached out for comment to Dr. Baric, Dr. Shi, and other researchers involved with this paper, but they have not yet replied.

A senior editor at ""Nature Medicine"" indicated on October 17, ""We are looking into it.""

No correction has yet been made.

The study

The study examined ""the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV,"" which at the time had been circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. The researchers, including a virologist at the Wuhan lab believed to be the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, claimed to have reverse-engineered SARS-CoV to create a ""chimeric virus"" expressing the spike of a bat coronavirus in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone.



By using SARS receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme II, the resultant strain was able to ""replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells."" The study noted that once in a lab mouse's lungs, there was was a notable development of a deadly condition.

The researchers ultimately ""synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate[d] robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo.""

Baric and Shi cautioned in their paper that ""scientific review panels may deem similar studies building chimeric viruses based on circulating strains too risky to pursue, as increased pathogenicity in mammalian models cannot be excluded.""

They emphasized that gain-of-function research posed a risk of ""creating more dangerous pathogens.""

Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, suggested that Baric, Shi, and the others involved in this study created a virus that ""grows remarkably well"" in human cells. ""If the virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory.""

Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University, stated that the ""only impact of this work is the creation, in a lab, of a new, non-natural risk.""

Shi claimed last year that her lab ""has never conducted or cooperated in conducting GOF experiments that enhance the virulence of viruses.""

Newsweek contradicted Shi's claim in 2020, noting that Shi's WIV had been being conducting GOF research for years.

The NIH later confirmed that EcoHealth and the WIV conducted GOF research on bat coronaviruses.

Concerning the 2015 study, Baric later claimed that ""the only gain-of-function that occurred in that virus is that we changed its antigenicity. ... And what the data tells you is that any vaccine or antibody that you'd made against the original virus from 2003 wasn't going to protect the public against this new virus if it should emerge.""

An article published on November 12, 2015, in Nature indicated that Baric planned to conduct further studies with the SHC014 virus in non-human primates.

"Despite Starbucks’ pro-trans efforts, transgender employees are complaining about how they’ve been treated","Starbucks coffee has tried present the image of a corporation that supports transgender ideology through its policies and its public relations efforts, but some employees say that those espoused values haven't always played out for them in the workplace.

A report published Thursday at Buzzfeed News details some of the problems that the company's transgender employees have run into while on the job, which include being outed by supervisors and having trouble getting their employee health insurance to cover ""gender affirming"" medical procedures.

The allegations leveled against the coffee company stand in contrast to the pro-trans image that it has attempted to craft over the years. The company announced that it would add sex change surgeries to its list of covered health benefits in 2013 and expanded what would be covered under that policy in 2018.

Tucker Jace Webb, described being greeted by a ""dead name"" — i.e., the name a transgender person used to go by — on the company's software for new hires and was told there was nothing to be done without a legal name change. Webb also told the outlet about how the company's health insurance wouldn't cover a transgender surgery and about being outed by a supervisor without consent.



A former employee who started working at Starbucks in 2018 also described being denied three times while trying to get a ""top surgery"" covered by company insurance.

""It was a really frustrating time and I started to not enjoy going to work as much,"" the former employee told the outlet. ""It is a very new policy they'd just come out with in the past year or two, so I don't think they realized the high demand of their employees.""



Yet another employee, Elaine Cao, recalled difficulties with getting reimbursed by company insurance for a transgender procedure that was paid for up-front, as being intentionally ""misgendered"" by a supervisor who the employees said later quit without disciplinary action being taken.

Cao says that while people in the company's headquarters may sincerely believe that they're helping their transgender workers, ""they aren't doing enough to make sure that that is the case.""

In a statement to Buzzfeed, a Starbucks spokesperson didn't comment on the individual claims made in the story, but is reaching out to people who have made complaints. The spokesperson also told the outlet that ""intentional misgendering is not acceptable conduct at Starbucks.""

Earlier this week, Starbucks UK made headlines with a video advertisement of a young transgender person being called by their preferred name at one of the company's locations. That ad coincided with the announcement that the company would partner with a charity organization that helps children access hormone treatment, among other things.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/despite-correction-wuhan-virologists-2015-paper-on-bat-to-human-coronaviruses-still-references-mystery-strain,2020-02-07
Diversity exec: Idris Elba TV character 'doesn't have any black friends' so his cop drama Luther 'doesn't feel authentic',"Actor Idris Elba's character on ""Luther,"" a British police drama, ""doesn't feel authentic"" because ""he doesn't have any black friends"" and ""doesn't eat any Caribbean food,"" according a BBC diversity executive, Yahoo Celebrity UK reported.

What are the details?

The outlet reported that the comments came from Miranda Wayland, the BBC's head of creative diversity.

""When [Luther] first came out everybody loved the fact that Idris Elba was in there — a really strong, black character lead,"" Wayland told the MIPTV media conference, according to Yahoo Celebrity UK. ""We all fell in love with him. Who didn't, right? But after you got into about the second series you got kind of like, 'Okay, he doesn't have any black friends, he doesn't eat any Caribbean food, this doesn't feel authentic.""""

Wayland also said, ""It's about making sure that everything around [characters] – their environment, their culture, the set – is absolutely reflective,"" Unilad reported, citing the Times.

White creator of 'Luther' has another view

But Neil Cross, the creator of ""Luther,"" has previously addressed Elba's character, Metro reported, and noted Luther's race wasn't a consideration.

""I have no knowledge or expertise or right to try to tackle in some way the experience of being a black man in modern Britain,"" Cross said, according to Metro. ""It would have been an act of tremendous arrogance for me to try to write a black character. We would have ended up with a slightly embarrassed, ignorant, middle-class, white writer's idea of a black character.""

Here's a recent trailer:

What did the BBC have to say?



In response to Wayland's comments, the BBC told Metro that ""we are tremendously proud"" of the ""Luther"" series and that ""of course people can have open discussions about our shows, but that doesn't mean it's a statement of policy.""

Metro said Wayland was appointed as the network's head of creative diversity in February 2020 ""as part of the corporation's commitment to increasing on-air diversity.""

UK doctor asks Muslim mom to remove niqab to clearly hear about daughter's illness. Now he might lose right to practice medicine.,"A doctor in Great Britain is under investigation for racism and could be forced out of his profession after he ""politely"" asked a Muslim mother to remove her niqab — an Islamic face veil that exposes only the eyes — so he could better hear her describe her daughter's suspected tonsillitis, the Telegraph reported.

What's the background?

Keith Wolverson — a general practice family doctor with 23 years of experience — was working at a walk-in center at Royal Stoke University Hospital in Stoke-on-Trent at the time of the encounter last year and said the woman consented without raising any objection, the paper reported.

But he added that her husband showed up soon after and issued a formal complaint — which indicated the mother said she felt ""victimized and racially discriminated against"" and that Wolverson was ""rude"" and ""gave her a dirty look,"" the Telegraph noted.

In addition, the family alleged that Wolverson refused to continue the consultation until she removed her niqab, the paper added, which the doctor denied.

What happened next?

The General Medical Council sent Wolverson a letter saying he's under investigation for racism and could be kicked out of the profession, the paper said.

The Daily Mirror said the investigation could see Wolverson ""struck off the medical register.""

The GMC said doctors must respect patients' choice of religious dress and consider the potential for upset if patients are asked to expose parts of their bodies they don't want to, the Telegraph noted.

'I'm not racist'

Wolverson told the paper he's found it impossible to get work since last June's incident and is considering tasks such as injecting Botox to make ends meet.

""I'm not racist — this is nothing to do with race, religion, or skin color; it's about clarity of communication,"" Wolverson told The Sun, according to the Telegraph. ""I found it difficult to understand what the woman was saying behind her veil, so [I] politely asked her to remove it. I needed to hear what was wrong with her daughter, so I could offer the safest possible care.""

Wolverson said most of his Muslim patients automatically remove the veil upon entering the consultation room, the paper said, and that the investigation has been a ""major injustice"" and that he ""absolutely no longer"" wants to be a doctor.

In addition, a petition calling for the GMC to ""treat this man fairly and look at all the evidence"" gained over 20,000 signatures in a little over a day, the paper noted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/diversity-exec-idris-elba-tv-character-doesnt-have-any-black-friends-so-his-cop-drama-doesnt-feel-authentic,2019-05-22
Renowned doctor who branded his initials on patients' livers has his medical license revoked,"A U.K. surgeon known for literally making his mark on patients had his license to practice medicine formally revoked this week.

Simon Bramhall, 57, admitted to using an argon beam coagulator — a common device used in surgeries to control bleeding — to autograph his initials on patients' livers in 2013 while working at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, BBC News reported.

On Monday, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) officially struck the once-respected liver, spleen, and pancreas surgeon off the country's medical register. The ruling means that Bramhall can no longer work as a doctor in the U.K.

MPTS records reportedly showed that Bramhall was first suspended in 2013 for marking his ""SB"" initials on two patients' livers during operations in February and August of that year.

One of the autographs, made on a female patient receiving a liver transplant, was reportedly spotted by a consultant surgeon when the patient returned to the hospital for a follow-up surgery a week later after the liver had failed.

According to the Guardian, the 4-centimeter branding was captured in a cell phone photograph. The outlet added that Bramhall at one time told police he branded the organs to relieve tensions during long and difficult transplant operations.

Records showed that neither patient suffered lasting physical damage as a result of the branding, though the female patient reportedly suffered ""significant emotional harm.""

In 2018, Bramhall was given a 12-month community order and fined £10,000 ($13,635) for the brazen actions after pleading guilty to common assault.

He was once again suspended in 2020 for five months after the MPTS concluded his actions amounted to ""professional arrogance of such magnitude that it strayed into criminal behaviour."" But in June 2020, the tribunal ruled the surgeon was no longer impaired and ordered that his suspension be revoked.

Bramhall wasn't in the clear yet, however. Upon another review this week, the tribunal finally determined that further suspension is “insufficient to protect the wider public interest” and said erasure from the medical register would be an “appropriate and proportionate sanction.""

In a ruling, the tribunal reportedly said: “The physical assault of two vulnerable patients whilst unconscious in a clinical setting, one of whom experienced significant and enduring emotional harm, seriously undermines patients’ and the public’s trust and confidence in the medical profession and inevitably brings the profession as a whole into disrepute.”

“The tribunal rejected the submission made on behalf of Mr. Bramhall, that it was to relieve tension. It was an act borne out of a degree of professional arrogance,"" the ruling continued.

Bramhall resigned his job at the Birmingham hospital in 2014. According to USA Today, he was a well-respected surgeon who ""received a series of titles and honors over the years"" and served as a ""lecturer at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, deputy director of the division of medicine at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/doctor-asks-muslim-woman-to-remove-face-veil,2022-01-13
"Doctor diagnoses 23-year-old's cough as COVID-19. Turns out it's actually cancer, and she's lucky to be alive.","A 23-year-old woman from the United Kingdom suffered a devastating cancer diagnosis after her doctor initially diagnosed her persistent cough as that of coronavirus.

What are the details?

Chloe Girardier, a caregiver for the elderly who lives in Harrogate, said that she developed a cough that refused to go away even when treated with antibiotics, inhalers, acid reflux tablets, and rest.

Girardier, according to the U.K.'s Mirror, was originally denied an in-person visit with her doctor and was instead diagnosed with COVID-19.

The cough persisted for several more months.

When she refused to receive an informal, over-the-phone diagnosis and pushed for an X-ray, her fears were confirmed: She had a cancerous mass inside her chest, measuring approximately four inches. She was soon diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

""I had no lumps or any other noticeable signs apart from the continuous cough,"" she said. ""When I started losing weight in October, that's when I really pushed for answers because it was noticeable to everyone around me.""

She added, ""I can't believe it wasn't looked into further, and if I hadn't pushed for the chest X-ray, I may still not have a diagnosis.""

Girardier said that many doctors' offices refuse to book appointments for things that present as ""just a cough"" during the pandemic.

""Other illnesses exist, and a cough isn't just a sign of COVID,"" she added.

Girardier's intensive chemotherapy treatment is set to begin on Dec. 20.

""Now,"" she continued, ""because I've been diagnosed so late, I'll have to have my chemotherapy a few days before Christmas. ... If doctors had found it quicker, I wouldn't need such intense chemo.""

""This cancer could've been caught three months earlier and I'm just lucky it's this type of cancer, and not one that progresses really quickly,"" added Girardier, who hopes for a full recovery.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/doctor-branded-initials-license-revoked,2021-12-14
Dr. Anthony Fauci says new 'mutant' COVID-19 variants are a 'clarion call' for people to get coronavirus vaccine,"Dr. Anthony Fauci says that the U.K. COVID-19 variant is a ""clarion call"" for people to get the vaccine against the deadly virus.

On Sunday, the infectious diseases expert spoke with Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press,"" where he discussed the emergence of the U.K.'s highly contagious new B.1.1.7 variant and spoke of a more ""ominous"" strain that is circulating in both Brazil and South Africa.

What are the details?

Fauci said that the new, concerning strains should embolden Americans to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and be more prudent in following public health guidelines.

Fauci — director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who will be President-elect Joe Biden's chief medical adviser on COVID-19 — said, ""When you have a variant that's really very, very different in the sense of it's more contagious, it tells you to do two things: One, double down on the public health measures that we've been talking about all the time ... but also, another important thing, the easiest way to evade this negative effect of these new isolates is ... when the vaccine becomes available, people should get vaccinated.""

He continued, ""Boy, if ever there was a clarion call for people to put aside vaccine hesitancy. If we can get the overwhelming majority of the population vaccinated, we'd be in very good shape and could beat even the mutant.""

The CDC on Friday published a concerning report suggesting that the B.1.1.7 variant could become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the United States by March.

The report noted that the more contagious strain could further overwhelm health care resources.

""Taking measures to reduce transmission now can lessen the potential impact of B.1.1.7 and allow the critical time to increase vaccination coverage,"" the report added.

Earlier in the interview, Fauci explained, ""[T]he more cases you get, even though on a one to one basis, it's not more virulent — meaning it doesn't make you more sick or more likely to die — just by numbers alone, the more cases you have, the more hospitalizations you're going to have. And the more hospitalizations you have, the more deaths you're going to have.""

Elsewhere during the interview, Fauci said that the United States is ""weeks away,"" and ""not months away,"" from considering an approval of new COVID-19 vaccines.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/doctor-diagnoses-cough-covid-actually-cancer,2021-01-18
"Dr. Fauci says politicizing mask-wearing in US contributed to 'stunning' death toll of 500,000","Dr. Anthony Fauci told Reuters on Monday that the politicization of mask-wearing in the U.S. helped contribute to the nation reaching the grim milestone of over 500,000 deaths, calling the number ""stunning.""

What are the details?

Reuters reported that Fauci ""said the pandemic arrived in the United States as the country was riven by political divisions in which wearing a mask became a political statement rather than a public health measure.""

""Even under the best of circumstances, this would have a been very serious problem,"" Fauci told the outlet, while acknowledging that other nations like Germany and the UK were also pummeled by the virus despite greater public compliance with measures aimed at stopping its spread. ""However, that does not explain how a rich and sophisticated county can have the most percentage of deaths and be the hardest-hit country in the world.""

The infectious disease expert also said it was ""incomprehensible"" to him that some governors and mayors disregarded the coronavirus task force's recommendations for reopening last year following lockdowns in the spring.

""When the American spirit is so divided, that really, really made me sad,"" Fauci said.

Fauci also said that while America's struggles combating the COVID-19 cannot all be blamed on former President Donald Trump, ""the lack of involvement at the very top of the leadership in trying to do everything that was science-based was clearly detrimental to the effort.""

Fauci has received criticism himself for inconsistent messaging on mask-wearing, after the task force initially urged Americans not to wear masks when the coronavirus first hit American shores before reversing course entirely and calling for everyone to wear facial coverings.

President Joe Biden floated the idea of a federal mask mandate while campaigning last year before easing off the nationwide order amid questions over its constitutionality and enforcement. However, the president did issue a mask mandate for federal properties and on modes of interstate transportation such as planes on his first day in office.

Fauci and Biden have said the U.S. should approach pre-pandemic normal life around Christmas.

Anything else?

Biden held a ceremony Monday at the White House to recognize and mourn the half-million Americans who have lost their lives to COVID-19, the Associated Press reported.

The president addressed the nation at the candlelight vigil, saying, ""We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow. We have to resist viewing each life as a statistic or a blur or, on the news. We must do so to honor the dead. But, equally important, to care for the living.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dr-anthony-fauci-says-new-mutant-covid-19-variants-are-a-clarion-call-for-people-to-get-coronavirus-vaccine,2021-02-23
Drag queen shows children how to twerk during story hour: 'Just move your bum up and down',"The Drag Queen Story Hour phenomenon isn't strictly an American thing — it's apparently catching on globally.

Case in point is Devon, England, where a drag queen children's entertainer known as ""Mama G"" is scheduled to appear at two libraries this week, Devon Live reported — and ""will be sharing tales that celebrate being who you are & loving who you want.""

Image source: Twitter

But some parents are concerned, saying Mama G is a ""sexualized, offensive caricature"" who ""teaches kids to twerk,"" the outlet reported.

Here's Mama G in action:



Drag queen teaches children to 'twerk' youtu.be

""Does anybody in this room know how to twerk?"" Mama G asks those in the room, which sounds as though young children are present.

The drag performer continues: ""All you need to do is you just need to stand with your feet sort of shoulder-width apart like so … and then you crouch down in this sort of position so you're bum's sticking out ... And then you just move your bum up and down like that. And that's twerking.""

How did folks respond to news of the drag queen's appearances?

Commenters took to Twitter and weighed in on Mama G's scheduled appearances at the Devon libraries — and some were supportive.

""Absolutely love Mama G,"" one person noted. ""Her storytime at Exeter Phoenix was brilliant and my 2 children adored her. If you want to hate on her shame on you; she wants you to be who you want to be. I know who I'd rather my children spent time with.""

But others weren't pleased in the slightest:

""Wholly inappropriate for children. [Devon Libraries] what on earth were you thinking.""

""Heavens, this abomination is in UK now. Twerking for toddlers. Hiding in plain sight.""

""FFS this is so not appropriate for children. It's disgusting misogynistic, over-sexualized, and wrong on so many levels.""

""This is obnoxious, disrespectful and borderline child abuse. Please stop at once.""

How did the libraries respond?



Libraries Unlimited, which runs Devon's libraries on behalf of Devon County Council, offered the following statement to Devon Live:

Story times and bounce and rhyme sessions are some of our most popular events across the county, with thousands of children attending each year. We host a variety of themed storytimes and they are always a huge success.



As a charity, we are committed to ensuring our libraries are welcoming, safe and inclusive places for all. We celebrate the arts, equality and diversity and are proud that our libraries offer a space for communities to come together and enjoy the power of words, reading and storytelling.



At Libraries Unlimited we take our safeguarding responsibilities very seriously and have a safeguarding policy that is followed by all staff across the organization.



In this case, we can also confirm that the artist involved has a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check.



Libraries are open to all, and we hope that everyone will find something suitable for them amongst our diverse range of activity across Devon and Torbay.

Drag Queen Story Hour included in health care provider commercial about shattering stereotypes,"Health care provider Kaiser Permanente recently released a commercial titled, ""To Them We Say,"" which shows a number of people who appear to shatter societal norms or deal with daily challenges.

The clip begins with a voice-over saying, ""There are those who will say that you're too fat"" — and shows a woman nailing a yoga pose. It continues with a boy deemed ""too skinny"" who pins his opponent in a wrestling match.

A female judge, pigeonholed as ""too soft,"" sits between her male colleagues and brings down a gavel, and a male nurse, pegged as ""too hard,"" is seen holding an older patient's hand.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The commercial also highlights a fancy-dressed elderly woman as ""too old,"" and a woman in the military going through a muddy obstacle course as ""too pretty.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

There's also a shot of three black females in cowboy gear sitting atop horses (""too unexpected"") and an armless woman in a wheelchair holding a paintbrush between her teeth to create a work of art (""too limited"").

In other words, the ad busts stereotypes and assumptions about people.



Drag Queen Story Hour shows up, too

But one of the vignettes shows a drag queen reading to smiling, laughing children — an apparent portrayal of the controversial Drag Queen Story Hour, which has grabbed numerous headlines over the last few years.

What are Drag Queen Story Hours all about?



Drag Queen Story Hours — in which men dressed as women read books to children in public libraries and bookstores — have become quite popular as they've spread across the country.

While parents who bring their children to these events often say they want to teach them to love and accept people, others have pushed back in protest, saying the Drag Queen Story Hours are inappropriate for children and are a tool of LGBTQ indoctrination. For example:

Drag queen teaches children to 'twerk' youtu.be

And a Louisiana drag queen admitted in a public meeting last year that the story hour events are meant to ""groom the next generation.""



Dylan Pontiff was shown in a video telling the Lafayette City-Parish Council that the ""very beautiful"" event is meant to get young people to accept LGBTQ values and lifestyles: ""This is gonna be the grooming of the next generation. We are trying to groom the next generation.""

What did Kaiser Permanente have to say?

Kaiser Permanente on Wednesday provided the following statement to TheBlaze when asked about the inclusion of the drag queen reading to children in its ""To Them We Say"" commercial:

For more than 70 years, Kaiser Permanente has regarded equity, inclusion, and diversity as core principles of our organization. These principles are evident in everything we do, including marketing and advertising. We know that providing equitable care — regardless of race, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, faith, language, or background — and having a diverse and inclusive workforce makes Kaiser Permanente a better place to receive health care, a better partner in the communities we serve, and a better place to work. Kaiser Permanente remains committed to achieving equity and inclusion for all.

Drag Queen Story Time specifically for children under 5 championed by London borough — and observers are horrified,"The borough of Newham in London championed a Drag Queen Story Time specifically for children under 5 years of age in an official borough news story regarding the start of LGBT+ History Month.

Here's the lowdown about the event featuring drag queens reading stories to kids — from a Newham Council Twitter account that handles borough news:

The council's tweet links to a page for Newham LGBT History Month, which describes the Drag Queen Story Time as ""providing spaces in which kids are able to see people who defy rigid gender restrictions"" and a chance for ""children to imagine the world in which people can present as they wish.""

What did observers have to say?

As you might expect, not everyone reacted positively to the Newham Council tweet about the upcoming event:

""What kind of sane adult takes their kids to this?""

""Every single person involved in the promotion, facilitation, and execution of this deranged, wicked event deserves to be locked up in prison facing capital punishment. Including the parents.""

""Child abuse.""

""Well, at least do me a favor and don't pretend to be surprised when the pedophiles want to be recognized as 'just love.' Slippery slopes.""

""This is grooming. Don't pretend it's anything else.""

""It does nothing positive for the kids. It only feeds the leftist need to feel superior. 'Look at how superior I am, allowing these heathens into my children's space,' 'I am the epitome of inclusion.'""

""Where are the parents? Parents are supposed to protect their children.""

Drag troupe for people with Down syndrome is picking up steam. It calls itself 'Drag Syndrome.',"You've no doubt noticed how popular Drag Queen Story Time for kids in public libraries has become over the last few years.

That's right. A U.K.-based troupe that calls itself ""Drag Syndrome"" started in March 2018 because choreographer Daniel Vais wanted to give people with intellectual disabilities a platform to perform, the outlet said.

The Mighty noted that Drag Syndrome also has been criticized. The outlet said the group noted in a recent BBC video that members have received hate mail and have heard that having those with Down syndrome participate in the drag scene is exploitative.

But Drag Syndrome's performers apparently don't see it that way.

""Gaia is not a character, but she is a part of me,"" Gaia Callas said, the Mighty noted, while Justin Bond added, ""If you have a problem with that, mate, you shouldn't be here.""

Vais added to the outlet that Drag Syndrome hopes it can show that those with Down syndrome are creative, dedicated, and professional — and also inspire young people with Down syndrome to pursue their passions fearlessly, the outlet said.

Left-wing activists blocking traffic in protest get dragged away by furious drivers: 'bunch of f***ing arseholes',"Global-warming activists infuriated Britons with their disruptive protest and were dragged away by angry drivers trying to get on with their lives.

Around 40 members of ""Insulate Britain"" sat down Wednesday morning at a street junction near Dartford Crossing in London with signs to protest for the insulation of Britain's social housing.

Drivers told reporters that the protest was disrupting fuel deliveries.

Various videos showed the furious drivers dragging the protesters out of the roadway, ripping their signs away and trashing them.

""Why aren't you at work? Why are you just sitting there, please just move. You self-satisfied p***!"" yelled one man at the protesters while dragging them away.

One driver told LBC News that he had lost his opportunity at a job interview because of the protesters.

""None of them work, they're all retired!"" he exclaimed.

LBC also spoke to a mother who was furious because she was trying to get her 11-year-old son to school. A man angrily referred to the protesters as a ""bunch of f***ing arseholes.""

LBC reported that police arrived about an hour and a half after the protest began and arrested many of them. Essex Police arrested 35 people at two separate protests.

The Evening Standard reported that it was the 13th time in a month that Insulate Britain had created a disturbance for the sake of their cause. The group is calling for all of the country's social housing to be insulated by 2025 for environmental and fuel poverty reasons, according to LBC.

Some on Twitter criticized the drivers.

""I have a lot of issues with Insulate Britain's tactics. But driving an SUV with one passenger for the school run is exactly the kind of s*** people should stop doing as a bare minimum if they care at all about preserving a habitable planet!"" tweeted Muslim writer Ash Sarkar.

Elton John blasts 'bulls**t' criticism from LGBT community over straight actor portraying him in new movie,"Sir Elton John has come to the defense of a heterosexual actor who portrays the legendary musician in the upcoming film ""Rocketman,"" a forthcoming biopic based on John's life.

What's the background?

Actor Taron Egerton, a straight man who portrays John in the film, has been criticized by the LGBT community for playing the role of a gay music icon. Critics say Egerton should have turned down the role and allowed a gay man to portray John instead.

What did Elton John say?

Speaking to The Sun UK after ""Rocketman"" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday, John made it clear he vehemently disagrees with Egerton's critics.

""That's all bulls**t, I'm sorry,"" he told the newspaper about the criticism.

""If people don't like it, review-wise, or it doesn't make one dollar, it's the movie I wanted to make and that's all that counts. I can look back and say, 'You know what, I love it. I can live with it,'"" he explained.

John also praised Egerton's performance.

""I was very emotional just now,"" he said. ""The movie floored me. But I'm very high. Taron is beyond belief. It's like watching me. It's quite extraordinary, he's so me-like. He's a megastar. He was schooled by George Martin's son Giles and he's done the most amazing job. I wanted it to be a movie where the actor sang — and he sings.""

What has Egerton said?

The young actor addressed the criticism in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month.

""I have spoken to gay people for whom it's not a problem, and I've spoken to gay people for whom it is a problem,"" he said.

""But for my part, I'm an actor, and I did not get into acting to just play people like me. You have to draw the line somewhere, and I don't want to live in a world where straight people play straight people and gay people play gay people,"" Egerton explained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/eco-protesters-drivers-drag-britain,2019-05-18
England changes policy again to allow home medical abortions during coronavirus outbreak,"The United Kingdom has changed its policy on home medical abortions more than once over the past month to adjust for the coronavirus pandemic — first allowing home abortions, then denying that they ever intended to make that switch. Now, England has decided to officially allow women to get abortion pills delivered to their homes after a telemedicine appointment, the BBC reported.

Advocates of removing obstacles for women seeking medical abortions say that the previous requirement for women to be seen in-person at a clinic before getting the abortion pills created risk due to the threat of COVID-19, especially for people with underlying health conditions.

The governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are now considering whether to change their policies to allow women to receive abortion pills after telephone or video appointments with physicians. Abortion was decriminalized in Northern Ireland last year, and women from that country often travel to England to obtain abortions.

A member of Parliament from Northern Ireland advocated for home medical abortions by citing an anecdote from pro-abortion organization Alliance for Choice.

Allegedly, a woman from Northern Ireland had an appointment for an abortion in England. Her appointment was canceled due to coronavirus lockdowns, so she went to a hospital in Northern Ireland to try to get the abortion there. The medical staff allegedly refused to give her an abortion, and the woman was hospitalized there the next day after a suicide attempt.

All changes to abortion policy in the U.K. are being called ""temporary"" at this time.



According to the BBC, medical abortions (available during the first trimester) are the most common method among the approximately 180,000 abortions each year in England. It's a two-pill process. The first pill, mifepristone, blocks the pregnancy hormone progesterone. The result is that the lining of the uterus breaks down, killing the unborn child.

The second pill, misoprostol, causes the uterus to contract, expelling the baby, the embryo, the embryonic sac, and the uterus lining. This can cause heavy bleeding and strong cramps.

This writer's perspective



Traveling during a pandemic can be dangerous for everyone, including and especially pregnant women. But an abortion is as much a loss of human life as a COVID-19 death is, and there is significant health risk associated with women taking abortion pills at home, potentially alone, after only a telephone conversation with a physician.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson held in-person discussions with Zelenskyy where he committed to providing Ukraine with military supplies,"The United Kingdom is going to send more than one hundred armored vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to Ukraine as the Russian invasion drags on.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the arrangement on Saturday during an in-person visit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

On Saturday, both Johnson and his Austrian counterpart, Chancellor Karl Nehammer, made in-person visits to Zelenskyy. The two leaders are the latest in a list of political figures who have made in-person visits to Ukraine in the midst of the ongoing Russian invasion.

The Ukrainian Embassy to the United Kingdom posted a picture of Johnson and Zelenskyy seated opposite one another at a table with the caption, “Surprise,” followed by a winking face emoji.

CNN reported that The Press Service of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine said on its official Twitter account that Zelenskyy and Johnson engaged in diplomatic discussions in Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv.



On his Twitter account, Johnson said, “The Ukrainians have the courage of a lion. President [Zelenskyy] has given the roar of that lion. The UK stands unwaveringly with the people of Ukraine.”

At the time of writing, this tweet is pinned to top of Johnson’s Twitter page.



In an official statement as Prime Minister, Johnson said, “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century.”

Johnson also praised his Ukrainian counterpart’s ""resolute leadership"" and the “invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people.” He said that the UK “stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight” and that “[the British] are in it for the long run.”

Acknowledging Johnson’s steadfast support of Ukraine, Zelenskyy said, “Boris was among those who didn’t doubt for a minute whether to support Ukraine. The leadership of Great Britain in providing our country help in defense, and also leadership in sanctions policy, will always be in history.”

He added, “Ukraine will always be grateful for this to Boris and Britain.”

During a press conference, Johnson said that the United Kingdom will continue to leverage sanctions against Russia and that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has dealt a “crushing blow” to his reputation and to the global standing of the Russian government.

During a subsequent press conference, Johnson said, “We will influence Russia’s ability to use its energy sources. The war determines the vision of Ukraine’s future, so our partners and I will supply Ukraine with equipment, technology, intelligence so that Ukraine never faces the horrors of invasion and blackmail.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/england-changes-policy-again-to-allow-home-medical-abortions-during-coronavirus-outbreak,2022-04-10
England's first transgender prison set to open for men who identify as women,"England's first transgender prison wing is set to open later this week.

Reports of sexual assaults in women's prisons by men prompted the government to make a change to its policies, which have allowed transgender inmates to serve time in women's prisons, the Sunday Times reported.

""Prisoner safety is our biggest concern and any decisions we take will seek to best manage the risks posed by each offender,"" a British Ministry of Justice spokesperson said in a statement, according to BBC News. ""The wider management of transgender offenders is a highly sensitive issue which poses unique and complex challenges and we are determined to get it right. That's why we are reviewing the way we manage all transgender offenders.""

Three inmates from Downview women's prison near London are expected to be the first to be housed in the new wing that's exclusively for men who now identify as women. The unit will feature 15 single cells and another cell with two beds. Transgender prisoners will be isolated from the main prison's inmates.

What are the details?

In 2016, the government issued guidance that called for the majority of transgender inmates to be held in prisons matching their preferred identity.

Last month, the government announced its revised guidance in an attempt to ""strike the right balance"" between the rights of transgender prisoners as well as the safety of women prisoners.

""They're going to have to have some kinds of safeguards to make sure that a Karen White event doesn't happen again,"" Andrea Albutt, the president of the Prison Governors Association, told the Sunday Times. ""That is the No. 1 priority.""

White, who was born as Stephen Wood, is a 52-year-old biological male who was sentenced to prison for raping women. He was moved from a men's prison to a women's prison after identifying as a woman.

Within days of his transfer to a women's prison, White sexually assaulted female prisoners. He was convicted last year and sentenced to life behind bars.

White has been accused of claiming to identify as a woman to get access to women in prison. His actions sparked the governments to review its transgender prisoner policy.

What else?

About 50 percent of the transgender prison population in Great Britain are sex offenders, according to the Sunday Times.

Last year, the Ministry of Justice reported that there were 139 transgender inmates in England and Wales. The data showed 15 prisons had at least one, 18 had two to four, and 11 had at least five, according to The Guardian.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/england-s-prime-minister-boris-johnson-held-in-person-discussions-with-zelenskyy-agreed-to-provide-ukraine-with-military-supplies,2019-03-05
EU energy prices soar as Russia vows not to resume gas supplies until sanctions lifted,"Russia will not resume its gas supplies to Europe until the West lifts its sanctions, reports the Guardian.

Dmitry Peskov, Moscow’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions “introduced against our country by western countries including Germany and the UK” for Russia’s failure to deliver gas to Europe.

European gas prices increased by as much as 30% following Russia’s announcement. The European Union (EU) is now weighing new gas benchmarks and price caps to address the soaring prices.

Russian energy supplier Gazprom announced that a suspension of gas supplies to Europe would be extended indefinitely, citing “malfunctions” on a turbine along the major Nord Stream 1 pipeline, reports the Guardian. Gazprom has blamed sanctions for delaying its ability to repair the turbine.

Germany’s energy regulator said that “the defects alleged by the Russian side are not a technical reason for the cessation of operations.” Germany, which had been planning to bolster its natural gas reserves in an effort to maintain sufficient power and ease energy inflation, is now unlikely to meet its targets.

Nord Stream 1 is the single biggest gas pipeline between Russia and Europe and has historically supplied about a third of the gas Russia exported to Europe; its supply is considered crucial to improving the European energy crisis.

""Supply is hard to come by, and it becomes harder and harder to replace every bit of gas that doesn't come from Russia,"" said Jacob Mandel, senior associate for commodities at Aurora Energy Research. Norway, a major European gas producer, has been increasing its output to European markets in response.

France has been hit particularly hard by the energy crisis. The government has spent over $26 billion since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to reduce French citizens’ gas and electric bills. Companies in France will soon be required to cut their energy use “by 10 percent or face enforced rationing of electricity and gas,” reports the New York Times. Businesses will also have to appoint an “ambassador of energy sobriety” and send the government their plans for cutting electricity use.

Evangelist Franklin Graham has been dropped by all seven of his UK tour venues. His offense? Believing the Bible's teaching on homosexuality.,"The Rev. Franklin Graham, a popular evangelist and son of the late Rev. Billy Graham, is planning a four-month gospel-preaching tour through the United Kingdom this summer.

But now, all seven of his scheduled venues have dropped him, citing his views on homosexuality and Islam.

What are they saying?

CNN reported that on Wednesday an arena in Newcastle became the seventh and final venue to cancel Graham's scheduled appearance, following similar cancellations by venues in cities across the U.K., including Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield, and Glasgow.

The cancellation came after the regional LGBT groups joined with Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes to oppose the visit.

Forbes, who claims that Graham ""peddles controversial, repulsive views about LGBT people"" said he was ""delighted"" to hear the news.

""Instead of focusing on such divisions, we can now come together and look forward to hosting U.K. Pride here this summer,"" he added.

More than 5,000 people had signed a petition put on by Northern Pride calling for the event to be canceled. The petition argued that Graham has ""publicly promoted homophobia.""

Similar protests have erupted in other U.K. cities over recent weeks. In Liverpool, a local gay pride foundation penned a letter to authorities, saying, the evangelist preacher ""is well known"" for ""promoting hate of LGBT+ people"" and ""openly supporting conversion therapy.""

CNN noted that Graham has ""fueled anger for his past comments and stances"" such as maintaining the Bible's view that ""homosexuality is a sin"" and calling Islam a ""wicked and evil"" religion.

The tour will go on

Graham has responded to the cancellations with resilience, vowing the tour will go on.

""We are still finalising where the Graham Tour will be held, but we want to be clear that the initiative and all associated training courses will take place on the same dates as originally planned,"" a statement on the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association website says.

Graham had previously noted on the website that opposition in the cities came from ""a small but vocal minority,"" and assured that such opposition would not derail the tour.

Last week, after the Liverpool venue cancelled, Franklin Graham took to Facebook to articulate his views and send a message to the LGBTQ community in the U.K.

""The rub, I think, comes in whether God defines homosexuality as sin. The answer is yes,"" he acknowledged. ""But God goes even further than that, to say that we are all sinners — myself included. The Bible says that every human being is guilty of sin and in need of forgiveness and cleansing. The penalty of sin is spiritual death — separation from God for eternity.""

Graham then went on to offer his detractors the Gospel, saying that he plans to come to the U.K. not out of hate, but out of love.

""The Gospel is inclusive. I'm not coming out of hate, I'm coming out of love,"" he wrote. ""I invite everyone in the LGBTQ community to come and hear for yourselves the Gospel.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/eu-energy-prices-soar-russia,2020-02-06
Experimental four-day workweek proving successful,"Seventy-three companies in Britain are halfway through a six-month trial in which employees get a paid day off weekly. Instead of the standard 40-hour workweek, participants are experimenting with a four-day, 32-hour week.

Of the 41 companies that responded to a survey at the halfway point, 35 said they were “likely” or “extremely likely” to consider continuing the four-day workweek beyond the end of the trial in late November, reports The New York Times. Six of the 41 companies said productivity had significantly improved, while 39 companies said productivity was either the same or had improved.

Claire Daniels, CEO at Trio Media, said of the program, ""The four-day week trial so far has been extremely successful for us. Productivity has remained high, with an increase in wellness for the team, along with our business performing 44% better financially.""

The test program is being run by 4 Day Week Global in partnership with think tank Autonomy, the 4 Day Week UK Campaign, and researchers at Cambridge University, Boston College, and Oxford University. More than 3,300 employees are participating in the test. The program is considered the world’s largest attempt at testing a four-day workweek.

Joe O'Connor, chief executive of 4 Week Global, said, ""We are learning that for many it is a fairly smooth transition and for some there are some understandable hurdles - especially among those which have comparatively fixed or inflexible practices, systems, or cultures which date back well into the last century.""

The New York Times notes that a four-day workweek has long been a topic of consideration. In 1956, then-Vice President Richard Nixon said he foresaw it in the “not too distant future.” Earlier this year, California introduced a bill that would make the official workweek 32 hours for companies with 500 employees or more. That bill was put on hold, reports USA Today.

Critics argue a shorter workweek reduces businesses’ competitiveness, which is particularly troublesome in Europe, as many companies are already struggling to compete with competitors in other regions.

Participants in the experiment seem optimistic that a four-day workweek can have positive effects in the long-term. Sharon Platts, Chief People Officer for Outcomes First Group, a participant in the test, said, “While it's still early days, our confidence in continuing beyond the trial is growing and the impact on colleague wellbeing has been palpable.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/evangelist-franklin-graham-dropped-venues-for-believing-bible-teaching-on-homosexuality,2022-09-24
"Extremists deface $110 million Monet painting and King Charles' likeness in latest instances of eco-iconoclasm, funded by Beverly Hills-based climate alarmism group","Anti-oil extremists' defacements of a Claude Monet painting in Germany and a waxwork of King Charles in London are the latest two in a string of attacks on famous works of art. The vandals responsible, like others before them, demanded an end to oil discovery and production amid an energy crisis in Europe, which is prompting some to hoard wood and burn manure to survive the coming winter.

The groups responsible have both been funded by the Beverly Hills-based Climate Emergency Fund, which is cultivating an army of ""climate activists.""

German iconoclasm

On Sunday, two German vandals threw mashed potatoes at a painting in the Barberini Museum in Potsdam, southeast of Berlin.

The oil painting they targeted was Monet's ""Grainstacks,"" an impressionist work depicting the stacks of hay that stood near the artist's house in Giverny. Reuters reported that the painting sold at auction in 2019 for $110.7 million. It is on permanent display in the Museum Barberini, on loan from the Hasso Plattner Foundation.

The vandals glued their hands to the wall beneath the painting after having thrown the food.

The National Post reported that four people were involved in the attack and that those responsible were subsequently arrested.

The Museum Barberini noted on Twitter that an ""immediate conservation investigation showed that [the painting] was not damaged in any way,"" since it had been set behind protective glass.

Museum director Ortrud Westheider responded in a statement saying, ""While I understand the activists’ urgent concern in the face of the climate catastrophe, I am shocked by the means with which they are trying to lend weight to their demands.""

Concerning a previous incident, the German Cultural Council's managing director, Olaf Zimmermann, said, ""The works put in danger are part of world cultural heritage and deserve to be protected as well as our climate.""

Zimmermann also noted that the risk of ""damaging the artworks is very high.""

Letzte Generation

The vandals who claimed responsibility for the attack on Monet's 132-year-old painting are affiliated with the extremist group called ""Last Generation."" They claimed the vandalism was a reminder ""that the fossil fuel course is killing us all.""

Last Generation claims on its website, ""We still have two to three years in which we can still leave the fossil path of annihilation.""

The climate extremist group Last Generation also had two of its members recently glue themselves to the frame of Raffael's ""Sistine Madonna"" painting at the Gemaldegalerie Museum in Dresden, Germany, on Aug. 23.

The extremists responsible for the Sunday art attack in Germany stated, ""People are starving, people are freezing, people are dying. We are in a climate catastrophe and all you are afraid of is tomato soup or mashed potatoes on a painting. You know what I'm afraid of? I’m afraid because science tells us that we won’t be able to feed our families in 2050.""

In his recent book ""How the World Really Works,"" scientist and policy analyst Vaclav Smil noted how fossil fuels are absolutely critical when it comes to feeding, warming, and nurturing humanity.

Ending oil production, as the vandals demand, would have profound consequences, not the least on all those who may no longer be able to heat their homes in the winter or cool them in the summer.



Although elsewhere advocating for a gradual transition off of oil, Smil noted, ""Our food supply — be it staple grains, clucking birds, favorite vegetables, or seafood praised for its nutritious quality — has become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels.""

Smil also indicated that ""after adding the energy requirements of food processing and marketing, packaging, transportation, wholesale and retail services, household food storage and preparation, and away-from-home food and marketing services, the grand total in the US [of the direct energy use in food production] reached nearly 16 percent of the nation's energy supply in 2007 and now it is approaching 20 percent.""

British iconoclasm



On Monday morning, Just Stop Oil extremists went to Madame Tussauds in London and smashed a chocolate cake into the wax likeness of King Charles.

The vandals responsible, 20-year-old Eilidh McFadden from Glasgow, Scotland, and 29-year-old Tom Johnson from Sunderland, England, stated, ""The demand is simple: Just stop new oil and gas. It's a piece of cake.""

The extremist group Just Stop Oil is committed to taking part in ""NonViolent Direct Action targeting the UK's oil and gas infrastructure should the Government fail to meet our demand by 14 March 2022.""

The Mirror reported that four people were arrested for criminal damage, including McFadden and Johnson.

Wasting food and glue

These attacks resemble several others committed in recent weeks.



On Oct. 14, two female climate extremists belonging to the group called Just Stop Oil were arrested for throwing tomato soup at a Vincent van Gogh painting ""Sunflowers"") in the National Gallery in London. After defacing the artwork, they glued themselves to the wall.

Both extremists demanded that the British government cease all new oil and gas projects.

On October 19, anti-oil extremists affiliated with ""Scientist Rebellion"" glued their hands to the floor of a Volkswagen exhibit in Wolfsburg, Germany.

One of the climate extremists suggested that so-called climate change was leading to floods and storms, rendering some regions of the world uninhabitable.

Climate Emergency Fund

Both Just Stop Oil and the Last Generation receive funding from the Climate Emergency Fund, on whose board sits Adam McKay, a Hollywood director and screenwriter; Aileen Getty, the American actress from the ultra-rich Getty oil family; Rory Kennedy, the youngest child of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy; and other wealthy climate alarmists.

The CEF has indicated that so far this year it has ""made $4 million in grants to 30 brave, ultra-ambitious groups.""

It is unclear whether the CEF could be held partly responsible if any of its grantees were to irreparably damage energy infrastructure or beloved artwork.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/experimental-four-day-workweek-proving-successful,2022-10-24
"FAA bans US carriers from flying over Iraq, Iran following Iranian missile attacks","The Federal Aviation Administration has banned commercial U.S. carriers from flying over the countries of Iran and Iraq, along with other areas of the Middle East following Iran's attack on U.S.-linked bases in Iraq on Tuesday.

What are the details?

Reuters reported that the FAA said American carriers were prohibited ""from operating in the airspace over Iraq, Iran, the Gulf of Oman and the waters between Iran and Saudi Arabia"" in the wake of Iran's missile launches on Iraqi bases housing coalition personnel, including Americans.



Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has claimed responsibility for the attacks in retaliation for the President Donald Trump ordering the airstrike that killed Iranian general and terrorist Qassem Soleimani last week.

According to The Jerusalem Post, there were no major commercial U.S. carriers that operate over the skies of Iran prior to the FAA's announcement, but the ban on airspace over Iraq and the two waterways were imposed in reaction to the attacks.

The outlet further reported that the FAA said ""it was closely monitoring events in the Middle East and coordinating with U.S. airlines and foreign authorities about aviation safety after Iran launched a missile attack on U.S.-led forces in Iraq.""

Facebook admits giving companies access to users' private messages,"In the wake of a New York Times report saying Facebook gave numerous companies shocking access to users' data — even giving Spotify, Netflix, and the Royal Bank of Canada the ability ""to read, write and delete users' private messages"" — Facebook has acknowledged the truth of the report.

The social media giant asked rhetorically in a Tuesday blog post, ""Did partners get access to messages?""

Facebook's answer? ""Yes,"" noted Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, director of developer platforms and programs. ""But people had to explicitly sign in to Facebook first to use a partner's messaging feature. Take Spotify for example. After signing in to your Facebook account in Spotify's desktop app, you could then send and receive messages without ever leaving the app. Our API provided partners with access to the person's messages in order to power this type of feature.""

In regard to the Times' report that Spotify, Netflix, and the Royal Bank of Canada could ""read, write and delete users' private messages,"" Spotify and Netflix spokespeople told the paper their companies ""were unaware of the broad powers Facebook had granted them. A Royal Bank of Canada spokesman disputed that the bank had any such access.""

The paper added that Spotify could view messages of more than 70 million users a month and ""still offers the option to share music through Facebook Messenger. But Netflix and the Canadian bank no longer needed access to messages because they had deactivated features that incorporated it.""

A Netflix spokeswoman told Business Insider the company didn't access anyone's private messages.

The spokeswoman said, ""Over the years we have tried various ways to make Netflix more social. One example of this was a feature we launched in 2014 that enabled members to recommend TV shows and movies to their Facebook friends via Messenger or Netflix. It was never that popular so we shut the feature down in 2015. At no time did we access people's private messages on Facebook or ask for the ability to do so.""

Facebook found no evidence of abuse by its partners, a spokeswoman told the Times.

More from Business Insider:

More troubling to observers, however, was any sense that Facebook gave third parties deep access to user data without properly informing users and gaining permission. Many people tend to assume their private messages on social media will stay private.



Former Federal Trade Commission officials told The Times that Facebook's newly revealed data-sharing agreements probably violated regulatory requirements.

Facebook sorry after reportedly deleting posts about the UK's Plymouth Hoe and penalizing posters,"Looks like a Facebook algorithm needs a course in European history.

Because the venerable social media giant apparently with wisdom out the wazoo now has some egg on its face. Or perhaps a full English breakfast.

What are the details?

The hubbub concerns the Plymouth Hoe, a historic seafaring site on England's coast. Here's what the Visit Plymouth website says about ""the Hoe"":

It is here where Sir Francis Drake, intrepid explorer and local hero, is immortalized in a statue, situated just a few meters from the green where he finished his game of bowls before heading out to defeat the Spanish Armada in 1588.



At the eastern end of the Hoe you'll find The Royal Citadel, the most impressive 17th century fortress in Britain and for many years England's most important defense against attack from the sea. The Citadel has been in constant military occupation since it was built and today it is home to some of Plymouth's modern heroes — the troops of 29 Commando Royal Artillery.

The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon word ""hoe,"" the Guardian reported, which is a sloping ridge shaped like an inverted foot and heel.

But some Facebook users got in trouble after referring to the landmark in recent posts, presumably because ""hoe"" is considered a misogynist term elsewhere.

The administrator of one Plymouth Facebook page warned its users to be careful when mentioning the Hoe, the paper said.

""Just a quick post to say anyone living Plymouth h o e, please don't write it as one word,"" the message read, according to the Guardian. ""Facebook are saying it's harassment and muting people and giving them a Facebook ban. It's not us doing that.""

One Facebook user's comments were removed on several occasions, the paper said, adding that, ""Now I am writing Oe.""

Another user told the Guardian that ""someone asked me where I swam in Plymouth, and I replied, 'Plymouth H O E.' I got told off for bad language and could not comment for two days.""

Still another Facebook poster noted that when she mentioned the Hoe, she received the following message: ""Are you sure you want to post this, it may be deemed offensive to some?"" the paper said.

Apologies

When all was said and done, Facebook apologized for its mistaken actions and promised to take steps to ensure residents and visitors can use the term ""hoe"" in relation to the Devon landmark, the Guardian said.

""These posts were removed in error, and we apologize to those who were affected,"" a Facebook spokesperson said, according to the paper. ""We're looking into what happened and will take steps to rectify the error.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/facebook-privacy-breach,2021-01-28
"Facing party mutiny, British Prime Minister Liz Truss calls it quits just 44 days in — will likely be shortest-serving leader in UK history","Liz Truss has announced her intention to resign as British prime minister after 44 days in office, setting a record for the shortest-serving prime minister in the history of the United Kingdom. The previous record-holder was George Canning, the Tory prime minister who died of tuberculosis after 119 days in office.

In recent weeks, Truss faced immense opposition from her own Conservative party, largely over her botched economic plan, which agitated the markets and resulted in the replacement of her treasury chief.

The internal tensions came to a head Wednesday night when a parliamentary vote concerning the future of fracking in the U.K. descended into chaos, exacerbated by claims that some Conservative members of Parliament had been forced to vote against the ban.

Yesterday's vote was reportedly originally regarded as a confidence motion. Some activists and MPs explicitly said it was an effort by some to ""prop up a zombie prime minister.""

Although Conservatives prevailed, defeating the ban (326 votes to 230), the session's poor handling proved a black eye for the party and its leader. One Conservative lawmaker, Charles Walker, denounced it as a ""shambles and a disgrace.""

Walker suggested that the people who put Liz Truss in office had done ""extraordinary"" damage to the Conservative Party.

Prior to making her Thursday announcement outside the prime minister's Downing Street residence, Truss notified King Charles of her intention to step down and spoke to Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, about holding a leadership election ""within the next week.""



Brady has since stated that he spoke to the Conservative Party chairman and determined Tory members will be consulted by Friday next week on a possible new leader.

In her speech, Truss reflected upon the past two months, noting her government ""delivered on energy bills and on cutting national insurance"" and set ""out a vision for a low tax high growth economy that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit.""



Truss, who yesterday claimed to be ""a fighter and not a quitter,"" noted that she had entered the role ""at a time of great economic and international instability"" and admitted she ""cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative party.""

The outgoing prime minister also indicated she would ""remain as Prime Minister until a successor has been chosen.""

If a leadership election is held next week as she has indicated, Britain will have its second new leader since Boris Johnson resigned after a similar party mutiny in July.

The leftist opposition in Parliament seized upon the opportunity to demand a general election.



Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrat Party, tweeted, ""We don't need another Conservative Prime Minister lurching from crisis to crisis. We need a General Election now and the Conservatives out of power.""

Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, similarly called for a general election, only prior to Truss' announcement.

After the announcement, Starmer issued a statement, saying, ""The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people. They do not have a mandate to put the country through yet another experiment; Britain is not their personal fiefdom to run how they wish.""

Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, joined in on the call for an election.

On October 14, the Daily Star started a YouTube livestream pitting a head of lettuce against Truss' tenure.

FACT-CHECK: The Washington Post distorts Dr. Fauci's words in order to defend Italy's 'open borders' policies,"In a fact-check, the Washington Post gave Dr. Anthony Fauci four ""Pinocchios"" on Friday for claiming that Italy's lax travel policies contributed to its ongoing coronavirus crisis. But the Post's fact-check is wrong.

What did Dr. Fauci say?

As TheBlaze reported, in an interview on Thursday with NBC's Lester Holt, the coronavirus expert was asked what the United States and Italy (now considered the epicenter of the pandemic) were doing differently that may result in disparate outcomes for the two countries.

In his response, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases credited President Donald Trump's various executive orders that suspended travel from Europe and China with preventing an Italian-level crisis in America:

Our shutting off travel from China and, more recently, travel from Europe, has gone a long way to not seeding very, very intensively the virus in our country. Unfortunately, Italy did not do that. They had an open border, they let people in.

The Post's misleading fact-check

The Post claimed that Fauci was ""simply wrong."" He isn't.

To debunk his claim, fact-checker Glenn Kessler honed in on a fragment of Dr. Fauci's comment and interpreted it to mean he was suggesting that Italy had not cut off travel from China.

Italy's prime minister took immediate action, declaring a state of emergency and announcing a ban effective Jan. 31 on all flights to and from China to Italy, with no exceptions. He announced this step even though the WHO advisory recommended against travel restrictions. The ban on flights also extended to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. The announcement added that anyone on a flight to Italy would face health checks upon arrival.

Indeed, Italy and the U.S. announced travel restrictions on China at around the same time. However, in his MSNBC appearance, Dr. Fauci was clearly referring to both countries' policies toward European travel and not just limits on Chinese travel. The Washington Post even acknowledged in its fact-check that Italy has not closed its doors to Europe.



""Italy's borders with the rest of Europe did remain open,"" wrote the Washington Post, which characterized Italy's policies as ""more sweeping steps than the United States.""

The Post even added that ""U.S. borders with Europe were open for many more weeks as well."" Except this is not true.

Trump announced a ban on European travel during a March 11 Oval office address. Four days later, he expanded it to include Ireland and the U.K. This is in addition to new restrictions on North American border crossings.

Conversely, according to the New York Times, Italy is still allowing travelers from Europe and most of the rest of the world to enter their country. In fact, aside from suspending flights from China and Taiwan, the only other measure taken by Italian officials on inbound travelers is to require them to pass ""temperature screenings"" at major airports, which do not prevent asymptomatic coronavirus patients from entering Italy.

Of course, it is no secret that Italy's loose points of entry have enabled the pandemic. Even the Italian ambassador to the United States has recognized that his country's porous borders has facilitated the spread of the virus which has killed thousands of his fellow countrymen. ""There are so many gates from where the virus might have reached Italy,"" said Amb. Armando Varricchio on Thursday, according to the Washington Examiner.



What else?

In short, the Post distorted Dr. Fauci's comments in order to downplay the positive impact Trump's policies have had and maintain that Italy's open borders did not contribute to the pandemic. However, Dr. Fauci was clearly referring to both countries' travel policies toward China and Europe. In fact, he specifically mentioned Trump's European travel restrictions vis-a-vis Italy's ""open border.""

Since Italy does not share a physical border with China, any reasonable person can conclude that Dr. Fauci was comparing the two countries' general travel policies and not just those pertaining to Beijing. A spokesman for the NIAID even explained this to the Post, which decided to run its misleading fact-check anyway.

"Fauci and other top scientists had another secret COVID-19 origins call, records reveal","A group of the world's top virologists held secretive private discussions in February 2020 on ""all theories"" of the origins of COVID-19 days after they began drafting an influential article that would attempt to debunk the lab-leak theory, newly reported emails reveal.



The group was led by Wellcome Trust Director Jeremy Farrar and University of Sydney virologist Edward Holmes. Members of these discussions included then-National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins and the U.S. government's top pandemic spokesman, Dr. Anthony Fauci.

A Freedom of Information Act request by U.S. Right to Know reveals that their discussions on the pandemic's origins continued on Feb. 7, 2020, three days after an article purporting to show the virus ""is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus"" was drafted and a week after a previously reported conference call on Feb. 1.



“Eddie Holmes and a small group have been looking extensively at the origins and evolution of n-CoV including all theories,” Farrar wrote to National Academy of Medicine President Victor Dzau on Feb. 8, 2020, using an abbreviation for ""novel coronavirus"" in reference to the emerging SARS-Cov-2 virus.

“This is the latest summary, written as part of a series of [teleconference] discussions we set up and included [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci] and [National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins] as well as a small group from USA, UK, Europe and Australia,” Farrar wrote.

The records obtained by U.S. Right to Know included six pages of notes from the Feb. 7 discussion, but the material is fully redacted.

The newly unearthed records reveal that scientists continued to consider the lab-leak origins theory of COVID-19 in private while working to dismiss the theory in public. But exactly what they discussed remains unknown, hidden behind redacted records and repeated refusals to comment.



There are two competing theories of the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. The first is that the virus has natural origins — that it was carried by an animal host and evolved to be contagious among human beings. This is the view widely accepted by most scientists.

The second theory is that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a Chinese lab that studies coronaviruses, may have genetically manipulated one of their virus samples, creating SARS-CoV-2, and somehow that engineered virus leaked from the lab. This theory was maligned as a crackpot conspiracy theory by most public health officials.

Neither hypothesis of the pandemic's origins has been definitively proven or ruled out. An intelligence review by President Joe Biden's administration determined the theories were ""equally plausible"" and that the lab-leak hypothesis was ""a credible line of inquiry.""



In previously reported email chains, Farrar, Fauci, and other public health officials were shown to have discussed the possibility that the Wuhan coronavirus was ""engineered."" But after holding private conference calls on the matter, many of those involved waged a vigorous public campaign to discredit the lab-leak theory, apparently with no outstanding scientific reasons for doing so.

That public campaign began with a Feb. 19, 2020, statement signed by Farrar and other top health and medical professionals that strongly condemned ""conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin"". It continued with various public statements from Fauci and others that the lab-leak theory was a ""conspiracy,"" which led social media companies to censor any discussion of the possible lab origins of COVID-19.

Perhaps the most significant blow to the credibility of the lab-leak theory came on March 17, 2020, with the publication of a letter titled, ""The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2."" This letter sought to definitively squash the idea that COVID-19 came from a laboratory setting. ""We do not believe any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,"" the authors wrote, words that were seized by the national media and used to attack President Donald Trump because he had made statements supportive of the lab-leak theory.

Yet just one month before the ""proximal origins"" letter was published, three of its five authors had privately concluded that aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were ""inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory"" and that ""some of the features (potentially) look engineered."" Their opinion was revealed in a Feb. 1 email to Fauci, first published by BuzzFeed News.

A subsequent Feb. 4 email from Farrar to Fauci and Collins revealed he was split ""50-50"" between the natural origins and lab-leak theories and that Holmes was ""60-40"" in favor of the lab origin.



Emails transcribed by Republican staff on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform show that on the same day Farrar sent a draft of the ""proximal origins"" paper with Fauci.

Farrar, Fauci, and the rest have stated that while they were initially open to all theories of the virus' origins, their change of opinion and embrace of the natural origins theory reflected the weight of scientific evidence.



However, there is a potential conflict of interest in how Fauci and Collins shaped the narrative that the lab-leak theory of COVID-19's origins was a ""conspiracy theory."" The nonprofit group EcoHealth Alliance had received federal grants from Fauci's agency to study coronaviruses and had sub-awarded nearly $600,000 to the Wuhan lab in the years preceding the pandemic.

Whether the Wuhan lab used that grant money to conduct risky gain-of-function research to create new artificially enhanced viruses is a hotly contested claim, with Fauci and others denying it and Republican lawmakers like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) accusing them of lying.



The truth is likely redacted.

Fauci: Christmas will be worse than Thanksgiving for COVID spread,"Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning Americans that the Christmas holiday could be worse than Thanksgiving for spreading the coronavirus.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared on CNN's ""New Day"" with host John Berman and issued a warning to America about the potential dangers of holiday celebrations.

""My concerns, John [Berman], are the same thing of the concerns that I had about Thanksgiving, only this may be even more compounded because it's a longer holiday,"" Fauci said.

He explained that because the Christmas holiday leads into New Year's Day celebrations, the potential for virus spread is greater than Thanksgiving, which lasts one day before people return to work.

""I think it can be even more of a challenge than what we saw with Thanksgiving,"" Fauci said. ""So I hope that people realize that and understand that as difficult as this is, nobody wants to modify, if not essentially shut down, their holiday season.""



""But we're at a very critical time in this country right now,"" he added. ""We've got to not walk away from the facts and the data. This is tough going for all of us.""

Fauci's advice comes amid a recent increase in positive coronavirus cases being reported. According to the COVID Tracking Project, as of Dec. 7 there were 14,717,065 identified cases of coronavirus in the United States. The previous Friday saw 228,000 new cases reported, the largest volume of positive cases reported in a single day since the pandemic began. Currently there are 102,148 people hospitalized with COVID, with 20,098 people currently in the ICU and 7,073 currently on a ventilator. Tragically, 274,745 Americans have died with confirmed or probable cases of COVID.

Progress toward the release and distribution of a COVID vaccine continues.

On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration released documents containing the agency's analysis of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The documents show Pfizer's vaccine provides some protection after the first dose and full protection from the coronavirus after the second dose. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee will meet Thursday and vote on whether to grant Pfizer emergency use authorization to begin distributing the vaccine in the United States.

In the United Kingdom, a retired British shop clerk received the first shot of the nation's COVID-19 vaccination program after the nation last week authorized the use of Pfizer's vaccine.

"Fauci: Risk of catching COVID-19 outdoors is 'extremely low,' expect new mask guidance soon","The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will soon issue new guidance on wearing masks outdoors, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, who also said the risk of contracting COVID-19 while outdoors is ""extremely low.""

Fauci, the White House's chief medical adviser, told CNN's Jim Acosta on Sunday to expect new recommendations soon, noting that all along, health experts have been saying the risk of contracting the virus outdoors is minimal.

""The risk when you're outdoors – which we have been saying all along – is extremely low. And if you are vaccinated, it's even lower. So you're going to be hearing about those kinds of recommendations soon,"" he said.

Fauci's comments echo what he told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos earlier that day, when he said ""it's pretty common sense"" that the risk of catching COVID-19 outdoors is low.

""I think it's pretty common sense now that outdoor risk is really, really quite low, particularly — I mean, if you are a vaccinated person, wearing a mask outdoors, I mean, obviously, the risk is minuscule,"" Fauci said.

He went on to say that new guidance from the CDC is forthcoming.

""What I believe you're going to be hearing, what the country is going to be hearing soon is updated guidelines from the CDC. The CDC is a science-based organization. They don't want to make any guidelines unless they look at the data, and the data backs it up,"" he said.

""But when you look around at the commonsense situation, obviously, the risk is really very low, particularly if you are vaccinated,"" he added.

The CDC's current guidance advises Americans, even those who have been fully vaccinated, to continue wearing masks and social distancing six feet apart from other people to mitigate spread of the virus. The CDC also says that ""masks may not be necessary when you are outside by yourself away from others, or with people who live in your household,"" but advises Americans to obey local mask mandates in places that have them.

Fauci's latest comments on the risk of contracting COVID-19 outdoors appear to be another flip-flop.

At the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, Dr. Fauci said, ""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask,"" adding that while mask-wearing may ""make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet ... it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is."" But as time went on and medical researchers learned more about the virus, Fauci changed his position and became a strong proponent of wearing masks at all times, even outdoors.

During a Facebook live chat with Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D) last August, Fauci advised people to ""get as much outdoors as you possibly can,"" noting that ""superspreader"" events almost always happen indoors in places like ""nursing homes, meat-packing, prisons, choirs in churches, congregations of weddings and other social events where people get together.""

""Nothing's 100%, but it's almost invariable that it's indoors. So when you are indoors, make sure you have a mask. When you're outdoors, keep the mask on,"" Fauci said.

On Oct. 7, Fauci reiterated that being outside is ""much less of a risk, but it is a risk."" He advised people who want to gather outdoors at places like the beach to gather with people they know have tested negative for the virus and to socially distance and wear masks when appropriate.

""If you separate into almost like pods of people that you know are being careful — maybe people who have been tested, you know they're negative, you know they're not being reckless — and stay with them, but not all over them,"" Fauci said. ""You could be separated by a fair amount. Obviously, you're not want to be wearing a mask when you jump in the water. Swim around, have fun. But when you come out, when you're congregating, put a mask on.""

President Joe Biden will give an address on the state of the pandemic Tuesday. During his remarks, the president will reportedly announce the new CDC guidance, though exactly what the new guidelines will be remains unclear.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-covid-christmas-worse-thanksgiving,2021-04-26
Former FDA commissioner admits cloth masks don't provide protection,"Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb admitted that cloth masks do not provide a high level of protection against COVID-19. Gottlieb — who sits on the board of directors of Pfizer — delivered his insight on face masks as well as stating that the omicron is a milder variant during an appearance on ""Face the Nation.""

""Cloth masks aren't going to provide a lot of protection, that's the bottom line,"" Gottlieb told host Margaret Brennan on Sunday morning.

""This is an airborne illness,"" he continued. ""We now understand that, and a cloth mask is not going to protect you from a virus that spreads through airborne transmission.""

""It could protect better through droplet transmission, something like the flu, but not something like this coronavirus,"" explained Gottlieb, who was a clinical assistant professor at New York University School of Medicine before becoming the 23rd FDA commissioner in 2017.

Last January, Gottlieb shared a CNN opinion piece titled: ""America needs better masks to fight Covid-19.""

Part of the reason is that new Covid-19 variants are more transmissible – meaning you are possibly more likely to be infected with even less exposure time and from greater distances than before. As Dr. Walensky herself mentions, ongoing studies are evaluating the efficacy of cloth masks in light of new variants. Without definitive answers, the precautionary principle – erring on the side of caution – should be invoked before more people become infected. Secondly, because -- regardless of variant -- the virus is still transmitted by both droplets and aerosols, the latter of which are best trapped by electrostatic chargesfound in N95 caliber masks.

In November 2020, Gottlieb wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal titled: ""Some Masks Will Protect You Better Than Others.""

In the article, Gottlieb noted that at the beginning of the pandemic, health agencies advised the public to use cloth masks because ""medical masks were in short supply.""

""A cotton mask offers far less protection than a surgical mask,"" he wrote, adding, ""An N95 or equivalent mask offers the best protection and, if used properly, will filter out at least 95% of infectious particles.""

During Sunday's ""Face the Nation"" interview, Brennan asked Gottlieb if schools should mandate COVID-19 booster shots for 12- to 15-year-olds.

""Well, look, I certainly don't think schools should be mandating boosters,"" he replied. ""I think this should be left up to the discretion of parents and their physicians.""

""You know, it's going to depend on the individual circumstance,"" Gottlieb said. ""What is the risk that the child's facing? Are they in a setting where they're more likely to come into contact with the infection? Do they have some underlying health conditions that put them at increased risk of bad outcomes?""

Gottlieb stressed that schools need to remain open.

""I think the imperative needs to be to try to open schools,"" he stated. ""What you're saying by closing schools preemptively, and even colleges, is that you can't possibly control outbreaks in those settings. And I just don't think that that's the case. I think with the tools we have with prudence, with the knowledge we have about how to control this infection in those settings, you can do pretty- a pretty good job of trying to control large outbreaks, certainly within the classroom.""

Gottlieb said the Omicron variant ""does appear to be a milder strain of coronavirus and we also have a lot of immunity in the population.""

""There is a very clear decoupling between cases at this point in hospitalizations and ICU admissions,"" he said. ""There's a very clear, as I said, decoupling between cases and hospitalizations and does appear now based on a lot of experimental evidence that we've gotten just in the last two weeks, that this is a milder form of the coronavirus appears to be a more of an upper airway disease and a lower airway disease that's good for most Americans.""

""The one group that- that may be a problem for his very young kids — very young children, toddlers who have trouble with upper airway infections, and you're in fact seeing more croup-like infections and bronchiolitis in New York City among children,"" he added. ""So, that could be a challenge for young kids, and we are seeing rising hospitalizations among that pediatric segment.""

Gottlieb believes that the current wave of the Omicron variant will begin to decline in most of the U.S. by the end of February.

""Now this is a big country, this will affect different parts of the country at different points in time,"" he said. ""But if the UK is any guide, London's already peaking. If South Africa is any guide. This is about a two-month epidemic wave from start to finish. And so, parts of the country that were affected earlier, like New York, probably are going to start to peak in the next two weeks, other parts within the next four weeks. So, I think certainly by the end of February, we will be through this if businesses need a guide of when prevalence is going to start to decline in terms of school.""

Last month, Gottlieb predicted that 2022 ""is going to be a transition year."" He said we will likely ""go from a pandemic into a more endemic phase.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-covid-outdoors-risk-new-mask-guidance,2022-01-02
FDA now investigating after multiple allergic reactions to Pfizer COVID vaccine reported across US,"The Food and Drug Administration said on Friday they are investigating after multiple allergic reactions were reported in people who had just received Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine.

The new development comes just days after the Pfizer vaccine began to be administered nationwide.

What did the FDA say?

Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said at a press conference that five allergic reactions occurred this week in more than one state.

The reactions were reportedly similar to those seen in the United Kingdom last week.

""We are working hand in hand with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and we've actually been working closely with our United Kingdom colleagues, who of course reported the allergic reaction. I think we'll be looking at all the data we can from each of these reactions to sort out exactly what happened, and we'll also be looking to try to understand which component of the vaccine might be helping to produce them,"" Marks said, the Hill reported.

Marks explained that scientists were not certain what caused the allergic reactions, but pointed to polyethylene glycol as the possible ""culprit."" The ingredient is present in both the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccine.

What's the background?



At least two of the reactions happened at the same hospital in Juneau, Alaska.

As the New York Times reported, the reactions happened within minutes of vaccine administration:

[The first worker] experienced a rash over her face and torso, shortness of breath and an elevated heart rate. Dr. Lindy Jones, the hospital's emergency department medical director, said the worker was first given a shot of epinephrine, a standard treatment for severe allergic reactions. Her symptoms subsided but then re-emerged, and she was treated with steroids and an epinephrine drip. When doctors tried to stop the drip, her symptoms re-emerged yet again, so the woman was moved to the intensive care unit, observed throughout the night, then weaned off the drip early Wednesday morning, Dr. Jones said.

...

The second worker received his shot on Wednesday and developed eye puffiness, lightheadedness and a scratchy throat 10 minutes after the injection, the hospital said in a statement. He was taken to the emergency room and treated with epinephrine, Pepcid and Benadryl, although the hospital said the reaction was not considered anaphylaxis. The worker was back to normal within an hour and released.



Still, the FDA said the vaccine is safe for most Americans who have allergies, Reuters reported.

The agency only warned those Americans who have a history of severe allergic reactions, or a history of allergic reactions to ingredients present in either vaccine, from immediately receiving the vaccine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fda-commissioner-cloth-masks-protection,2020-12-19
Fed head suggests additional interest rate hikes will ultimately produce the lesser of two pains,"On Friday at the Kansas Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming, Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, indicated that the Fed would continue raising interest rates in hopes of precluding price increases from becoming permanent. The intimation that interest rates will continue to go up triggered share prices around the world to dip.

In his speech, Powell suggested the forces that will ultimately bring down the present decades-high inflation — ""higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions"" — are ""unfortunate costs"" that will ""bring some pain to households and businesses."" Nevertheless, he argued, ""a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.""

Powell cautioned that ""reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth"" and that interest rates will remain at levels that will slow the economy ""for some time.""

Kathy Jones, the chief fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, explained the result of higher interest rates to the New York Times thusly: ""By raising rates, the Fed is trying to make you slow down your spending. That happens when the cost of money goes up for a car loan or mortgage or something else you want to spend money on. At some point, you’re going to pull back.""



By reducing Americans' buying power, the Fed is prompting consumers to buy less. Less demand might allow for supply to catch up and price increases to slow down.

In its last four meetings, the Fed rapidly lifted interest rates by two whole percentage points, from near zero in March to within a range of 2.25% to 2.5%, to deal with inflation, which in the neighborhood of 8.5%.

Powell did not specify in his speech how large a rate hike the Fed will announce at its September meeting or how long the rates will remain at these levels.

Whereas Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he favors a 50-basis-point hike at the Fed's next meeting, in his speech, Powell referenced his July statement that another 75-basis-point increase ""could be appropriate at our next meeting.""



Some believe the Fed's ""forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand"" may result in a recession.

Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research, suggested the ""likelihood of recession is rising, because that's the solution to the inflation problem.""

Desmond Lachman, an economist and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote on Wednesday that the ""Fed is maintaining this hawkish posture even though the economy has contracted in two successive quarters"" while ""turning a blind eye to the strong deflationary forces emanating from abroad as a result of the rapidly deteriorating state of the world economy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fda-investigating-covid-vaccine-allergic-reactions,2022-08-26
"Feminist author Naomi Wolf wrongly claimed in book that men, boys were executed for being gay in Victorian England. Her book just got pulled.","A new book by famed feminist author Naomi Wolf — which incorrectly claimed that England executed men and boys for being gay during the Victorian era — is being pulled, the Telegraph reported.

The book — ""Outrages: Sex, Censorship, and the Criminalization of Love"" — is based on a Ph.D. thesis she wrote in 2015, the Telegraph added. Turns out Wolf began but never completed her thesis as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, The Guardian said, adding that she reapplied to the school to finish it.

What are the details?

Here's what Wolf told The Guardian earlier this year about what her research uncovered:

""I could not get over what I found,"" she says. ""People widely believe that the last executions for sodomy were in 1830. But I read every Old Bailey record throughout the 19th century, so I know that not only did they continue; they got worse. In the beginning, there were relatively few executions, and it was relatively difficult to get arrested. If you were, it was usually for rape or the molestation of children. But then there's a transition, and you see adult consensual men being brought in as couples, and it begins to be more likely they'll be convicted and given a sentence of penal servitude or worse."" Her voice rises. ""Those kids … I cannot get them out of my mind … executed or sent to Australia for the attempt at sodomy."" To take just one example, in 1859, a 14-year old-boy named Thomas Silver was found guilty of having committed an ""unnatural offense"" and hanged.

The Guardian added that Wolf believed what she discovered encompassed the threads of modern homophobia.

But we have a big problem

Then in a May BBC interview with Wolf, the host pointed out her book's claim that the aforementioned 14-year-old boy was ""actually executed for committing sodomy"" and that his fate was noted as ""GUILTY — Death recorded.""

And therein lies a giant problem. The host, Matthew Sweet, told Wolf during his interview that she was wrong — that, in fact, ""death recorded"" actually meant Silver was spared capital punishment.

The term ""death recorded,"" Sweet continued, ""was a category that was created in 1823 that allowed judges to abstain from pronouncing a sentence of death on any capital convict whom they considered to be a fit subject for pardon. I don't think any of the executions you've identified here actually happened.""

Ouch. Here's a clip of that interview:

With that, Wolf told Sweet: ""Well, that's [a] really important thing to investigate.""

Hot Air added that Sweet also discovered that all those in the book Wolf said were victims — like Silver — actually were found guilty of rape and, in some cases, pedophilia:

""When I found this I didn't really know what to do with it because I think it's quite a big problem with your argument,"" Sweet said. He continued, ""Also, it's the nature of the offense here. Thomas Silver committed an indecent assault on a six-year-old boy. And he served two-and-a-half years for it in Portsmouth prison which doesn't seem too excessive really.



""And I wonder about all the others because all the others that I followed up, I can't find any evidence that any of these relationships that you've described were consensual. The other one you offer is James Spence, 60-year-old tutor. He committed what was described as felonious assault on schoolboys. One of these cases you offer is a bestiality case and not a buggery case. So, I think there's a problem here with this argument.""

Wolf acknowledged some errors but said they were fixable and objected to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's postponement of the book in June, the Associated Press reported. She even promoted ""Outrages"" on her own in the U.S., with attendees offered the chance to buy the U.K. edition, the AP added.

More from the Telegraph on what happened next:



Her U.K. publisher, Virago, corrected the mistakes, and the book remains on sale in the U.K., but according to the New York Times, her U.S. publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt has now cancelled the entire U.S. run.



Just days before it was due to be published they recalled copies from retailers at a significant cost, saying ""new questions have arisen that require more time to explore.""



Now, a spokesperson for the company said they had ""mutually and amicably agreed to part company"" with Wolf, who told the paper that she was still hoping for it to be released in the US ""in due course.""

New doubts

The Telegraph also said Wolf's research errors ""have thrown into doubt the merits of her doctorate awarded by Trinity College, Oxford, and it emerged in June, that the author had made contact with the university in order to correct mistakes made in her thesis.""

Wolf and Oxford University ""were approached for comment,"" the Telegraph added without noting if they responded.

The author has had her scholarship challenged before, the AP said, adding that Wolf's best-seller, ""The Beauty Myth,"" says anorexia caused 150,000 deaths among women annually. But the AP noted that such a death count is generally regarded as inflated.

As for how the ""Outrages"" errors made it to print, the AP said publishers rarely fact-check books due to the time and expense.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fed-head-say-counter-inflation-efforts-the-lesser-pain,2019-10-22
"Firefight involving US forces breaks out at Kabul airport, Afghan soldier killed, others wounded","An Afghan soldier was killed and three others were wounded after a firefight erupted at Kabul's international airport on Monday amid ongoing evacuation efforts by the U.S. military.

Germany's military said Monday that U.S. forces were involved in the exchange of gunfire with ""unknown attackers."" The incident happened as thousands of Afghans and foreigners including U.S. citizens sought entrance to the airport to flee the new Taliban regime in Afghanistan.

The U.S. military later confirmed to NBC News that no American or NATO coalition forces members were injured after the brief firefight. Navy Capt. William Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said the incident ""appeared to begin when an unknown hostile actor fired upon Afghan security forces.""

The U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan on Saturday advised U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to the airport because of ""security threats outside the gates.""

President Joe Biden's administration faces mounting criticism for failing to guarantee the safe passage of American citizens and Afghan allies of the U.S. to the airport and out of the country following the withdrawal of U.S. forces.

The administration was surprised when the Taliban seized control of Kabul on Aug. 15, triggering a humanitarian crisis as tens of thousands of people in the city sought to flee the country through the airport. According to Reuters, at least 20 people have been killed in shootings and stampedes as U.S. forces work to evacuate their citizens and Afghans who may be targeted by the Taliban in retribution for assisting the U.S.

President Joe Biden said Sunday that 28,000 people have been evacuated from Afghanistan since Aug. 14, but an unknown number of Americans are still in the country. Evacuation efforts have a ""long way to go and a lot could still go wrong,"" Biden told reporters at the White House.

""""The evacuation of thousands of people from Kabul is going to be hard and painful no matter when it started, when we began,"" he added.

U.S. troops are being assisted by some 600 Afghan security forces soldiers who are providing security around the airport. Monday's firefight, as described by Urban, exemplifies the dangers they face.

""The Afghans returned fire, and in keeping with their right of self-defense, so too did U.S. and coalition troops,"" he said, adding that one Afghan soldier was killed by the unknown assailants and several Afghans were wounded during the violence.

""The wounded are being treated at an airfield hospital and are reported to be in stable condition. Our condolences go out to the teammates and loved ones of the fallen Afghan soldier,"" Urban said.

Biden had initially insisted that U.S. forces complete their withdrawal from Afghanistan by August 31, regardless of the evacuation effort, but he said Sunday he is reconsidering that decision. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will ask Biden to extend the evacuation deadline when they speak at a virtual G7 Summit Tuesday, and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has also called for the deadline to be extended, according to France 24.

The Taliban has warned Western nations against extending the deadline to evacuate their citizens from Afghanistan.

""If the US or UK were to seek additional time to continue evacuations — the answer is no. Or there would be consequences,"" Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told Sky News on Monday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/feminist-author-naomi-wolf-wrongly-claimed-that-boys-were-executed-for-being-gay,2021-08-23
Former CDC director says he continues to believe COVID likely leaked from a lab,"Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said Monday that he continues to believe that the COVID-19 pandemic probably leaked from a laboratory.

In an interview with Martha MacCallum on Fox News, Redfield said that during the past year and a half there has not been new evidence to indicate that the illness ""evolved from nature."" There has not been evidence that the virus is connected to any of the numerous animal species tested, but there has been increasing evidence to bolster the idea that it resulted from a lab leak, he said.

Redfield described himself as ""disheartened"" by the scientific community's failure to consider both pandemic origin theories in an open-minded manner, saying that he ""was very rapidly sidelined, threatened, and you know really put on, sort of outed,"" due to his view that COVID-19 may have emerged from a lab.

The Trump-era CDC official said that COVID-19 has been extremely infectious among humans.

""This virus is replicating at a high capacity in humans. And as a consequence the risk for variant evolution is extremely high,"" he said.

Redfield pointed to the UK variant and the Delta variant and predicted that in the coming months another variant will be more infectious than the Delta variant.

""The one thing that we all can do that can really confront the evolution of this next variant, slow it down, is to really continue to get our population vaccinated. And more importantly I believe, although it's not getting as much discussion as I want, making sure that we're doing what we need to do to maintain the immunity in the vulnerable individuals,"" Redfield said.

He said it is apparent that the vaccine will not be ""durable year after year"" and it needs to be determined how to maintain immunity in people who got vaccinated early.

According to the CDC, 58.7% of the U.S. population ages 12 and older have been fully vaccinated, while 68.8% have received at least one dose.

Former FDA head says US could 'turn the corner' in 3 weeks on Delta variant outbreak,"Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under the Trump administration, says that the U.S. could ""turn the corner"" over the next three weeks in COVID-19's latest concerning Delta variant outbreak.

What are the details?

According to a Forbes report on Monday, Gottlieb — who also sits on Pfizer's board — warned that the coronavirus' resurgence across the country is probably more widespread than what's being reported, but he believes that could mean that the U.S. is turning the corner on the latest Delta variant outbreak.

""I believe there's more virus than we're picking up right now,"" Gottlieb said on Sunday's ""Face the Nation,"" basing his theory on the Delta variant's trajectory in the United Kingdom — which he says is about three to four weeks ahead of the U.S. in terms of the infection rate.

""If you look at the U.K. in the last seven days, they do appear to be turning the corner,"" he continued. ""It's unclear whether that's going to be sustained [since] they just lifted a lot of the mitigation they had in place, but if the U.K. is any guide, we are perhaps further into this epidemic and hopefully going to turn a corner in the next two or maybe three weeks.""

Gottlieb in his remarks also advised vaccinated Americans to mask up against the spread of the contagious Delta variant.

Forbes reports 350,000 new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. over the past week, a 172% jump from just two weeks ago and the highest levels since April.

Gottlieb says U.S. likely ""much further in this epidemic than we're picking up www.youtube.com

What else?

In a Monday interview with ""Squawk Box,"" Gottlieb added, ""I think the more observable trend is what's going on in the United Kingdom, where cases are clearly coming down at this point. There's a very clear trend down. It seems like they've peaked.""

While that may be encouraging, Gottlieb warned that the country might face challenges as such a timeline coincides with the reopening of schools for the 2021-22 school year.

“We'll be turning a corner right at the point that schools start to reopen, and my concern is that schools reopening could cause sort of a second bump in cases, or could look like a pattern where you start to see a decline and then it levels out because the reopening of the schools becomes a source of local transmission, and we don't quite get out of it as quickly as we would've,"" he said. “That remains to be seen.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-cdc-director-says-he-continues-to-believe-covid-likely-leaked-from-a-lab,2021-07-26
France recalls ambassadors from the US and Australia after calling Indo-Pacific pact a 'stab in the back',"The United States, Australia and Britain celebrated a new trilateral pact on Wednesday but France displayed their displeasure with the agreement after calling it a ""stab in the back.""

On Friday France recalled ambassadors from the United States and Australia, a dramatic and unprecedented move.

""This exceptional decision is justified by the exceptional seriousness of the announcements made on September 15 by Australia and the United States,"" explained French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

The trilateral pact, called AUKUS, includes the plan to create a nuclear-powered submarine fleet for Australia in order to protect the interests of the three countries in the Indo-Pacific region.

Many observers noted that the agreement was a direct challenge to China's growing influence.

De Drian, however, angrily derided the pact on behalf of France. Australia had cancelled a contract with France to buy diesel electric submarines from the country in favor of the U.S.-manufactured nuclear submarines.

""It's a stab in the back. We had established a trusting relationship with Australia, and this trust was betrayed,"" said Le Drian on Thursday.

On Friday Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that the French government had been notified about the AUKUS deal prior to the announcement, but admitted that there was more work to do to improve their frayed relations.

Le Drian said he was ""angry and very bitter"" about what he referred to as a ""break up."" He also said that the move reminded him of the brutality he had come to expect under former President Donald Trump.

""This brutal, unilateral, unpredictable decision looks very much like what Mr. Trump used to do,"" he said.

France rarely recalls its ambassadors. In 2019, the country recalled their ambassador from Italy over comments made criticizing the French government. They also recalled their ambassador from Turkey after that nation's president said French President Macron needed mental health treatment.

""Allies don't do this to each other,"" Le Drian concluded about the U.S. pact. ""It's rather insufferable.""

"In France, people now need a form to leave their houses as 100,000 police have been commissioned to enforce the country's lockdown","As a part of a ramped-up lockdown, France is now requiring people to fill out a form justifying their reason for being away from home.

On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced the 15-day lockdown in France, saying that the country is at ""war"" with the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. The lockdown requires most people to remain at home over the next couple weeks in order to stem the spread of the virus.

Under the lockdown, French residents are still able to leave their homes if absolutely necessary, but in order to so they must produce a document citing their reasons for being in public.

According to Business Insider, some of the excusable reasons are to seek medical care, to work (if remote work is not possible), to buy groceries in authorized shops, or to get some exercise by yourself.

To enforce the rule, 100,000 police officers have been deployed and authorized to hand out fines. Residents found out and about without the form will be fined a minimum of 38 euros ($42) and a maximum of 135 euros ($150).

""Stay at home,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner flatly said as he announced the enforcement measures.

Speaking with i24 News, French journalist Peter John Humi said that, in general, the French people are accepting of the lockdown so far and that they view it as such rather than as a mandated ""curfew.""

As of Tuesday morning, over 6,000 had tested positive for the virus in France and the death toll was at 148.

In the United States, President Donald Trump and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued tougher guidelines for social distancing this week amid the outbreak.

The CDC recommended that all events consisting of 50 or more people within the next eight weeks should be canceled or postponed, while the president advised Americans to avoid social gatherings of 10 or more people.

So far, the U.S. government has not enacted measures to enforce social distancing and community mitigation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/france-ambassadors-recalled-aukus-sub,2020-03-17
France to launch contest to determine design of new spire for damaged Notre Dame Cathedral,"The French government will be launching a contest to design a new spire for the Notre Dame Cathedral after the old one was destroyed in a fire.

What happened?

On Monday, the Notre Dame Cathedral caught fire. While much of the building's stone structure survived, the wooden roof and spire were destroyed and the rest of the building suffered serious damage. While an investigation is still ongoing, French authorities have said that they believe the fire was accidental.

Since the fire, billionaires and companies from around the world have pledge hundreds of millions of dollars to finance the cathedral's reconstruction.

What contest?

On Wednesday, the French government announced that it would be holding a competition to redesign the roof of the building.

French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said he thought the contest could give Notre Dame ""a spire suited to the techniques and challenges of our time."" He also suggested that the contest could result in the building being reconstructed without a spire at all. ""The international competition will allow us to ask the question of whether we should even recreate the spire as it was conceived by Viollet-le-Duc,"" he said, according to Reuters. He called the undertaking ""a historical responsibility.""

While the foundation for the cathedral was laid in 1163, the spire was added during a restoration in the mid-1800s by Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc.

French President Emmanuel Macron said that he wanted to see the church rebuilt within five years ""more beautiful than before."" However, the cathedral's own rector said that the church would likely be closed to the public for up to six years due to a segment that ""has been very weakened,"" so the actual timetable could be longer than that.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/france-form-to-leave-house-coronavirus,2019-04-17
Franklin Graham had an event canceled in the UK because he views homosexuality as a sin — he responded with the gospel,"The Rev. Franklin Graham, a popular evangelist and the son of the late Rev. Billy Graham, recently had a speaking engagement in the United Kingdom canceled due to his views on homosexuality.

What are the details?

Graham was scheduled to speak at a venue in Liverpool this summer as a part of a larger tour through the U.K., but on Sunday the venue, ACC Liverpool, informed the public that the event would be canceled.

""Over the past few days we have been made aware of a number of statements which we consider to be incompatible with our values,"" ACC Liverpool said in a statement. ""In light of this we can no longer reconcile the balance between freedom of speech and the divisive impact this event is having in our city. We have informed the organisers of the event that the booking will no longer be fulfilled.""

FaithWire noted that the decision to cancel Graham's event in Liverpool is not surprising, as LGBT protesters in the city had been calling for its cancellation for several days.

The Liverpool Labour LGBT Network called Graham a ""homophobic hate preacher"" in a petition to the Liverpool City Council.

""We fear that with such a high profile event gaining traction, Graham's appearance may incite hateful mobilisation and risk the security of our LGBTQ+ community,"" the group wrote.

The Liverpool City Region Pride Foundation also penned a letter to authorities, saying, the evangelist preacher ""is well known"" for ""promoting hate of LGBT+ people as more important than education"" and ""openly supporting conversion therapy and the vicious attacks on our community in Russia.""

How did Graham respond?

Following the cancellation, Graham posted a lengthy response on Facebook to the LGBTQ community in the U.K.

In the response, he did not back off his views regarding what the Bible says about homosexuality, but suggested that he is not coming to condemn them, but to present them with the hope of the gospel.

""The rub, I think, comes in whether God defines homosexuality as sin. The answer is yes,"" he acknowledged. ""But God goes even further than that, to say that we are all sinners — myself included. The Bible says that every human being is guilty of sin and in need of forgiveness and cleansing. The penalty of sin is spiritual death — separation from God for eternity.""

Graham also said that he desires to use his freedom of speech not to speak ""against anybody"" but to speak ""for everybody.""

""The Gospel is inclusive. I'm not coming out of hate, I'm coming out of love,"" he wrote, inviting ""everyone in the LGBTQ community to come and hear for yourselves the Gospel.""

That gospel, Graham wrote, is that ""Jesus Christ came. He became sin for us. He didn't come to condemn the world, He came to save the world by giving His life on the Cross as a sacrifice for our sins.""

'Get the f*** outta here!': Furious NYC drivers confront radical left-wing environmentalists blocking morning rush-hour,"Radical left-wing environmentalists blocked Monday morning rush hour roads in New York City, igniting fury among Manhattan motorists looking to get to work.

What are the details?

Northbound lanes of FDR Drive were closed at Jackson Street in Manhattan before 9 a.m., WPIX-TV reported.

Video cameras captured the road blocking as it unfolded:

Extinction Rebellion NYC was behind the stunt, the station said, adding that the group was calling on President Joe Biden to push environmental reforms with the ""Build Back Better"" plan. Biden was scheduled to visit New Jersey Monday to pitch the plan, WPIX added.

Content warning: Language:

Angry drivers

In one clip, irate drivers exited their vehicles to confront the protesters face-to-face.

""You guys work?"" one motorist hollered. ""We got things to do!""

Another driver kicked and tossed the group's orange cones, yelling at them to ""get the f*** outta here!""

""I f***in' work, man!"" the first motorist yelled.

Also a woman emerged from her vehicle to implore the protesters to move so she could take her child to school.

(Content warning: Language):

""If we do not act today, if @potus does not act today, NYC will be underwater by 2100,"" the group tweeted. ""It's a matter of life and death.""

Motorists were advised to expect delays and consider alternate routes, WPIX reported.

More from the station:

Another protest near West 34th Street and 12th Avenue blocked all southbound lanes the same time, according to Notify NYC. Those lanes reopened around 10 a.m.



It was not immediately clear if the protest on the west side of Manhattan is connected to the protest on the FDR Drive.

WPIX — citing the city's emergency management department — noted that roadways reopened as of 10:45 a.m.

Anything else?

Extinction Rebellion has created public disruptions for a number of years to get its agenda across. On Earth Day this past April the group dumped manure near the White House to protest Biden's ""bulls**t"" environmental plan.

Openly gay anti-Trump Olympic skier leaves US team to join British Olympic team,"An openly gay Olympic skier who mocked President Donald Trump has abandoned the US team and joined the British team, he announced Tuesday.

Gus Kenworthy skied on the US Ski and Snowboard team in 2014 at Sochi, Russia, and also in 2018 at Pyeongchang, South Korea. He received a silver medal in the 2014 Olympics.

He has been a vocal critic of Trump and compared his presidency to Nazi Germany.

""This is a great opportunity for me to start again and compete in three events in 2022,"" Kenworthy said in a statement about his exit from the US team.

""I have strong roots in the UK and have been close with many of the athletes,"" he added. ""For me, this is an incredible opportunity to join a first-class team and I believe we will be able to deliver great results.""

Kenworthy, who is 28 years old, was born in Britain and moved to the United States as a child.

In 2016, he tweeted, ""Was just writing a tweet about Trump and my phone autocorrected bigly to bigot. Seems appropriate.""

Kenworthy made headlines in 2018 when he posted a photo of himself and his boyfriend on Instagram adding, ""Eat your heart out, Pence. #TeamUSA #TeamUSGay.""

Biden adviser melts down when challenged by Fox News hosts on inflation and the economy: 'You know the answer to that!',"An interview with Gene Sperling, a senior advisor to President Joe Biden, devolved into a shouting match on Fox News when he was challenged to defend the president's plan on inflation and the economy.

Sperling shouted at co-hosts John Roberts and Sandra Smith who challenged him to explain the missteps of the Biden administration that led to soaring inflation on ""America Reports"" Tuesday.

""If he has been obsessed with bringing gas prices down,"" asked Smith in reference to Biden, ""why are we at a brand new record high today, why are we seeing $4.62 a gallon at the pump if this president's been obsessed with tackling gas prices and inflation?""

""You know the, you know the answer to that!"" Sperling responded.

""You know that this is global, you read the papers today, you know that the Euro just said that inflation is 8.1%, you read the papers last week that the UK was at 9%, you know that this is a global issue,"" he continued, appearing frustrated.

""So there's nothing we can do about it? There's nothing we can do as a country to bring prices down?"" Smith interjected.

""I've explicitly, I've explicitly said the opposite!"" answered Sperling, who went on to say that the Biden administration will back the independent actions of the Federal Reserve to bring inflation down.

Smith went on to ask Sperling to forecast the future prices of gasoline, but he refused and instead cited economic statistics favorable to the administration.

Later in the segment, Sperling angrily berated the hosts for asking for Biden's economic plan.

""Gene, we appreciate you joining us, these are pretty simple questions, and you know we appreciate you joining us but, people just want to know what the plan is, I mean, gas prices all-time high, inflation at a 40 year high, the president in his speech makes the case that the economy is thriving!"" Smith said.

""You know what? I just, you know what? Here's the deal, I just go through the plan, and you just pretend that I didn't say it, you just ignore and you just ask the same questions,"" Sperling responded, raising his voice.

""It's your show, if that's what you want to do, but when I'm going though this and you just interrupt, I don't see how that's helping your viewers. Now you can say that you disagree with the plan,"" he continued.



""We gave you quite a bit of time to explain!"" Smith protested.

""By the way! By the way!"" he shouted. ""Last time I was on this show, you were upset because I was talking about the Rick Scott plan!""

Sperling went on to argue that Republicans didn't have a plan to address the economy while angrily claiming he had tried to present Biden's economic plan but was being interrupted by Smith and Roberts.

Elsewhere in the interview, he touted the administration's track record on job recovery while admitting that they needed to transition towards battling inflation.

Polling shows that most Americans blame Biden and his high spending policies for damaging inflation and the state of the economy.

"Germany bans Hezbollah after labeling Iran-backed militant group a 'terror organization,' conducts raids","Germany designated Lebanese militant and political group Hezbollah as a terror organization on Thursday. After outlawing the Iran-backed militant group, dawn raids were carried out at mosques to prevent the destruction of any evidence linking individuals or groups to Hezbollah.

German police raided four mosques with Hezbollah connections and private residences of the group's leaders in Berlin, Bremen, Dortmund, Münster, and Recklinghausen.

""As the authority responsible for issuing the ban, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building, and Community is of the opinion that Hezbollah openly calls for the violent elimination of the State of Israel and questions the right of the State of Israel to exist,"" the German ministry said in a statement. ""The organization is therefore fundamentally against the concept of international understanding, regardless of whether it presents itself as a political, social, or military structure.""

Steve Alter, a spokesman for German Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer, tweeted: ""BM [Federal Minister] Seehofer today banned the activity of the Shiite terrorist organization Hezbollah (Party of God) in Germany. Police measures are underway in several federal states concurrently since the early hours of the morning. The rule of law is able to act in times of crisis.""

""The associations under investigation are suspected of forming part of Hezbollah due to their financial support and propaganda for the terrorist organization,"" Seehofer said in a statement.

Hezbollah symbols are banned, and the group's assets can be confiscated. There are believed to be approximately 1,000 Hezbollah activists in Germany.

The United States labels Hezbollah as a terrorist group, and the Trump administration issued sanctions on the Iran-backed militant group as recently as August 2019.

Richard Grenell, U.S. ambassador to Germany and acting director of National Intelligence, tweeted that ""the world is a little bit safer"" with Germany outlawing Hezbollah.

""We applaud the German government's actions today against suspected Hizballah supporters. The government's decision to act reflects the resolve of the West to confront the global threat posed by Hizballah,"" Grenell said in a statement.

Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz called the ban ""a valuable and significant step in the global fight against terrorism.""

""I call on additional European countries and the European Union to adopt this necessary policy and to recognize the organization for what it is: Hezbollah — both its military and political wings — constitutes a terror organization, and that is how it must be treated,"" Katz said in a statement.

The European Union designated Hezbollah's military wing a terror organization in 2013, but did not blacklist the group's political wing. In 2012, Hezbollah's deputy leader said Shia Islamist group did not divide itself into military and political branches, and that all elements were ""in the service of the resistance"" against Israel.

Britain's finance ministry added the entire Hezbollah entity to its list of terrorist groups in February 2019. British Interior Minister Sajid Javis said United Kingdom authorities could ""no longer able to distinguish between their already banned military wing and the political party."" The U.K. froze Hezbollah assets in January 2019.

Ghislaine Maxwell has unexplained black eye in first photo from prison,"Ghislaine Maxwell appears unrecognizable in the first photo released of her since her imprisonment — and shows the accused madam of sporting a black eye that her attorneys cannot explain.

What are the details?

Maxwell, 59, is the former girlfriend of the late convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. She has been in federal custody for roughly 10 months over allegations that she groomed young girls and women who became victims of Epstein during the late 1990s through the early 2000s.

Last month, Maxwell was charged with sex trafficking of a minor, over allegations that she groomed a 14-year-old girl to engage in sex acts with Epstein.

Epstein died in 2019 while being held awaiting trial in a cell at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, and his death was ruled a suicide. But his past links to several powerful leaders — including former President Bill Clinton, then-President Donald Trump, and the UK's Prince Andrew — cast doubts over whether he took his own life.

Maxwell is being held in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, and officials want to be sure she stays alive. So guards keep a close watch on their high-profile inmate, checking every 15 minutes to be sure she is still breathing.

But Maxwell's lawyers want those check-ins to stop.

Fox News reported that Maxwell attorney Bobbi Sternheim submitted a court filing Thursday afternoon, which included the photo of his client's black eye. Sternheim stated that Maxwell does not know how she received the injury, but the lawyer speculated that it might have come from Maxwell shielding her eyes from flashlights during checks by guards.

Sternheim told the court that Maxwell ""has grown increasingly reluctant to report information to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline and punitive chores.""

Anything else?

Maxwell has been denied bail multiple times since being detained last year. In late December, she even offered a $28.5 million bail package that was turned down by a judge.

Giant swarm of flying ants shows up on weather radar,"Adding to the surreal feeling that 2020 has consisted of a series of Exodus-style plagues, a huge swarm of flying ants swept across the United Kingdom on Saturday, and the swarm was so huge and so dense that weather radar mistakenly identified it as rain.

Brits were understandably confused when the U.K.'s Meteorological Office (known as the Met Office) displayed a weather map Sunday showing that it was raining in several places where absolutely no precipitation was falling.

The Met Office's Twitter account quickly attempted to clear things up and sheepishly admitted that a giant cloud of flying ants was to blame for the mishap.

Some initial reports erroneously stated that the cloud of ants was so huge that it was visible from space, but the Met Office quickly cleared up any confusion on that.



Twitter twitter.com

The radar error was due to a phenomenon known as Flying Ant Day, which occurs once a year in the U.K. Flying ants across the country leave their nests in a frenzied search for mates. As a result, billions of ants take to the skies at essentially the same time.

It should be noted, there is at least some amount of scientific disagreement as to whether Flying Ant Day is a misconception and that some scientists have suggested that the existence of a single Flying Ant Day is really a myth that is fed by the phenomenon of people remarking about it repeatedly on social media.

Either way, this particular cloud of flying ants was clearly unusual. BBC meteorologist Bryan King said that this was the largest cloud of insects he'd ever seen in the U.K.: ""For it to actually to appear on the radar imagery, that's something certainly incredible, and I just feel sorry for all the people who have to experience those flying ants.""

Perhaps equally pestilential were the massive flocks of seagulls that were reported to have congregated upon the cloud in order to enjoy a flying ant feast.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ghislaine-maxwell-has-unexplained-black-eye-in-first-photo-from-prison,2020-07-20
"Gender-neutral restrooms in UK schools reportedly causing girls to hold bladders all day, stay home when menstruating","Gender-neutral restrooms in United Kingdom schools are resulting in girls holding their bladders all day — which puts them at risk for infections — and staying home from school when they're menstruating because they're embarrassed and feel unsafe in the restrooms with boys, the Daily Mail reported.

The inclusive restrooms trend is tied to the push to help transgender students who want to use restrooms typically occupied by those of the opposite sex, the outlet said.

But now doctors and politicians are telling schools to stop the unisex restroom idea in order to protect girls from further harm, the Daily Mail said.

Tessa Katz, a physician, told the outlet that regularly holding urine for prolonged periods can increase the risk of girls suffering urinary and bladder infections, the outlet said — not to mention the potential psychological damage of girls not feeling safe enough to use gender-neutral restrooms.

Some girls are so fearful that they've stopped drinking liquids at school, the Daily Mail said.

Parents speak out

Some parents aren't happy about the rise in gender-neutral restrooms at schools, the outlet noted, adding that many of them said they weren't consulted before the change was made.

Case in point: Deanesfield Primary School in West London — which teaches children up to the age of 11 — installed unisex restrooms this year, and parents told the Express that some children were so embarrassed that they were refusing to urinate at school.

With that, outraged parents set up a petition at the school gates last month in order to put a stop to the unisex restroom idea, the paper said.

The Express added that one parent, who wished to remain anonymous, told MyLondon: ""Making the toilets unisex isn't the issue for me; it's the fact [that] they haven't followed the guidelines which state that unisex toilets must have cubicle walls from floors to ceiling. They haven't done this, and there's already been cases of boys looking over the tops at girls on the toilet. Children are so inquisitive at school age. Girls are being forced to hold themselves until they get home which could damage kidneys. My friend's daughter has been holding herself all day because she's so embarrassed. It's not fair on the kids really.""

What did the school have to say?

""We will be communicating with our parents about the changes made to the school toilets as soon as possible,"" a spokesperson from Deanesfield Primary School told MyLondon, according to the Express. ""In the meantime, if parents have any worries about their child, then staff are here to provide support.""

Tory Member of Parliament David Davies has supported feminist claims that transgender rights are overriding women's rights and told the outlet that ""if girls are not comfortable sharing toilets with boys then schools should make provision for them, rather than saying girls have got a problem.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/giant-swarm-flying-ants-weather-radar,2019-10-18
"‘Chilling,’ ‘deeply concerning,’ ‘bad news for the whole world’: Global abortion advocates melt down over potential worldwide reverberations of US overturning Roe v. Wade","A leaked draft indicating that the U.S. Supreme Court is set to overturn its landmark ruling on abortion in Roe v. Wade sent progressive politicians and abortion advocates in the U.S. spiraling into a frenzy Monday night. But the pandemonium didn't stop at the nation's borders; rather, the reverberations could be felt around the globe.

According to VICE News, abortion activists all around the world lashed out Monday into Tuesday, lamenting over the potential ""disturbing"" and ""chilling"" consequences that the U.S. ruling could have on abortion rights in other countries and the movement at large.

""This is really bad news for the whole world,"" Polish abortion activist Natalia Broniarczyk told the outlet.

Hanneke van Halen, from Abortion Network Amsterdam, added in regret that ""the normalisation of patriarchal violence in a world-dominating country like the US will have an impact on the reproductive rights of people everywhere.""

Mandu Reid, who leads the U.K.’s Women's Equality Party (WEP), told VICE: ""This is chilling news coming from the US, it is the latest disturbing attack on reproductive rights amidst a global backlash against women's equality.""

Apparently, news that the U.S. had finally decided to dispel its invented notion that a woman has the constitutional right to kill an unborn child without government interference was ""deeply concerning"" to foreign activists.

Moreover, the fact that a majority of appointed justices would rule it better to instead return the controversial matter to the states, where elected lawmakers would decide what to do, was evidently troubling, too.

""We're talking about a handful of people — mostly conservative men — making life-changing decisions about women's bodily autonomy without their consent. But this applies to the UK too, where free, safe, and legal abortion still isn't a legal right and where underfunding leads to difficulties in women accessing contraception and abortions,"" Reid further argued.

Sarah Shaw, head of advocacy for MSI Reproductive Choices, a global pro-abortion group, expressed fear that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, ""it would be the biggest setback to women’s rights in the U.S. in a generation and deeply concerning for global reproductive rights.""



Together, many of the activists expressed support for the speedy codification of abortion rights in countries where such is possible. The same idea was posited in the U.S. by Democratic politicians — led by President Joe Biden — as a way to protect women's ability to terminate pregnancies without punishment.

In a draft decision obtained by Politico on Monday, Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, said, ""We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,"" referring to two separate decisions that enshrined and upheld abortion rights.

Great Britain announces a plan to mint NFTs through the Royal Mint in a bid to 'lead the way' in the increasingly digital economy,"On Monday, the British government announced its plans to move forward with minting its own non-fungible tokens (NFT) as it attempts to become a ""world leader"" in the cryptocurrency space in the global economy.

British Finance Minister Rishi Sunak asked the Royal Mint — the entity responsible for the manufacture of the United Kingdom's currency — to create and issue the NFT ""by the summer,"" CNBC reported.

The United Kingdom's NFT initiative is the British government's attempt to ""lead the way"" in crypto, according to City Minister John Glen.

Glen stated that there are a number of regulatory steps the U.K. plans to introduce to bring digital assets — like NFTs and Bitcoin — scrutiny.

These include:

Regulate stablecoins with existing regulations on electronic payments;

Strategizing on a ""world-leading regime"" for regulating trade in other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum;

Asking the British Law Commission to consider the legal status of blockchain-based communities;

Examine the taxability of decentralized finance loans and interest gaining services;

Establishing a Cryptoasset Engagement Group that will be an official government body and will engage with British regulators and cryptocurrency-oriented businesses;

Explore the possibility of using blockchain technology in regulating debt instruments.

Glen said, ""We shouldn't be thinking of regulation as a static, rigid thing. Instead, we should be thinking in terms of regulatory 'code' — like computer code — which we refine and rewrite when we need to.""

He also said that the British government was ""widening"" its gaze to look at introducing more diverse regulations on the ever-expanding world of cryptocurrency, including the burgeoning Web3 movement, which would establish a more decentralized global internet that is powered and regulated through blockchain technology.

""No one knows for sure yet how Web3 is going to look,"" Glen said. ""But there's every chance that blockchain is going to be integral to its development. We want this country to be there leading from the front, seeking out the greatest economic opportunities.""

Similarly, across the pond, the American federal government is continuing to move forward with the development of a central bank digital currency — fully digitizing the U.S. dollar — and preparing to regulate the cryptocurrency holdings of the American public.

In an era with historic levels of regulation, the wages and savings of the American people are constantly losing value, and storing money in a savings account with a sub-1% interest rate is becoming less appealing to more and more people. So naturally, they're looking for a more secure alternative other than storing cash under their mattresses.

There are currently trillions of dollars invested in cryptocurrencies for these very reasons, and the more that government tries to regulate them, the less appealing they become to potential investors.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/global-abortion-advocates-melt-down-over-roe,2022-04-05
Greta Thunberg is boycotting the climate summit because of 'vaccine nationalism',"Greta Thunberg says that she will not attend the next global climate summit because the inequality of vaccine distribution means not all countries will be represented equally.

The teenage climate activist said the (Conference of the Parties) COP26 summit planned in Glasgow, Scotland in November, will have unequal representation from countries that have less access to vaccines.

""Of course I would love to attend the Glasgow COP26. But not unless everyone can take part on the same terms,"" Thunberg said in a tweet.

""Right now many countries are vaccinating healthy young people, often at the expense of risk groups and front line workers (mainly from global south, as usual...),"" she continued.



""Inequality and climate injustice is already the heart of the climate crisis. If people can't be vaccinated and travel to be represented equally that's undemocratic and would worsen the problem,"" she said in a second tweet.

Thunberg also called for the summit to be postponed until global vaccinations rise.

""We don't have to wait for conferences nor anyone or anything else to dramatically start reducing our emissions. Solidarity and action can start today,"" she added, before noting lamentably that digital access was also limited in many countries and unequally distributed.

Thunberg attended the United Nations COP25 climate change summit in Madrid in 2019 and excoriated world leaders for ignoring her calls to massively change global industries in order to slow down climate change.

""We have been striking now for over a year, and still basically nothing has happened,"" Thunberg said. ""The climate crisis is still being ignored by those in power.""

Thunberg might get some help for her campaign from President Joe Biden who signed back onto the Paris Climate Accords after former President Donald Trump removed the U.S. from the pact. Biden has also promised to do more to transform industry in the U.S. to fit with climate change demands.

Here's more about Thunberg's campaign:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/great-britain-announces-a-plan-to-mint-nfts-through-the-royal-mint-in-a-bid-to-lead-the-way-in-the-increasingly-digital-economy,2021-04-09
Greta Thunberg's plan to save carbon emissions backfires over travel on luxury yacht,"Teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg refuses to fly on airplanes, relegating her trans-Atlantic travel to boats. The 16-year-old Swede believes the move cuts down on carbon emissions.

So, when Thunberg needed to travel from the U.S. to Europe last month in order to attend a climate summit in Madrid, Thunberg took a boat, of course.

However, as it turned out, Thunberg's trip did not reduce carbon emissions. Instead, it produced the same amount that Thunberg hoped to save — perhaps even more.

That is because, as the Sunday Times reported, Nikki Henderson, a 26-year-old yacht skipper, flew to the U.S. from Britain to sail Thunberg's ship — the La Vagabonde, a 48-foot catamaran — the 3,500 mile journey from the U.S. to Portugal.

More from the Daily Mail:

The journey was meant to save approximately two or three tons of carbon dioxide emissions.



But Ms Henderson's flight from Britain to the US likely produced the same amount of emissions the journey hoped to save, countering Ms Thunberg's mission, The Times reports.

Adding insult to injury, the vessel Thunberg used for her journey is not climate friendly because it has two diesel engines and is made from products that use petroleum for production.

Craig Rucker — president of Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow, a free-market environmental organization — said Thunberg's travel logistics are ""rife with irony.""

""The irony of protesting capitalism and oil on board a carbon-fiber (petrochemical) yacht owned by European royals who made billions operating Monaco as a tax haven was rich,"" he wrote last month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/greta-thunberg-is-boycotting-the-climate-summit-because-of-inequality,2019-12-02
Guardian reporter says you're a 'fascist' if you disagree with transgender agenda as leftists pile on controversial New York Times op-ed,"A reporter with The Guardian called anyone who disagrees with transgenderism a ""fascist"" in comments complaining about how U.S. and U.K. media covers transgender issues.

Julia Carrie Wong, a technology reporter for Guardian US who is based in San Francisco, on Sunday said it is ""deeply disturbing"" that ""the UK media status quo of transphobia"" is entering U.S. news media in what she called a ""bigotry creep.""

""I think that we’re entering a period when the most meaningful political distinction will be fascist and anti-fascist,"" Wong tweeted. ""It’s really important to understand that transphobia is one of the most potent entry points to fascism today - and act accordingly.""

Wong's comments were made after the New York Times published an opinion article Sunday that stirred controversy on the left.

The article by Pamela Paul, entitled ""The Far Right and Far Left Agree on One Thing: Women Don’t Count,"" argued that the far-left is alienating women by erasing womanhood to be accepting of transgender people. Paul is the editor of the New York Times Book Review.

""Those on the right who are threatened by women’s equality have always fought fiercely to put women back in their place. What has been disheartening is that some on the fringe left have been equally dismissive, resorting to bullying, threats of violence, public shaming and other scare tactics when women try to reassert that right,"" Paul wrote.

""Tolerance for one group need not mean intolerance for another. We can respect transgender women without castigating females who point out that biological women still constitute a category of their own — with their own specific needs and prerogatives,"" she argued.

Her opinion was trashed by Wong, who accused her of harboring bigotry towards gender dysphoric males who identify as female.

""One thing about the policy of legacy publications to ban their employees from being honest about their political opinions in public is that a person can rise to an incredibly powerful position in an industry without anyone being the wiser about their biases and bigotries,"" Wong tweeted.

""[T]ruly wild how full on she is now tho. like every damn week it’s anti-woke on blast,"" she added in apparent reference to Paul.

""She's a Bari Weiss cover band!"" replied standup comic Josh Gondelman, comparing Paul to Bari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer who resigned from the paper after alleging her coworkers harassed her not being sufficiently far-left.

Other progressive reporters bashed Paul's column on Sunday.

""That NYT op-ed equating inclusive language to widespread legislative oppression is a reminder that many white, cis women would rather gatekeep and maintain privilege than work in solidarity with other groups. Patriarchy is crushing us, but y'all wanna play both-sides pattycake,"" Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah said.

She added, ""I'm a cis woman who is clearly able to see that we are under a system-wide assault on bodily autonomy and reproductive rights.

""We will need a politics of solidarity and community building to resist this, which is not something that white women have historically had to do.""

Jennifer Rubin, the Washington Post's ""conservative"" columnist who isn't a political conservative under any definition of the term, replied to Attiah's tweet and called Paul's op-ed ""appalling.""

Edward Ongweso Jr., a staff writer at Motherboard, called Paul's op-ed ""a deeply stupid grafting of UK TERF arguments onto the U.S.,"" agreeing with Wong.



TERF is an acronym for ""transgender exclusionary reactionary feminist,"" a derogatory epithet thrown at any woman who disagrees with the left's transgender dogma.

The slur was used against Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, who is an outspoken critic of transgender political activists' demands to let men into women's restrooms and other spaces if they identify as female. Leftists accused Rowling of bigotry and transphobia because she disagreed with their politics.

But as Wong's comments demonstrate, name-calling to delegitimize political opponents is standard operating procedure for the left. Anyone who disagrees is a ""fascist.""

Guardian torched for asking folks to share their 'lowest point' during lockdown after revealing Gwyneth Paltrow 'broke down and ate bread',"The Guardian drew intense condemnation on Monday for asking people on social media to share their ""lowest point"" during COVID-19 lockdowns after using the example that actress Gwyneth Paltrow ""broke down and ate bread.""

What are the details?

The outlet out of the UK published a headline that read, ""Gwyneth Paltrow broke down and ate bread during quarantine. What was your lowest point?""

After sharing the story on Twitter, the Guardian was absolutely lambasted — and many could not hold back their profanity.

One individual replied, ""I became homeless but sorry about the millionaire eating bread I guess.""

""I would rather read all day long about a junky horse than suffer through some BS story about how the cooch candle queen hit rock bottom during a pandemic and ate a f***ing bagel,"" one person wrote.

Another responded, ""Sending [prayer] and lighting a [flame]. Poor little dear I struggled to keep my business going so my employees didn't lose their jobs I spent months alone during first lockdown. My home was left partly built - I got off lightly compared to some But thank f*** I didn't have to eat bread.""

Someone else replied, ""Bunch of people I loved died. Lost my full time job I loved of 25 years and its associated health benefits too. But, damn, can't say I ever went as low as Gwinny eating bread, so count my blessings, huh?""

Yet another answered that their low point was, ""My parents dying 18 days apart, followed by a friend since the 80s dying after a fiery car crash, shortly followed by the death by ALS of 'the one who got away', followed by 3 months alone with 2 cats. But I didn't hit up the boulangerie, so there's that.""

While the reactions were overwhelmingly critical, one person pleaded, ""Read the article before you blast The Guardian for posting it. That's all I ask.""

What else?

The short article mocks Paltrow by calling her admission ""the latest celebrity attempt to prove they had it just as hard as normal people in the pandemic,"" but then the author's example of her own ""low point"" was yelling ""I'M THE ALPHA"" at her puppy.

The Guardian added an editor's note at the end of the piece saying that the headline had been updated to ""better reflect the understanding of the story.""

The new headline reads: ""Gwyneth Paltrow broke down and ate bread during quarantine. How did you surprise yourself?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/guardian-reporter-says-you-re-a-fascist-if-you-disagree-with-transgender-agenda-as-leftists-pile-on-controversial-new-york-times-op-ed,2021-05-11
UK bank faces online backlash over woke gender pronouns tweet,"Conservative Americans are not the only people fed up with the radical gender ideology that leftists have been peddling around the globe — Halifax, a bank over in the UK, faced a wave of backlash after posting a tweet that declared ""Pronouns matter,"" along with a name tag that included the name ""Gemma"" and the pronouns ""she/her/hers.""

Someone responded to the bank by tweeting, ""Did all your staff agree on this or did a vocal few, force the change onto you with 'concerns'?""



A bank representative named Lara replied by noting that including gender pronouns is a choice: ""Adding pronouns is completely optional. We're offering our colleagues the choice because we understand how important it is to create a safe and accepting environment that normalises the conversation around gender identity. ^Lara.""

When someone replied to the bank's initial tweet about pronouns and said that they were thinking they should shut down their account, a representative replied on the bank's official Twitter account with a message that said, ""Hi, I'm Lee. At Halifax, we strive for inclusion and equality. Giving our colleagues the option to add their pronouns on their badge, helps to create an inclusive environment for our customers and colleagues.""

Someone else responded to the bank by accusing it of ""pathetic virtue signalling,"" and asking, ""Why are you trying to alienate people?""

But representative AndyM responded by tweeting, ""We strive for inclusion, equality and quite simply, in doing what’s right. If you disagree with our values, you’re welcome to close your account. ^AndyM.""





Another individual replied to the bank's declaration that ""Pronouns matter,"" by saying that the issue only matters to a small number of people: ""Only to a tiny minority. You fail to understand that you’re annoying and alienating the vast majority of your customers. Just be a bank without all of the virtue signalling. You’re fuelling mental illness by pandering to this nonsense. Might move my account to a less woke bank,"" the tweet declared.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/guardian-torched-for-asking-folks-to-share-their-lowest-point-during-lockdown-after-revealing-gwyneth-paltrow-broke-down-and-ate-bread,2022-06-30
Health care worker without history of allergies hospitalized in ICU following severe allergic reaction after receiving COVID vaccine,"A health care worker in Alaska developed a severe allergic reaction after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, according to NBC News.

At least one other health care worker at the same facility also experienced a less serious reaction following the injection.

What are the details?

The unnamed health care worker, an employee at the Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau, Alaska, had to be hospitalized overnight for the severe reaction.

The worker, a middle-aged woman, reportedly had no history of allergies and never experienced anaphylaxis, according to the New York Times.

According to the outlet, all 96 workers at Bartlett Regional Hospital received the vaccine on Tuesday. Medical experts observed the workers for 30 minutes following the injection. The woman, however, began feeling flushed about 10 minutes after receiving the shot, and shortly began experiencing other symptoms such as shortness of breath and an elevated heart rate.

Dr. Lindy Jones, an emergency physician who treated the woman, said, ""She had a red, flushed rash all over her face and torso. I was concerned about an anaphylactic reaction.""

The woman was initially treated with antihistamines, but later received an emergency injection of epinephrine.

The outlet reported that the worker's symptoms abated, but returned, forcing physicians to place her on intravenous epinephrine and took her to the ICU for overnight observation.

The woman was taken off all medications as of Wednesday morning and was expected to be discharged. There is no further information available about the woman or her condition at the time of this reporting.

CNN reported on Thursday that a second health care worker also experienced a reaction. The second worker was reportedly treated for less severe symptoms and was ultimately released within an hour.

In a statement, Pfizer said that the biotechnology company is ""working with local health authorities to assess"" the reactions, and will ""closely monitor all reports suggestive of serious allergic reactions following vaccination and update labeling language if needed.""

What else?

Last week, two health care workers in the United Kingdom experienced allergic reactions following the COVID-19 vaccine, prompting the government to issue an allergy alert in connection with the vaccination.

U.K. regulators say that people with history of allergic reactions to medicine or food should avoid the COVID-19 vaccine following the reaction.

Health experts now advise wearing two masks instead of one to stop the spread of COVID,"With the news of potentially more contagious coronavirus variants spreading across the globe, several leading health experts are now recommending wearing two masks instead of one to stem transmission of the disease.

The practice of ""double masking"" — usually achieved by placing a cloth mask over a surgical one — started trending over the last month after more contagious variants of the virus were discovered first in the United Kingdom, then in South Africa and Brazil, and has since been backed health experts.

Over the weekend, double masking received endorsement from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert and chief medical adviser for President Biden.

In an interview with NBC's ""Today,"" Fauci argued the practice just makes ""sense.""

""If you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on, it just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective and that's the reason why you see people either double masking or doing a version of an N-95,"" he said.

Shortly after Fauci's remarks, a top public health expert in New York City also advised residents to wear two masks in order to combat the new faster-spreading coronavirus strains.



Dr. Jay Varma, Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio's senior adviser on public health, said during a morning briefing on Tuesday, ""If you have the opportunity to wear more than one mask, it is more likely that it's going to be helpful than it's going to be harmful.""

""In fact, myself, I now am starting to wear a surgical mask covered by a fabric mask,"" he continued, adding, ""More is probably better, even though we don't know for sure why these new strains are more infectious.""

Still others, including Linsey Marr, an expert in virus transmission and professor at Virginia Tech University, have pitched the practice as a good idea.

""A mask is like an obstacle course for particles to get through,"" Marr said in conversation with AARP. ""Adding a second mask increases the chance that the particle will be trapped before it gets through.""

While wearing two masks has not been recommended in any official guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it nonetheless has picked up steam as a new mitigation effort.

At least three new identified coronavirus variants have raised concerns since their recent discovery due to the belief that they are up to 70% more transmissible than other strains.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/health-care-worker-hospitalized-covid-vaccine,2021-01-27
Helicopter apparently equipped with night vision nabs social distancing violators on Australian rooftop — and it's all on video,"Cops aren't pulling out all the stops to corral coronavirus social distancing violators only in the United States and United Kingdom — they're at it Down Under, too.

What are the details?

Police received several reports about illegal entering at a construction site in the Queensland, Australia, suburb of Palm Beach, Gold Coast Chief Superintendent Mark Wheeler told 4BC News Talk.

""It was a set of units under construction, which raises a few issues,"" Wheeler added to the station. ""It's an unsafe place to be, at the start.""

It appears cops used night vision from a helicopter to locate the trouble. And indeed a trio of men — ages 19, 20, and 21 — were spotted on the site's rooftop Saturday night, 7News reported.

4BC News Talk said they were illegally drinking and socializing.

'The building is surrounded by police'

Video showed the moment the jig was up.

""This is the police, this is the police,"" an officer's voice can be heard from the helicopter as the young men start gazing skyward. ""To the three people sitting on the building rooftop — yes, we can see you, with the hoodie in the middle, with your cold drinks. The building is surrounded by police. We need you to return to the ground floor. Return to the bottom immediately.""

What happened to the culprits?

The trio of men will be fined $1,334 for breaching public health directions against gatherings for nonessential reasons, 7News reported, adding that they also were issued infringement notices for being unlawfully on the premises.

""This is a textbook example of a breach where there has been a total and blatant disregard for not only the law, but also the direction of the chief health officer's directions,"" Wheeler added to 7News.

The 19-year-old and 20-year-old also were charged with drug possession and will appear in court in July, 7News said.

4BC News Talk commentators wondered if police were being a bit heavy handed, but Wheeler shot that right down.

""This is about keeping the community safe; it's about stopping the spread of COVID-19 in Queensland,"" he told the radio station. ""It's also about [protecting] people who've got businesses and premises that are not attended, that we … get around as much as we can to make sure those venues are secure.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/health-experts-recommend-two-masks,2020-04-21
"Wife of US diplomat claims diplomatic immunity, flees UK after allegedly killing British teen in wrong-way crash","The wife of an American diplomate is wanted in the United Kingdom, after the woman allegedly killed a British teen in a wrong-way crash outside a U.S. spy base and then fled the country claiming diplomatic immunity.

What are the details?

The Daily Mail reported that Virginia native Anne Sacoolas, 42, is accused of driving on the wrong side of the road after pulling out of RAF Croughton air force base in Northampshire and fatally striking 19-year-old Harry Dunn, who was riding on his motorcycle in the correct lane.

British authorities say Sacoolas initially appeared to be cooperating with police, but then abruptly returned to the United States after being granted diplomatic immunity.

Harry's grieving parents are demanding Sacoolas return to the U.K. to face justice in the death of their son, and have solicited the assistance of British officials.

The boy's mother told the BBC that Sacoolas leaving was ""such a dishonorable thing to do,"" but explained, ""We are not out to get her put behind bars. If that's what the justice system ends up doing then we can't stop that but we're not out to do that, we're out to try and get some peace for ourselves.""

On Monday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters, ""I hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country,"" saying U.K. officials had already been in contact with the U.S. ambassador in London.

Johnson added, ""If we can't resolve it, then of course I will be raising it myself personally with the White House.""



The BBC explained that ""under the 1961 Vienna Convention, diplomates and their family members are immune from prosecution in their host country, so long as they are not nationals of that country. However, their immunity can be waived by the state that has sent them.""

According to Reuters, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in London released a statement on the situation, saying, ""Any questions regarding a waiver of the immunity with regard to our diplomats and their family members overseas in a case like this receive intense attention at senior levels and are considered carefully given the global impact such decisions carry.""

The spokesperson added, ""Immunity is rarely waived.

"'Human Ken doll' — who spent more than $600,000 on over 70 surgeries to enhance maleness — is now a transgender woman","The images of Rodrigo Alves — the ""human Ken doll"" — have been known the world over for years.

Alves had over 70 surgeries to the tune of over $600,000 to enhance maleness, the Mirror UK reported, including fake six-pack abs, pectoral implants, and facial operations until the patient was unrecognizable.

But now Alves, 36, is coming out as a transgender woman, the outlet said.

“It feels ­amazing to finally tell the world I'm a girl,"" Alves told the Mirror. ""I'm known as Ken, but inside I've always felt like Barbie.""



What's the background?

Alves — a biological male — dressed in Mom's clothing as a child in Brazil and developed breasts due to higher-than-normal estrogen production, the outlet said.

""Growing up, I was very feminine and used to play with dolls and wear my mum's dresses and heels,"" Alves told the outlet. ""I had an instinct toward toys and clothes ­designed for females. I was bullied at school because I was very feminine. Boys would play football and girls ­volleyball. I'd always be with the girls. I was physically abused — I had my face pushed into the urinal and was thrown down the stairs. At the age of 13 two boys at school sexually abused me. I was very feminine and weak. I couldn't defend myself. It was very traumatic.""

By age 17 Alves had a breast reduction and then a nose job two years later, the Mirror said, adding that dozens of male-enhancing surgeries followed after moving to London.

""I have tried my best to behave like a man, but deep inside I was never happy. I would see a ­beautiful woman and feel jealous because I wanted to be like them,"" Alves told the outlet. ""I think like a woman, I act like a woman because I have always been one deep inside.""

In 2017, Alves announced plans to live as a woman. Then a year later, Alves finally decided to transition to female after being asked during a New York photo shoot to dress in ­women's clothes, the Mirror added.

""I began wearing the lingerie at home, and it made me feel beautiful,"" Alves told the outlet. ""It was an awakening. It finally all became clear to me. I came back to the U.K. and made an appointment with my GP, who referred me to a psychologist and psychiatrist. Within a month I was diagnosed with gender dysmorphic disorder and given the option to start the ­appropriate medication to transition.""

More surgeries

Last year, Alves' fake six-pack was removed — and ­used for a buttocks lift, the Mirror said, adding that hormone injections have given way to feminine hips and the need for a D-cup bra.

Next year, Alves — who now goes by Roddy and uses ""she"" and ""her"" pronouns — will ­complete the female transition with gender reassignment surgery, the outlet said.

""I will have a penile inversion and my testicles will be removed. That will be the final step,"" Alves added to the Mirror. ""Before that I'm having silicone breast implants. I'll be able to wear dresses that show my cleavage and look sexy. I'm very excited. After that, I'm having face feminization surgery. It will be an incision at the top of my scalp, and through that the doctor will reshape my forehead, give me an eye lift, lip lift and middle face lift. I'm having my Adam's apple removed, my jawline shaved and my chin modified.""

Alves also told the outlet: ""I finally feel like the real me. Glamorous, beautiful, and feminine. For years I tried to live my life as a man. I had a fake six pack put in, I had fake muscles in my arms, but I was lying to myself. I'm a woman and have always had a feminine brain. Now my body matches my mind.""



Alves has had a lucrative career as a TV personality in the U.K. and in Europe, the Mirror said.

Climate activist calls for the extinction of the human race,"Les Knight, a climate activist in Portland, Oregon, has a novel solution for improving the environment: eradicate the human race.

In an article in the UK's The Guardian newspaper, Knight detailed his five-decade long journey of advocating for an end to mankind.

Fifty years ago, I concluded that the best thing for the planet would be a peaceful phase-out of human existence. We're causing the extinction of hundreds of thousands of other species. With us gone, I believe ecosystems will be restored and there will be enough of everything. No more fighting over resources.



Surprised, Knight conceded his idea ""wasn't as well received"" as he hoped. Still, the climate activist said he led by example and voluntarily had himself sterilized in the 1970s.

""At 25, I wanted to show I was serious. A medical school gave me a discounted vasectomy in exchange for being a student doctor's first try at the procedure, which was successful,"" he wrote.

The Voluntary Human Extinction Project

Then, in 1980, Knight settled in Portland where he founded the Voluntary Human Extinction Project. ""Our message is simple,"" he wrote, ""we encourage people to stop procreating so the biosphere might return to its former glory, and everyone already here will be able to live life more abundantly.""

Knight says his organization has a global presence. ""We have active volunteers across the world, from India to Mexico,"" he wrote while lamenting how his vasectomy has limited his dating life.

""In my own relationships, I've always explained that pregnancy is impossible,"" Knight said. ""Marriage never made sense to me anyway: I would have missed getting to know many wonderful women had I stuck with one.""

Attacks capitalism, says it will be a ""magnificent world"" without humans

The climate activist said that couples limiting themselves to just one child is not good enough. ""Procreation today is the moral equivalent of selling berths on a sinking ship,"" he wrote.

Knight said his motivations have also changed. ""I was a deep ecologist at first, caring more about our impact on the ecosphere than human needs,"" but now the Portland-based activist's concerns extend beyond the environment.

""I've become more concerned about any new humans being brought into existence,"" he declared. ""It's true that society would be greatly diminished without children, but it isn't right to create them just because we like having them around.""

Unsurprisingly, Knight also attacked American capitalism. ""We don't need to breed more wage slaves to prop up an obsolete system,"" he wrote, concluding the world will be a better place without human beings.

""If we go extinct, other species will have a chance to recover. I'll never see the day when there are no humans on the planet, but I can imagine what a magnificent world it would be – provided we go soon enough,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/human-ken-doll-transgender-woman,2020-01-12

Rosemont Seneca was founded in 2009 by Hunter Biden, Christopher Heinz – stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry, and Devon Archer – an American businessman who was classmates with Heinz at Yale University. Rosemont Seneca has conducted extensive business in China.

The report added, ""The logs also reveal that Schwerin met with various close aides of both Joe and Jill Biden at key moments in Hunter’s life when he was striking multi-million dollar deals in foreign countries, including China.""

""Emails from Hunter Biden's discarded laptop show a series of exchanges between Hunter and his associates in Rosemont Seneca’s joint venture with Chinese investment firms Bohai Capital and BHR,"" Fox News reported. ""In February 2017, Schwerin emailed the CEO of BHR, Jonathan Li. Previously, Li sent Hunter his son's resume with a list of colleges he planned to apply to,"" adding, ""It is unclear if Li’s son was admitted to Brown University or, if so, whether he attended.""

The New York Post report claim that Schwerin ""made at least 19 visits to the White House and other official locations between 2009 and 2015.""

According to Obama White House archives, a press release from March 10, 2015, stated that Obama appointed Eric D. Schwerin as a member of the Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad. The U.S. Commission for the Preservation of American Heritage names Schwerin as a past member, who was sworn in on Feb. 1, 2017.

The Obama administration noted that Eric D. Schwerin is ""Founding Partner and Managing Director at Rosemont Seneca Partners, LLC, positions he has held since 2008.""

Records also show that Rosemont Seneca founders Archer and Heinz visited the White House in 2009 and 2011 for a “holiday reception” and “group tour” respectively.

Of the situation involving a top Hunter Biden business partner, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said, ""Not everyone gets to meet the vice president of the United States in the White House. The press should be asking why Hunter Biden’s business associates — like Eric Schwerin — had that privilege and were given access to the Obama White House. This is additional evidence that Joe Biden lied when he said he never discussed Hunter's foreign business dealings. It's well past time for the corporate media to demand the truth from Joe Biden. The corruption of Biden Inc. must be exposed.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/human_extinction_climate_activist,2022-04-24
"Hunter Biden, former Joe Biden adviser invested in Chinese company with Communist Party ties, emails show","A new report claimed that Hunter Biden and a former aide to Joe Biden invested in a Chinese company with ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

In 2009, U.S. investment firm Rosemont Seneca Partners was founded by Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden; Christopher Heinz, stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry; and Devon Archer, an American businessman who was classmates with Heinz at Yale University.

According to emails reviewed by Fox Business, Rosemont Seneca Partners held a 5% investment stake in Harves Amusement Parks and ownership in Harves Sports and Entertainment as recently as March 2017. A purported email exposing the ownership interests of Rosemont Seneca Advisors was allegedly sent to Hunter by Eric Schwerin — Hunter Biden's longtime business partner.

The report alleged that Hunter's original introduction to the Harves Group arrived in 2015 by Francis Person, who served as an adviser to then-Vice President Biden from 2009 to 2014 and was a ""special assistant"" to Biden when he was a senator.

In July 2014, Person stopped working with then-Vice President Joe Biden. In January 2015, Person became the president of the Harves Group. By May 2018, Person became the co-founder of Harves Global Entertainment.

Person reportedly wrote an email to Hunter in July 2015, which invited him to travel to China the following month to meet his business partner — Bo Zhang.

""Bo Zhang and his family would host us. They are a great family with great respect and relationships in China,"" Person allegedly wrote to Hunter in an email. ""Bo graduated from American Univ and is in his late 20’s, and his parents own Harves Century Group of Shenyang - which is a top tier private Chinese real estate development firm.""

According to the purported email, Person highlighted that Zhang was being ""groomed to take over the family's dynasty"" and that ""there will be plenty of big things that come down the road that we can work on.""

""His mom is actually the Chairman of the company, which is unique in China,"" the alleged email said. ""They are very private, and wouldn’t tell anyone about you coming. Bo's father-in-law is actually the Governor of Hainan (Chinese Hawaii), which he doesn’t advertise at all.""



Bo's father-in-law is Liu Cigui — who since 2012 has been a member of the CCP Central Committee — the party’s ""highest organ of authority,"" according to China Vitae . Between 2012 and 2017, Cigui was a member of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which is ""a secretive, powerful agency in charge of investigating the Communist Party’s own members for corruption,"" and was ""the main weapon in Xi Jinping’s rapid consolidation of power as China’s new leader,"" according to the Washington Post.

The Diplomat described Cigui as a ""Xi loyalist"" in a report from January 2021.



The Harves Century Group reportedly received financial backing from the state-owned China Development Bank.

""Harves Century's website says the chairwoman is Jenglan Shao, which is revealed to be Zhang's mother according to Person's 2015 email to Hunter Biden,"" Fox Business reported. ""It is unclear what her background is or whether she is an American citizen, but her name comes up on the Federal Election Commission (FEC) website as a maxed-out donor to Person's failed 2016 campaign against then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C. Zhang also was a maxed-out donor to Person’s campaign. Schwerin and Hunter Biden both donated $2,700.""

In Person's alleged email to Hunter, he notes that Harves is partnering with NBA legends Magic Johnson and LeBron James to ""host an NBA Global Game in China"" in 2016.

In November 2020, Harves announced that it was partnering with NBA China, the National Basketball Association's organization that ""conducts all the league’s businesses in Greater China."" NBA China is ""invested by five strategic partners,"" which includes the Bank of China Group Investment, Legend Holdings Limited, Li Ka Shing Foundation, China Merchants Investments, and ESPN. The partnership between NBA China and Harves included opening ""six NBA-themed entertainment centers across China, with the first opening by 2022,"" according to the joint press release.

Fox Business noted:

It does not appear that Biden was able to make the China trip during the specific week that Person pitched in the email, but multiple emails reviewed by Fox Business show that Person and Zhang met with Biden and Schwerin in Washington on multiple occasions and emailed back-and-forth coordinating potential Harves-related business deals. In one 2016 email, Biden calls Zhang his ""good friend and business colleague."" One of the names cc'd on the email was James Bulger, who appeared to help Biden get a Chinese business license for his uncle's telemedicine company a couple of years earlier.

Fox Business reached out to Person, Zhang, Schwerin, and Hunter Biden's attorney, but none of the parties responded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-business-partner-vice-president,2022-01-23
"'I was gonna be damned if I was going to apologize for something that I believe': Piers Morgan defends free speech, says never bow to the 'woke brigade'","Piers Morgan — until recently a co-host of ""Good Morning Britain"" — told Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Monday that he more or less was forced out of his job after refusing to apologize to Duchess of York Meghan Markle for not believing things she said during an interview with Oprah Winfrey last month.

But Morgan — a fierce free speech advocate — told Carlson his gut told him to stay strong in the face of pressure from Markle, his bosses, and the government of the United Kingdom, which regulates television there.

What are the details?

""I was basically corralled into a position where I was told, 'You either gotta apologize for effectively disbelieving Meghan Markle's version of events here, or your position is untenable, and you have to leave,'"" he told Carlson. ""And my gut was, 'I was gonna be damned if I was going to apologize for something that I believe.' I just wasn't gonna go down that road. I've seen too many people when they're bullied by the woke brigade into apologizing.""

Morgan noted how celebrity Sharon Osbourne ""was bullied into apologizing for defending me against a disgusting slur that I'm a racist ... and then she lost her job anyway."" He also noted the plight of Alexi McCammond, who was forced to give up her Teen Vogue editor position before she even started when offensive tweets of hers surfaced dating back to when she was a teenager.

Morgan noted that even though McCammond said she was sorry, ""that wasn't enough, so apologies don't ever get you anywhere.""

As for his own plight, Morgan told Carlson that he was ""under attack from Miss Markle ... to basically conform to her version of events, and I had to believe her, and if I didn't, I was a callous racist, and I should be condemned, and ultimately — as it turned out later that day — lose my job. And I think that's a pretty perilous slope. A journalist's job ... is to express skepticism.""

Morgan added: ""Frankly I should be allowed in a democracy that values freedom of speech ... to say, 'I'm sorry, I don't believe you,' but I wasn't. ... It was Meghan's way and Meghan's narrative and Meghan's truth. That phrase was actually used by Oprah Winfrey: 'This is your truth.' What does that mean? When did we get to your truth? This is the kind of defense ... we would hear liberals attack [former President] Donald Trump for: for reinventing facts, for creating his own truth. But when Meghan Markle does it, the same liberals that attacked Donald Trump cheer and applaud and say, 'This is her truth, and it must be believed, and if you don't believe it, you're a racist.' Well, I'm sorry; I'm not a racist. I just don't believe her.""

What free speech truly is

Carlson told Morgan he found it curious that Markle and Winfrey behaved like victims when Morgan doesn't hold their kind of power. ""They got you fired,"" Carlson continued, ""but you're oppressing them. The strong pretending to be weak in order to crush people below them.""

Morgan added that the cancel culture he fell victim to will end only when others stand up and say enough's enough — and when we remember what free speech truly is. To illustrate, he told Carlson that Winston Churchill once said, ""Some people think free speech is absolutely fine, right to the point they hear an opinion that they don't like, and then it's an outrage.""

""That's not what free speech is,"" Morgan continued. ""Free speech is about listening to an outrageous opinion you don't agree with and being able to accept that somebody else doesn't feel like you. That's what free speech is.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-chinese-business-china,2021-04-06
"ICE arrests rapper 21 Savage, says he's in country illegally","Grammy-nominated Rapper 21 Savage was arrested by ICE early Sunday and taken into custody for possible deportation from the U.S., according to published reports.

What happened?

Sha Yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph — that's his real name — is accused of being in the U.S. illegally because his visa expired in 2006, TMZ reported. The 26-year-old was also convicted on felony drug charges in 2014.

A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson told WSB-TV that Abraham-Joseph is currently in ICE custody in Georgia. He's also undergoing removal proceedings before federal immigration courts. According to the spokesperson, the rapper is ""unlawfully present United Kingdom national"" who legally entered the U.S. in July 2005 on a visa. But his visa expired a year later.

It was not immediately known what United Kingdom country or territory he's from. The rap star has long claimed to be from Atlanta, Georgia.

ICE is reportedly waiting for the outcome of his case before a judge before any additional actions are set in motion.

In a statement obtained by WSB-TV, Abraham-Joseph's attorney, Dina LaPolt, stated:

We are working diligently to get Mr. Abraham-Joseph out of detention while we work with the authorities to clear up any misunderstandings. Mr. Abraham-Joseph is a role model to the young people in this country, especially in Atlanta, Georgia, and is actively working in the community -leading programs to help underprivileged youths in financial literacy.

Last fall, Abraham-Joseph donated school supplies to more than 2,500 DeKalb County school students.

Anything else?

Abraham-Joseph has said the 21 in his name refers to a street gang in Decatur, Georgia, which is northeast of Atlanta.

Additionally, his songs have often referred to his connection to East Atlanta's Zone 6. Lyrics from his song ""Bank Account, from his 2017 album ""Issa Album,"" state that he is ""straight up out the 6."" The rapper's second album ""I Am > I Was"" came out in December 2018.

"In-N-Out Burger employee carries bullhorn-wielding protester out of restaurant. Then police arrive, take action — and demonstrators​ lose it.","Recently surfaced video shows an In-N-Out Burger employee carrying a bullhorn-wielding protester out of one of the fast-food chain's locations before police arrive and handcuff another demonstrator.

In-N-Out on Monday didn't immediately reply to TheBlaze's emailed request for comment, including if any action was taken against the employee seen carrying the protester out of the restaurant.

What happened?

The clip first showed a male In-N-Out employee holding an older, grey-bearded protester from behind and carrying him out of the restaurant — to the cheers of those inside.

Once out of the restaurant, the protester used his bullhorn to yell ""get your hands off me!"" in the employee's face, and the employee told the protester to leave the property.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

A second part of the clip showed another protester — a female — appearing to be escorted from the restaurant by a different employee. The grey-bearded protester was next to her.



Protesters yelled that they were being assaulted.

Soon police arrived on the scene. Video showed officers' shoulder patches reading ""Long Beach Police.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

There are three Long Beach In-N-Out locations: East Los Coyotes Diagonal, East Pacific Coast Highway, and Lakewood Boulevard. No other ""Long Beach"" In-N-Out restaurants show up on the company's site other than those three in southern California.



Long Beach Police on Tuesday told TheBlaze that officers responded to ""group disturbance at a business"" in the 6300 block of East Pacific Coast Highway just before 5 p.m. Sept. 8. Once on scene officers spoke with a male adult victim who said he was grabbed by a female adult suspect and suffered injuries to his upper torso.

Police said Sarah Gomez, 26, of Long Beach was taken into custody, booked for battery on a person and outstanding warrant, and released Sept. 10 on a court order. Detectives filed one count of trespassing and one count of battery on a person with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, police told TheBlaze.

Video shows that outside the restaurant, officers handcuffed the female protester and took her to a squad car amid much screaming and hollering.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

One protester was heard yelling, ""What the f*** are you doing?"" while another claimed police were exhibiting ""cruel and unusual punishment!"" and ""you have no legal right!""



The video was posted by Ian Miles Cheong, Human Events' managing editor, who noted that people are ""fed up with Extinction Rebellion,"" although authorities haven't confirmed that the radicalclimate changeactivists were behind the In-N-Out incident.

Here's the clip. (Content warning: Language):

Anything else?

In-N-Out — which has strong Christian beliefs at the corporate level and places Bible verses on its wrappers, bags, and cups — donated $25,000 to the California Republican Party last year. But afterward the head of the California Democratic Party called on Democrats to boycott the popular fast-food chain. The plan backfired.

"Award-winning actress and climate change activist hysterically warns of climate emergency, says people should prepare to eat their pets","Actress, climate activist, and Dame Emma Thompson, 60, issued a dire prediction of what life will be like due to climate change.

According to the award-winning actress, climate change will affect the globe so much that people may have to resort to eating their pets because of catastrophic food shortages and weather emergencies.

What are the details?

In a video captured by the Evening Standard, Thompson on Thursday warned that a global climate crisis will force people to consume their beloved family pets for protein.

Thompson, who attended the evening's Extinction Rebellion protest in London, said that due to ""extreme weather,"" worldwide citizens will have to take grave precautions in order to survive.

""Better wrap up warm, stockpile food, and remember there is a surprising amount of protein in the average household pet,"" she read from prepared remarks that were set up as a mock weather forecast.

Standing in front of a map of the United Kingdom, Thompson said, ""For those of you expecting a habitable future, we have some pretty gloomy projections for you.""

And boy did it get dire.

Thompson insisted that because of climate change, there will be an ""increased chance of warmer, wetter winters, and hotter, drier summers, along with an increase of frequency and intensity of extremes.""

""Expect crop failures, water contamination, damaged houses, and ruined lives,"" she continued, ""and we will see these persistent weather fronts continue to wreak havoc across the nation, albeit with one or two days of dry and settled weather.""

​Investigation demanded after Black Lives Matter co-founder exposed for 'real estate-buying binge'​,"The leader of Black Lives Matter Greater New York City is calling for an investigation after a new report revealed that a co-founder of Black Lives Matter has purchased four expensive homes over the past several years.

Hawk Newsome, leader of Black Lives Matter Greater New York City, is demanding an ""independent investigation"" into the finances of Black Lives Matter.

""If you go around calling yourself a socialist, you have to ask how much of her own personal money is going to charitable causes,"" Newsome told the New York Post. ""It's really sad because it makes people doubt the validity of the movement and overlook the fact that it's the people that carry this movement.""

""We need black firms and black accountants to go in there and find out where the money is going,"" he added.

What are the allegations?

According to the New York Post, Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors went on a ""real estate-buying binge, snagging four high-end homes for $3.2 million in the US alone"" since 2016.

Not only does she own the $1.4 million property in Topanga Canyon that was widely reported on, but she has purchased three other properties in recent years, and even reportedly considered buying property in an exclusive resort in the Bahamas where Tiger Woods and Justin Timberlake own property.

The three other properties include, according to the Post:

A three-bedroom home in Inglewood, California, that she purchased in 2016 for $510,000, which is now reportedly worth approximately $800,000

A four-bedroom home in South Los Angeles that she purchased in 2018 for $590,000, which is now reportedly worth $720,000

A three-bedroom property on 3.2 acres in rural Conyers, Georgia, that reportedly has its own private runway that accommodates small airplanes

The average home price in the U.S. stands at around $270,000, according to Zillow, whereas the average home price in California is $635,000.

Anything else?

Black Lives Matter has faced scrutiny over alleged transparency issues with their finances, especially considering the organization has both non-profit and for-profit arms.

From the New York Post:

Founded by Khan-Cullors and another activist, Kailee Scales, the non-profit Oakland, Calif.-based BLM Global Network Foundation was incorporated in 2017 and claims to have chapters throughout the US, UK and Canada, and a mission ""to eradicate White supremacy and build power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities."" The group does not have a federal tax exemption and donations are filtered through ActBlue Charities and Thousand Currents, two non-profits that manage the cash.



At the same time that the Khan-Cullors incorporated the non-profit, she also set up the similarly named BLM Global Network, a for-profit which is not required to disclose how much it spends or pays its executives.

Neither Khan-Cullors nor Black Lives Matter have responded to the intensifying scrutiny around the group's finances.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/international-actress-and-climate-change-activist-hysterically-warns-of-climate-emergency-says-people-should-prepare-to-eat-their-pets,2021-04-11
Iran launches over a dozen ballistic missiles as a 'warning' to Israel,"According to multiple reports, Iran has launched over a dozen ballistic missiles that the country claims are capable of hitting Israel during the course of an ""ongoing major military exercise"" this week.

Although the exact number of missiles launched has not been confirmed, Iran's state news agency claims that a total of 16 surface-to-surface ballistic missiles were launched as part of the exercise. Major General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri claimed that the missiles all simultaneously hit the same target, a claim that has not yet been independently verified. Bagheri also stated that the launches were in response to Israel's ""massive but pointless threats"" to Iran.

According to the Times of Israel, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps chief Major General Hossein Salami also added, ""The military exercise… is a serious warning to Zionist regime officials… Make the slightest mistake, we will cut off their hand.""

The United States Department of State does not appear to have commented on the launch, and requests for comment were not immediately returned.

The UK's Foreign Office, however, said in a statement that ""The launch is a clear breach of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which requires that Iran not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons – including launches using ballistic missile technology. These actions are a threat to regional and international security and we call on Iran to immediately cease its activities.""

Foreign policy experts have cautioned for years that Iran has been continuing to advance their strategic missile program aggressively even after entering into the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action negotiated by the Obama administration. If Iran's claims regarding this launch are true, their missile program may currently be more advanced than even what was previously believed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/investigation-demanded-black-lives-matter-co-founder-real-estate,2021-12-24
"Ireland closes all schools, universities and restricts hospital, prison visits amid COVID-19 panic","Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar announced Thursday that schools and colleges in Ireland would temporarily close their doors due to the ongoing coronavirus — or COVID-19 — outbreak, according to the BBC.

Varadkar announced Thursday morning that the closures begin on Thursday and to last at least until March 29.

He also said that any indoor gatherings of more than 100 people — as well as outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people — should also be canceled. Varadkar added that people should begin to work remotely if they have the option.

""I know that some of this is coming as a real shock, and it is going to involve big changes in the way we live our lives, and I know I'm asking people to make enormous sacrifices, but we're doing it for each other,"" he said.

He continued, ""Our economy will suffer, but it will bounce back. ... Lost time in school or college will be recovered, and in time, our lives will go back to normal.""

""Ireland is a great nation,"" Varadkar continued. ""We're great people. We've experienced hardship and struggle before [and] we've overcome many trials in the past.""

Airports and ports will remain operational, Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said, as well as shops and public transport.

""The actions we are announcing today are absolutely necessary and justified,"" Coveney insisted. ""We are asking people to continue to work. Those who go to their places of work should limit their contacts, particularly face-to-face meetings.""

He added, ""We do need to respond with calm, with unity, with discipline, and resolve. These are the right measures at the right time based on the best public health advice.""

Irish Health Minister Simon Harris also revealed that all museums, galleries, and tourist attractions will close for the time being.

Tony Holohan, who is Ireland's chief medical officer, also announced restrictions on visitors at public facilities such as hospitals and prisons.

""We've recommended that there be restrictions now on visiting hospitals, long-term care settings, mental health facilities, prisons, and spacing measures applied in homeless shelters,"" he said.

ISIS propaganda poster depicts drone delivering package over NYC,"ISIS has circulated a threatening propaganda poster depicting a mocked-up photo of a drone delivering a package and hovering over New York City, the Daily Mail reported.

The drone in the photo is transporting a box with the words ""Private Mailbox"" written on it. And above the Manhattan skyline are the words, ""Sender: The Islamic State.""

Multiple smaller photos featuring previous attacks claimed by the terrorist group are lined across the bottom of the poster.

The poster comes as drone chaos at London's Gatwick Airport has forced one of the United Kingdom's busiest airports to halt flights for the second time since Wednesday.

What happened at Gatwick?



On Wednesday night, authorities shut down all flights at about 9 p.m. after drones were spotted buzzing the airspace over the airport, according to reports.

The next day, the British Army was deployed to knock the drones out of the sky.

The military is believed to have used special equipment called a ""kill-jammer"" to cut-off the drone's communications from up to two miles away. Then the drones were shot down by a laser, the Mail reported.

By 10 p.m. Thursday, drone sightings had stopped.

Flights resumed Friday morning at 6:30, but just hours later, BBC News reported that operations were again halted after another sighting occurred.

Has anyone been caught?

Authorities haven't located those responsible for the drone event, and the motive for the more than 50 flyovers is still unclear.

Investigators are working to determine whether or not the drones may have been flown by a ""lone wolf eco-warrior"" who wanted to ground the airliners for environmental reasons.

British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the possibility of the drone attack being led by a hostile foreign country has not been ruled out.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ireland-closes-all-schools-universities-and-restricts-hospital-prison-visits-amid-covid-19-panic,2018-12-21
"ISIS terrorists arrested for raping, murdering two female Scandinavian ‘enemies of God’ in Morocco","Four suspects have been taken into custody by Moroccan authorities in connection with the murders of two Scandinavian women whose bodies were discovered earlier this week in the country's High Atlas Mountains.

A video purportedly showing the beheading of one of the victims has been authenticated by Danish intelligence, who confirmed Wednesday that the killings can be connected to ISIS.

What are the details?

On Monday, 24-year-old Dane Louisa Jespersen and 28-year-old Norwegian Maren Ueland were found dead by fellow hikers in an isolated area six miles from the tourist village of Imlil. The women's bodies had been mutilated, and investigators say they were both sexually assaulted.

Earlier reports said that detectives believed the attacks were sexually motivated, but authorities now say Islamic extremism is behind the gruesome murders. According to the Daily Mail, the Danish intelligence service has confirmed that a video of the decapitation — which appears to be committed with a kitchen knife while the victim was still alive — is genuine.

Men can be heard in the clip reportedly calling the women ""enemies of God,"" referring to their deaths as ""Allah's will,"" and saying ""this is for Syria.""

The Danish intelligence service issued a statement saying, ""The video and preliminary investigation according to Moroccan authorities indicate that the killings may be related to the terrorist organization Islamic State. This is a case of an unusually bestial killing of two totally innocent young women.""

The lead suspect in the murders was arrested Monday, and another three were apprehended while trying to flee on a bus Thursday. They were discovered trying to smuggle large knives underneath their seats, which are believed to be the murder weapons.

Anything else?

Jespersen and Ueland were students at the University of Southeastern Norway, pursuing degrees in ""outdoor life, culture and eco philosophy."" According to the institution, the women's trip to Morocco was not part of their studies, the Daily Beast reported.

The school issued a statement saying, ""What we know is that they were on a month-long, private holiday in Morocco. Our thoughts go to the families.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/isis-propaganda-poster,2018-12-20
'Barbaric' Islamic terrorist El Shafee Elsheikh sentenced to life for abuse and deaths of four Americans,"El Shafee Elsheikh is the Sudanese-born former British national who joined ISIS and committed atrocities in Iraq and Syria. He was convicted in April of hostage-taking resulting in death and other crimes. At a U.S. District Court hearing in Alexandria, Virginia, on August 19, Elsheikh was sentenced to life in prison.

Elsheikh, the most senior ISIS terrorist to stand trial in the U.S., had a hand in the imprisonment, abuse and deaths of American hostages James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller.

Whereas Foley, Sotloff, and Kassig were executed on camera, the footage of which was widely circulated online, Mueller was enslaved, raped by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and then killed.



On October 27, 2019, al-Baghdadi ""died like a dog ... like a coward"" in a ""dangerous and daring"" nighttime raid ordered by former President Donald Trump, wherein numerous other ISIS militants were reportedly killed.

Another one of Elsheikh's accomplices who had joined him in leaving England to join ISIS, Mohammed Emwazi (nicknamed ""Jihadi John""), was killed in a 2016 drone strike.

Elsheikh, captured in 2018 by Kurdish-led Syrian defense forces, was spared capital punishment along with his friend Alexanda Kotey because in August 2020, former U.S. Attorney General William Barr waived the death penalty to ensure cooperation from British prosecutors.

Raj Parekh, the lead prosecutor and first assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, requested that Elsheikh's punishment should reflect the Islamic terror group's engagement in ""the systematic torture and abuse of their victims, ultimately resulting in the horrific deaths of at least eight American, British and Japanese citizens, among others, including gruesome executions that were videotaped and broadcast globally.""

The Americans who Elsheikh was convicted of taking hostage were among 26 others taken captive by ISIS between 2012 and 2015. At the terrorist's base in Raqqa, Syria, the hostages were tortured in various ways, including waterboarding, mock executions, food deprivation, electric shocks, and prolonged beatings.

The New York Times reported the hostages were forced to fight one another, witness killings of fellow hostages, and were placed in painful stress positions.

Survivor Federico Motka, an Italian aid worker, recalled an instance in 2013 where he and other hostages David Haines, James Foley, and John Cantlie were forced by their ISIS captors to fight one another. Whoever would lose this so called ""Royal Rumble"" would be waterboarded.

Although Elsheikh did not deny fighting for ISIS, his attorneys suggested that he was not actually involved in the kidnappings. They claimed that he had been confused for one of the so called ""Beatles,"" likely because the terrorists wore balaclavas and concealed their faces on camera.



Elsheikh's lawyer, Zachary Deubler, said his client will appeal his conviction. He also requested that Elsheikh not be sent to the supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, where he would be indefinitely placed in solitary confinement.

Israeli actress Gal Gadot issues statement calling for peace and anti-Israel activists melt down,"Gal Gadot, the Israeli actress best known for portraying ""Wonder Woman"" on the big screen, issued a statement calling for peace and pro-Palestinians critics melted down in response.

Gadot posted a short statement to her Twitter account on Wednesday after several days of lethal violence in her home country.

""My heart breaks,"" wrote Gadot. ""My country is at war. I worry for my family, my friends. I worry for my people.

""This is a vicious cycle that has been going on for far too long. Israel deserves to lives as a free and safe nation, our neighbors deserve the same,"" she added.

""I pray for the victims and their families, I pray for this unimaginable hostility to end, I pray for our leaders to find the solution so we could live side by side in peace,"" Gadot continued.

""I pray for better days,"" she concluded.

'Gal gadot is an ugly zionist...'

Some supporters of the Palestinian cause replied with vicious vitriol to Gadot's call for peace.

""Gal gadot is an ugly zionist who can't act and is beyond pathetic. time and time again she shows yall that she sides with the ethnic cleansing of palestinians and yall act brand new everytime. f*** that woman,"" responded one Twitter user.

""I'm glad Gal Gadot said what she said. People should see how Israelis have been laundering the genocide of Palestinians under a disingenuous call for the end of a conflict that has never existed, it's always been an extermination campaign,"" claimed activist Asheya Siddiqi.

""Just another reminder that Gal Gadot is a Zionist and has long supported the ethnic cleansing and violence towards Palestinians,"" said another critic.

""Gal Gadot is wrong. Israel is not at 'war' with Palestine. Israel is butchering Palestine. Again,"" responded UK musician James Kennedy.

""I wish gal gadot a very shut the f*** up,"" read another tweet.

"The new James Bond trailer had the internet abuzz, but left some asking: Is '007' now a woman?","""The name is Bond."" Jane Bond?

The entertainment world was buzzing Wednesday with the release of the trailer for ""No Time To Die,"" the highly anticipated 25th installment in the 007 series. Starring British actor Daniel Craig (in what is said to be his last appearance as British spy James Bond), the 2 1/2-minute preview is replete with the action, sleek cars, and exotic locations that fans love about the films.

However, viewers did notice a difference in the upcoming movie: A new double-O, and not just any new MI6 agent. The next James Bond film will introduce audiences to actress Lashana Lynch as a member of the elite British intelligence unit, making her the first woman to play the role. Lynch's presence is prompting many to speculate if she will eventually become the next 007.

NO TIME TO DIE Trailer youtu.be

As Wired noted:



Now that Craig has sworn he'll never come back for another installment, a new actor eventually will join that list, and the torch will get passed.



Judging by this first trailer, that new Bond could be Lashana Lynch (Captain Marvel's Maria Rambeau). Ever since she was cast, there have been rumors that she might take up the mantle. This trailer doesn't prove that she's the new 007, just a double-0, but it also hints that she's the future of the franchise.

Indeed, it is unclear what exactly is Lynch's role, but the new trailer offers some clues.

A female Double-O?

The preview suggests that the first 007 film of the #MeToo era picks up where 2015's ""Spectre"" left off. Bond has taken an extended leave of absence in Jamaica, but ghosts from his love interest Dr. Madeleine Swann's past and a new villain now haunt him and British intelligence.

Among those who come to pull Bond out of his early retirement are CIA agent Felix Leiter (a staple of the series) and Lynch's character, known only as Nomi.

""Are you a double-O?"" Bond asks her. ""Two years,"" she replies.

That said, much is left to the imagination. We do not know whether Nomi received the 007 designation while Bond was on leave in the Caribbean, if she was assigned another code number, or if she will become the next James Bond when Craig retires from the role. A cryptic tweet by Lynch — that simply says ""Nomi. @007"" — could be interpreted to imply that her character is the new 007.

James Bond will continue being played by a man

There are a few reasons why fans of the James Bond franchise who are concerned Hollywood may be trying to turn the renowned spy into a woman have little to worry about for now.

First, it is worth noting that there are real-life female MI6 agents who are reportedly excellent at their jobs. The film series already acknowledged this, as fans surely remember that Bond's boss, known as ""M,"" was played by actress Judi Dench for 17 years. Therefore, the mere presence of a female double-O in ""No Time To Die"" would be more akin to art imitating life and a continuation of a trend within the franchise than studio executives imposing excessively ""woke"" cultural values.

Next, even if Nomi were named as 007, she would not necessarily replace the James Bond character. In the films, the double-O numbers are codes assigned to a special class of British intelligence officers. For instance, in 1995's ""GoldenEye,"" a character named Alec Trevelyan was also known as Agent 006. In other words, if Bond took a leave of absence in the film, spy chief ""M"" may have given his code number to another agent, but that does not mean that the character has been replaced in this film or future ones.

In fact, the film's producer, Barbara Broccoli, has made it clear that James Bond will continue to be played by men.

""Bond is male,"" she said last year while dismissing speculation that the legendary British spy's gender would be changed. ""He's a male character. He was written as a male and I think he'll probably stay as a male.""



""And that's fine. We don't have to turn male characters into women. Let's just create more female characters and make the story fit those female characters,"" Broccoli added.

The U.S. release date for ""No Time To Die"" has been set for April 8.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/israeli-actress-gal-gadot-issues-statement-calling-for-peace-and-anti-israel-activists-melt-down,2019-12-05
"Japan to resume commercial whaling for cultural reasons; environmentalists, other nations freak out","Citing its cultural heritage, Japan's government announced Wednesday that the country would resume commercial whaling in July following an official decades-long reprieve from the practice.

The country also intends to scrap its membership with the International Whaling Commission after 67 years, shocking other nations and drawing ire from environmentalists.

What are the details?

Critics say Japan has never really stopped commercial whaling, in spite of its agreement to the IWC's moratorium on whale hunting dating back to 1986. According to the New York Times, the international agreement allowed Japan to kill a certain quota of whales in Antarctic for ""scientific research"" purposes; but that loophole is considered to be a ruse — whale meat restaurants operate in the country in spite of reportedly declining demand, and byproducts are sold in its stores.

According to the Animal Welfare Institute, whaling has been a part of Japanese culture for centuries — possibly dating as far back as the Jomon period (14,500-300 BC).

The island nation's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said in a statement Wednesday: ""In its long history, Japan has used whales not only as a source of protein but also for a variety of other purposes. Engagement in whaling has been supporting local communities, and thereby developed the life and culture of using whales.""

Suga explained that Japan was dropping its IWC membership because the organization failed to develop guidelines for a sustainable whaling industry — part of its stated mission — instead focusing primarily on conservation efforts. Despite leaving the IWC, Japan will still send representatives to IWC meetings.

An official from the foreign ministry's fisheries division told Reuters, ""It's not like we are turning our back on the IWC and abandoning international cooperation. There is no change to our country's respect for the rule of law and multiculturalism.""

Japan's commercial whaling will be within its own territorial waters, according to Suga. The hunting begins in July 2019.

So, who's complaining?

Sam Annesley, executive director at Greenpeace Japan, said in a statement:

It's clear that the government is trying to sneak in this announcement at the end of the year, away from the spotlight of international media, but the world sees this for what it is. The declaration today is out of step with the international community, let alone the protection needed to safeguard the future of our oceans and these majestic creatures. The government of Japan must urgently act to conserve marine ecosystems rather than resume commercial whaling.



As a result of modern fleet technology, overfishing in both Japanese coastal waters and high seas areas has led to the depletion of many whale species. Most whale populations have not yet been recovered, including larger whales such as blue whales, fin whales and sei whales.



The world's oceans face multiple threats such as acidification and plastic pollution, in addition to overfishing. As a country surrounded by oceans where people's lives have been heavily reliant on marine resources, it is essential for Japan to work towards healthy oceans. Japan's government has far failed to resolve these problems.

U.K. Health Secretary Michael Grove tweeted about his disappointment in Japan's decision:

Extremely disappointed to hear that Japan has decided to withdraw from the International Whaling Commission to resume commercial whaling. The UK is strongly opposed to commercial whaling and will continue to fight for the protection and welfare of these majestic mammals.

— Michael Gove (@michaelgove) December 26, 2018

The head of campaigns of the Humane Society in Australia, Nicola Beynon, accused Japan of ""operating completely outside the bounds of international law,"" and said, ""This is the path of a pirate whaling nation, with a troubling disregard for international rule,"" the BBC reported.

Anything else?

Japan isn't the only country who has pushed back against the IWC. According to the BBC, a group of pro-whaling nations (Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland and Norway) formed an alternative organization, Nammco. Under U.N. regulations, Japan must be a part of some international organization for the conservation and study of whales; but they can choose which organization that is, meaning they can either join another group or form their own.

Activists fear that other countries whose citizens have a palate for whale meat might follow Japan's lead.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/james-bond-trailer-woman-007,2018-12-27
Jeremy Corbyn suspended from UK Labour Party after report says party committed 'unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination' under his watch,"Controversial former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been suspended by the Labour Party and has had the whip removed after he refused to accept the conclusions of a damning report that was released Thursday, accusing him of gross failures to confront anti-Semitism within his party.

The 130-page report was compiled by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, a statutory non-departmental government agency that operates independently to ""safeguarding and enforcing the laws that protect people's rights to fairness, dignity and respect.""

The report detailed a litany of alleged failings by Corbyn and the party, and specifically stated that on at least two occasions, party officers committed acts of ""unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination"" against Jewish people and their allies. The report also stated that on numerous occasions, ordinary party members who did not have official roles committed such acts.

The report further claimed that, when complaints were made about this harassment, the party demonstrated ""significant failings"" and a ""lack of leadership"" in how it responded to the complaints when they were filed. Specifically, the report faulted the party for allowing some investigations to be influenced by political pressure, and additionally found that, ""Some complaints were unjustifiably not investigated at all.""

The report went on to claim that there existed ""a culture within the party which, at best, did not do enough to prevent antisemitism and, at worst, could be seen to accept it.""

Current Labour leader Keir Starmer accepted the conclusions of the report, calling this a ""day of shame"" for Labour and saying, ""If you're anti-Semitic, you should be nowhere near this party. And we'll make sure you're not.""

Corbyn, meanwhile, reacted to the report with defiance, claiming that ""the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party.""

His defiance appears to have cost him his position within the party. According to statement released by a Labour spokesperson, ""In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation. He has also had the whip removed from the Parliamentary Labour Party.""

Corbyn stepped down as Labour leader in December after Labour suffered a crushing electoral loss that saw them lose 60 seats and caused Starmer to admit that Labour had utterly failed to address the concerns of ordinary Brits. However, he promised that under his leadership, Labour would become a ""competent, credible opposition.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/japan-to-resume-commercial-whaling,2020-10-29
Jim Acosta: Trump's 'enemy of the people' rhetoric creates climate in which 'journalists can get murdered',"CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta said President Donald Trump's ""enemy of the people"" rhetoric directed toward certain media outlets and reporters creates a climate in which ""journalists can get murdered,"" The Guardian reported.

Speaking at an event Thursday at the Oxford Union in the United Kingdom, Acosta — who's made a name for himself through his often excessive questioning of Trump, who bestowed the infamous ""fake news"" upon Acosta and CNN — said things are getting scary for reporters.

'This is a dangerous time to tell the truth in America'



""Perhaps they won't stop calling us the enemy of the people because it works so well with their people, but all of this adds up to one painful reality: This is a dangerous time to tell the truth in America,"" Acosta said, The Guardian reported, adding that those who run with that rhetoric create ""an atmosphere where people can get hurt, where journalists can get murdered.""

Acosta's White House media credentials were revoked last year after an altercation in which he interrupted and argued with Trump during a media briefing, but they were reinstated after CNN filed a lawsuit. The White House also claimed Acosta assaulted an intern who was trying to take a microphone away from him.

""The vast majority of people could plainly see the only thing that was under assault that day was the truth,"" Acosta said, The Guardian noted.

He calls Fox News a 'beast of many heads'

Acosta also called Fox News a ""beast of many heads,"" the outlet said. He noted that while journalists on the conservative-leaning cable news network defended him when his media credentials were revoked, there are ""forces on that network that act as propagandist for Trump,"" The Guardian reported.

Fox News anchor Dana Perino at the time said Acosta's colleagues were frustrated with his spotlight-grabbing antics because they frustrated journalists' efforts to do their jobs.

Acosta appears to compare Trump to a playground bully

When asked if his questioning style with Trump is too aggressive, Acosta replied that it's expected that reporters will use that tactic, the outlet said.

""Are we supposed to roll over? Are we supposed to take it?"" Acosta replied, according to the Guardian. ""Some colleagues say to just take it, but I'm still thinking about the folks at home, thinking about my own kids, are we supposed to let the bully beat us up at the playground every day?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jeremy-corbyn-suspended-uk-labour-party,2019-02-01
JK Rowling blasts kid-focused transsexual 'charity' for mutilating kids and having a pedophile apologist on its board,"Mermaids touts itself as one the United Kingdom's ""leading LGBTQ+ charities,"" committed to ""supporting transgender, nonbinary and gender-diverse children."" Over the last three weeks, the taxpayer-subsidized group has faced intense scrutiny. In late September, it was condemned for giving out so-called ""breast binders"" to children against their parents' wishes. This week, a trustee of the group quit after it was revealed he had both advocated for destigmatizing pedophilia and spoke at a conference hosted by a group that serves pedophiles.

The perversions linked to the so-called charity drew the ire of British author J.K. Rowling, author of the ""Harry Potter"" series and notable critic of transsexual extremism, misogyny, and those who reject the reality of biological sex.

Responding to a tweet that said Mermaids was on its way to ""be the new Savile"" — a reference to the notorious pedophile and rapist Jimmy Savile — Rowling noted how the group's influence would not have been possible ""without the money and public support of certain corporations and celebrities, who eagerly boosted them even though the red flags have been there for years.""

Extra to a host of big corporate sponsors like Starbucks, Mermaids has benefitted from donations from high-profile celebrities like Emma Watson, an actress who came to prominence in the ""Harry Potter"" movies.

Rowling suggested that ""Mermaids' fingers were all over the Tavistock Gender Identity Clinic debacle.""

The Tavistock clinic, opened in 1989, is shutting down this year. It was accused of hurriedly foisting puberty-blocking drugs onto children, which reportedly cause sterility and deformities. One former patient, Keira Bell, took Tavistock to court, claiming that the clinic didn't challenge her ahead of prescribing her sterilizing medications when she was a minor.

Rowling raised the matter of Mermaids sending so-called ""chest binders"" to children without their parents' consent.

Chest binders are pieces of compression clothing that flatten a woman's chest to make her more ""male-presenting."" They reportedly can cause breathing difficulties, chronic back pain, headaches, skin infections, broken ribs, and malformations of the spine. 97% of those who use them suffer health problems as a result.

The Telegraph reported late last month that Mermaids was sending ""potentially dangerous chest-flattening devices to 13-year-olds against their parents' wishes."" In one instance, Mermaids agreed to send an adult whom they believed was a 14-year-old girl a breast binder, despite her informing them that her mother would ""not allow"" it.

According to the Telegraph, Mermaids has been running a free ""binder scheme"" since 2019.

In addition to pushing these devices on children, the group allegedly told individuals whom they believed to be minors that sterilizing puberty-blocking drugs were safe and ""totally reversible."" A study published last month in the Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy indicated that such claims are far from being true.

Parents have suggested that Mermaids also convinced children they were transsexual and that hormones and mutilation might ""cure"" their issues.

Stephanie Davies-Arai, founder and director of Transgender Trend, a group that combats the mutilation of children, told the Telegraph that Mermaids ""are giving out inaccurate and partial information and they are encouraging people to trust in what is a medical experiment.""

When the Telegraph published its report revealing how Mermaids circumnavigated parents and contravened their wishes in efforts to mutilate their children, Rowling welcomed greater scrutiny of the organization.

On September 29, it was announced that the U.K.'s Charity Commission would be investigating Mermaids. A spokesman from the commission stated, ""Concerns have been raised with us about Mermaids' approach to safeguarding young people. We have opened a regulatory compliance case and have written to the trustees. We now wait their reply.""

One of Mermaids' trustees from whom the commission wanted to hear, Dr. Jacob Breslow, resigned days later, on October 3, after it was revealed he had previously given a presentation at an event hosted by B4U-ACT, a group that promotes services and resources for pedophiles.

In his presentation and in its corresponding paper, Breslow employed the phrase ""minor attracted persons"" instead of ""pedophile"" to when referring to degenerates who are sexually attracted to children.

According to Breslow, ""Allowing for a form of non-diagnosable minor attraction is exciting. ... This understanding may displace the stigma, fear and objection that is naturalised as being attached to minor-attracted persons and may alter the terms by which non-normative sexualities are known.""

Breslow, who had been a trustee of the children-focused group Mermaids up until this week, also stated, ""Many tend to begin with the linkage of paedophilic desire to harmful and abusive relationships and acts ... rather than questioning, normative gendered and sexual intelligibility.""

Rowling wrote that an individual who had been arguing for the destigmatization of pedophilia, never recanted those beliefs, and ""then wheedled"" his way onto the board of a charity for vulnerable kids should be fired.

She went onto tweet that either Mermaids did not do due diligence or ""they were fine with [Breslow's] views.""

India Willoughby, Britain's first man to read the news while claiming to be a woman on Channel 5, suggested that someone ""needs to take legal action against JK Rowling.""

Rowling embraced Willoughby's initiative, writing, ""India, I swear to God, if you want to start a petition for Mermaids to take me on in court, the first signature will be mine.""

Rowling highlighted that some of her leftist critics were apparently less concerned that a trustee for a so-called trans charity for children ""wrote sympathetically about orgasming 'on or with' a child ... but that the TERFs might 'twist' his appointment.""



In light of this recent controversy, Mermaids has shut down its hotline, citing ""intolerable abuse.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jim-acosta-trump-rhetoric-journalists-murdered,2022-10-06
JK Rowling launches service for sexual assault survivors with her own money,"Author J.K. Rowling, who penned the ""Harry Potter"" series, is launching a service aimed at being a resource for sexual assault victims over 16 years old.

The service, called Beira's Place, will provide ""support, advocacy and information"" for women in Scotland.

""We are pleased to announce the launch of Beira's Place, a new service providing support, advocacy and information for women survivors of sexual violence aged 16 and over in Edinburgh and the Lothians,"" the tweet from the new program reads.

""For those who need it,"" Rowling added.

The news prompted an ""I Stand with JK Rowling"" trending hashtag on Twitter.

The service will employ a board of directors made up of a former prison governor; a former member of the Scottish Labour Party (democratic socialists), Johann Lamont; a general practitioner; and the director of For Women Scotland, Susan Smith, according to Elle Magazine via MSN.

For Women Scotland is noted as a campaign that opposes the right for individuals in Scotland to legally change their gender by a simple declaration. The debate is centered around the Gender Recognition Reform Bill, which is set to be debated before the end of 2022.

""I founded Beira’s Place to provide what I believe is currently an unmet need for women in the Lothians area. As a survivor of sexual assault myself, I know how important it is that survivors have the option of women-centered and women-delivered care at such a vulnerable time,"" Rowling said in a statement.

""Beira’s Place will offer an increase in capacity for services in the area and will, I hope, enable more women to process and recover from their trauma,"" she continued.

Rowling told the Telegraph that she didn't feel that she has been ""cancelled,"" before remarking on her monetary status in regards to her plans to self-funding the service.

“I will always be able to feed my kids, even if everyone boycotts my books for the rest of my life. That is a phenomenally privileged position to be in,"" said the author.

“The only time I've ever made reference to being cancelled, my book sales went up,"" she added.

Rowling has faced criticism both online and in the media for being ""transphobic,"" as she sparked controversy by opposing the phrase ""people who menstruate,"" preferring to simply refer to those people as women.

Rowling has been both praised and condemned by actors in the book-inspired ""Harry Potter"" films; Tom Felton has praised her as ""lovely,"" while star Daniel Radcliffe has stated that he felt bad for transgender youth who were hurt by her remarks.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jk-rowling-blasts-kid-focused-transsexual-charity,2022-12-12
"JK Rowling talks trans debate, gender reassignment surgery","British author J.K. Rowling has called for an end to the ""climate of fear"" regarding the debate about transgender individuals in a new interview that is certain to spur an uproar.

""Many are afraid to speak up because they fear for their jobs and even for their personal safety,"" Rowling said in an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine. ""This climate of fear serves nobody well, least of all trans people.""

Since Rowling has been speaking her mind on the trans debate, she has received harsh condemnation as well as death and rape threats. But the 55-year-old writer alleges that ""more than 90 percent of the letters and emails have been supportive.""

""My correspondence have included medical staff, social workers, prison workers, workers in women's refuges, and members of the LGBT community, including trans people,"" Rowling claimed.

""I believe everybody should be free to live a life that is authentic to them, and that they should be safe to do so,"" the ""Harry Potter"" author said. ""I also believe that we need a more nuanced conversation around women's rights and around the huge increase in numbers of girls and young women who are seeking to transition.""



Rowling claimed to have received ""heartbreaking letters"" from young women, who ""regret the irreversible surgeries they've undertaken."" She said these stories from women regretting their irreversible gender reassignment surgery ""need to be told.""

This follows the Keira Bell case in Britain, where the 23-year-old sued the British National Health Service's gender-identity youth clinic for prescribing her puberty blockers at the age of 16. Bell blamed the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, which runs the U.K'.s only gender identity development service for children, for not doing enough to ""challenge"" her decision to transition to a male.

Earlier this month, the judges' ruling stated, ""It is highly unlikely that a child aged 13 or under would be competent to give consent to the administration of puberty blockers.""

""It is doubtful that a child aged 14 or 15 could understand and weigh the long-term risks and consequences of the administration of puberty blockers,"" the judges said.

""In respect of young persons aged 16 and over, the legal position is that there is a presumption that they have the ability to consent to medical treatment,"" the ruling read.



Bell had a double mastectomy at age 20 with hopes to ""achieve happiness."" When the surgery didn't bring joy, Bell began to de-transition last year, describing the situation by saying, ""It was heartbreaking to realize I'd gone down the wrong path.""

Rowling has had a history of weighing in on trans issues. In September, transgender activists called Rowling a ""transphobe"" for writing about a character in one of her books that was a cross-dressing serial killer.

Over the summer, Rowling was heavily criticized for saying that hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgeries are too often over-prescribed.

'Dictionary and a backbone': JK Rowling unleashes on British politician for refusing to define what is a woman,"Author J.K. Rowling punched back at a British politician on Tuesday who — on International Women's Day — refused to define what is a woman.

What is the background?

Transgender advocates believe Rowling is an enemy of their movement because the ""Harry Potter"" author affirms the biological structure of sex and gender and believes that transgender ideology delegitimizes women.

In fact, Rowling believes that if biological gender is not real — and only a social construct like some LGBT activists claim — then ""the lived reality of women globally is erased."" Rowling has repeated her beliefs several times in recent years, and, just last November, she vowed never to stop defending biological women's sex-based rights.

What did Rowling say now?

On Tuesday, Rowling criticized Anneliese Dodds, chair of the UK Labour Party and shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, for refusing to define what constitutes a ""woman"" in a BBC interview.

When asked to define what is a ""woman,"" Dodds said there are ""different definitions"" and claimed ""it does depend what the context is surely.""

""Someone please send the Shadow Minister for Equalities a dictionary and a backbone,"" Rowling responded, adding the hashtag ""#HappyInternationalWomensDay.""

Rowling then mocked Dodds in direct response to a video the British lawmaker posted for International Women's Day. ""This morning you told the British public you literally can't define what a woman is. What's the plan, lift up random objects until you find one that rattles?"" Rowling said.

Rowling also said, ""Apparently, under a Labour government, today will become We Who Must Not Be Named Day.""

Then, in response to someone who challenged Rowling about her legacy, Rowling said she plans to forever defend women's rights.

""Yes, sweetheart. I'm staying right here on this hill, defending the right of women and girls to talk about themselves, their bodies and their lives in any way they damn well please,"" Rowling said. ""You worry about your legacy, I'll worry about mine.""

Rowling has been critically outspoken in recent days about Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform Bill, which would further codify progressive transgender ideology in Scottish society. Specifically, Rowling believes the legislation ""will harm the most vulnerable women in society.""

""Multiple women’s groups have presented well-sourced evidence to [First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon's] government about the likely negative consequences of this legislation for women and girls, especially the most vulnerable. All has been ignored,"" Rowling said on Monday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jk-rowling-trans-debate-gender-surgery,2022-03-09
"Joe Rogan blasts Anthony Fauci for public mistrust in science, says people are expected to believe him when he's '100 percent wrong'","Joe Rogan slammed Dr. Anthony Fauci on a recent episode of his hugely popular podcast, blaming the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for the public's mistrust in science and vaccine skepticism.

Rogan discussed the current conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic with Lex Fridman, an ""AI researcher working on autonomous vehicles, human-robot interaction, and machine learning at MIT.""

""There's not enough authentic, strong leadership,"" Fridman stated. ""We have somebody like Fauci, who basically nobody really trusts any more, as being the chief communicator of how we proceed forward. That's a huge problem.""



Rogan noted, ""You don't just have the fact that the people don't trust him, but you have the mainstream media ignoring all the things he's done to lead the people not to trust him.""

Rogan stressed Fauci's shifting guidance on face masks, in which he initially said, ""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask"" in the spring of 2020. In January 2020, Fauci said, ""The driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person."" However, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in January 2021 suggests that asymptomatic infections account for more than half of all COVID-19 cases. Fauci also walked back the possibility of a lab-leak theory.

Rogan and Fridman claimed that Fauci wasn't transparent about gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute, which helped intensify the lab-leak theory. Rogan highlighted that Fauci's agency provided grants for bat coronavirus research to EcoHealth Alliance.

Fridman told the audience not to let ""shady, greedy a**holes at the very top that are communicating science as part of our government be somehow connected to the essence of science.""

""There's also a problem with people like him where they make these statements that you're led to believe they have an understanding of the situation ... but then it turns out they're 100% wrong. But then they come up with a new statement and you're supposed to believe that,"" Rogan said. ""When they don't know, they never say 'We don't know.' They don't say, 'This is very confusing and we're trying to figure it out as we go along.'""

Rogan mocked the chutzpah of Fauci, who serves as President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, by citing a quote that the notable immunologist said in June.

""A lot of what you're seeing as attacks on me, quite frankly, are attacks on science, because all of the things that I have spoken about, consistently from the very beginning, have been fundamentally based on science,"" Fauci told NBC News host Chuck Todd.

Fridman believes that top health administrators let ""power get to them,"" and ""ego is the thing that destroys all awesome things.""

Fridman said that he believes in the efficacy of the coronavirus vaccines, which decreases the risk of death from COVID-19.

""I think it's a wise choice to take the vaccine if you're at all concerned about ending up in the hospital,"" Fridman said.

During ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast, the comedian acknowledged that his parents got vaccinated.

Rogan explained that he hoped that there would be a ""push for health, there'd be a push for people to change their diet, start a rigorous exercise routine.""

A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that 78% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 were overweight.

Rogan pointed out that ""people don't trust pharmaceutical companies and haven't for a long time."" Rogan and Fridman noted that the pharmaceutical companies are making enormous profits from the COVID-19 vaccines, which could mean that the ""incentives are not well aligned.""

Fridman argued that the United States should fully reopen and allow unvaccinated Americans to accept the risks of their decisions. Fridman also said that he is against any kind of vaccine passport.

""I don't trust the government enough to allow any kind of control of your ability to travel and your whereabouts,"" Rogan said of vaccine passports.

Earlier this month, Rogan railed against vaccine passports, warning they take America ""one step closer"" to a dictatorship. Rogan's comments drew the ire of the outrage mob, who attempted to cancel the massively successful podcast host.

Jon Stewart defends,"Liberal political satirist Jon Stewart defended Joe Rogan against the tidal wave of criticism. Stewart proclaimed that it is a ""mistake"" for music artists to make a concerted effort to censor and push Spotify to cut ties with the prolific podcaster.

During a recent episode of ""The Problem with Jon Stewart"" podcast, the former host of the ""Daily Show"" opined that it is an ""overreaction"" by anyone attempting to cancel Rogan because he acts in good faith.

""Don't leave, don't abandon, don't censor, engage,"" Stewart advised critics of Rogan, which includes musicians Neil Young, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, Joni Mitchell, India Arie, and Nils Lofgren.

""I'm not saying it’s always going to work out fruitfully, but I am always of the mindset that engagement, and especially with someone like a Joe Rogan who is not, in my mind, an ideologue in any way,"" Stewart said during his podcast. ""To me, that says that’s a person that you can engage with.""

Stewart highlighted a recent situation where Rogan was open to new information during a podcast.

During ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" episode released on Jan. 12, Rogan and Australian TV presenter Josh Szeps were discussing myocarditis – which is inflammation of the heart muscle, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Rogan noted that for teens, myocarditis is an adverse side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC stated: ""Cases of myocarditis reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) have occurred.""

Szeps acknowledged that myocarditis is a side effect of COVID-19 vaccines, but argued that myocarditis is actually more common for those who have been infected with coronavirus than those from being vaccinated.

Rogan was skeptical of the claim and asked his producer Jamie Vernon to verify the assertion.

There were studies that found that myocarditis is not more common in those who were fully vaccinated than those with a COVID-19 infection.

The day after the podcast was released on Spotify, Rogan addressed the situation.

""If anyone was going to make me look dumb on the podcast I’m glad it’s @joshzepps, because I love him, and he’s awesome,"" Rogan wrote on Twitter.

""However this is why I was confused,"" Rogan added, and provided a link to a Guardian article titled: ""Boys more at risk from Pfizer jab side-effect than Covid, suggests study.""



The article reads, ""Healthy boys may be more likely to be admitted to hospital with a rare side-effect of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine that causes inflammation of the heart than with Covid itself, US researchers claim.""

The study, which is not peer-reviewed, found that the stratified cardiac adverse event (CAE) rate was ""highest in young boys aged 12-15 following dose two.""

""For boys 12-17 without medical comorbidities, the likelihood of post vaccination dose two CAE is 162.2 and 94.0/million respectively,"" the authors wrote. ""This incidence exceeds their expected 120-day COVID-19 hospitalization rate at both moderate (August 21, 2021 rates) and high COVID-19 hospitalization incidence.""

Rogan also included a link to a Substack article titled ""UK Now Reports Myocarditis stratified by Age & Sex After Vaccine Or Sars-cov-2"" from Dr. Vinay Prasad – who is a hematologist-oncologist, associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California San Francisco, and author of more than 3,000 academic articles.

Stewart commended Rogan for being open to new information.

Stewart said, ""And Joe just went, 'I don’t know, okay, I didn’t get that.' And that to me says, 'Oh, that’s a person that you can engage with.'""



""My point is, we all exist in this world and on this planet, and there’s no question that there is egregious misinformation that’s purposeful and hateful and all those other things,"" Stewart continued. ""And that being moderated is a credit to the platforms that run them. But this overreaction to Rogan, I think is a mistake. I really do.""



Stewart asked if every music artist is going to quit platforms that feature voices that they don't agree with, such as Eric Clapton and Fox News.



Stewart said identifying ""dishonest, bad actors in the world"" is ""so much more important"" to him.

Trevor Noah – the current host of the ""Daily Show"" – also defended Rogan this week.

""I actually thought it was pretty classy,"" Noah said of Rogan addressing the controversy in a video this week. ""He owned up to it. I thought it was pretty dope. It was refreshing.""

Former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard advised Rogan, ""Just keep being you.""

Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson also supported Rogan this week by saying, ""Great stuff here brother. Perfectly articulated. Look forward to coming on one day and breaking out the tequila with you.""

Comedic actor Kevin James added, ""Joe – we go way back and all these years I’ve known you to be nothing but objective and seeking truth. Thank you. Love you brother.""

Legendary surfer Kelly Slater told Rogan, ""Love to see you offer to bring Neil Young and/or Joni Mitchell on with whomever they want by their side to refute whatever it is they’re so pissed about. If they’re for truth it should be an easy convo. I’ll be looking forward to their replies.""

Guests support Joe Rogan against being canceled on Spotify,"Joe Rogan is currently embroiled in two controversies surrounding his massively popular podcast. While critics of Rogan have engaged in a campaign to try to force Spotify to cancel ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" former guests of the show rallied around the beleaguered podcaster to fight back.

Spotify deleted roughly 70 episodes of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" last week without providing an explanation for the purge.

A few days earlier, a compilation video went viral of Rogan saying the N-word in past podcasts. Rogan used the racial slur 24 times from episodes recorded years ago, well before his deal with Spotify.

On Saturday, Rogan issued an apology for using the racial slur, calling it ""the most regretful and shameful thing I’ve ever had to talk about publicly."" Rogan said the clips were taken ""out of context"" from ""12 years of conversations.""

This comes on the heels of a firestorm targeting Rogan and accusing him of spreading pandemic misinformation. The situation escalated when musicians threatened to remove their music libraries from Spotify, including Neil Young, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, Joni Mitchell, India Arie, and Nils Lofgren.

Numerous former guests of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" voiced their support for the embattled podcaster. One of Rogan's supporters even vowed to remove their content from Spotify if the streaming giant bends the knee to the outrage mob and cancels ""The Joe Rogan Experience.""

MIT research scientist and podcaster Lex Fridman: ""I stand with Joe Rogan. It is not a coincidence that the attacks calling him racist come as pressure on Spotify to censor builds. Politicians and the media profit on division & outrage. They fuel the extremes that make us believe we're divided. We're not. We're in this together.""

Former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard: ""I get the feeling some people are using @joerogan's COVID interview as a pretext to silence his voice because he's not woke. Zealots of wokeism try to censor voices who don't agree with theirs, because they fear the absurdity and weakness of their positions will be exposed.""

Rapper Zuby Music: ""Joe Rogan has helped millions of people, all around the world, in a myriad of ways he can't possibly fathom. He has contributed more good to humanity than ALL of his haters and detractors combined. Bunch of salty losers. Joe is a genuine, honest, kind human being. That's why he is such a threat to people who are none of the above. I will vouch for him and defend him.""

Former Evergreen State College professor and author Bret Weinstein: ""Joe Rogan is taking flak because he’s over the target. I support him for the same reason every other person who understands the relationship between a free exchange of ideas and liberty supports him.""



Conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro: ""Nobody targeting Joe Rogan right now gives two damns about anything he's said in the past. This is all just an opportunity for activists to destroy a guy who doesn't carry water for those with institutional power, and whose audience dwarfs their own. It is that simple.""

Comedian Russell Peters: ""This is my friend and brother @joerogan he’s a great human being and I will stand by him because I know WHO he is and not who they want you to think he is!""

Conservative cultural commentator Matt Walsh: ""Nobody is offended by anything @joerogan said. Nobody is hurt. Nobody is a victim. They went digging for the 'offensive' comments. They’re happy to have found them. That’s why these damned vultures deserve a middle finger, not an apology. Rogan owes them nothing but contempt. Rogan is successful and a freethinker. That’s his crime. That’s why they’re coming for him. Not for anything he said about covid. Not for any jokes he made five years ago or whatever. That’s all a pretense. His real sin is that he couldn’t be controlled.""

Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw: ""I’m with @joerogan.""

Journalist Glenn Greenwald: ""That Rogan represents a threat to corporate media - because he questions, disputes and dissents from their herd propaganda - is only one reason they're united against him. Another is petty professional jealousy: millions watch and trust him while almost nobody watches/trusts CNN.""

""Breaking Points"" host Saagar Enjeti: ""The effort to smear Joe Rogan as a racist is one of the most despicable efforts I’ve ever seen in my lifetime. They don’t actually care, they’re just trying to destroy him. We either live in a society where context matters or we don’t.""



Neuroscientist Debra Soh: ""Keep going @joerogan Every sane person sees this witch-hunt for what it is.""

Comedian Whitney Cummings: ""Don’t look to why so many people trust joe Rogan, look to why so few people trust the mainstream media.""

Comic and libertarian podcaster Dave Smith: ""A great person who has launched so many careers. He’s built an incredible show and heroically told the truth in the face of enormous pressure. I could give a s**t what no-no words he’s said in the past.""

Journalist Andy Ngo: ""After I was beaten by Antifa & hospitalized for a brain bleed in 2019, @joerogan offered to give me a voice even though I was unknown. The pile on against him now is because he’s willing to speak with those overlooked by the establishment. Thank you, Joe.""

Comedic actor Rob Schneider: ""'Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech.' - Benjamin Franklin. Free Speech was made the 1st of our Freedoms because it is upon Free Speech that all of our other Freedoms. #ThanksJoeRogan.""



Journalist Bari Weiss: ""Grateful for @joerogan.""



Comedian Andrew Schulz: ""Rogan hit job started with misinformation. That didn’t stick so now it’s racism. Next it will be misogyny. After that transphobia. They are trying to make him radioactive bc they fear his influence. This isn’t about hate. It’s about silencing a powerful man THEY can’t control.""



Political commentator Siraj Hashmi: ""Joe Rogan isn’t some sort of menacing figure trying to take over the world. the dude literally just has an inquiring mind. even if he comes to the wrong conclusion sometimes, he keeps it moving and asks questions trying to get to the truth. isn’t that a virtue we should all want?""



Comedian Shane Gillis: ""Rogan is the man. If they cancel him just end your Spotify subscription.""



NFL player Nicholas Williams: ""Naw we still rockin’ with @joerogan you heard it here 1st.""

Comedian Tim Dillon: ""It’s a political hatchet job. It’s obvious to anyone with eyes. The debate about the vaccine has been over. UK just opened no restrictions. They don’t want him on the air for the next election cycle. Press Sec asked Spotify to 'do more.' It’s not a conspiracy it’s out in the open.""



North Korean human rights activist Yeonmi Park: ""All I can say is we love and grateful to have you in this life journey!""

Podcast host Anthony Cumia: ""Complete bulls**t what is going on. Joe has done so much for so many. Standing by my friend @joerogan.""



Congressional candidate Chris Palombi: ""Those coming after Joe Rogan claiming he is racist must not have listened to his podcast with Daryl Davis, which laid the blueprint for how you defeat racist ideologies - through the free exchange of ideas and liberty, not censorship.""



Former MMA fighter turned podcaster Brendan Schaub: ""If they cancel @joerogan every comic Rogan has ever helped should pull their podcast off Spotify. I’m down.""

Comedian Donnell Rawlings: ""I doubt very seriously if this picture would be possible if Joe Rogan was the person that 'they' trying to make him to be.""



Last week, Jon Stewart defended Rogan by saying it is a ""mistake"" to censor a ""person that you can engage with.""

"John Cleese, under fire from woke mob, hopes they all 'fry in their own sanctimoniousness and narcissistic posturing'","British comic legend and Monty Python star John Cleese over the weekend refused to submit to a woke social media mob accusing him of ""transphobia"" for an old tweet supporting author J.K. Rowling.

Cleese, 81, relentlessly and hilariously mocked his accusers, at one point jokingly asking if he was ""allowed"" to identify as ""a Cambodian police woman"" if he so desired. The comedian, who has come under fire from woke Twitter before and has vigorously defended free speech each time, was accused of standing in solidarity with ""transphobia"" after a Twitter user reposted one of Cleese's tweets from September in which he told his followers he signed a letter of solidarity with Rowling.

Transgender activists on the left have frequently directed their outrage at Rowling because of her criticism of transgender political demands for any man who identifies as a woman to be allowed in bathrooms or changing rooms reserved for natal women and girls.

Cleese, by supporting Rowling, was by extension accused of ""standing in solidarity with transphobia and discrimination.""

And he would have none of it, accusing the rage mob of ""wokery, humorless posturing, and moral self-promotion.""

""If you can't control your own emotions, you're forced to control other people's behavior,"" Cleese said of the hordes of Twitter users who've attacked Rowling and demanded that she shut up. ""That's why the touchiest, most oversensitive and easily upset must not set the standard for the rest of us.""

""Why the f*** can't you just let people be who they want to be? Do you actually think there is some deep conspiracy to turn people 'against their genders'?"" one user demanded of Cleese before the comedian brushed him aside with a joke.

""Deep down, I want to be a Cambodian police woman,"" Cleese wrote. ""Is that allowed, or am I being unrealistic?""

Another demanded that Cleese be ""upfront"" with his actual thoughts on Rowling and her ""position on trans folks.""

""I'm afraid I'm not that interested in trans folks,"" Cleese replied. ""I just hope they're happy and that people treat them kindly.""

Becoming serious for a moment, Cleese said, ""Right now I'm more focused on threats to democracy in America, the rampant corruption in the UK, the appalling British Press, the revelations about police brutality, Covid19, the incompetence of the British government, China's complete disregard for the necessity to abandon fossil fuels, the developments in France between Macron and Islamicists, diabetes, and the recent deaths of several of my close friends.""



But he refused to sympathize with the woke mob.

""I hope they fry in their own sanctimoniousness and narcissistic posturing. Until they get a sense of perspective, that is.""

"John Kerry admits Joe Biden 'literally, literally had not been aware' that France would be upset with Australian submarine deal","John Kerry said that President Joe Biden had ""literally, literally"" not been aware at all that France might be upset with a trilateral deal the U.S. made with Australia and the United Kingdom.

The U.S. special presidential envoy for climate made the comments on French television while trying to explain how the international debacle had occurred.

""He asked me. He said, 'What's the situation?' and I explained exactly, uh,"" Kerry said. ""He was, he had not been aware of that, he literally, literally had not been aware of what had transpired. And I don't want to go into the details of it.""

Kerry was referring to the AUKUS deal to check China's growing presence in the Indo-Pacific. A major feature of the deal is that the U.S. and Britain would develop a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines for Australia. France later called the deal a ""stab in the back"" because it invalidated their deal to provide diesel-powered submarines to Australia.

""But suffice it to say that the president,"" Kerry continued, ""my president is very committed to, um, strengthening the relationship and making sure that this is a small event of the past and moving on to the much more important future.""

Critics of Biden pointed to Kerry's comments to further skepticism about the president's capability to fulfill the duties of the Oval Office.

France has since recalled its ambassadors from the U.S. and Australia to emphasize its outrage at the deal. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian went on to deride the AUKUS alliance.

""This brutal, unilateral, unpredictable decision looks very much like what Mr. Trump used to do,"" he said. ""Allies don't do this to each other. It's rather insufferable.""

"Old stunt: Pop star John Legend says Americans might need to think about leaving US if Trump gets re-elected, succeeds in 'project' to 'destroy democracy'","Singer-songwriter John Legend has repeatedly made it clear that he is not a fan of President Donald Trump.

In an interview with Cosmopolitan UK posted Friday, Legend revealed that he and his wife, model Chrissy Teigen, have considered leaving the country over embarrassment that Trump is president.

He went on to say that leaving the country is something more and more Americans might need to start thinking about should the president prove victorious on Nov. 3.

No surprise

Legend's spat with Trump has been going on for some time.

Most famously, the president ripped Legend as ""boring"" and Teigen as the artist's ""filthy mouthed wife"" after the couple refused to give him credit for pushing for and signing criminal justice reform in September 2019 — despite the fact that the duo had praised it and other liberal black commentators and celebrities had noted Trump's efforts.

In response to those comments, Legend told the Evening Standard that President Trump is ""sad and petty and narcissistic and immature.""

The hard feelings, it appears, have not subsided.

In the Cosmo UK interview, Legend related that he and Teigen thought about leaving the country during the president's first term and said Trump was ""trying to destroy democracy.""

""Every once in a while you think about it. We were born and raised here, all of our families are here. It would be hard to leave,"" he told the magazine. ""But I don't know what one's supposed to do when you have a leader who is trying to destroy democracy.""

Legend added that if the country votes to re-elect Trump and he's successful in his effort to take down America's democracy, then it might be time for Americans to consider moving to another country.

""At some point, if that project [to destroy democracy] was to be in any way successful, you'd have to think about going somewhere that is a true democracy, that has respect for the rule of law and human rights,"" he said. ""If America chooses to be that place then people will have to start thinking about going somewhere else. It is truly disturbing and concerning.""

He wasn't done there. He went on to claim that that somehow President Trump is responsible for the loss of life when it comes to COVID-19, so Americans should vote ""like our lives depend on it"" because we might not be a democracy after four more years with Trump in the White House.

""I think his handling of the [COVID-19] pandemic has been embarrassing to the entire nation and has caused so much loss of life, that was preventable,"" he said. ""We can't bear another four years of this. As Michelle Obama said, we have to vote like our lives depend on it. I honestly think the American people will do it. I truly don't know if we would be a democracy when we were done if we went another four years.""

Nothing new

This stunt by Legend is nothing new. Celebrities were all over themselves in 2016 threatening to leave if Trump was elected. The Hollywood Reporter dug up 20 stars who vowed four years ago to flee if Trump became president:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/john-kerry-biden-unaware-france,2020-09-25
Jordan Peterson says his 'anti-censorship' social media platform is almost ready to launch,"Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson has announced that he is creating an alternative social media platform called ""Thinkspot.""

Who is Jordan Peterson?

Peterson is a psychology professor at the University of Toronto. He has frequently spoken out against censorship.

What's the story?

On June 9, Peterson announced during an episode of his own podcast that his planned social media platform, Thinkspot, already had a Beta version. He tweeted after the interview that he would have further ""exciting announcements coming very soon.""

Speaking with comedian Joe Rogan, Peterson said that people like Milo Yiannopolous, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and Tommy Robinson, a British political figure who campaigned against Muslim integration in the United Kingdom, should be allowed to be on social media platforms because they were ""interesting."" Robinson was arrested last year for live-streaming inside a courthouse during a trial after being warned that it was illegal to do so.

He said that it was a ""terrible assumption"" to think that ""if you give someone like that [with a differing opinion] a platform then you must agree with them, simply because you're conversing with them.""

Peterson said that on Thinkspot ""once you're on our platform we won't take you down unless we're ordered to by a U.S. court of law.""

The site purports to be ""an intellectual playground for censorship-free discourse."" It will start off as invitation-only.



Thinkspot will also allow users to downvote comments into being hidden, although Peterson was not clear on what the threshhold for this would be. Initially, he had said that if more than half the votes were negative, then added, ""We don't know if 50/50 is right."" He also considered having a minimum comment length of 50 words ""so that even if you're a troll, you have to be a quasi-witty troll.""

Does this sound familiar?

In December, Peterson announced that he wanted to launch his own version of the crowdfunding website Patreon after it banned several far-right figures including Milo Yiannopoulos. At that point, no name or description had been announced. He appears to have been referring to Thinkspot.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/john-legend-trump-leave-us,2019-06-13
"'I Kissed Dating Goodbye' author attends Pride Parade after leaving Christian faith, announcing divorce from wife of 21 years","Joshua Harris — the former pastor and author of ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"" — attended a Pride Parade in Vancouver, British Columbia, Sunday after grabbing headlines a month before by leaving his Christian faith and announcing that he and his wife of 21 years are divorcing.

Image source: Twitter

Pink News UK said Harris uploaded photos from the Pride Parade to his Instagram Story.

The Christian Post reported that Harris shared a photo of himself with Matthias Roberts, host of ""Queerology: A Podcast on Belief and Being,"" and gay rock singer Trey Pearson.

""Enjoyed swapping stories, gentleman!"" he wrote in the photo caption, the outlet said.

Pearson posted the same photo on Twitter:

Image source: Twitter

What's the background?

In July, Harris revealed on Instagram that he had ""undergone a massive shift in regard to my faith in Jesus. The popular phrase for this is 'deconstruction,' the biblical phrase is 'falling away.' By all measurements that I have for defining a Christian, I am not a Christian.""

He also apologized to the LGBTQ community ""for the views that I taught in my books and as a pastor regarding sexuality. I regret standing against marriage equality, for not affirming you and your place in the church, and for any ways that my writing and speaking contributed to a culture of exclusion and bigotry.""

Not long before that Harris also said he and his wife are ""separating"" and that ""in recent years, some significant changes have taken place in both of us.""

In 2016, Harris apologized to Christians he hurt when he advised against dating in his best-selling 1997 book, ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye, calling it a ""huge mistake,"" the Christian Post reported.

How did LGBTQ community react to Harris at Pride Parade?

The day after Pearson posted the photo showing him at the Pride Parade with Roberts and Harris, he added some context.

""Joshua's book and purity culture was damaging to men and women,"" Pearson posted. ""The whole idea of that culture did a lot to me. Joshua was at Pride with his queer friends and I was happy to grab a beer with him, talk about his progression in faith, and his journey. He mostly wanted to hear mine.""

But at least one LGBTQ member wasn't happy.

""He has blood on his hands and doesn't belong at Pride until and unless he makes amends to those he's hurt over the years,"" one person reacted in reference to Harris. ""I am devastated to see you and Matthias supporting someone who's done so much harm because of one milquetoast apology that is obviously a remarketing attempt.""

Roberts appeared to apologize for the photo, saying Harris ""was already there. I was so interested to meet him, but should have thought more about how tweeting a photo would harm and retraumatize many. I'm so sorry. Everyone's anger and grief and disappointment in me is well placed.""

What are Christian leaders saying?

Heath Lambert of First Baptist Church in Jacksonville said a Harris-penned foreword would be removed from his book, ""Finally Free: Fighting for Purity with the Power of Grace,"" the Post reported.

""In 'Finally Free' I am trying to be clear about a Christian approach to sexuality,"" Lambert said, according to the outlet. ""Joshua's recent actions and statements only confuse that attempt at clarity and will lead others astray.""

""The Lord knows Joshua's heart,"" Lambert added. ""Was Joshua a Christianized unbeliever who never knew Christ? We do not know, but God does. Is he a Christian who has fallen into grievous sin, and is in need of restoration? We do not know, but God does. What we do know is that Joshua Harris is in absolute spiritual peril. He needs our love, and he needs our prayers. He has mine, and I trust he will have yours as well.""

The Gospel Coalition, from which Harris resigned in 2014, released a statement hoping Harris will return to the faith, the Post said.

""While we grieve Josh's decision (and have told him as much), we are not without hope (and we've told him that as well). We will continue to call on the God of sovereign mercy, the God Josh once extolled and the God who still sits on the throne,"" the organization said. ""We pray for our friend, for our churches, and for ourselves — that we may keep ourselves in the love of God (Jude 21), as God keeps us from stumbling (Jude 24).""

Judge authorizes forced abortion for UK Catholic woman due to her disabilities and mood disorder,"A Catholic woman in the United Kingdom may be forced to get an abortion against her will after a judge ruled that it was ""in her best interests"" to terminate the pregnancy due to her developmental disabilities and mood disorder, according to the Catholic News Agency.

The unidentified woman in her 20s is 22 weeks pregnant, and suffers from developmental disabilities that reportedly have left her with the mental capacity of a grade school-aged child. The origin of the pregnancy, whether it was conceived consensually or not, is unknown and under police investigation.

Justice Nathalie Lieven acknowledged how invasive her ruling is to the woman's rights, but still said the need for the abortion outweighed that.

""I am acutely conscious of the fact that for the State to order a woman to have a termination where it appears that she doesn't want it is an immense intrusion,"" Lieven ruled. ""I have to operate in [her] best interests, not on society's views of termination.""

The woman is under the care of the United Kingdom's National Health Service under an NHS trust, and her doctors have said the abortion would be less traumatic for the woman than giving birth and giving up the child to foster care. The judge agreed, and suggested that the baby, while unborn, is not ""real"" yet.

""I think [the woman] would suffer greater trauma from having a baby removed [from her care],"" Lieven said. ""...it would at that stage be a real baby.""

The woman's mother has told both the doctors and the court that she would take care of the baby. She is reportedly a registered midwife. Lieven believes that it would be too much for the mother to care for her daughter and granddaughter.

Abortion is legal in the UK until 24 week of pregnancy. After that, doctors must certify that it is in the medical interest of the mother to have an abortion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joshua-harris-pride-parade-after-leaving-christian-faith,2019-06-22
Judge tells unemployed Extinction Rebellion protester — a volunteer tree planter — to get a job to pay for vandalizing war memorial,"A United Kingdom judge told an unemployed Extinction Rebellion protester — who doubles as a volunteer tree planter — to get a job so he can pay the fine for vandalizing a memorial to the women of World War II in London, Yahoo News UK reported.

Joseph O'Malley, 33, spray-painted ""mother"" on the bronze sculpture during a climate-change demonstration last November, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard on Tuesday, the outlet said.

The Monument to the Women of World War II memorializes millions of British women who signed up for the armed services and worked in factories to help battle the Nazis, the outlet added.



What are the details?

O'Malley was described as sporting a beard, loose-fitting clothes, a wooden beaded necklace, and ripped-open shoes when he was found guilty of criminal damage to property under £5,000 (about $6,400), the court heard, according to Yahoo News UK.

District Judge Richard Blake said O'Malley's stunt ""wasn't protest, it was just vandalism,"" the outlet noted.



""The manner in which you attacked this memorial was a senseless expression of the word 'mother,'"" Blake told O'Malley, Yahoo News UK reported. ""For some reason on this protest you involved yourself in hooliganism and vandalism. It was senseless. I fail to see how defacing a significant monument which recognizes the role of women in our society, for too many decades overlooked, in overcoming the tyranny of Nazism, how defacing this memorial can in any way further the cause of those who seek to bring to our attention concerns about climate change.""

'You're going to need to find some work to pay this off'

The judge ordered O'Malley to pay a £500 fine, a £50 victim surcharge, and £200 costs, the outlet said. The total is about $965.

""There's no reason I'm told you could not get employment,"" Blake added to the guilty party, the outlet said. ""You're going to need to find some work to pay this off.""

What did O'Malley's lawyer have to say?

""His intention wasn't to damage that memorial,"" O'Malley's attorney, Chantel Gaber, said, according to Yahoo News UK. ""It wasn't intended to cause offense. It was impulsive during the march. There was no long-term damage. The damage was temporary and minimal.""

Gaber also said her client was jobless and did volunteer tree-planting for a group called Fellowship of the Trees, the outlet said.

It was noted in court that O'Malley's spray-painted vandalism remained on the sculpture for about two months, and it wasn't possible to get a precise figure for the cost of removing it, the outlet noted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-rules-uk-catholic-woman-must-get-an-abortion-against-her-will-due-to-disabilities-mood-disorder,2019-10-24
BREAKING: Jury reaches verdict in Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial,"A jury in Virginia on Wednesday found both actor Johnny Depp and his actress ex-wife Amber Heard guilty of defaming each other. However, the seven-member jury sided overwhelmingly in favor of Depp, awarding the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star $15 million in damages while only awarding $2 million in damages to his former spouse, the Rolling Stone reported.

The jury's decision officially brings to an end the highly publicized trial, which began when Depp filed a $50 million lawsuit against Heard, claiming she publicly defamed him by insinuating he abused her in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed.

In response, Heard filed a $100 million counterclaim, alleging that Depp ruined her reputation by claiming she was a liar for voicing allegations of sexual violence against him.

Depp, who was reportedly seen performing at a concert in the U.K. earlier this week was not present inside the courtroom when the verdict was read.

Following the decision, he issued a statement that read: ""False, very serious and criminal allegations were levied at me via the media, which triggered an endless barrage of hateful content, although no charges were ever brought against me It had already traveled around the world twice within a nanosecond and it had a seismic impact on my life and my career.""

""Six years later, the jury gave me my life back. I am truly humbled,"" he added.

Heard issued a statement of her own, noting, ""The disappointment I feel today is beyond words.""

""I’m heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence, and sway of my ex-husband. I’m even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women. It is a setback. It sets back the clock to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated. It sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously. I believe Johnny’s attorneys succeeded in getting the jury to overlook the key issue of Freedom of Speech and ignore evidence that was so conclusive that we won in the UK. I’m sad I lost this case. But I am sadder still that I seem to have lost a right I thought I had as an American — to speak freely and openly,"" she said.

The trial, which quickly devolved into a media firestorm, took approximately six weeks to complete and involved dozens of witnesses — including model Kate Moss, actor Ellen Barkin, doctors, friends, and family members, The Hill reported.

It featured several moments of explosive testimony from both Heard and Depp as the former couple traded barbs and divulged intimate details about their raucous marriage.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-tells-unemployed-extinction-rebellion-protester-to-get-a-job-to-pay-for-vandalizing-war-memorial,2022-06-01
"Justin Trudeau excitedly describes 'amazing feeling' after vaccine shot, begs fans to push 'that crusty old uncle who resists' to also get vaccinated","Far-left Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could barely contain his excitement as he described the ""amazing feeling"" of receiving his COVID-19 vaccine shot during an interview with ET Canada earlier this week.

""You know, it's amazing, because we were talking about how important it was for everyone to get vaccinated and what a big deal it was to get vaccinated, so I thought that was all built in already,"" Trudeau told host Sangita Patel before becoming particularly animated and excited. ""But getting that shot really was an amazing feeling! It it it, it hits you!""

Patel asked Trudeau if getting the shot made him cry — which, as we've seen, is not out of the ordinary for those who've announced to the world that they've gotten their jabs.



But while the prime minister confessed, ""I cry at movies,"" he said he didn't shed any tears while getting vaccinated.

Trudeau then continued his sermon, telling others they should ""convince"" friends who are ""skeptical"" to get vaccinated — even ""that crusty old uncle who resists.""

""It's knowing that each of us doing our part is getting through this, because we don't get through this unless the vast majority of the population gets that first shot, and then a few months later, gets that second shot,"" he said. ""That's how we get through it, and it's something that everyone can do. And we're just seeing Canadians coming out in such strong numbers all across the country to say, 'Yeah, I want this COVID thing to end; I wanna get back to normal.' And the way to do that is to make sure that everyone, even that crusty old uncle who resists, or that friend who's skeptical, encourage them. Convince them. Tell them that they need to get vaccinated. Because this is how we get through it.""

Trudeau got an AstraZeneca shot in April and said last month he'll get a second when it's available. Trudeau's enthusiasm for vaccinations as the way to ""get through"" the coronavirus pandemic appears to be quite a turnaround from his stance just before his first shot, when he declared that ""vaccinations on their own are not enough to keep us safe.""

How did folks react to Trudeau's 'amazing feeling' story?

The prime minister, of course, had his share of fans who loved his enthusiastic description of getting his vaccination, but others were decidedly turned off:

""The never-ending push to get everyone to take it,"" one commenter said. ""If the threat was real and the 'cure' so effective and risk free they wouldn't have to convince anyone — all feels very sinister to me.""

""So use social pressure and bullying to get the vaccine [hesitant] to overlook the facts that this is an untested vaccine with no long-term studies on its effects?"" one user observed. ""This will turn into a witch hunt for the unvaccinated mark my words.""

""A. You're not young. You're 49 yrs old. B. You're a liar, I think. Those getting the #vaccine won't be rewarded with a return to normal,"" another commenter said. ""You've damaged our economy beyond easy/quick repair & #vaccination is already causing life-destroying side-effects in many.""

""And this folks is what you voted for!"" another user declared. ""A complete idiot! Either on drugs of booze. What an embarrassment.""

'Most cringeworthy politician': Kamala Harris mocked for putting on 'French accent' for scientists in Paris lab,"Vice President Kamala Harris suffered yet another ""cringe"" moment this week. Harris was mocked for seemingly putting on a French accent in front of scientists at a laboratory in Paris, France.

Harris made a four-day trip to France this week — her third overseas trip since being in office. Harris traveled to France to try to help mend relations with America's oldest ally after French President Emmanuel Macron was furious with the Biden administration in September.

Australia bailed out on a $66 billion deal with France for 12 new diesel-electric submarines. Instead, Australia reached a trilateral security partnership with the United States and the United Kingdom — known as AUKUS — to deliver nuclear-powered submarines to the Australians. France called the deal a ""stab in the back"" and recalled its ambassadors to the U.S. and Australia. President Joe Biden attempted to smooth things over with his French counterpart by saying the U.S. acted ""clumsy"" and noting that the submarine deal ""was not done with a lot of grace.""

Harris stated the trip had an objective to ""build on our administration's progress strengthening our alliances and partnerships in Europe and around the world."" However, the reconciliation tour experienced some turbulence on Tuesday when Harris appeared to speak in a French accent at a COVID-19 lab at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.

The vice president attempted to explain how politics was different from science.

""In government, we campaign with 'The Plan,'"" Harris said in what is believed to be a French accent. ""Uppercase T, uppercase P, The Plan!""

""And then the environment is such we're expected to defend 'The Plan' even when the first time we roll it out there may be some glitches and it's time to re-evaluate and then do it again,"" she told the French scientists – again using a purported French accent.

Kamala's alleged French accent was panned on social media.

Political commentator Monica Crowley simply said, ""Hot mess.""

RNC deputy communications director Nathan Brand declared, ""Kamala Harris is the most cringeworthy politician.""

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News, ""The clip from Vice President Harris is just, it's more than embarrassing on the world stage. ... Our adversaries watch that and see weakness. They see people who aren't serious, they see people who aren't determined — precisely the opposite of what we did for four years.""

Political columnist Joe Concha said of the video, ""There really are no words anymore… #AuRevoir.""



Abigail Marone, press secretary for Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), joked by making a reference to the political satire comedy TV series ""Veep,"" ""Is she using a FRENCH ACCENT?! I love this episode of Veep.""



Harris, who grew up in Berkeley, California, until she was 12, then moved to Canada, was previously denounced for using a southern accent during a campaign event last November. The then-candidate was accused of putting on a southern drawl at a drive-in rally at Fayetteville State University in North Carolina.

Kamala also suffered criticisms of her authenticity last month when she appeared in a space exploration video with ""students,"" who were reportedly child actors hired by the Sinking Ship Entertainment production company.

A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released this week showed that Harris has an abysmal 28% approval rating among Americans — which is 10 points lower than President Biden. Kamala has the lowest approval rating among modern vice presidents — even lower than Dick Cheney's 30% approval rating in 2008.

Late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel attempted to cover for Kamala's all-time-low approval rating by claiming that ""sexism and racism"" are the ""obvious"" reasons why she polls so poorly. Twitter reactions to Kimmel's remarks ridiculed the talk show host over his notion.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/justin-trudeau-amazing-feeling-vaccine-shot,2021-11-11

"Actor Kevin Spacey charged in the UK for sexually assaulting three men, engaging in non-consensual sexual activity","British prosecutors on Thursday announced multiple sexual assault charges against embattled American actor Kevin Spacey, including one charge of ""causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.""



In a press release, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) claimed to have gathered enough evidence to charge Spacey, 62, with four counts of sexual assault against three men in the U.K. between 2005 and 2013, in addition to the non-consensual sexual activity charge.

Rosemary Ainslie, head of the CPS' Special Crime Division, said the charges followed her department's review of evidence gathered by London's Metropolitan Police.

Authorities made clear that the pronouncement of charges does not predetermine guilt and warned news outlets not to engage in any ""reporting, commentary, or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.""

According to the release, two of the alleged assaults happened in London in March 2005 against one person. A third alleged assault and the alleged non-consensual sexual activity also happened in the U.K.'s capital city in August 2008 against a second man.

Then, a fourth sexual assault against a third man allegedly occurred in 2013 in Gloucestershire, a county approximately 100 miles west of London.

Spacey — a two-time Academy Award winner best known for his work in the movies ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""American Beauty"" and his television work in Netflix's ""House of Cards"" — spent considerable time in the U.K. between 2004 and 2015 while serving as artistic director for London's Old Vic theater.

His storied career abruptly came to an in 2017 after fellow actor Anthony Rapp accused him of assaulting him at a party in the 1980s. Rapp was only 14 years old at the time, NBC News reported.

Shortly after, Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos claimed the star would frequent the Old Vic's bar and ""squeeze whoever caught his attention."" Spacey has denied this and all previous allegations made against him.

That year, Old Vic acknowledged that it received 20 allegations of ""inappropriate behavior"" against Spacey during his tenure at the theater, all involving men.

According to the Associated Press, the new U.K. charges were announced as Spacey testified in a courtroom in New York City on Thursday for the civil lawsuit filed by Rapp.

The actor reportedly didn’t respond to reporters as he left the courthouse talking on his cell phone, and his lawyers declined to comment when the charges were brought up during a break in the testimony. As of Thursday afternoon, no public statement had been issued.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kelloggs-lgbtq-themed-breakfast-cereal,2022-05-26
Key British scientist says Omicron is 'not the same disease' as previous variants,"A key British scientist who advises the UK government made waves earlier this week when he said that Omicron is ""not the same disease we were seeing a year ago,"" and that high COVID death rates are ""now history,"" according to the Guardian.

Sir John Bell, who was born in Canada but has been one of Britain's most prominent life scientists for years, made the comments while explaining why the British government would not be instituting additional holiday restrictions in response to the Omicron variant. Bell is currently a professor of medicine at Oxford and an adviser to the British government on life sciences. He was awarded a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 2015 for his work in medical science and the life sciences industry.

Bell conceded that hospitalizations had increased marginally under Omicron in Britain, but said that Omicron ""appears to be less severe and many people spend a relatively short time in hospital."" Bell also stated that patients who are hospitalized are needing high-flow oxygen support much less often and are only staying an average of three days.

According to the Guardian, some prominent British scientists disagreed with Bell's assessment and stressed continuing caution. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson, in particular, noted that it was yet unclear what would happen to hospitalization rates if Omicron began to experience widespread transmission among the elderly. Others noted that the Omicron variant was likely to cause problems for the medical system in the UK due to staff callouts — one expert predicted that in a ""worst-case scenario"" as many as 40% of NHS workers in London could call out in a single day due to testing positive for Omicron.

As the Omicron wave surges, governments worldwide face critical decisions. By all appearances, Omicron appears to be highly more contagious than previous variants, which has led to increasing panic among certain segments of the population. On the other hand, it also appears, based on preliminary data, that Omicron appears to be much less dangerous than previous variants, particularly the Delta variant which it is in the process of displacing.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kevin-spacey-sexual-assault-charges-uk,2022-01-01
A key coronavirus model just drastically reduced its US death toll projections. It's part of a growing trend.,"An influential coronavirus model often cited by the White House coronavirus task force has significantly reduced its U.S. death toll and hospital resource usage projections.

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at Washington University lowered its death toll projection by nearly 20,000 Wednesday, and now predicts that just over 60,000 Americans will die in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The IHME model also lowered its predictions for the number of hospital beds and ventilators that will be needed on the country's projected peak usage date by one-third each — now at 94,249 and 16,524, respectively.

The drastic reduction is part of a growing trend among all major models predicting U.S. deaths. Generally speaking, as social distancing methods have been taken into account in later models, death toll predictions in those models have been lowered significantly.

The IHME model, however, has been forecasting with the assumption of ""full social distancing through May 2020"" for some time now. As far as we know, the latest update was not based on any changes in social distancing measures. Therefore, the implications, at this point, are that the revisions are based on data coming in about the infectious disease itself.

Two weeks ago, the influential epidemiologist behind the ""gold standard"" Imperial College in London model, Dr. Neil Ferguson, made news when he revised his death toll predictions for the U.K. from 510,000 to 20,000 or fewer. His model also predicted 2.2 million people would die in the U.S. without intervention.

At the time, Ferguson credited the revision in part to the success of social distancing measures, but according to former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, the U.K.'s lockdown had only begun two days prior, on March 23.

Ferguson had also made his revisions after new data from around Europe suggested the virus' infection rate was higher than initially believed, and as a result, the research team updated the virus' reproduction number. It follows that if more people are infected or have been infected than current data shows, the virus' lethality is diminished.

Similarly, there appears to be some confusion with the White House coronavirus task force model, in regard to how much social distancing efforts are being taken into account in the projections.

On Wednesday, a source close to the task force reportedly told CNN that the eventual death toll could be ""way under"" the current 100,000 to 240,000 projections. A key factor, the source said, was that the task force assumed only 50% of Americans would observe the government's guidance about social distancing.

Yet, that is not what Dr. Deborah Birx told reporters when unveiling the projections last week.

""If we do things together well, almost perfectly, we could get in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 fatalities,"" she said adding later that ""the best-case scenario would be 100 percent of Americans doing what is required.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/key-british-scientist-says-omicron-is-not-the-same-disease-as-previous-variants,2020-04-08
"Popular Los Angeles lifestyle boutique goes viral for mercilessly mocking Democrats, leftist celebrities over hypocrisy and more","Los Angeles' premier ""lifestyle boutique,"" Kitson, is going viral for blasting Democratic lawmakers and leftist celebrities with a massive display across their storefront.

Lawyer injects own blood into food in UK supermarkets; jury deliberating insanity defense,"Surveillance video has been released showing a lawyer injecting his own blood into food in a United Kingdom supermarket, Metro U.K. reported.

What are the details?

Leoaai Elghareeb, 37, entered three stores in Fulham, west London, last summer with a bucket containing hypodermic needles and injected his own blood into products such as apples and chicken tikka fillets, the outlet said.

Following the Aug. 25 incidents, the three affected supermarkets — Sainsbury’s Local, Tesco Express, and Little Waitrose — were forced to remove all products from their shelves as a precaution, costing them nearly £500,000 (over $677,000), the outlet said.

Metro U.K. said the supermarkets also recovered 21 syringes during deep cleaning efforts.

The outlet also said Elghareeb is accused of throwing a syringe at a doctor — who was uninjured after it bounced off her — and that he's also accused of pushing a security guard in the chest while shouting, ""You are all vile people, and Sainsbury’s is vile!""

The outlet also said ""there is no dispute Elghareeb carried out the offenses. His defense is that he was, in the legal sense, insane at the time they were committed.""

Indeed, he denied three counts of contaminating goods and two counts of assault, Metro U.K. said, adding that a jury is now deliberating.

'The Truman Show'?

The court was told Elghareeb thought he was living in a simulation akin to ""The Truman Show"" in which ""everything was fake"" and that he wanted to alert ""the real police"" to get rid of ""an implant in his brain"" which he thought military intelligence was using to monitor him, the outlet noted.

In addition, he was said to have regularly used crystal meth to self-medicate mental health problems, Metro U.K. reported.

Dr. Bradley Hillier, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, said Elghareeb was ""severely psychotic"" at the time of his offenses and could not understand that his actions were ""legally and morally wrong,"" the outlet noted.

""He was not thinking straight,"" Hillier added to Metro U.K. ""He was in a situation where he was trying to escape this [world] that the psychosis had created for him."" The doctor also said Elghareeb described himself as being ""so burdened and tortured,"" the outlet noted.

Left-wing UK mayor says Boris Johnson 'completely deserves' coronavirus — and pays big price for her 'deeply offensive' remarks,"While a Facebook post had asked people to say a ""little prayer"" for United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson after he was admitted to intensive care Monday night for his worsening COVID-19 condition, Sheila Oakes — mayor of Heanor in Derbyshire — had other ideas.

""Sorry, he completely deserves this, and he is one of the worst PMs we've ever had,"" Oakes noted in a comment, BBC News reported.

What happened next?



As you might expect, more than a few folks were angry about Oakes' comment — and the next day she said told the outlet she ""apologized for upsetting people and saying it,"" acknowledging she ""made a mistake.""

""I didn't think what I said would upset so many people,"" Oakes told BBC News. ""It came across as not a nice thing to say. I'm concerned about nurses and doctors who don't have protective equipment. I said something when I was angry without thinking about the prime minister or his family.""



The whip comes down

But it was too little, too late.

For starters, the Amber Valley Labour Group said it had withdrawn the whip, meaning Oakes is no longer a Labour councillor, the outlet said.

Chris Emmas-Williams, leader of AVLG, added to BBC News there would be an investigation into Oakes' conduct: ""This behavior is totally unacceptable and not what the Labour Party are about. I've not made the comments, but I feel as leader of the Labour group I have to apologize as well to Boris Johnson and his family, and we wish him well because we need everyone possible to fight this disease.""

What's more, Oakes lost her paralegal job in the wake of her comment, BBC News reported in a separate story.

VHS Fletchers Solicitors told the outlet it became ""embroiled in criticism"" after Oakes' words got around and that she's ""no longer employed by this firm in any capacity.""

The firm on its website decried her ""deeply offensive"" remarks and said her views are ""not shared by the partners or any other members of staff,"" and that ""to wish illness upon anyone must be abhorrent to all right thinking members of the public,"" BBC News reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lawyer-injects-own-blood-into-food-in-uk-supermarkets,2020-04-09
Leftist woman who plans to be a doctor for UK and 'actually care about people' wishes conservative PM Boris Johnson 'a horrible death',"Word to the wise: If you're in the United Kingdom in the future and need to see a doctor, you might do well to avoid mentioning your conservative politics if the woman in the following video calls you from the waiting room.

Amid violent left-wing protests after conservative Boris Johnson won a landslide victory last week to become the nation's newest prime minister, one woman made her position on the matter profanely clear.

Wearing a ""F*** Boris"" T-shirt that employs a caricature of Johnson's naked body spelling out each letter, the woman told an interviewer that Johnson ""is a pig, and I'm so ashamed that he's the prime minister of my country. It's disgusting, and I wish him the worst. I wish him a horrible death.""

What's the big deal?

Since more than a few Brits share her point of view, hers would seem to be just another left-wing rant — except for one disturbing caveat: In the same interview the woman revealed she aspires to work for the UK's National Health Service.

""I plan be a doctor,"" she said. ""I plan to actually care about people.""

She also mentioned, ""Go f*** yourself Boris Johnson, honestly, what a c**t, sorry.""

Here's the clip. (Content warning: language):

Oh, and about those protests

Protesters in London filled the streets and clashed with police Friday night following the massive conservative — i.e. Tory — victory.

Interestingly, they used much the same language American leftists employed during their protests over President Donald Trump's 2016 election. The Evening Standard said phrases such as ""No to racism"" and ""defy Tory rule"" were used, along with that stirring refrain, ""the people, united, will never be defeated.""

Leftist woman who threw red slushie drink at GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz sentenced to 15 days in prison,"Amanda Kondrat'yev — who admitted to throwing a red slushie drink at Republican U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) a few months back — was sentenced Monday to 15 days in prison for assaulting a U.S. congressman, the Pensacola News Journal reported.

The 35-year-old wife and mother of two will turn herself in to U.S. Marshals to begin her sentence Dec. 2, the paper said.

Image source: Pensacola News Journal video screenshot

What's the background?



Kondrat'yev — who briefly ran against Gaetz as a Democratic challenger in the 2016 election — pleaded guilty in August, admitting she tossed the beverage at the Florida congressman as he was leaving the Brew Ha Ha restaurant in Pensacola for an ""Open Gaetz"" event on June 1, the News Journal said.

After the slushie toss, which was caught on video, Kondrat'yev was seen holding a sign and sneaking away through the crowd as Gaetz in the light blue shirt is pointing in the opposite direction:

Image source: Pensacola News Journal video screenshot

She headed toward a parking lot and seemed just seconds from getting away it:

Image source: Pensacola News Journal video screenshot

But cops were on the case and ran after her:

Image source: Pensacola News Journal video screenshot

Then Kondrat'yev got cuffed and endured a brief walk of shame:

Image source: Pensacola News Journal video screenshot

What happened with the case?



Sentencing guidelines called for a prison sentence of eight months to a year, the News Journal said, but U.S. Magistrate Judge Hope Cannon pointed out that Kondrat'yev had no prior criminal history and that the crime had a ""limited duration"" — both of which led the judge to impose a lighter sentence.

However, Cannon said ""the fact that there was no bodily injury or harm does not make this crime count any less"" and that elected officials should be able to hold office without fear of being assaulted, the paper added.

Besides 15 days in the slammer, Kondrat'yev will serve one year of supervised probation and pay a $500 fine, the News Journal reported.

She likely will be held at the Santa Rosa County Jail, which has a contract with the federal government to house inmates for short sentences, the paper said, citing Kondrat'yev's attorney.



What's was Gaetz's position?

Gaetz attended the hearing Monday morning and gave a statement to the judge, asking that Kondrat'yev receive a prison sentence, the News Journal said.

""I come not for any vengeance or retribution but for the safety of the constituents who attend our public events,"" Gaetz told the court, according the paper, later adding that he feared only probation would inspire others ""willing to endure that consequence to show up wishing to cause harm to my supporters or me.""

Afterward, Gaetz told reporters he was pleased with the 15-day sentence, the News Journal reported.

""We want to welcome everyone to our events, whether they support me or not,"" he said.

What did Kondrat'yev's lawyer have to say?

Kondrat'yev's attorney Eric Stevenson said he was happy with his client's lighter sentence but unhappy with Gaetz, the paper said.

""For him to talk about a violent crime, it's not as violent as a potential DUI is to drivers on the road,"" Stevenson said, referring to Gaetz's 2008 arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol, the charges of which were later dropped, the News Journal said. ""It's not as much of a threat to our national security as storming a security hearing with a cellphone in a room that doesn't allow cellphones. It doesn't jeopardize our rule of law as much as intimidating witnesses, and it's not as severe as threatening to unleash violent supporters if you don't get what you want.""

Stevenson added that he wished Gaetz showed Kondrat'yev ""some Christian justice or mercy,"" the paper said.

Anything else?

A cursory glance at Kondrat'yev's very active Twitter page gives a pretty clear picture of what she's all about, sociopolitically speaking.

At the top of it she trumpets the phrase, ""Matt Gaetz thinks cups are deadly weapons but guns are cool for school.""

In an update last month, she wrote, ""It has been really hard to cope with the idea of going to Federal prison for a year over a slushee splash and being away from my family and everyone I know. I never meant to hurt anyone, but I'm charged with a Federal misdemeanor: 'Willful Assault on a Member of Congress.' I hope the judge is lenient. I have no way to know until I am sentenced. In the draft report it says the victim wants me to be incarcerated or his supporters will get violent too. I never thought it would be like this but clearly the US is not like the UK where they just paid a fine for dry cleaning despite much larger and direct spills. I'm sorry for what I've done, I shouldn't throw things. If anyone will please help, it would mean so much.""

"Leftists heap criticism, mockery on Jeff Bezos for donating nearly $100M to help homeless families: 'Just pay your taxes'","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, gave nearly $100 million to charity last week to help combat homelessness. The donation is but a mere drop in the bucket for a man who boasts a net worth exceeding $100 billion, but the donation will undoubtedly help thousands of people who need help.

The $98.5 million donation went to 32 organizations in 23 states that help homeless families, Forbes reported, with each organization receiving between $1.25 million to $5 million.

Unfortunately, the donation — which surpassed his 2018 giving to organizations helping homeless families — initiated criticism from those on the left.

The most prominent critic was UK Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who condemned Bezos and told him to ""just pay your taxes"" instead.

On social media, the criticism was intense. Critics echoed Corbyn's sentiment, suggesting the American government, which is more than $20 trillion in debt, is better suited to handle Bezos' money and philanthropic efforts than the self-made billionaire whose company is responsible for creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.

""Billionaires are evil,"" one critic said. ""[H]e could END HOMELESSNESS if he wanted to.""

""Homeless is a structural issue that exists because of giant corporations like Amazon and the wealth disparity they've created. His donations are empty - Bezos is the problem, not part of the solution,"" another critic said.

""A whopping .09% of his net worth. Thanks so much Jeff,"" another critic mocked.

""How generous of him to donate less than what he makes in an hour,"" yet another person said.

Bezos' philanthropic efforts have long been a boon for critics who believe that he does not give away a sufficient amount of his vast fortune.

Forbes ranked Bezos as the 23rd most generous givers of 2018 for donating $131 million to various charities. However, that amount was significantly less than that donated by Warren Buffett or Bill Gates, who gave away $3.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.

Amazon has also faced criticism for allegedly having a tax liability of $0 in 2018 despite raking in more than $11 billion in profits.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftist-woman-who-threw-red-slushie-at-matt-gaetz-sentenced,2019-11-26
"After series of UK milkshake tossing incidents, leftists say such physical attacks are effective — and 'absolutely hilarious'","Following a series of incidents involving protesters pelting U.K. political figures with milkshakes — the latest being pro-Brexit leader Nigel Farage on Monday — leftists are saying that such physical attacks against ideological opponents are nothing if not effective and even ""absolutely hilarious.""

Tommy Robinson, former English Defense League leader, has been hit in public with milkshakes a number of times recently, and ""alt-right"" YouTube figure Carl Benjamin got multiple servings of the same as well.

Writing for New Republic, Matt Ford contended that ""milkshaking is so potent against Farage and his brethren"" because it ""humiliates them.""

Nigel Farage doused in milkshake on the campaign trail youtu.be

More from Ford's piece:

Throwing a milkshake at someone is rude at worst. It may also qualify as assault in some jurisdictions, especially in the United States. British political and media figures condemned the incidents. Prime Minister Theresa May's office said that politicians ""should be able to go about their work and campaign without harassment, intimidation and abuse."" Tim Farron, the leader of the pro-Europe Liberal Democrats, said, ""I'm not laughing along with the attack on Farage. Violence and intimidation are wrong no matter who they're aimed at. On top of that, it just makes the man a martyr, it's playing into his hands.""



Yet Ford noted that ""nothing animates the far right or shapes its worldview quite so much as the desire to humiliate others — and the fear of being humiliated themselves. It's why 'alt-right' trolls, projecting their own sexual insecurities, enjoy calling their opponents 'cucks.' It's why they rally around blustery authoritarian figures like Donald Trump who cast themselves as beyond embarrassment, shame, or ridicule. They brandish humiliation like a weapon while craving release from it.""

Ford also pointed out that persistent Antifa violence has led to opponents' ""fear of public clashes"" with the masked, far-left civilian army, all of which has had an ""intimidating and profound"" effect.

'Absolutely hilarious'

Amid complaints that the Farage milkshake incident was inherently violent or could lead to more pronounced violence, Aditya Chakrabortty noted in an op-ed for The Guardian that ""chucking a milkshake is not political violence at all; it is political theater, of a kind shared down the ages and across countries.""

In the same vein, the headline of an Independent article on the Farage milkshake incident characterized the act as ""absolutely hilarious.""

""For several weeks now, Nigel Farage has been visiting every part of the country, delivering a stump speech on Brexit that is a lie from start to finish, and no politician has done anything to stop him,"" Tom Peck, a political sketch writer, noted in his piece. ""The sum total of the resistance he has thus far met is £5.25's worth of salted caramel milkshake. Not great, but it's better than nothing.""

But not everybody agrees

In a notable retort to the ""absolutely hilarious"" headline of Peck's piece, we have the following clip showing Piers Morgan asking Peck himself if he'd find it funny if anti-Brexit politician Anna Soubry had a milkshake thrown at her.

Peck is deft enough with his pen, but he's clearly pushed out of his depth — for a few funny moments, at least — after being cornered by Morgan's pointed question:

Another Independent op-ed took the opposite position from Peck's piece, as Kate Townshend wrote that while she can't ""feel much pity for a man whose rhetoric makes me want to claw my own ears off,"" she wouldn't have tossed a milkshake at Farage, either.

""I can't help but imagine the moment some unknown liquid from some unknown assailant hits you is pretty terrifying,"" Townshend noted, adding that she'd be a ""hypocrite to condone it for Farage"" when she wouldn't want it happening to political figures she likes.

More from Townshend's piece:

On the one hand, nobody should have to walk around in fear of having things thrown at them, but on the other, a temporarily milky face is also just not a satisfying redress.



I'd far rather see the Brexit Party nosedive in terms of its expected votes on Thursday. I'd far rather see Farage unemployed and ignored by every media outlet currently so keen to provide him with a platform. I want him irrelevant, not just slightly damp and embarrassed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftists-heap-criticism-on-jeff-bezos-for-donating-nearly-100m-to-help-homeless-families,2019-05-22
Legendary filmmaker Tim Burton: 'I think my days with Disney are done',"Legendary director Tim Burton, 64, may soon part ways with the film and entertainment company that made him a star.

Over the weekend, Burton was in France for the Lumière Film Festival in Lyon where he received a lifetime achievement award known as the Prix Lumière. Burton was selected to receive the award this year because of his storied career, which includes smash hits like ""Beetlejuice,"" ""Mars Attacks!"", ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Big Fish,"" and his latest film, a live-action version of ""Dumbo.""

Upon receiving the award, Burton held a press conference where he discussed, among other topics, his strained relationship with Disney, which has recently focused almost exclusively on projects related to the Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar franchises.

""It’s gotten to be very homogenized, very consolidated,"" Burton claimed. ""There’s less room for different types of things.""

While Burton acknowledged that Disney gave him his first start in the film industry as an animation artist in the early 1980s, he said he is not sure that his current creative interests align with the general direction Disney has taken lately.

""My history is that I started out there. I was hired and fired like several times throughout my career there,"" Burton said.

But he said he would pass on the opportunity to direct a Marvel film.

""I can only deal with one universe,"" he added. ""l can’t deal with a multi-universe.""

Because he no longer feels like he fits in at Disney, Burton also admitted that his work on the live-action adaptation of ""Dumbo"" for Disney hit very close to home.

""The thing about ‘Dumbo’ is that’s why I think my days with Disney are done,"" he continued. ""I realized that I was ‘Dumbo,’ that I was working in this horrible big circus and I needed to escape. That movie is quite autobiographical at a certain level.""

In addition to his discussion of Disney, Burton also mentioned that he rarely watches his films.

""I don’t really watch my movies. It was strange seeing the clips [at the festival],"" he said. ""I got quite emotional. It feels like each film you do is part of your life and is very deep and meaningful so it’s like watching your life flashing before your eyes – that’s why I likened it to a funeral in a way, in a beautiful way, it captures moments of your life.""

Right now, Burton is putting the finishing touches on a spinoff series of ""The Addams Family"" entitled ""Wednesday,"" due out on Netflix in late November. Though born and raised in Burbank, California, Burton has lived in London for many years.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftists-support-physical-attacks-on-ideological-opponents,2022-10-24
Lego vows to get rid of 'gender bias' in its toys,"Woke culture has invaded nearly every corner of American society — and the toy department is no exception.

Lego — the company that creates plastic building blocks that can be fashioned into pretty much anything and sells those molded pieces at exorbitant prices — announced Monday that it would work to get rid of the ""gender bias and harmful stereotypes"" surrounding its toys, the UK Guardian reported.

No longer can parents find Legos ""for boys"" or ""for girls,"" and the company's website does not let shoppers search for toys by gender, the Guardian pointed out.

And the company did not stop there.

What's happening?

Lego, one of the biggest toy makers in the world, made its woke announcement about ridding itself of gender bias and stereotypes following the publication of a study that it commissioned, which ""found attitudes to play and future careers remain unequal and restrictive,"" the Guardian said.

Apparently boys and their parents are just to bigoted about the idea of playing with ""girls' toys,"" so Lego is going to do what it can to combat such ""harmful stereotypes.""

From the Guardian:

Researchers found that while girls were becoming more confident and keen to engage in a wide range of activities, the same was not true of boys.



Seventy-one per cent of boys surveyed feared they would be made fun of if they played with what they described as “girls' toys"" — a fear shared by their parents. “Parents are more worried that their sons will be teased than their daughters for playing with toys associated with the other gender,"" said Madeline Di Nonno, the chief executive of the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, who conducted the research.



“But it's also that behaviours associated with men are valued more highly in society,"" said Di Nonno. “Until societies recognise that behaviours and activities typically associated with women are as valuable or important, parents and children will be tentative to embrace them.""



The study found that parents still encouraged sons to do sports or Stem activities, while daughters were offered dance and dressing up (girls were five times more likely to be encouraged in these activities than boys) or baking (three times more likely to be encouraged).

Actress Geena Davis, who started the company that did the study for Lego, decried ""how ingrained gender biases are across the globe.""

Another ""expert,"" professor Gina Rippon, a neurobiologist and author of ""The Gendered Brain,"" warned of the dangers of gender biases within the toy industry — especially how it could hurt boys to not get them to play with dolls.

""We encourage girls to play with 'boys' stuff' but not the other way around,"" she told the Guardian, adding, ""So if girls aren't playing with Lego or other construction toys, they aren't developing the spatial skills that will help them in later life. If dolls are being pushed on girls but not boys, then boys are missing out on nurturing skills.""

In response to the study showing alleged gender bias in toys, Lego is working to be ""more inclusive,"" according to Lego Group chief product and marketing officer Julia Goldin, the paper said, adding:

“Traditionally, Lego has been accessed by more boys, but products like [arts and crafts line] Lego Dots or Lego City Wildlife Rescue Camp have been specifically designed to appeal to boys and girls,"" said Goldin. The Lego mandate is now to promote nurturing and caring as well as spatial awareness, creative reasoning and problem solving.



The Let Toys Be Toys campaign was launched in 2012 in the UK to put pressure on children's brands to expand their marketing and include both genders, so that no boy or girl thinks they are playing with “the wrong toy"". But progress is slow. A 2020 report by the Fawcett Society showed how “lazy stereotyping"" and the segregation of toys by gender was fuelling a mental health crisis among young people and limiting perceived career choices.

Lego is all in on the woke agenda of treating boys and girls exactly the same.

""Our job now is to encourage boys and girls who want to play with sets that may have traditionally been seen as 'not for them,'"" Goldin said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/legendary-filmmaker-tim-burton-i-think-my-days-with-disney-are-done,2021-10-11
British lesbian couple carried baby in both of their wombs in first-of-its-kind pregnancy,"A lesbian couple from the UK recently became the first parents to carry a baby in both of their wombs during a first of its kind procedure that doctors are characterizing as a breakthrough in ""shared motherhood.""

The procedure, offered by London Women's Clinic, involves one parent harvesting the egg, which is fertilized by donor sperm, and the other parent carrying the fetus in her womb.

Jasmine Francis-Smith gave birth to their son, Otis, two months ago using an egg that was incubated for 18 hours by her wife, Donna, before being transferred to Jasmine's womb for the remainder of the pregnancy.

The process means that Donna is the biological mother and Jasmine is the gestational mother.

The Telegraph notes that while more than 100 babies have been born to lesbian couples using artificial incubation, this marks the first time that both parents have shared in the process.

Lance Corporal Donna Francis-Smith, 30, told The Telegraph, ""We're overwhelmed to be honest, it's blown up massively.""

""It's definitely brought us closer together emotionally,"" she added. ""We're a close couple anyway but we both have a special bond with Otis as well which was helped by the way we've done it.""

The couple is saying that the procedure made them feel ""equal in the process.""

""We're just happy that it's worked so well and the information is out there,"" Jasmine added. ""It will help people in the future — it brings you closer together rather than feeling one has a bond more than the other.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lego-vows-to-get-rid-of-gender-bias,2019-12-04
Liberal Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde praises Trump for Limbaugh honor — because she believes in the ‘right to disagree’,"Liberal Pretenders' lead singer Chrissie Hynde issued praise Monday of President Donald Trump for giving conservative radio icon Rush Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Trump awarded the medal to Limbaugh during the State of the Union address earlier this month.

What are the details?

In a tweet, Hynde said that she appreciated Trump's move in an open letter calling for the president to work toward helping to free WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange.

Hynde, 68, said that her late father, Melville Hynde, was a big fan of Limbaugh and his long-running radio show. Melville Hynde passed away in 2010 at the age of 88.

""An open letter to @realDonaldTrump, President of the United States,"" Hynde began. ""Dear Mr. President, I often think of how much my father, Melville 'Bud' Hynde, who proudly served his country as a Marine on Guadalcanal, would have enjoyed your Presidency.""

""The other day when you gave that award to Rush Limbaugh, my father would have been so delighted,"" she added. ""He loved listening to Rush, which is why I allowed my song, 'My City Was Gone,' to be used on his radio show. My father and I didn't always see eye-to-eye. We argued a lot.""

She continued, ""But isn't that the American way? The right to disagree without having your head chopped off? Soon, I will be participating in a protest in London against the extradition of Julian Assange. I know my father would be mortified, but I feel strongly enough to do ... what I believe is the right thing.""

Hynde concluded by pointing out that Assange should be set free.



""[T]o protest further punishment of a man who sought to defend Freedom, albeit in a way you rightly disagree with,"" she wrote. ""I know Mr. Assange broke the law (as I have done defending the treatment of animals) but I believe ... he has been duly punished and should now be set free. Please consider my plea.""

Authorities arrested Assange outside of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2019. Assange faces extradition to the U.S. You can read more on the background of the Assange case here.

What else?

""My City Was Gone"" by The Pretenders has been Limbaugh's theme song since 1984. In 2011, Limbaugh said he chose the song because he found it ironic that a conservative would use such an anti-conservative song. He also voiced his appreciation for the song's ""unmistakable, totally recognizable bass line.""

In 1999, Hynde's manager revealed that Limbaugh did not license the song properly, nor did he request permission from Hynde to use it as his bumper song. EMI music publishing later issued a cease and desist to prevent Limbaugh from using it on his radio show, but Hynde later said that Limbaugh was welcome to use the song as both of her parents loved Limbaugh's show.

Hynde, instead, suggested that Limbaugh make a $100,000 payment to her that she would, in turn, turn around and donate to PETA.

At the time, she said, ""In light of Rush Limbaugh's vocal support of PETA's campaign against the Environmental Protection Agency's foolish plan to test some 3,000 chemicals on animals, I have decided to allow him to keep my song, 'My City Was Gone' as his signature tune.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lesbian-couple-shared-womb-baby,2020-02-18
'Like a bar code': Andrew Yang calls for way to show proof of someone's vaccination,"Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang is calling for a system people can use to provide proof that they have been vaccinated for COVID-19, suggesting something ""like a bar code they can download to their phone"" would make it easier to safely congregate.

What are the details?

Yang, whose campaign for the White House was based on a platform calling for universal basic income, tweeted Friday, ""Is there a way for someone to easily show that they have been vaccinated - like a bar code they can download to their phone? There ought to be.""

He argued, ""Tough to have mass gatherings like concerts or ballgames without either mass adoption of the vaccine or a means of signaling.""

The businessman went on to say, ""I've been tested at a photo shoot or interview and gotten a bracelet showing I was negative. Then we could interact more freely.""

Yang was blasted for the suggestion on Twitter, with many likening his idea to the way Jewish people were labeled in Nazi Germany.

Conservative podcaster Stephen Miller replied, ""Might want to rethink this one before running for mayor of the city with the largest concentration of Jewish population in the country,"" referring to reports that Yang may run for mayor of New York City.

""This is Nazi talk Andrew,"" wrote director Robby Starbuck, while someone else added sarcastically, ""How about yellow star attached to our shirts?""

Not everyone found that analogy fair. One person wrote, ""As a Jew I find it pretty insulting that people are comparing a QR code that shows whether you can transmit a deadly disease to the Nazis marking my ancestors for slaughter, but whatever. That's politics I guess.""

Some folks also referenced the mark of the beast from the Book of Revelation, with one tweeting, ""Got to be some sort of..... mark."" Turning Point USA contributor Graham Allen drew a correlation to communist China, writing, ""Let me guess social credit comes next?""

Others agreed with Yang, with one person noting that everyone who is inoculated for COVID-19 will receive a vaccination card from the CDC, and suggested people ""take a pic of it to show getting into events.""

Someone else stated that they had been working on a ""digital health passport"" for nearly a year, and another follower wrote, ""What! You mean they are not giving people a card? The UK has a card. I assumed we would do likewise.""

Anything else?

Yang is not the first to call for some type of verification system for vaccinated individuals.

WISN-TV reported earlier this week that according to Anit Mukherjee with the Center of Global Development, ""such identification requirements are almost a certainty for a return to normal.""

""There would be gatekeepers, as I call them, at different places, be it at your workplace or your office when you go in, or a stadium to watch the Bucks play,"" Mukherjee told the outlet. ""They would require some form of assurance that you have been vaccinated.""

He added, ""We need to think of how we approach this in a very careful manner, but also understanding that this is the future. There will be other pandemics and we need to be prepared.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-pretenders-singer-chrissie-hynde-praises-trump-for-limbaugh-honor,2020-12-18
Lincoln Project reportedly scrubs co-founder from website amid allegations he groomed young men for sex,"Anti-Trump Super PAC, the Lincoln Project, has reportedly erased the ""Our Team"" page from its website amid unverified allegations that one of its founders was involved in ""grooming"" younger men for sex, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

What are the details?

On Thursday evening, following reports that some had stepped forward on Twitter to accuse the founder in question, John Weaver, of the troubling behavior, the Lincoln Project curiously started erasing his existence from its website.

After the website had allegedly been scrubbed, Twitter profile, ""Comfortably Smug,"" posted screenshots of the ""Our Team"" page as well as a separate bio page for Weaver as proof that they were both taken down.

As of Friday afternoon, both pages were nowhere to be found on the website.

In the tweet, Comfortably Smug alleged that the scrubbing curiously happened after Fox News host Laura Ingraham tweeted out a RedState story about the allegations against Weaver.

Weaver — a longtime establishment Republican operative who advised the late Sen. John McCain from 1997-2007 and is married to a woman — became the target of an onslaught of accusations on Twitter last week after author Ryan Girdusky accused him on the platform of ""grooming"" and ""offering jobs"" to young men ""in exchange for sex"" throughout his career.

RedState reported that ""after Girdusky's tweets ... it was like the floodgates opened as young men stepped forward to talk about their (alleged) creepy experiences with Weaver.""

What else?

Girdusky would later flesh out some of the accusations he claimed to be aware of in an article published by the American Conservative. Included in the article, were screenshots of messages from young men to Girdusky describing Weaver's alleged inappropriate behavior.

In one of the messages, a former college student recalled receiving a late-night phone call from Weaver during which he was asked about his height and weight. When the student answered saying he was ""about average,"" Weaver allegedly replied, ""Oh my boy, I'm sure certain parts of you are well above average.""

Another accuser alleged that Weaver texted him, ""I love your voice"" and ""I appreciate you, my boy!"" after the 21-year-old male had just done a media hit.

Anything else?

It should be noted that so far none of the allegations have been confirmed. It also goes without saying that just because somebody says something on Twitter, it doesn't make it true.

Weaver has not publicly denied the allegations, and the Lincoln Project has also not addressed the allegations, the Daily Caller reported.

The Lincoln Project is a Super PAC made up of ex-Republican political operatives who are anti-Trump and spent millions of dollars in the 2020 election cycle supporting Democratic candidates.

According to the Washington Free Beacon, it ""began as an anti-Trump organization but has gradually evolved into a pro-Democratic political operation after raising millions of dollars from wealthy liberals.""

Last summer, Weaver discussed the Lincoln Project's efforts to defeat President Trump on CUNY TV's ""Open Mind"" YouTube show.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/like-a-bar-code-andrew-yang-calls-for-way-to-show-proof-of-someones-vaccination,2021-01-15
Linda Sarsour to keynote fundraisers for radical terror-tied group,"Women's March leader Linda Sarsour is set to keynote several fundraisers across the country for Islamic Relief USA, an Islamic advocacy organization that is banned in many countries and has increasing ties to international terrorist organizations.

Over the past few years, the controversial progressive activist has faced increasing scrutiny over her Islamist ideology and ties to radical extremists, in addition to her virulent anti-Semitism. Nonetheless, she remains a board member of The Women's March, which claims to advocate for the rights of all women.

The Sarsour keynote series for Islamic Relief will kick off May 12 in the Atlanta area, where she will be joined by radical New York-based preacher Imam Siraj Wahhaj, whom Sarsour considers her closest mentor. Last year, several of Wahhaj's children were arrested after they attempted to set up a terrorist training camp in New Mexico.

The week after the Atlanta gala, Sarsour will travel to Chicago and Orlando to speak at other Islamic Relief fundraisers.

Several countries have listed Islamic Relief Worldwide — the parent organization of Islamic Relief USA — as an international terrorist organization.

IRW is listed as a designated terrorist group in the United Arab Emirates.

Israel has banned the group from the country, alleging that it provides material support for Hamas. In 2016, Israeli authorities arrested an Islamic Relief worker for assisting Hamas.

Bangladesh has banned IRW as well, claiming that it supports radical Islamists.

Additionally, Russian and Swiss authorities, along with British and Swiss banks, have cracked down on the group for terrorist-financing efforts. Banking giants UBS and HSBC have closed Islamic Relief's bank accounts due to terrorist-financing concerns.

Under the guise of a humanitarian mission, IRW is known to support and prop up radical Islamist groups and individuals in the nations where its network operates. There is currently an ongoing U.S. federal criminal investigation into Islamic Relief, according to a 36-page investigative report by the Middle East Forum that was published in 2018.

The think tank has described Islamic Relief as an outfit that ""was founded — and continues to be managed — by prominent Islamist operatives"" who are linked to the Muslim Brotherhood and other international terrorist organizations.

Moreover, the Clarion Project has described Islamic Relief as an entity ""joined at the hips"" with the Muslim Brotherhood. The current chairman of the group appears to openly support the Muslim Brotherhood, according to photographs publicized by The Investigative Project on Terrorism.



Linda Sarsour has previously spoken at fundraisers for the controversial terror-linked organization. In 2016 and 2017, she spoke at several Islamic Relief events as part of the group's ""Promise for Palestine"" tour. Islamic Relief is just one of the many U.S.-based Islamist outfits that the Women's March leader has cozied up to.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lincoln-project-founder-allegations,2019-04-29
Viral video shows police arresting London street preacher for ‘breaching the peace’: ‘Don’t take my Bible away!’,"Police in London arrested a black street preacher as he spread the Gospel outside Southgate Station. Video of the incident has since gone viral.

At the time of this writing, the original Twitter video has been viewed more than 1.8 million times.

What are the details?

The incident took place Sunday after police approached the man, who had a Bible clutched in his hands, and berated him for ""disturbing people's days.""

When the man refused to stop preaching, police arrested him. The preacher's name remains unknown at this time.

As two officers approach the man, one of them asked, ""What are you doing here?"" The man responded that he's simply preaching.

""You're preaching,"" the officer repeated. ""I'm going to require you to go away.""

The preacher, looking surprised, responded, ""You can never!""

""OK,"" the officer replied, ""then I will arrest you for breach of peace, plain and simple.""

The preacher balked and insisted that he isn't disturbing anyone with his preaching.

""You're posing problems,"" the officer insisted. ""You're disturbing people's days, and you're breaching their peace. If you won't go away voluntarily, we will have to arrest you.""

The preacher refused to leave and said that he's just doing his job.

""I need to tell [people] the truth,"" he fired back.

""Jesus is the only way, the truth and the life, and nobody—"" he added, but the officer interrupted him.

""I appreciate that,"" the officer offered, ""but nobody wants to listen to that. They want you to go away.""

The officer made good on his threat and cuffed the man, and the second officer snatched the Bible from the his hands.

""Don't take my Bible away!"" the preacher begged.

The officer responded by telling the man that he ""should have thought about that before being racist.""

What 'racist' comments?

Judging by the video's contents, it is unclear what ""racist"" statements the man made.

Faithwire reached out to London's Metropolitan Police for comment on the video.

A department spokesperson said despite the officer's remark accusing the man of being ""racist,"" no racist language had been used by the preacher.

""[N]o language of this nature was used in the presence of officers,"" the spokesperson revealed. ""The initial report suggested some Islamophobic language had been used. However nobody has made a formal allegation to this effect and no language of this nature was used in the presence of officers.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/linda-sarsour-to-keynote-fundraisers-for-radical-terror-tied-group,2019-02-25
London pub renamed 'The Trump Arms' in honor of the president's state visit to the UK,"The landlord of a west London pub has temporarily renamed his business in honor of President Donald Trump's visit to the United Kingdom this week.

The Trump Arms, which is normally called the Jameson, is decked out in American flags, Trump 2020 campaign shirts, an ""Oval Office,"" and even a cut out of Trump, ABC News reported.

The president and the first lady Melania Trump arrived Monday in London for an official state visit.

What's the story?

It's the second time Damien Smyth has made the gesture to the president. The 53-year-old Irish pub operator renamed the pub during Trump's visit last summer.

""We did it last year when President Trump visited the U.K.,"" Smyth told ABC News. ""We've done it again now because he's coming here on Monday. We must mark the great relationship between the British, the Irish and the American people.""

Trump described the renaming of the pub as ""wonderful,"" according to The Sun newspaper in July 2018. ""I love those people. Those are my people.""

Smyth turned Trump's quote into posters, which are hung all over the walls.

The pub owner said he welcomes Americans to his establishment and that he expects many to stop in for a pint during Trump's visit.

He told ABC News that the president has a lot of supporters in the U.K. and that his previous trip to London was unfairly represented in the media.

""There has to be another side to the story, you know,"" Smyth said. ""We have to show the American people that the British, the Irish and the Americans are family friends. We're old friends and this can't be forgotten.""

What else?

Smyth said that renaming the pub is a sign of ""respect"" for the U.S. president that celebrates a trans-Atlantic bond that dates back to World War II.

Maajid Nawaz goes on hunger strike for China's Uyghur Muslims,"Maajid Nawaz, an anti-extremist activist and London Broadcasting Company host, is currently on a hunger strike. He will continue to do so until he has gathered enough support for the United Kingdom Parliament to have a debate about human rights violations against Uighur Muslims by the Chinese Communist Party.

""I declare a hunger strike in meditative silence for #STOPUigurMuslimGenocide,"" Nawaz wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. ""In protest against CCP enslavement, rape & harvesting of my Uigur Muslim, Falun Gong, Buddhist or Christian brethren's organs, I'm on hunger strike until the UK Parliament agrees to formally debate acknowledgment of the Uigur genocide.""



The LBC host is encouraging his 274,000 Twitter followers to sign a petition titled ""Impose sanctions on China over its treatment of Uyghur Muslims."" If the petition gets 100,000 signatures, the U.K. Parliament will debate the issue. At the time of publication, the petition had over 78,000 signatures.

""The UK Government plans to introduce 'Magnitsky law,' a law which targets people who commit gross human rights violations,"" the petition reads. ""Through this law or alternative means, this petition urges the UK Government to impose sanctions on China for their human rights violations on the Uyghur people.""

""Since 2017, there have been many reports of the 'cultural genocide' of Uyghur Muslims, a minority Turkic ethnic group native to Xinjiang, China,"" the petition states. ""They are subject to mass detention, mass surveillance, restriction of religious and cultural identities, as well as other gross human rights abuses. Over a million Uyghurs have been forced into 're-education' camps.""



Nawaz tweeted that ""1-2 million Uigur Muslims are held in CCP concentration camps"" and that there is evidence that the Chinese government has an ""organ-harvesting human slave trafficking network.""

""Genocide against Uigur Muslims in East Turkestan is currently taking place,"" Nawaz said. ""Up to two million people are being held in concentration camps. Uighurs are suffering repression, torture and the plundering of their bodies for spare parts for the organ transplant market.""



""The world seems to have turned a blind eye to this abuse,"" he added. ""We appear to care more about globalized supply chains, cheap labor and greed than fairness and respect for fundamental human rights. As a result, civil society and our political establishment is at risk of being politically, morally and economically compromised by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).""

Nawaz also included a link to a Change.org petition titled ""End the Uigar genocide and concentration camps in China,"" which has nearly 15,000 signatures.



Nawaz is the founder of the Quilliam Foundation, a London-based think tank that focuses on counter-extremism.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized a huge shipment of human hair products from China that hint at ""potential human right abuses of forced child labor and imprisonment."" CBP officers at the Port of New York/Newark intercepted a shipment of 13 tons of hair products worth over $800,000 that originated from Xinjiang, China, and linked to the Chinese government's Uighur concentration camps.

Major UK COVID-19 vaccine trial in jeopardy because the virus is 'disappearing',"A major COVID-19 vaccine trial in the United Kingdom is at risk of not producing usable results because researchers may not be able to find enough subjects that test positive for the virus, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

A vaccine produced at Oxford University, which is set for mass production through the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, is set to be tested soon on 10,000 volunteers. However, professor Adrian Hill, the head of the lab that created the vaccine, is worried they might not have enough positive tests to get a result. From the Morning Herald:

""It is a race, yes. But it's not a race against the other guys. It's a race against the virus disappearing, and against time,"" he said. ""At the moment, there's a 50 per cent chance that we get no result at all.""



Hill said that of 10,000 people recruited to test the vaccine in the coming weeks — some of whom will be given a placebo — he expected fewer than 50 people to catch the virus. If fewer than 20 test positive, then the results might be useless, he warned.



""We're in the bizarre position of wanting COVID to stay, at least for a little while. But cases are declining.""

The U.S. has agreed to purchase 400 million doses of the vaccine, and the U.K. plans to purchase 100 million doses, with 30 million of them potentially available to the public by September.

There are more than 200 coronavirus vaccines in development worldwide.

The number of daily new infections and deaths in both the U.S. and U.K. has decreased in May compared to the peak days in April even as testing increases, leading many locations to ease lockdown restrictions some and allow more businesses to open with precautions. Still, some states in the U.S. are waiting until there is a widely available vaccine before fully removing restrictions.

"Male blood donor, 66, required to state on form if he's pregnant — part of new, woke UK policy. He's turned away from clinic when he refuses to answer.","A 66-year-old man in the United Kingdom who's been donating blood for nearly 50 years was turned away from a clinic last week because he wouldn't answer an apparently new question on a form that asks if the prospective blood donor is pregnant, the Daily Mail reported.

The director of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service told the outlet that the agency has a ""duty to promote inclusiveness — therefore all donors are now asked the same questions.""

What are the details?

Leslie Sinclair — who has donated 125 pints of blood in his life — was told he had to answer a part of the form that asks if he's expecting a child or has been pregnant in the past six months, the Daily Mail said, adding that pregnant women must wait six months after giving birth to donate blood.

After he argued that as a man — and as a person age 66 years — the question doesn't apply to him and that he shouldn't have to answer it, Sinclair said clinic staffers replied that they couldn't accept his blood, the outlet said.

With that, Sinclair walked away over the ""nonsensical"" policy, the Daily Mail reported.

""I am angry because I have been giving blood since I was 18 and have regularly gone along,"" the father of two from Stirling in central Scotland told the outlet. ""I'm very happy to do so without any problem.""

Sinclair added the following to the Daily Mail:

There is always a form to fill in and that's fine — they tend to ask about medical conditions or diseases — and clearly that's because the blood needs to be safe. This time around, there was a question I hadn't seen before: ""Are you pregnant, or have you been in the last six months?"" which required a yes or no answer. I pointed out to the staff that it was impossible for me to be in that position, but I was told that I would need to answer, otherwise I couldn't give blood. I told them that was stupid, and that if I had to leave, I wouldn't be back, and that was it. I got on my bike and cycled away. It is nonsensical, and it makes me angry because there are vulnerable people waiting for blood, including children, and in desperate need of help. But they've been denied my blood because of the obligation to answer a question that can't possibly be answered.

Sinclair added to the outlet that his wife, Margaret, 59, also was appalled: ""She just can't understand it, either.""

What did a health official have to say?

Professor Marc Turner, director of SNBTS, last week told the Daily Mail about the new policy.

""We appreciate the support of each and every one of our donor community and thank Mr. Sinclair for his commitment over a long number of years,"" Turner told the outlet. ""Whilst pregnancy is only a relevant question to those whose biological sex or sex assigned at birth is female, sex assigned at birth is not always visually clear to staff. As a public body we take cognizance of changes in society around how such questions may be asked without discrimination and have a duty to promote inclusiveness — therefore all donors are now asked the same questions.""

Anything else?

The National Health Service in England launched a campaign last week to recruit a million more blood donors over the next five years due to falling numbers during the pandemic, the outlet said, adding that the SNBTS began a drive earlier in June to find 16,000 new donors in the coming year.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/major-covid-19-vaccine-trial-in-jeopardy-because-the-virus-is-disappearing,2022-06-20
Man gets prison time for calling in a bomb threat so he wouldn't miss his flight,"A man who was running late for a flight to visit his fiance was sentenced to more than a year in prison for calling in a bomb threat to delay the plane and buy himself more time, according to The Guardian.

Rashidul Islam was on his way to catch a flight from Gatwick airport in London to Marrakech, Morocco, in May 2019. He took a cab, but soon realized that he was stuck in traffic and was probably not going to make his 5:40 p.m. flight.

He knew he could not afford to buy another plane ticket to Morocco—so he had to make this flight. In a panic, he called 999 (the U.K. equivalent of 911).

""EasyJet flight 8897 leaves in 40 minutes,"" Islam told the dispatcher. ""There may be a bomb on the plane, you need to delay it, you need to stop it now.""

Islam did indeed succeed in delaying the flight. Airline officials evacuated the plane and held all passengers by the gate. That gave Islam time to check in and arrive at the terminal.

However, it was not difficult for authorities to determine that the cell phone number that called in the bomb threat was Islam's, and he was arrested at the airport. Islam readily admitted to the crime, and to the reasons why he did it.

The plane did take off, three hours after its scheduled departure—but Islam was not on it. Now, in addition to being sentenced to 16 months in prison, Islam is permanently banned from Gatwick airport.

""Making a false report of a bomb on a plane not only causes significant costs and delays to the airport and its passengers, it also strikes fear into the community,"" Sussex Police Detective Constable Stephen Trott said. ""We treat all reports of this nature extremely seriously, and anyone caught committing such an offense will be dealt with robustly.""

That's not the end of Islam's issues, either. He was sentenced to 42 additional months in prison for money laundering crimes.

Man goes off on 'British f***ing police' who allegedly bashed through his front door 'to make sure there's nothing going on' amid COVID-19 lockdown,"An expletive-filled cellphone video is circulating on social media recorded by a man who calls out ""British f***ing police"" after he said they broke through his front door.

Why?

""We've had a call, haven't we?"" a woman officer tells the man as she stands in his hallway accompanied by three male officers.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

She adds to the resident that police received a ""disturbance"" call and that the officers ""need to check the rooms to make sure there's nothing going on.""



""We've had a call that there might be something going on here, so we need to double check,"" she also told the man recording the video.

None of the officers were wearing gloves or masks upon entering the residence, and it isn't clear from the video what department the officers represent or when the incident occurred. The clip was posted Monday to Twitter.

'What are you doing in my house?'

""What are you doing in my house?"" the man asks the officers, growing agitated and refusing to give his name.

The woman officer told the man — after he remarked incredulously ""so you kick me door in?"" — that had he opened the door, police would've explained why they needed to enter.

""I told you why I wouldn't open the door is because of what's going 'round, this virus, now f*** off and get out of 'ere!"" the irate man yells at the officers.

As the cops open doors inside the residence and check for signs of an illegal gathering, he hollers at a male officer, ""Have a look d**khead! Nothing going here, is there?""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

The resident also calls the officers ""f***ing pathetic,"" an ""absolute disgrace,"" and says they have ""nothing else"" taking up their time.



As the woman officer begins putting on safety gloves and speaking to the man recording the video, he tells her to ""shut your f***ing mouth, you f***ing brain-dead c**t!""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

""Get the f*** out, the lot of ya!"" he hollers at the officers as they finally leave the premises.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

'British f***ing police'

With that, the man inspects the damage and says the ""f***ing idiots broke my f***ing door.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

""Look at the f***ing state of it, you f***ing knobheads!"" he laments by his busted door as the clip comes to an end. ""F*** my life!"" (In case you're wondering, ""knobhead"" is vulgar British slang for a stupid person.)



Here's the video. (Content warning: F-bomb laden language, as if you couldn't already tell):

Anything else?

Police have been getting called out in the United Kingdom by residents who say they're going overboard in efforts to enforce social distancing.

Last week, TheBlaze reported about a U.K. cop caught on video telling a man he isn't allowed to sit in his own front garden due to the government's COVID-19 lockdown. The officer also chastised the man for wanting to go to the supermarket twice — and that she saw him out earlier after making a nonessential purchase: ""You've already been to the shop once; I've seen you with two cans of pop.""

"British man who identifies as a pup wears a fur dog suit, barks, licks, and bites his friends","A British man who identifies as a dog claims he has never felt like a human, the Mirror reported. Kaz James wears a fur dog suit and he eats from a dog bowl. He often barks at, licks, and even bites his friends.

""I didn't ever feel like a human, I always felt like a dog that was really out of place,"" James told the Mirror. ""I was known by my friends for saying hello to them by grabbing hold of the collar of their shirt in my teeth and biting or licking them, very canine-type behaviors. It was always how I was.""

The 37-year-old from Salford, Greater Manchester, who works as a store manager, describes himself as a ""full-time orange, brown and camo K-9.""

But it wasn't until his late teens that he found out there were others like him.

""I never really had a name for it, being a pup wasn't a thing I knew about,"" James told the Mirror. ""When I met other people like me I felt I could be myself.

""The first time I heard the term of being a pup was through a pup I met online, he was the first person I met who was like me,"" he said. ""Through him, I knew other pups and learned a whole new language of this other world that I didn't know about with a whole bunch of other people who were like me.""

Now, James belongs to an online ""pup play"" community, which has helped him with his transition from a ""part-time pooch to a confident canine,"" according to the Mirror.

""It was a liberating moment knowing there were other people like me, having felt properly weird for the longest time,"" James said.

James' pricey fur dog suit set him back about $2,200. He's also the author of the book, ""How to Train a Human Pup.""

When did he realize he was a pup?

As a young child, James said he knew he was different from others.

""I realized that my behaviors were quite dog-like in childhood, probably from the age of 6. No one ever talked about it, it was never mentioned,"" he told the newspaper.

After his parents retired, the family moved to a farm.

""It wasn't until the internet arrived in our house that I started chatting to people online — mostly through groups and message boards,"" he added.

He feared telling people about his feeling because they might think he was crazy.

""I was worried that If I ever spoke to anyone about it, they would be like 'you're a nut job,'"" James said, but after meeting other pups, he found out his feelings weren't as uncommon as he thought.

""It's an experience that a lot of pups I know have had — feeling really weird and strange about how they are and then finding other people and feeling a lot better about it,"" he added.

Finally, James allowed his inner pup shine through after moving into a house with friends when he was 18.

""During that time, as I was finding out I was a pup, I met my first owner and he ended up living in that house with us,"" he said. ""It was quite a steep learning curve for my friends who had gone to school with me and seen me be relatively normal and then learn all these interesting things about me.""

Does he hang out with other pups?

James co-founded a group called Kennel Klub, a human pups meet up for play dates.

""My whole lifestyle is about being a pup,"" he said. ""For me, it's an everything, I go about and live my day-to-day life relatively normally, that includes things like putting collars on at barking at people I know in the street.

""If I see pups out in the Village I will bark at them, I get funny reactions from passersby all the time,"" James added.

James also has two human pups of his own.

Does he dress like a dog at work?

The human pup said his attire depends on the activities he's doing.

""If I'm going to work I'm picking things that are fairly mild like a T-shirt that says 'pup' on the front,"" James said. ""It's an extension of myself and dressing how I feel.""

His pup wardrobe consists of dog suits, dog masks, leashes, harnesses, and other pup items.

""It makes me feel really great when people walk up to me and say I look really good, and it's great that people get a kick out of it, but it's not specifically done for other people,"" he added.

James told the mirror he's at peace as a dog.

""I feel a sense of peace being a human pup,"" he said. ""Little things make me feel happy like eating my dinner out of a bowl using a knife and fork. I don't eat at people's tables when I go to friends' houses.

""I can be a normal person in a restaurant, I'm trained and can deal with humans, but I don't like it, it makes me feel uncomfortable,"" he continued.

While he does eat regular people food, James said that he also enjoys eating Bonios dog biscuits.

""I don't eat dog food, I eat regular food like a normal person, but I do eat Bonios,"" he said. ""They're quite nice.""

Is this really a thing?

James claims that the human pup scene took off after the 2016 documentary, ""Secret Life of the Human Pups.""

""We thought it was big before but after the documentary came out it just became insanely big and became a whole new other monster,"" he said.

What else?

James encourages others to try out being a pup.

""The best advice I could give to anyone interested in becoming a human pup just give it a try,"" he said.



But some people show up at the Kennel Klub out of curiosity.

""We do get people who just show up because they're interested in it, have a few drinks with everyone and chat about stuff,"" he said. ""By the end of the night, they'll be on the floor with tennis balls in their mouths.""

"Transgender limerick retweeted; UK cop investigates 'hate incident,' tells man 'we need to check your thinking'","Police in Humberside, England, recently questioned a man who retweeted a transgender limerick, calling his actions a ""hate incident"" and telling him ""we need to check your thinking,"" The Telegraph reported.

What happened?

A ""community cohesion"" officer contacted Harry Miller, 53, last week after a complaint about the plant and machinery dealer's social media posts, the paper said.

Officer Mansoor Gul cited 30 potentially offensive tweets, among them a limerick Miller retweeted that questioned if transgender women are biological women, The Telegraph reported, adding that it included the line: ""Your breasts are made of silicone, your vagina goes nowhere.""

4. I said, I didn't write that. He said, 'Ah. But you Liked it and promoted it.'

I asked why he was wasting his time on a non crime. He said, 'It's not a crime, but it will be recorded as a hate incident.'

— Harry The Owl - Limerick Criminal (@HarryTheOwl) January 23, 2019

7. This is where it gets incredibly sinister. The cop told me that he needed to speak with me because, even though I'd committed no crime whatsoever, he needed (and I quote) 'to check my THINKING!' Seriously. Honestly.

— Harry The Owl - Limerick Criminal (@HarryTheOwl) January 23, 2019

According to the paper, Gul told Miller he'd taken a training course on the subject and ""what you need to understand is that you can have a fetus with a female brain that grows male body parts, and that's what a transgender person is.""

The officer added to Miller, ""We need to check your thinking,"" the Telegraph reported.

Miller — a husband and father of four — was alerted about the investigation by his company, which officers approached trying to make contact with him, the paper said.

The complaint added that Miller's company is an ""unsafe environment"" for transgender employees due to his social media comments, the Telegraph noted.

How did Miller react to being investigated?

Miller told the paper he's been inundated with messages from others who are ""terrified"" of speaking out on transgender issues due to possible police action against them.

""The only way to protect freedom of speech is to keep bloody speaking,"" he added to the Telegraph, noting that he's in talks with the woman who wrote the limerick he retweeted — who goes by the Twitter handle Restless Ellie — to go on a ""limerick tour"" of police headquarters.

""I'm just a hairy a***ed docker who swears, drinks, and watches football,"" Miller also told the paper. ""But I have a wife, a mother, and daughters, and when it comes to their rights and safety and those of women everywhere, men need to speak up.""

What did the investigating officer have to say?

Officer Gul confirmed to the Telegraph that he spoke with Miller for 20 minutes and said the training course he made reference to was headed up by a transgender person.

""Although none of the tweets were criminal, I said to Mr. Miller that the limerick is the kind of thing that upsets the transgender community,"" Gul added to the paper. ""I warned him that if it escalates we will have to take further action. If someone comes forward and says: 'I'm the victim of a hate incident, and it's really upsetting me', then we have to investigate.""

What did a member of Parliament have to say?

""What on earth are the police doing investigating if no crime has been committed?"" Cleethorpes MP Martin Vickers asked, according to the Telegraph. ""Have they not got better things to do than acting as thought police?""

What did police have to say?

Scott Young, assistant chief constable of the Humberside Police, released the following statement Monday, according to Hull Live:

Following media coverage over the last few days, I want to take this opportunity to provide some clarity around why the police investigate hate incidents.



Hate incidents can cause extreme distress to victims and communities, some of whom are incredibly vulnerable members of our society. A hate incident is recorded as such if the victim perceives the actions taken to be wholly, or partially, motivated by hostility or prejudice.



This relates to any actions, whether spoken or written, around race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and transgender.



We, and all forces, follow College of Policing guidance in relation to handling reports of hate incidents, which can often be a precursor and can escalate to more serious crimes and we, as the police, have a responsibility to prevent crime.



In this case, there were more than 30 tweets reported to us of a transphobic nature, not just a liked or retweeted limerick as some reports have suggested.



This isn't a case of the ""police controlling people's thoughts."" The actions taken by the individual and his comments made around transgender caused someone distress. We take all reports of hate related incidents seriously and aim to ensure they do not escalate into anything further.



The correct decision was made to record the report as a hate incident (as opposed to a hate crime in which a full investigation would have followed), and to proportionately progress by making contact with the individual concerned to discuss the actions taken on social media.



There is evidence to show hate related incidents are already under reported with people feeling they won't be taken seriously and not having confidence in the police.



I want to offer my reassurance that we will always take reports of this nature seriously, and as with this case, take proportionate action.

Man kicks teen girl in face for not wearing mask after 'racially abusing her' on UK bus. Fellow passenger body slams him.,"A man was caught on cellphone video kicking a 16-year-old girl in the face after he chewed her out for not wearing a mask and was ""racially abusing her"" on a bus in the United Kingdom — and then a fellow passenger body slammed the man to the floor, threatened to ""murder"" him, stomped on his head, and threw him off the bus, the Daily Mail reported.

What are the details?

Video shows a man and woman sitting on the bus during an Oct. 1 ride in West Bromwich and excoriating a girl — who was sitting in front of them and on the opposite side — for not wearing a mask.

""All I'm saying is put your mask on!"" the man told the girl, according to the outlet. ""I'm not being racist, but the virus is more common in black and Asians. Put your f***ing mask on.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The Daily Mail said the girl replied but was shouted down by the woman who asked her, ""Why do I have to come on the bus and put up with you sitting next to us with no mask on?""



The woman also told the girl, ""If you weren't 16 years old, I would knock you the f*** out,"" the Daily Mail reported.

As the couple walk toward the bus door to de-board, the man turns around and kicks the girl in the face, the outlet said. It isn't clear if he does so in response to a parting shot from the girl.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

With that, a passenger stands up, grabs the man from behind, and body slams him to the floor.



While the body-slammed man covers his head, the passenger stands over him, points his finger at his face, and threatens him: ""What are you doing, you piece of s**t? I will f***ing murder you.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

As he's walking away, he stomps on the man's head.



The woman comes to the man's defense and appears to try hitting the intervening passenger — but he easily swipes her away, grabs her and the body-slammed man, and throws them off the bus.

"Man can't get dentist appointment during coronavirus lockdown, so he pulls his own tooth using pliers ... and whiskey","The National Health Service in England has told citizens with dental issues that what qualifies as a ""dental emergency"" has changed.

No longer does a throbbing tooth or debilitating headache seem to qualify, at least not according to British dad Billy Taylor who said he was told not to come in for emergency dental work unless he couldn't breathe, the BBC reported over the weekend.

Taylor, 33, said he called about getting an emergency appointment for a toothache, but was turned away. And though the NHS is reportedly setting up urgent care centers, he was not offered that as an option.

""I phoned my dentist and they said they were closed and would put me on an emergency waiting list but I didn't know how long that would take so I phoned 111 and they basically said that unless it was stopping me from breathing they couldn't do anything,"" he told BBC Radio.

Taylor stated that the pain was increasing and ""excruciating,"" but even more concerning was that the left side of his face was swelling.

""Every half an hour it was getting bigger. I looked like Elephant Man,"" he said. ""I thought if this is an infection and it gets into my brain it's really serious,"" the BBC reported.

So he took matters into his own hands.

DIY dental care tools: whiskey and pliers

Taylor logged on to YouTube for instructional videos on tooth removal, grabbed a bottle of whiskey and some pliers, and went to work — after recruiting his 11-year-old son to help and to keep watch in case he passed out.

He took some shots of whiskey, numbed his face, and put the pliers in his mouth. After an hour and a half, the troublesome tooth was out.

""I got an ice pack put it on my face until I couldn't feel it anymore and the final tug, me and my son just went for it and it came out, it was quite tricky,"" he told the BBC. I thought maybe 20 minutes but it took an hour and a half.""

The surgery was a success — though painful.

""It was hideous, I thought I was going to faint half way through,"" he said. However, Taylor said the pain was gone ""instantly"" once he pulled out the molar.

Taylor, as well as virtually all dentists, have strongly urged people to not follow his example.

Dress-wearing 'Queer Eye' star Jonathan Van Ness is first solo male to appear on the cover of Cosmopolitan UK in three decades,"""Queer Eye"" star Jonathan Van Ness is the first solo male star to grace the cover of Cosmopolitan U.K. in more than three decades.

Van Ness, 32, appeared on the magazine's cover wearing a pink and orange ball gown, adorned with several layers of tulle.

The caption for the feature reads ""Jonathan Van Ness. Yep. We did it. You're totally welcome.""

What are the details?

Van Ness, an HIV positive LGBTQ advocate and style star on Netflix's ""Queer Eye,"" identifies as non-binary and uses male pronouns.

Van Ness paired the dress with socks and sneakers.

The reality star shared the cover on Twitter, writing, ""First non female cover star in 35 years. thanks for having me. @CosmopolitanUK showing more variations of beauty for young LGBTQ+ people YAS QUEEN photo by @Rachell_Smith.""

The last single male to be featured on the cover was Boy George in 1984.

Claire Hodgson, Cosmopolitan U.K.'s editor-in-chief, told Time that Van Ness was a natural choice.



""Jonathan is warm, funny, opinionated, kind and brave, all qualities that resonate with our audience,"" Hodgson gushed. ""He is encouraging people to love who they are, which is at the heart of what our brand stands for — we could all do with a little more self-love in our lives.""

Van Ness was also recently named the first male brand ambassador for nail color brand Essie.

The star revealed his HIV status in 2018. At the time, he told Cosmopolitan, ""This is only the beginning.

Media try to pass off British holiday fireworks as a celebration of Biden's apparent win. It backfires.,"Social media users from the United Kingdom roasted American news outlets like ABC News and CNN over the weekend for assuming that fireworks celebrating Guy Fawkes Night — or Bonfire Night — were actually in response to the news of former Vice President Joe Biden's reported win over incumbent President Donald Trump.

What are the details?

As highlighted by Newsbusters, the Daily Mail reported that ABC News wrote in a since-deleted tweet, ""Fireworks lit up the night sky over London, England, after Joe Biden was characterized to be the apparent winner of the presidential election.""

The outlet reported that CNN's Jeff Zeleny added, ""We heard church bells in Paris, fireworks in London. This is indeed a moment the world is watching!""

MSNBC's Ari Melber also shared video of Paris' church bells, saying, ""That doesn't happen for every election. That was the reaction there to mark Trump losing. Joe Biden becoming our President-Elect. Take London. Fireworks were set off, celebrating this historic win. Let's take this in. ... Millions of people in dozens and dozens of countries stopping to reflect on what we did, what you did here in America yesterday.""

The Hill also tweeted, ""Fireworks in London, Edinburgh as Biden win celebrated abroad.""

The Daily Mail pointed out that such egocentric Americans were beyond mistaken in assuming the worldwide celebrations were just for them.

According to the outlet, ""Every year on Bonfire Night [Guy Fawkes Night] families across the UK gather outside on November 5 to enjoy firework displays commemorating the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The plot was formed by Catholic zealots to blow up Parliament in order to assassinate King James I and overthrow Protestant rule.""

The outlet pointed out that the event was delayed this year because Nov. 5 fell midweek.

According to the British-based outlet, one social media user — who quickly went viral for their remarks — wrote, ""Shall we tell them?""

Another user referred to the mistaken media outlets as ""morons.""

Speaker and social activist Obianuju Ekeocha summed the faux pas up nicely, writing, ""Have you ever heard of Guy Fawkes Night? Every 5th November there is Bonfire and lots of Fireworks. But sure, dear American journalists, this year everyone in the UK decided to cancel Guy Fawkes and instead have a Biden-Harris fireworks night. #EverythingIsAboutYou.""

BBC journalist John Simpson added, ""The US tv network ABC reported from London that people were staging firework displays to welcome the news that Joe Biden had won the presidency. No one told them it was Guy Fawkes night.""

Journalist Jack Parrock snapped, ""The amount of US news outlets saying there's fireworks in the UK celebrating the Biden win is frankly outrageous. The weekend closest to Nov 5th is Guy Fawkes night where we do fireworks every year. You can't tell me there's not British people in the newsrooms putting this out.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-wearing-dress-on-cover-of-cosmo,2020-11-09
Actress Megan Fox says she and Machine Gun Kelly drink one another's blood for 'ritual purposes',"Actress Megan Fox said that she and her fiancé, musician Machine Gun Kelly, occasionally drink each other’s blood for ""ritual purposes.""

Fox has been in a relationship with the entertainer, whose real name is Colson Baker, since 2020.

What are the details?

During a recent interview with Glamour Magazine UK, Fox, 36, said that she and her partner drink each other's blood as a tribute to greater things such as moon ""rituals"" and more.

""It’s just a few drops, but yes, we do consume each other’s blood on occasion for ritual purposes only,"" she told the Glamour interviewer. ""I’m much more controlled [compared to Baker]. I read tarot cards, and I’m into astrology, and I’m doing all these metaphysical practices and meditations. And I do rituals on new moons and full moons and all these things. And so, when I do it, it’s a passage, or it is used for a reason.""

She pointed out that her method of exchanging blood is much more disciplined when compared to that of her betrothed.

""And it is controlled where it’s like, ‘Let’s shed a few drops of blood and each drink it,’"" she explained. ""He’s much more haphazard and hectic and chaotic, where he’s willing to just cut his chest open with broken glass and be like, ‘Take my soul.’""

Fox also added that she believes she ""manifested"" Baker into reality.

""He's literally my exact physical type that I've been manifesting since I was four,"" she gushed. ""I'm also four years older than him. So, I think I made him. My thoughts and intentions grew him into the person that he is. Who knows what he would have looked like or been like if it wasn't for me?""

Ex-royal Meghan Markle says the royal family was worried that the skin of Markle's and Prince Harry's child would be too dark,"Meghan Markle said in a new interview that members of the royal family were worried during her pregnancy that the skin color of her unborn son would be too dark.

Markle, the American-born Duchess of Sussex, shares 1-year-old son Archie with Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex. Markle's mother is black, and her father is white.

The couple made headlines in early 2020 when they announced they would be withdrawing from the royal family.

What are the details?

In a wide-ranging interview with Oprah Winfrey, Markle said that her time in the British monarchy was scarring and that members of the royal family had discussions over worries that the skin of Markle's and Prince Harry's son would be too dark.

She also told Winfrey that her son was not bestowed with a prince title following his 2019 birth.

""All around this same time, we have in tandem the conversation of he won't be given security, he's not going to be given a title, and also concerns and conversations as to how dark his skin might be when he's born,"" Markle told Winfrey.

Markle added that Prince Harry shared the information with her and did not state who in the royal family had concerns about the color of the child's skin.

""That was relayed to me from Harry from conversations that family had with him,"" she said.

""The idea of our son not being safe, and also the idea of the first member of color in this family, not being titled in the same way that other grandchildren would be ... the other piece of that conversation is there is a convention,"" she also told Winfrey.

According to People, ""Great-grandchildren of the monarch are not princes or princesses, except for children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, which is why Prince William and Kate Middleton's children are Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.""

During the interview, Oprah pressed the prince on the issue and asked who, specifically, had such concerns about the couple's child.

""That conversation I'm never going to share,"" he said. ""It was awkward. I was a bit shocked.""

On Monday, the BBC reported, ""It was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh who made the comment about how dark the couple's baby's skin would .""

Winfrey told CBS' ""This Morning,"" ""[Prince Harry] did not share the identity with me but he wanted to make sure I knew, and if I had an opportunity to share it, that it was not his grandmother or grandfather that were part of those conversations.

""He did not tell me who was a part of those conversations,"" she added.

What else?

During the interview, Markle told Winfrey that she considered killing herself while pregnant because she ""just didn't want to be alive any more"" due to media criticism.

Markle also said members of the royal family told her that seeking mental health services would not reflect well on the monarchy.

""I was really ashamed to have to say it at the time and ashamed to have to admit it to Harry especially, because I know how much loss he's suffered,"" she revealed. ""But I knew that if I didn't say that I would do it ... and I just didn't ― I just didn't want to be alive any more. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought.""

“It wasn't even, 'I don't want to [be alive any more],'"" Markle told Winfrey. “It was like, 'These are the thoughts that I'm having the middle of the night that are very clear ... and I'm scared, because this is very real. This isn't some abstract idea. This is methodical, and this is not who I am.""

Anything else to know?



A late-night report from the BBC reports that the interview was ""devastating"" and a ""body blow"" to the royal family.

""It's not at all clear if and how the palace will respond,"" BBC News royal correspondent Jonny Dymond told the British news agency. ""Many of the revelations are so personal that getting any reaction seems unlikely. The Queen has made clear repeatedly the affection in which the couple are still held. As for the newspapers that the couple so despise — will they change their tune? It is not in their nature.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/megan-fox-blood-drinking-mgk,2021-03-08
Meghan McCain rips co-host Sunny Hostin for spreading Julian Assange ‘propaganda’ on ‘The View’,"Meghan McCain got into a dust-up with one of her co-hosts on ""The View"" Thursday after the topic of WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange's arrest came up.

Authorities arrested Assange on Thursday at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and indicted him on conspiracy charges related to 2010's WikiLeaks releases. You can read more about the arrest and his background here.

What happened on 'The View?'

The segment kicked off after co-host Whoopi Goldberg brought up Assange's arrest.

""Did he break the law?"" Goldberg asked, positing the notion of free speech.

Co-host Joy Behar answered, ""[Assange] hacked into the Democrats' computers and basically helped Trump get elected by exposing [John] Podesta's emails. ... That's why Trump won!""

Co-host Abby Huntsman was quick to hit back at Behar's remarks, noting that the Trump administration prosecuted Assange — not the Obama administration.

Co-host Meghan McCain added, ""The politics of this have always been completely hypocritical, on both sides. ... This is something that a lot of people who put national security first ... have been warning about.""

""The only time the Democrats started caring is when it started affecting them politically,"" McCain insisted. ""I hope he rots in hell!""

Co-host Sunny Hostin interjected with an attempt to defend Assange by explaining that the U.S. Constitution ""does protect Julian Assange.""

Hostin pointed to the release of the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, the Pentagon Papers, and the Panama Papers as evidence to back up her claim that anyone who had a ""problem with what [Assange] released"" must also have a problem with such other things.

""Those items released protected our democracy,"" Hostin explained.

""Freedom of the press is ... our most important amendment,"" she added. ""It's very clear that the Constitution protects information investigative journalism even if that information is gotten illegally. Even if that info is a matter of national security.""

McCain pushes back

With an incredulous look on her face, McCain fired back, ""I've got to push back hard on this.""

""I think what you just said was straight propaganda, just so we're clear,"" she added.

Hostin fired back, ""Well if the law is propaganda, I'm sorry.""

""He is a cyberterrorist!"" McCain insisted.

Huntsman broke in and added, ""There is a difference ... between being a whistleblower and being a straight-up hacker!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/meghan-markle-royal-family-child-too-dark,2019-04-11
UK becomes first country to approve Merck's COVID-19 pill. British health secretary touts treatment as a 'game-changer.',"The U.K. has become the first country to approve Merck's new antiviral pill that is a treatment for COVID-19. The drug molnupiravir — which is to be branded as Lagevrio in Britain — is being lauded as a ""game-changer"" by the U.K.'s health secretary.

The U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency granted authorization for molnupiravir on Thursday. Molnupiravir has been authorized for use in adults age 18 and older who have tested positive for COVID-19 and have at least one risk factor for developing severe disease, such as obesity, heart disease, or are over the age of 60.

The COVID-19 pill developed jointly by Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Merck works by interfering with the virus' replication. The drug is said to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from multiplying, which keeps virus levels low in the body and reduces the severity of the disease.

""Molnupiravir (MK-4482, EIDD-2801) is an investigational, orally administered form of a potent ribonucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19,"" Merck's press release stated.

The British government says, ""Based on the clinical trial data, Lagevrio is most effective when taken during the early stages of infection and so the MHRA recommends its use as soon as possible following a positive COVID-19 test and within five days of symptoms onset.""

Molnupiravir was initially studied as a potential flu therapy that received funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health.

""Last year, researchers at Emory University decided to repurpose the drug as a potential COVID-19 treatment,"" ABC News reported. ""They then licensed the drug to Ridgeback and partner Merck.""



The U.K.'s Health Secretary Sajid Javid said, ""Today is a historic day for our country, as the UK is now the first country in the world to approve an antiviral that can be taken at home for COVID-19.""



Javid added, ""This will be a game-changer for the most vulnerable and the immunosuppressed, who will soon be able to receive the ground-breaking treatment.""

The MHRA's chief executive, Dr. June Raine, said, ""Following a rigorous review of the data by our expert scientists and clinicians, we are satisfied that Lagevrio is safe and effective for those at risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease and have granted its approval.""

There was no timetable as to the release of Lagevrio in the U.K., but Javid said the ""NHS to set out plans to deploy molnupiravir to patients through a national study as soon as possible.""

In October, U.K. officials announced they secured 480,000 courses of molnupiravir after clinical trials by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics showed patients who received molnupiravir within five days of COVID-19 symptoms had about a 50% decrease in the rate of hospitalization and death as patients. None of the study participants had been vaccinated.

Molnupiravir is also pending review with regulators in the U.S. and the European Union.

The Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee, is scheduled to ""discuss the available data supporting the use of molnupiravir to treat mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults who have tested positive for COVID-19"" on Nov. 30.

Merck reportedly has a contract to supply the U.S. government with 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir at a price of $700 per course. A review by Harvard University and King's College London estimated the drug costs approximately $18 to make.

Merck CEO Robert Davis told CNBC last week that the drugmaker is ""on pace to have 10 million courses ready before the end of this year, and more than double that next year.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/meghan-mccain-fights-sunny-hostin-over-julian-assange,2021-11-04
'Dangerous by design' metaverse apps allow children to access immersive digital sex clubs,"A researcher who went under cover in the metaverse as a 13-year-old girl witnessed grooming, graphic sexual material, and threats of rape.

The researcher, the BBC reported, used an app with a minimum age rating of 13 and visited virtual reality rooms where other users’ avatars were simulating explicit acts. The researcher, whose online presence depicted that of a 13-year-old girl, was shown sex toys and condoms and approached by several adult men.

One man told the researcher that in the metaverse, users’ avatars can “get naked and do unspeakable things.” Other users approached the researcher while in the metaverse and discussed “erotic role-play.”

The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, a British charity dedicated to the welfare of Great Britain’s children, warned that some of the apps in the metaverse are “dangerous by design” as there is very little content moderation in the metaverse.

For instance, the app used by the researcher to access the metaverse, VRChat, allows its users to access any number of immersive chatrooms. Some of these rooms are as innocuous as digital McDonald’s, while others allow users to watch and participate in pole dancing or even attend digitally immersive strip clubs.

Mr. Burrows of the NSPCC said, “It’s children being exposed to entirely inappropriate, really incredibly harmful experiences. This is a product that is dangerous by design, because of oversight and neglect. We are seeing products rolled out without any suggestion that safety has been considered.”

Jess Sherwood, the researcher who went under cover, said, “I was surprised how totally immersed in the spaces you are. I started to feel like a child again. So when grown men were asking why I wasn’t in school and encouraging me to engage in VR sex acts, it felt all the more disturbing.”

She said, “VRChat definitely felt more like an adult’s playground than a child’s. A lot of the rooms were overtly sexualized in pink neon, similar to what you might see in the red-light district in Amsterdam or in the more seedy parts of London’s Soho at night. Inside, sex toys were on display.”

Catherine Allen, founder of a UK-based augmented and digital reality consulting firm, said that while VR can be “fun and surreal,” it also tends to be “quite traumatic and disturbing.”

She described an incident in a Meta-owned app where she and a 7-year-old girl were surrounded by a group of men who joked about raping them.

VRChat said that it was “working hard to make itself a safe and welcoming place for everyone” and that “predatory and toxic behavior has no place on the platform.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/merck-covid-pill-treatment-uk-approved,2022-02-23
"Michigan mask mandate now applies to children ages 2-4 — and daycare owner complains, 'We're struggling'","A new Michigan mask mandate applying to children ages 2 through 4 went into effect Monday, requiring them to wear masks in all public places, including schools, child care centers, and camps.

WZZM-TV noted that in April, the state has tallied a spike in COVID-19 cases among children, and last week some hospital leaders said they are treating more children for the virus than ever before — even ones with no underlying conditions.

But the new mask mandate has created new problems for those charged with enforcing it — and the station profiled a day care center that is experiencing difficulties.

What are the details?

""It's impossible. She's not even teaching anymore,"" Erin Farias, owner of Little Smiles Daycare and Christian Learning Center in Kentwood, told the station regarding her toddler teacher. ""She's not getting any of the curriculum, any of the crafts. It's just, 'Wear your mask, pull your mask up.' That's what their day is.""

Farias told WZZM she understands the mask mandate for 2- to-4-year-olds, particularly because at the Little Smiles centers they've seen an increase in the virus' spread: Last year, they had to close only two rooms all year to quarantine — but in the last two weeks they've had to do it twice.



""We're struggling, this isn't a school right now,"" she added to the station. ""This is a 'let's follow this rule all day long.' It's hard.""

The latest mandate is in effect until May 24, WZZM reported.



Doctor is all for toddlers wearing masks

""Even from the fall, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said kids two and older should be wearing masks, to begin with,"" Dr. Matthew Hornik of the Pediatric Care Corner in West Bloomfield Township told the station in a separate story. ""So, you know, this isn't an out of the blue, left-field kind of a thing that's being done now.""



Hornik added to WZZM that ""the data recently has shown an increase in children. As more adults are getting vaccinated, and as this UK variant is spreading in the state, it's a lot more contagious. So, yes, there still is a small amount of spread in schools and daycares. But anything we can do to help kind of mitigate that spread even further is going to help.""

Hornik also is president of the Michigan Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the station said, adding the he said there's no danger in toddlers wearing masks as long as they're changed out and the correct size.

""I've seen a huge increase in comfortability, even in my own office, with kids who at the beginning of this whole thing were having to wear masks in the office,"" he added to WZZM. ""You know, now I see them and it's like nothing is even happening. They're just totally comfortable with it.""

Hornik also told the station that if adults are ""modeling good behavior and talking to [kids] about it, and taking away that kind of stigma of it being bad, then they're more likely to wear it. So, put it on their stuffed animals. Show pictures of other kids wearing it. And, as they get older they're obviously going to ask more questions and you can be able to explain, 'you know you're wearing this to help protect yourself and to help protect others and doing your part to get through this pandemic.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/metaverse-apps-children-immersive-digital-sex-clubs,2021-04-27
Millennial reality star: World War II history shouldn't be taught to 'young children' so their 'mental health' can be preserved,"A 22-year-old United Kingdom reality TV star said on the popular ""Good Morning Britain"" show that World War II history shouldn't be taught to ""young children"" so as to preserve their ""mental health.""

And Freddie Bentley, a contestant on ""The Circle,"" declared all this in a Friday clash with fellow panelist Sir Michael Wilshaw, who only happens to be the former chief inspector of schools in England.

Image source: ITV/GMB video screenshot

'I don't think it needs to be put ... to young children'



""I don't think it needs to be put ... to young children,"" Bentley said, according to Birmingham Live, adding that it could adversely affect ""their mental health to be told that this certain amount of people died for you.""

He added, ""I remember learning it as a child and thinking, 'My God, it's so intense,'"" the outlet reported.

But Wilshaw retorted: ""Children need to know that it is a dangerous world out there. They need to know that crossing the road is sometimes dangerous.""

Bentley, however, wasn't too convinced, emphasizing that ""mental health [problems are] ... on the rise completely, and I don't think encouraging death or telling people how many people died in a world war is going to help someone in the future.""

""There are so many problems going in the world at the moment, like Brexit, that's not taught in schools and climate change, which is a situation that I feel like we should be aware of,"" the reality show star offered, adding, ""when I left school, I felt like it hit me like a ton of bricks, because I didn't know anything"" about practical living such as ""how to save for a mortgage.""

Bentley added that ""instead of focusing so much on our history and holding onto this past, that we could let it go a little bit — I'm not saying get rid of it totally — but let go of it a little bit and replace it with a subject that is gonna be beneficial to us in the future ... more relevant.""

Wilshaw, however, reminded him that ""50 million people died in the Second World War to fight fascism, to fight tyranny — people who wanted to take away people's right to freedom, to the vote ... that's why people should know about the Second World War, the First World War, the conflicts that have taken place, and the fight for freedom that you and I enjoy.""

Five 'Mission: Impossible' staffers reportedly quit movie after second Tom Cruise meltdown,"In the wake of iconic actor Tom Cruise's expletive-laden rant on the set of ""Mission: Impossible 7"" over crew members' failure to follow social distancing protocols, five movie staffers quit after a second Cruise meltdown, the Sun reported.

What are the details?

The paper said Cruise erupted yet again Tuesday night after news of his first rant grabbed headlines around the world.

""The first outburst was big, but things haven't calmed since,"" a source told the Sun. ""Tension has been building for months, and this was the final straw. Since it became public there has been more anger and several staff have walked. But Tom just can't take any more after all the lengths they have gone to just to keep filming at all. He's upset others aren't taking it as seriously as him. In the end, he's the one who carries the can.""

What's the background?



In Cruise's initial rant, the 58-year-old hollered that ""we're the gold standard! They're back there in Hollywood making movies right now because of us! Because they believe in us and what we're doing! And I'm on the phone with every f***ing studio at night, insurance companies, producers, and they're looking at us and using us to make their movies!""

He added that ""we are creating thousands of jobs you motherf***ers!"" and warned, ""I don't ever want to see it again! Ever! And if you don't do it, you're fired, and I see you do it again, you're f***ing gone!""

Cruise also yelled that he's trying to protect people's jobs: ""No apologies! You can tell it to the people that are losing their f***ing homes because our industry is shut down! It's not going to put food on their table or pay for their college education! That's what I sleep with every night! The future of this f***ing industry!""

Fellow actor George Clooney defended Cruise during a Wednesday interview with Howard Stern:

""He didn't overreact because it is a problem,"" Clooney said. ""I have a friend who's an AD on another TV show who just had the almost exact same thing happen with not quite as far out a response. ... I wouldn't have done it that big. I wouldn't have, you know, pulled people out. You're in a position of power, and it's tricky, right? You do have a responsibility for everybody else, and he's absolutely right about that. And, you know, if the production goes down, a lot of people lose their jobs. People have to understand that they have to be responsible.

"UK mom: I was arrested in front of my kids, jailed for 7 hours after calling transgender activist the 'wrong' gender","A British mother said she was arrested in front of her two children and placed in a cell for seven hours after referring to a transgender activist as a man, the Daily Mail reported.

Three officers detained Kate Scottow, 38, of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, at her home before questioning her at a police station on Dec. 1 over a Twitter exchange with transgender activist Stephanie Hayden, the outlet said.

'With my autistic ten-year-old daughter and breastfed 20-month-old son present'

""I was arrested in my home by three officers, with my autistic ten-year-old daughter and breastfed 20-month-old son present,"" Scottow wrote on the Mumsnet online forum, the Daily Mail said. ""I was then detained for seven hours in a cell with no sanitary products (which I said I needed) before being interviewed then later released under investigation ... I was arrested for harassment and malicious communications because I called someone out and misgendered them on Twitter.""

Scottow — who remains under investigation — had her photograph, DNA, and fingerprints taken and was banned by a court from referring to her accuser as a man, the outlet said.

In addition, Scottow's cellphone and laptop still have been returned to her, the Daily Mail reported, which she said is interfering with masters studies in forensic psychology.



Hertfordshire Police confirmed the arrest, the outlet said, and noted that ""we take all reports of malicious communication seriously.""

Who complained?

Transgender activist Stephanie Hayden complained about Scottow, which led to her arrest, the Daily Mail said. Hayden also lodged a complaint against sitcom writer Graham Linehan, who was given a verbal harassment warning by West Yorkshire Police for referring to Hayden on Twitter by her previous names and pronouns, the outlet added.

More from the Daily Mail:

High Court papers obtained by The Mail on Sunday detail how Mrs. Scottow is accused of a ""campaign of targeted harassment"" against Miss Hayden, allegedly motivated by her ""status as a transgender woman.""



The papers claim that, as a ""toxic"" debate raged online over plans to allow people to ""self-ID"" as another gender, Mrs. Scottow tweeted ""defamatory"" messages about Miss Hayden.



She is also alleged to have used accounts in two names to ""harass, defame, and publish derogatory and defamatory tweets"" about Miss Hayden, including referring to her as male, stating she was ""racist, xenophobic and a crook"" and mocking her as a ""fake lawyer.""



Mrs. Scottow denied harassing or defaming Miss Hayden and said she holds a ""genuine and reasonable belief"" that a human ""cannot practically speaking change sex,"" but Deputy Judge Jason Coppel QC issued an interim injunction that bans her from posting any personal information about Miss Hayden on social media, ""referencing her as a man,"" or linking her to her ""former male identity.""

The outlet said Scottow declined to comment.

British cops have been busy with transgender incidents

Police in Humberside, England, in January questioned a man who retweeted a transgender limerick, calling his actions a ""hate incident"" and telling him ""we need to check your thinking.""

A ""community cohesion"" officer contacted Harry Miller, 53, after a complaint about the plant and machinery dealer's social media posts, The Telegraph reported. Officer Mansoor Gul cited 30 potentially offensive tweets, among them a limerick Miller retweeted that questioned if transgender women are biological women, the paper said.

According to the paper, Gul told Miller he'd taken a training course on the subject and ""what you need to understand is that you can have a fetus with a female brain that grows male body parts, and that's what a transgender person is.""

The officer added to Miller, ""We need to check your thinking,"" the Telegraph reported.

Miller told the paper he's been inundated with messages from others who are ""terrified"" of speaking out on transgender issues due to possible police action against them.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mission-impossible-staffers-quit-tom-cruise,2019-02-11
Monty Python star Terry Gilliam rips 'humour-averse ideologues' who got his musical canceled after he endorsed Dave Chappelle's 'The Closer',"Actor and director Terry Gilliam — who gained fame as part of the Monty Python comedy troupe then later as a director and filmmaker — blasted The Old Vic theatre in London and some of its staff after his production of Stephen Sondheim's musical ""Into The Woods"" was canceled, Yahoo Entertainment reported.

What happened?

Gilliam, 81, was to co-direct the show next year at the historic venue, the outlet said. But last month, The Old Vic said it was canceling the production amid reports that some staffers were unhappy about ""controversial remarks"" Gilliam made, Yahoo Entertainment noted.

And Gilliam took aim at those responsible on his Facebook page Monday:

Gilliam wrote: ""It is very sad that a great cultural institution like The Old Vic allowed itself to be intimidated into cancelling our production of Into The Woods by a small group of closed-minded, humour-averse ideologues on their staff who, absurdly, call themselves 'The Old Vic 12' ... as if they are the victims of some cruel injustice desperately fighting for their freedom!""

He added: ""My unspeakable crime was recommending my Facebook followers to watch a Netflix special by a brilliant and provocative American comedian, and then share with me their opinions. They did and civilisation did not collapse! However, The Old Vic's artistic credibility certainly has.""

Gilliam concluded by saying, ""Freedom of Speech is often attacked, but I never imagined that Freedom of Recommendation would be under threat as well.""

Who's the comedian Gilliam recommended?

Yahoo Entertainment said Gilliam recommended to his nearly half a million Facebook followers that they watch comedian Dave Chappelle's controversial Netflix show ""The Closer.""

As readers of TheBlaze know, Chappelle has been attacked as transphobic over the last few months over some jokes he told in his comedy special, and leftists far and wide have been savaging him and pushing for his cancellation ever since.

What did Gilliam say about Chappelle?

Gilliam in October went on Facebook to endorse Chappelle and ""The Closer"":

""I'm encouraging all of you to watch Dave Chappelle's new show, The Closer, on Netflix,"" he wrote. ""To me, he's the greatest standup comedian alive today: incredibly intelligent, socially aware, dangerously provocative, and gut-wrenchingly funny. There is a storm brewing over Netflix's support for the show. I'd love to hear your opinions.""

Reactions were mixed with respect to both of Gilliam's Facebook posts — his recommendation of Chappelle and ""The Closer"" as well as his criticism of The Old Vic and some of its employees for his own show's cancellation.

Here's a sampling of reactions from the latter post:

""The Great Cancel Witch Hunts of the 2020s, as they may be remembered, will recede into history, just as did the McCarthyism of 1950s America,"" one commenter wrote. ""Freely-discussed ideas, opinions, and unfettered creativity are essential to a healthy society. Love your films Terry Gilliam!""

""Terry I have the utmost respect for you and your work, if someone can't take a joke then they are missing out,"" another commenter said.

""Terry, you are better than this. Chappelle is a great comedian, too, but he went after a whole community that really needs our support in that special, and you recommending it is just adding fuel to a fire that is already out of control,"" another commenter argued. ""The Trans community needs our support and acceptance. They are just normal people, trying to live their lives in peace like everyone else. If we can stop promoting material that tears them down and encourages prejudice, that would be amazing.""

""Thanks for reminding me that I needed to unfollow you,"" another commenter said.

Anything else?

Gilliam, in his post about The Old Vic cancellation, noted that his ""Into the Woods"" production ""has found a beautiful and welcoming new home, the Theatre Royal in Bath. The show will open August 19, 2022.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mom-arrested-transgender-activist-misgendered,2021-12-16
"UK mom killed husband with water, sexual assaulting children","A British woman who allegedly killed her husband in his sleep with boiling sugar water was sentenced on Friday. The mother-of-two reportedly flew into a homicidal rage after her daughter claimed that the father had sexually assaulted her and her brother when they were children.

Corinna Smith, 59, poured scorching hot liquid over Michael Baines, 81, while he was sleeping in their home in Neston, near Liverpool, according to court documents. Smith attacked her husband with a mixture of two piping hot kettles of boiling water and three bags of sugar on July 14, 2020. Prosecutors told a local court the sugar ""made the liquid more viscous, thicker and stickier, so that it stays on the skin and causes greater damage.""

Smith reportedly fled the home and went to a house that was nine doors down, where she told a neighbor about the assault, ""I've hurt him really bad, I think I've killed him."" The neighbor contacted police, and an ambulance was sent to the wounded man.

Police found Baines ""in excruciating pain and whimpering in bed with the skin on his right arm and hand peeling off,"" according to the BBC. Smith's husband of 38 years suffered burns to 36% of his body.

""He was in hospital for five weeks and needed repeated surgery and skin grafts, but he died a month later, on August 18, last year,"" the Liverpool Echo reported.



Cheshire Constabulary detective chief inspector Paul Hughes said Smith ""killed her husband Michael in such a painful and cruel way.""

""To throw boiling water over someone when they are asleep is absolutely horrific,"" Hughes added. ""To also mix three bags of sugar with the water showed the determination she had to cause serious harm.""

""The sugar placed into the water makes it vicious,"" he continued. ""It becomes thicker and stickier and sinks into the skin better. It left Michael in agony.""

The day before the lethal attack, Smith's daughter allegedly told her that Baines sexually assaulted her and her brother. Smith's daughter claimed Baines had sexually abused her and her brother ""for many years when they were children."" The accusations that her husband had sexually abused her son and daughter caused the U.K. mom to be ""livid and fuming,"" according to court documents.

Smith's son, Craig, committed suicide in 2007. Before his death, Craig was imprisoned for assault of a man. He told his mother that the man he assaulted was a ""pedophile"" who had ""touched him sexually,"" according to the New York Post.

From Law & Crime:

""He had been troubled before his death and had been to prison for a serious assault,"" said Judge Amanda Yip DBE. ""He had told you that the man he attacked had been a pedophile and that he had touched him sexually. The day before Craig's death, he had been in some distress and had said: 'Mum, he's a pedophile.' You understood him to be referring to the man he had assaulted. Craig seemed happier the next day and you did not explore what he had said further. Your trial could not and did not explore the truth of the allegations made against your husband.""

The Sun reported, ""Smith had claimed manslaughter due to loss of control but a jury found her guilty of murder following a trial last month.""



""She was in control and acted in anger and to extract vengeance for what she believed that Michael had done,"" prosecutor Mark Rhind told the Chester Crown Court. ""We say that she intended either to kill Michael or to cause him really serious harm and so she is guilty of murder.""

""We cannot and do not say whether these allegations made about Michael Baines are true or not…but that is not the issue for you in this case because the prosecution certainly accept that these allegations were made, and that Corinna Baines believed them to be true at the time that she caused the fatal injuries to Michael,"" prosecutors said.

On Friday, Smith was found guilty and sentenced to life with a minimum of 12 years.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/monty-python-terry-gilliam-musical-canceled-dave-chappelle,2021-07-11
'Mr. Bean' star Rowan Atkinson blasts cancel culture: 'Medieval mob roaming the streets looking for someone to burn',"""Mr. Bean"" star Rowan Atkinson blasted cancel culture in an an interview with the Radio Times, likening the left-wing movement to a ""medieval mob roaming the streets looking for someone to burn,"" Deadline reported.

What are the details?

The U.K. comic actor said social media has been responsible for increased sociopolitical polarization, which Atkinson said makes him nervous about the future of freedom of speech, the outlet noted.

""The problem we have online is that an algorithm decides what we want to see, which ends up creating a simplistic, binary view of society,"" he observed, according to Deadline. ""It becomes a case of either you're with us or against us. And if you're against us, you deserve to be 'cancelled.'""

Atkinson added: ""It's important that we're exposed to a wide spectrum of opinion, but what we have now is the digital equivalent of the medieval mob roaming the streets looking for someone to burn. So it is scary for anyone who's a victim of that mob, and it fills me with fear about the future,"" the outlet reported.

Not the first time

This was far from the first time Atkinson has spoken up about free expression. In 2009 he decried U.K. hate speech legislation, which is much harsher than in the United States — at least so far.

""The last thing that any academic, or cleric, or practitioner in creative writing wants to hear is of police officers walking round with a tool box bulging with sanctions against speech and expression that 'could be useful one day.' I do not believe that legislation of such a censorious nature as that of Hate Speech, carrying as it does the risk of a seven-year jail sentence for saying the wrong thing in the wrong way, can ever by justified merely by the desire to 'send the right message,'"" he said.

In 2012, Atkinson urged a repeal of part of the U.K.'s Public Order Act that outlaws ""insulting words and behavior"" in order to stop the ""creeping culture of censoriousness"" which saw the arrest of a Christian preacher, a critic of Scientology, and even a student making a joke, the Daily Mail reported.

Saying the law was having a ""chilling effect on free expression and free protest,"" he noted to the outlet that ""the clear problem of the outlawing of insult is that too many things can be interpreted as such. Criticism, ridicule, sarcasm, merely stating an alternative point of view to the orthodoxy, can be interpreted as insult.""

And earlier this year Atkinson joined more than 20 prominent cultural figures in signing a letter against the Scottish government's proposed Hate Crime Bill over fears it could limit freedom of expression.

"Murder victim's niece tracks down aunt's killer, pretends to want a date, and sets up sting operation to catch him","A murder victim's niece brought her aunt's killer to justice after he raped and killed the woman in 2014, according to a Wednesday report from the Mirror.

What's a brief history here?

Christine Robinson, 59, was brutally murdered at her 125-acre lodge in Limpopo, South Africa, in 2014.

Robinson's former gardener, 32-year-old Andrea Imbayarwo, was found guilty on Tuesday of raping Robinson and slashing her throat before concealing her body in a duvet cover.

Following the murder, Imbayarwo fled to his native country of Zimbabwe and remained undetected for several years until Robinson's niece, Lehanne Sergison, learned that he was back in South Africa.

What are the details?

Sergison, now 51, decided she would physically attempt to track down her aunt's murderer and dole out a good helping of justice after becoming frustrated with the ongoing investigation into her aunt's horrific murder.

She decided to set up a fake Facebook profile in order to flirt with Imbayarwo and eventually try to trap him in an amateur sting operation.

Posing as a woman called ""Missy Falcao"" — a combination of her pets' names — Sergison virtually approached Imbayarwo and told him that she found him attractive and wanted to meet him.

""I told him I was a stewardess as it meant I wasn't always contactable,"" she recalled telling the killer. ""Its as hard as this man murdered my aunty. I had nightmares when we were messaging each other.""

She said that he eventually agreed to meet her on a blind date in Johannesburg, but said that police ultimately failed to pick him up and he went on the run once more.

""I told the authorities but nobody was listening,"" she said.

Once more, Imbayarwo was out of her life, having changed his name to Andrew Ndlovu.

Two years later, according to a report from the Daily Mail, she crafted a Facebook post naming his new alias as belonging to her aunt's killer.

She shared a photo of the suspect to Facebook, writing, ""Six years ago today this man raped and murdered my aunt Christine Robinson. Andrew Ndlovu is still a free man enjoying his life after taking hers.""

Her post quickly went viral, and Imbayarwo again found himself in the spotlight after Ian Cameron, anti-crime activist, was able to locate him in South Africa.

Authorities soon arrested Imbayarwo and jailed him on murder charges.

During his murder trial, Imbayarwo claimed he had a sexual relationship with Robinson and denied raping and murdering his former employer.

He was found guilty on Tuesday and awaits sentencing.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mr-bean-star-rowan-atkinson-blasts-cancel-culture-medieval-mob-roaming-the-streets-looking-for-someone-to-burn,2022-04-20
Muslim parents in UK protest LGBT curriculum that some describe as brainwashing,"More than 200 Muslim parents and children protested Thursday outside a primary school in England over the school's LGBT curriculum that some parents have condemned as brainwashing, Fox News reported.

The program, dubbed ""No Outsiders,"" was developed five years ago by Andrew Moffat, the assistant head of Parkfield Community School in Birmingham, who is gay.

""This is a brainwash. We bring our children here so they can later work as a solicitor or a teacher, not to be taught about being gay or a lesbian,"" Abdul Ma, 46, told the Sun in an earlier interview.

Thursday's protest was one of many that have occurred in recent weeks over ""No Outsiders"" lessons that Moffat claims were meant to educate the 4- to 11-year-old students about accepting differences among those in society, according to BBC News.

The parents, who are mostly Muslim, have participated in the weekly protests over the lessons they believe promoted gay and transgender lifestyles to the young students.

""This is nothing but indoctrination of our children,"" Razina Mahmood, 40, told the Sun. ""You are using our children as an experiment.""

On March 1, many parents reportedly withdrew their children from the school for a day.

What did the school say?

The school recently issued a letter stating it would not be teaching the curriculum for the rest of the school year.

""Up to the end of this term, we will not be delivering any No Outsiders lessons in our long-term year curriculum plan, as this half term has already been blocked for religious education. Equality assemblies will continue as normal and our welcoming No Outsiders ethos will be there for all,"" Parkfield educators wrote in the letter, according to the BBC.

What else?

Organizers reportedly said that the parents would continue their protests until the school does away with the curriculum altogether.

School officials said it would have conversations with concerned parents about the lessons before the beginning of the next school year",https://www.theblaze.com/news/murder-victim-s-niece-tracks-down-aunt-s-killer-pretends-to-want-to-date-him-and-sets-up-sting-operation-to-catch-him,2019-03-07
Star of new 'Aladdin' movie explains how she stays grounded in her Christian faith while keeping a Hollywood career,"Naomi Scott has received widespread attention and praise for her phenomenal performance in Disney's new, live-action retelling of “Aladdin,"" but the actress is also gaining some accolades for bolding speaking out about her Christian faith.

In a recent interview with Compassion UK, a Christian organization that helps kids in poverty, Scott, 26, proclaimed that she's not sure how she would do life without her faith. The actress' comments came when she was asked how her faith has shaped her life and career.

(Read also: 'Jesus...Save Me': Actor's Plea to God Changed Everything)

""My husband and I were actually talking about this yesterday. Sometimes we get asked the question, 'How do you juggle your faith and what you do?'"" she said, ""But for me, I don't know how I would do life without my faith.""

Scott said she stays grounded and focused with the knowledge that she is ""loved and valued."" She explained that she doesn't see her faith as some sort of separate part of her being.

""Quite honestly, I don't see it as this separate thing, this add-on thing,"" she said. ""My faith is just a part of who I am and what I do.""

And Scott wasn't done there. She added that she and her husband, Jordan Spence, often talk about ""God's grace"" and the fact that they aren't defined by what people say or what happens in life.

In the end, her identity is based on God — a truly powerful message from a Hollywood actress who has a major megaphone right now considering the success of ""Aladdin.""

""To know that doesn't inform my identity in any way shape or form (although it's easier said than done sometimes), that's going to be the thing keeping me going,"" she said. ""Keeping the main thing, the main thing throughout.""

You can read the entire interview here.

This isn't the first time Scott has discussed her faith, as she also openly spoke about Christianity's role in her life for an April interview and cover shoot with British Vogue.

""[My faith is the foundation] of every decision I make, and of my marriage,"" she said. ""And [my husband Jordan Spence and I are] are young people with big aspirations – I want to be a power couple, I want to make all the money and have a big house.""

Video: NATO leaders caught on camera appearing to mock Trump behind his back,"Update 10:21 a.m. ET:



In response to footage of NATO leaders apparently mocking him behind his back, President Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ""two-faced"" Wednesday.

Trump suggested that Trudeau was ""not very happy"" after he called out Canada for not paying the targeted 2 percent of their gross domestic product towards defense spending outlined in the NATO agreement.

""Honestly, with Trudeau he's a nice guy, I find him to be a very nice guy,"" Trump said, speaking at a press conference alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""But you know the truth is that I called him out on the fact that he's not paying 2 per cent, and I guess he's not very happy about it.""

Original story below



World leaders at the NATO summit in London appear to have been caught on video mocking President Donald Trump behind his back Tuesday night.

The short video clip, which was taken during a reception at Buckingham Palace, shows several world leaders including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and French President Emmanuel Macron gossiping about Trump while he was absent.

""Is that why you were late?"" Johnson asked Macron as the video began.



Macron nodded, as Trudeau replied [allegedly referencing Trump], ""He was late because he takes a ... 40-minute press conference at the top.""

The leaders chuckle as Macron speaks inaudibly.

""You just watched his team's jaws drop to the floor,"" Trudeau then continued.

It should be noted that Trump is never mentioned by name in the video, but Trudeau's comments almost certainly were in reference to Trump's press conference with Canadian PM earlier that day.

The Canadian Broadcasting Company first posted the video to Twitter with captions.

Soon after it posted on Twitter, the video went viral.

The video follows a tense exchange between Trump and Macron

Earlier during the summit, Trump and Macron also clashed over ISIS and Macron's comments about NATO being ""brain dead"" due to the United States' lack of involvement.

Trump responded calling Macron's comments ""nasty"" and ""disrespectful.""

This led to a tense exchange when the two world leaders met before the press Tuesday.

""I have not spoken to the president about that — would you like some nice ISIS fighters?"" Trump asked Macron, speaking about the ISIS fighters from Europe captured in Syria. ""I can give them to you, you can take every one you want.""

Macron responded pushing back on Trump's claim that most of the ISIS fighters in Syria are coming from Europe, and called on Trump and the United States to ""be serious"" in the fight against ISIS.

""This is why he's a great politician, because that's one of the greatest non-answers I've ever heard,"" Trump joked after Macron finished.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/naomi-scott-aladdin-star-faith-in-hollywood,2019-12-04
Social distancing mastermind resigns after breaking his own rules to cheat with married woman,"The leading epidemiologist who helped craft the United Kingdom's social distancing rules resigned after he was caught breaking those rules in order to cheat with a married woman.

Dr. Neil Ferguson led a team of researchers at the Imperial College in London but he relinquished his post on Tuesday after the Telegraph newspaper reported on his extramarital acts.

The report said that a married woman who lived in another house with her family visited Ferguson twice at his home in violation of the social distancing rules he helped implement. Ferguson lives with his child but is believed to have separated from his wife.

Ferguson told CNN in a statement that he had committed ""an error of judgement and took the wrong course of action.""

He explained that he believed he had taken the proper precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus before engaging in his romantic interests.

""I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms,"" Ferguson said.

""I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic,"" he added.

""The government guidance is unequivocal,"" Ferguson concluded, ""and is there to protect all of us.""

The 38-year-old woman Ferguson met with was identified by the Daily Mail as a left-wing activist who joined demonstrations on climate and against fossil fuels.

Critics of Ferguson and the coronavirus lockdown policies enforced around the world pounced on the report to brand him a hypocrite and argue that his behavior made a case against social distancing.

"New COVID variant found in UK that may be linked to faster spread of disease, officials say","A new strain of the novel coronavirus potentially linked to a faster spread of the disease has been discovered in south Wales, U.K. officials announced Monday.

What are the details?

British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that the new variant ""may be associated"" with a faster spread in southeast England, but there is ""nothing to suggest"" that it causes worse disease or resistance to vaccines, BBC News reported.

""Initial analysis suggests that this variant is growing faster than the existing variants,"" Hancock said in the House of Commons Monday.

Hancock told British lawmakers that while most of the cases have been reported in the south of England, the strain had spread to at least 60 council areas. He added that the World Health Organization has been notified.

""We've currently identified over 1,000 cases with this variant predominantly in the south of England, although cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas,"" he told British lawmakers while rolling out harsher restrictions in London and parts of Essex and Hertforfdshire.

""We do not know the extent to which this is because of the new variant, but no matter its cause we have to take swift and decisive action which unfortunately is absolutely essential to control this deadly disease while the vaccine is rolled out.""

What else?

While news of a coronavirus variant may sound alarming, the mutation of a virus is actually a normal occurrence.

""It is natural for a virus to mutate over time and we have seen a range of mutations in Wales,"" the Welsh government said in a statement. ""Viruses are living beings that change and adapt, and we know that since the original Wuhan virus there [have] actually been 25 mutations.""

The news in this case is that the strain has been potentially linked to a faster spread of the disease, though that has not been confirmed yet by any further testing beyond the U.K.'s ""initial analyses.""

On Monday, Hancock said that similar variants have been discovered across the U.K. and in other countries in recent months and confirmed that further analysis of the new strain is being conducted by health experts.

Anything else?

However, the process has slowed following some initial complications, including allergic reactions to the vaccine by some.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/neil-ferguson-cheated-on-social-distancing,2020-12-15
"UK's new faster-spreading COVID strain found in Japan, Canada, possibly parts of US","A new faster-spreading COVID-19 variant first discovered in the United Kingdom has reportedly been detected in other corners of the world, including Canada and Japan.

What are the details?

Officials in Ontario, Canada, over the weekend announced that they had detected two cases of the new coronavirus strain, called B.1.1.7, which health experts say is 40%-70% more infectious than the original strain.

The two cases were carried by a couple in southern Ontario who reportedly had no known travel history, exposure, or high-risk contact.

""As the monitoring continues, it is expected that other cases of this variant and other variants of concern may be found in Canada,"" the Public Health Agency of Canada said in a statement. ""Furthermore, as these two cases did not travel outside of Canada, it is important to follow public health measures and limit contacts with others, to reduce the transmission of the virus and any of its variants in communities.""

Meanwhile, authorities in Japan moved to close the country's border to all non-resident foreign nationals through next month, as seven people in the country tested positive for the new variant.

Several other European countries, including France, Spain, and Sweden, also reported confirmed cases of the strain over the last several days.

What else?

The news comes after numerous countries around the world closed their borders to travel from the U.K. due to concerns over the new strain.

U.K. officials first raised the alarm about the variant earlier this month after it reportedly spread across 60 council areas in southeast England. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that while ""initial analysis suggests that this variant is growing faster than the existing variants,"" more testing needed to be conducted.

So far, health experts are confident that the new strain, though more infectious, does not result in a worse disease and is not resistant to a vaccine.

Anything else?

On Saturday, health officials in Los Angeles County began testing virus samples out of suspicion that the new strain is what's driving a surge in confirmed COVID-19 cases in southern California.

While to date, no confirmed cases of the new strain have been discovered in the United States, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested it's likely the variant has been present in the country for weeks but has simply gone undetected.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-coronavirus-variant-faster-spread,2020-12-28
New poll shows Sanders with large national lead as Democrats panic: 'It's going to be the end of days',"A newly released Morning Consult poll taken entirely after the New Hampshire primary seems to confirm the worst fears among some Democratic Party leaders: Sen. Bernie Sanders is now the clear front-runner for their party's nomination.

With 29 percent of the poll's respondents indicating they would vote for the Vermont democratic socialist, Sanders tops the field of candidates. He has an ample lead over former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who stand at 19 and 18 percent, respectively, with Democratic voters.

Former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg comes in at fourth place with 11 percent, while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, once considered the favorite to win the nomination, is in fifth place with 10 percent. Meanwhile, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who had a surprisingly strong finish in the New Hampshire primary, is the favorite among 5 percent of Democrats nationwide.

For the survey, Morning Consult interviewed 2,639 registered voters nationwide who indicated they may vote in the Democratic primary or caucuses in their state.

'Poor reading for Biden'

According to pollster Eli Yokley, the poll is bad news for Biden, who political commentators like Ben Shapiro have said is ""clogging"" the ""moderate lane"" in the Democratic primary.

""The results are poor reading for Biden, who continues a dramatic drop that erases the national lead he held for over a year until his fourth-place showing in the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses,"" Yokley wrote in a memo accompanying the poll results.

In his analysis, Yokley notes that the race was tighter before the New Hampshire primary, when Sanders' lead over Biden was within the margin of error, 25 to 22 percent.

""The decline in Biden's support comes amid faltering voter confidence over his perceived general-election strength, even as he banks his candidacy for the Democratic nod on the more diverse electorates driving nominating contests in Nevada and South Carolina ahead of Super Tuesday.""

The researcher also said that Biden's standing with black voters is deteriorating as he enters the crucial South Carolina primary.

""Among black voters — one of Biden's strongest blocs of support — confidence in his chances of beating Trump fell 10 points, to 21 percent. Roughly a third of black voters (32 percent) said Sanders is Democrats' best chance to beat Trump, up 9 points from last week, and 21 percent said Bloomberg, up 7 points.""

'I'm scared to death ...'

Sanders' 10-point lead comes as Democratic leaders are openly fretting about the impact of his campaign on down-ballot Democrats in key states across the country and whether an open socialist can win the presidency.

""If he's at the top of the ticket in 2020, it's going to be a bad year for Democrats in Florida,"" said Florida state Rep. Javier Fernandez to the Miami Herald. Fernandez is running for a swing Senate seat in South Florida.

This sentiment was echoed by veteran Democratic strategist James Carville, who said he's ""scared to death"" of Democrats' chances to win back the White House. Carville even compared Sanders to the UK's Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing leader of the Labour Party, which was decimated during December elections.

""If we go the way of the British Labour Party, if we nominate Jeremy Corbyn, it's going to be the end of days. ... So I am scared to death, I really am,"" said the former adviser to President Bill Clinton regarding Sanders' candidacy, according to Fox News.

Meanwhile, according to a Gallup poll released earlier in the week, a majority of Americans say they would never vote for a socialist for president. Fifty-three percent said they would vote against a socialist candidate, while only 45 percent of respondents in the study indicated they would back one.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-covid-strain-canada-japan,2020-02-13
"New study on COVID-19 antibodies suggests that immunity fades within weeks, authors say it puts a 'nail in the coffin' of herd immunity","A new study from the U.K. finds that immunity against COVID-19 fades within weeks, putting a ""nail in the coffin"" of the idea of herd immunity, according to the study's authors.

What are the details?

The research, carried out by scientists at King's College London, determined that a COVID-19 patient's level of antibodies peaked three weeks after symptoms appeared and then in some cases faded away altogether.

Research notes that in some cases, a patient's level of antibodies was entirely ""undetectable"" after three months.

The study, conducted on antibody response of 90 patients and health care workers at Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, found that 60 percent of those tested had ""potent"" levels of antibodies during their COVID-19 battles, but just 17 percent had the same level of antibodies three months later.

The study also noted that it appears COVID-19 can reinfect people even if those infected developed antibodies in their initial infection.

According to Business Insider, ""The potency of the antibodies fell by as much as 23 times over the three months ... and in some cases were undetectable at the end of that period of time.""

One of the study's authors said that the findings put ""another nail in the coffin of the dangerous concept of herd immunity.""

The study has not been peer-reviewed at the time of this writing.

What else?

In a statement, Professor Jonathan Heeney, a virologist at the University of Cambridge, said that the idea of herd immunity is dangerous — especially when it comes to COVID-19.

""I cannot underscore how important it is that the public understands that getting infected by this virus is not a good thing,"" he said. ""Some of the public, especially the youth, have become somewhat cavalier about getting infected, thinking that they would contribute to herd immunity.""

""Not only will they place themselves at risk, and others, by getting infected, and losing immunity, they may even put themselves at greater risk of more severe lung disease if they get infected again in the years to come,"" he insisted.

Anything else to know?

This study has come out on the heels of a Spanish study, which claimed the same result: Antibody protection against COVID-19 reinfection significantly declines in a good many patients.

The study found that just five percent of people tested maintained antibodies several weeks following infection.

In a statement, the study's authors said, ""In light of these findings, any proposed approach to herd immunity through natural infection is not only highly unethical, but also unachievable.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-poll-shows-sanders-with-large-national-lead-as-democrats-panic,2020-07-13
New tool helping those with prosthetic arms take up surfing,"A new tool that can help people with prosthetic arms take part in the sport of surfing has been proving successful, reports the BBC.

The new type of prosthetic arm is named “The Nicole,” in honor of Nicole Brennan, who was born with a congenital limb difference. Brennan launched the IAMPOSSIBLE Foundation in 2019 to help those with similar disabilities in the United Kingdom.

Brennan said the shape of the new tool gives people extra grip and balance and allows them to do a push-up or pop-up onto a surfboard. ""Having the correct tools to do the activities that bring you joy...is really powerful,"" Brennan told the BBC.

The prosthetic was developed by UK startup Koalaa, whose mission is to “provide people worldwide with affordable prostheses and a community they can contact.”

Prior to working with Brennan, Koalaa patented a soft fabric sleeve that can be fitted with different tool attachments, depending on the task. Koalaa recognized that many people using its product were interested in surfing, and that “popping-up” onto a surfboard posed a major challenge to those with prosthetics. ""I reached out to the founder of Koalaa, Nate Macabuag, we soon realized that our values were aligned,” Brennan said. “We wanted to ensure that everyone had access to the correct tools to approach a task/activity with ease whilst knocking down the barriers that those with limb differences face.”

The Wave, an “artificial surfing destination” in Bristol, UK, recently held an event where surfers could test out the new tool. “We jumped at the chance to enable the testing and launch of this brilliant innovation,” said Nick Hounsfield, founder of The Wave.

Brennan says the invention is empowering. “I spend as much time on the beach as I can and have always wanted to try surfing but never felt like it was a sport that was available to me,” she said. “Being able to push up from the board to a standing position was always a barrier and it’s been amazing to work with the team at Koalaa to create a prosthetic that can make surfing accessible for those with limb differences like mine.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-study-dashes-concept-of-herd-immunity-in-covid-19-patients,2022-09-25
"NHS backpedals on transgender treatments for minors, says most children are just going through a 'phase'","In an astonishing turn of events, the National Health Services of England announced that most children who believe that they are transgender are just going through a ""phase,"" the Telegraph reported on Sunday. The publicly funded health care provider stated that it would take a more cautious approach when treating minors with gender dysphoria.



Doctors should not encourage children to socially transition, because transitioning is not a ""neutral act"" and it could have ""significant effects"" in terms of ""psychological functioning,"" according to the new NHS report.

The NHS also announced that it would ban prescribing minors puberty blockers ""outside of strict clinical trials,"" the Telegraph reported. Treatment for those under 18 years old will be heavily restricted.

In July, the NHS stated that it would be closing down the controversial Tavistock Centre, a gender identity clinic for children led by therapists and hormone specialists. Following an independent review, the gender dysphoria clinic received criticism for failing to collect data on puberty blockers and for taking an ""unquestioning affirmative approach"" to treating children with gender dysphoria.

Instead, the NHS will open two regional clinics based in specialist children's hospitals led by medical doctors who are experts ""in paediatric medicine, autism, neurodisability and mental health.""

The new clinics will follow guidelines that ""reflect evidence that in most cases gender incongruence does not persist into adolescence."" Therefore, the NHS recommended that medical professionals should consider that a child expressing gender dysphoria might only be going through a ""transient phase."" Doctors will be encouraged to take ""a watchful approach"" to monitor how a child's gender dysphoria develops.

Going forward, the NHS will no longer recommend that medical professionals urge children to change their names or pronouns. Instead, socially transitioning will be recommended only in cases in which the child ""is able to fully comprehend the implications of affirming a social transition"" and in which a social transition may likely prevent ""clinically significant distress.""

""The clinical approach has to be mindful of the risks of an inappropriate gender transition and the difficulties that the child may experience in returning to the original gender role upon entering puberty if the gender incongruence does not persist,"" the NHS report stated.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-tool-helping-those-with-prosthetic-arms-take-up-surfing,2022-10-24
"Nigel Farage unloads on Black Lives Matter movement, compares it to the Taliban. Outrage ensues.","Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage blasted the Black Lives Matter movement as ""dangerous,"" comparing it to the Taliban.

The U.K. has seen its own protests and riots in the days following the killing of George Floyd.

What are the details?

In a video on his YouTube channel, Farage said that the Black Lives Matter movement is ""Marxist,"" and its recent actions across the region have left him ""utterly appalled.""

Over the weekend, protesters defaced property and toppled a statue of Edward Colston, an English merchant, slave trader, former member of Parliament, and philanthropist.

""For the second day in a row, Winston Churchill's statue in Parliament Square [has] been defaced,"" he said. ""A mob around the statue screaming 'Churchill was a racist.' We saw another assault on the Cenotaph, this time with some yob climbing up there and trying to set fire with a cigarette lighter to the Union Flag. These were just some of the highlights from what happened in the United Kingdom.""

Farage also blasted the BBC for playing up to the Black Lives Matter movement, making it seem that its members are all ""so peaceful and so wonderful"" despite recent protests that saw scores of police officers injured.

""My argument here isn't against equality of opportunity,"" he said. ""It's not to say there aren't still things that aren't perfectly fair — but it is to say this, and to say it very, very clearly: This Black Lives Matter movement is a dangerous, Marxist organization, hell-bent on anarchy, and we need to wake up, get some facts into our heads, and understand what it is we're fighting.""

Farage pointed out that it seems one of the group's primary aims is to defund police forces.

""They want to effectively close down the established police force in the United States of America,"" he explained, ""and that's what the key activists in this country want to do as well.""

He also insisted that the group is looking to enact a ""radical redistribution of wealth.""

""This is a little bit like the 1917 Lenin manifesto which saw the communist revolution in Russia,"" the leader added. ""That's the kind of thing that we're dealing with here, and it's very heavily funded — they're not short of money; they've got some big backers, Soros, others … who want to fundamentally overturn the norms of society as we see them today.""

Say no to anarchy on our streets. www.youtube.com

What else?

On Tuesday, the panelists on ""Good Morning Britain"" addressed Farage's remarks, as well as the recent protests in the country.

Farage himself also appeared on a segment of the hit daytime TV show, where he hit back at co-host Piers Morgan and guest professor Kate Williams for their criticism of his remarks on Black Lives Matter.

He repeatedly insisted that the Black Lives Matter movement's ""chief aim is to defund and close down police forces.""

Morgan blasted Farage's remarks as ""incendiary"" and said that the Black Lives Matter movement should never be compared to the likes of the Taliban terrorist organization.

Williams spat, ""You are inciting racism, and this is outrageous.""

Attorney and activist Dr. Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, who also appeared on the Tuesday panel, voiced her outrage.

""You're full of such utter nonsense, Nigel Farage,"" she said. ""I understand that you're struggling to be relevant. The only thing you're an expert right now is your backside, because every word out of your mouth stinks.""

""BLM represents a fight against racism in this country,"" Mos-Shogbamimu insisted.

Now people are mad about 'Joker' because it features a popular song by a convicted pedophile,"""Joker"" is at the center of a brand-new controversy — this time surrounding music featured in one of the more pivotal scenes in the film.

The new Warner Bros. film faced harsh criticism before it even debuted, with people concerned about the feature of gun violence in the film, and later, security threats at screenings of the film. Warner Bros. eventually ended up restricting press access at the premiere event to photographers only.

Now, people are angry about the film because it features 75-year-old convicted pedophile Gary Glitter's popular ""Rock & Roll Part 2.""

CNBC reported that Glitter — who's real name is Paul Francis Gadd — could stand to make a substantial amount in royalties as a result of being featured in the hit film.

The film smashed box office records over the weekend, raking in $93.5 million in just the U.S., making it the highest debut for a film released in October in cinematic history. The film brought in $140.5 million worldwide over the weekend.

Here comes the outrage

Many social media users are crying out against the film for featuring the 1972 hit song.

Here are some of the more interesting responses below:

""Joker was brilliant. Loved every minute of it. Joaquin is a definite oscar contender after that. Maddest bit was Gary Glitter being on the soundtrack and in an integral scene. Couldn't get my head around it. People looking at each other like 'is this what I think it is?'""

""Surely the main talking point for the new #joker movie should be how Gary Glitter ended up on the soundtrack?!?""

""For the all the unease and tension that the #Joker stirs up... my British brothers and sisters are probably gonna be the most uncomfortable with Gary Glitter.""

""So I was gonna watch the joker but I discovered today they have used a Gary Glitter song of which he will receive revenue. If you are unaware who that is but have a conscience I'd suggest you google him before you decide to go the cinema.""

""Dancing with the Devil ... I will pass on paying to see #JokerMovie until they remove convicted pedophile Gary Glitter 's song or donate royalties from it to a child abuse charity. C'mon @wbpictures what the 'hell' were you thinking when you green lighted this flick?""

""Dancing with the Devil ... I will pass on paying to see until they remove convicted pedophile Gary Glitter 's song or donate royalties from it to a child abuse charity. C'mon what the 'hell' were you thinking when you green lighted this flick?"" ""A minor thing about Joker that's been overshadowed by, you know, everything else: a pivotal scene is prominently scored by Gary Glitter's Rock and Roll Part 2.""

More details about Gary Glitter

A British court convicted the musician in 1999 after downloading thousands of images of child pornography. He was also deported from Cambodia in 2002 on suspicions of child abuse, and jailed in Vietnam in 2006 for reportedly molesting two girls. In 2015, a court sentenced him to 16 years in prison for attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault, and one count of having sex with a child under the age of 13. The incidents all reportedly took place between 1975 and 1980.

According to The Sun, Glitter will receive a lump sum from the film for using the song. He will receive additional royalties based on how well the film performs in sales across all media.

However, The Music Royalty Co. tells Yahoo Movies U.K. that Gadd will be paid under a ""one-off"" fee.

""Artists are usually paid a one-off 'synchronization fee' when their songs are used on movie soundtracks,"" said Ray Bush, who is managing director of The Music Royalty Co.

""It can range from £500 (about $615 U.S.) for smaller acts up to £250,000-£500,000 ($307,000 to $615,000 U.S.), depending on the artist and the importance to the narrative of the film,"" Bush explained. ""There are many middlemen involved, including the record label, Glitter's agent and sometimes a 'synchronization' agent, with artists sometimes only receiving a measly amount from the deal.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nigel-farage-black-lives-matter-taliban,2019-10-08
Now they want to ban the sale of pointed kitchen knives in the UK to reduce knife crime. Brutal mockery follows.,"Crime experts, politicians, and religious leaders are calling on the U.K. government to ban the sale of pointed kitchen knives, KentOnline reported, to stem the tide of knife crime there, which has risen 80 percent since 2014.

Say what?



Following a Friday conference titled — what else? — The Point, experts penned an open letter urging the government to ""take urgent measures to promote the sale of safe kitchen knife designs and restrict those designs which have been used in so many acts of violence,"" the outlet said.

Research found that points on kitchen or domestic knives are no longer necessary, KentOnline said, citing the letter: ""Historically we needed a point on the end of our knife to pick up food because forks weren't invented. Now we only need the point to open packets when we can't be bothered to find the scissors.""

The letter added: ""A five-year study in Edinburgh found that of the sharp instruments used in homicides, 94% were kitchen knives. Research demonstrates kitchen knives are used in a large percentage of homicides due to their availability and lethal nature. Criminologists have demonstrated that reducing availability in turn reduces crime,"" the outlet said.

""The UK has worked for the public good by restricting handguns, paracetamol [a pain reliever], smoking in public and plastic bags — now it is time to say 'no bloody point,'"" the letter concluded, according to KentOnline.

How did folks react to the push to ban the sale of pointed kitchen knives?

As you might expect, Twitter users reacting to the news didn't exactly appreciate the experts' line of thinking:

""Does anyone want to invade the UK? Figure we only need maybe a few people at this point.""

""This is where Canada is headed under Trudeau and his Merry Band of Marxists.""

""It's NOT about safety it's about control!

""Next, banning pointed sticks.""

""They won't stop at guns, they won't stop until you are helpless.""

""Pretty soon they'll outlaw fists... It's a mental disorder.""

""I'm so old I remember when 'knife control' was a joke and not a thing that was under serious consideration.""

And when there's humor happening, Monty Python can't be far behind:

Oh, but there's more

The conference was part of a month of related initiatives, including the Knife Angel art installation at Rochester Cathedral, the outlet said. The Knife Angel statue is made of confiscated knives from police stations to raise awareness about the rising tide of knife crime.

The Knife Angel will remain at Rochester Cathedral until the end of September, KentOnline said, adding that over 5,000 visitors to the monument have signed a book pledging not to carry knives.

The cathedral also hosted a special service Saturday that reflected on knife crime, the outlet reported.

Bishop Simon Burton-Jones of Tonbridge told the assembled that ""knife crime rips up the lives of families and friends, piercing the networks that give us life, meaning, and support. Knife crime can be reduced if we follow the evidence trail, devote our resources to the right places, share knowledge smartly, and value the organizing power of local communities. The Church has a role to play, for it is located in most, if not all, places,"" the outlet said.

"On 'International Pronouns Day,' British police chief warns people against misgendering others: 'A form of abuse'","A British police chief filmed a social media video stressing the importance of recognizing ""International Pronouns Day,"" which apparently was Tuesday.

In the video, Deputy Chief Constable Julie Cooke explains the dangers of how misgendering someone is a ""form of abuse.""

What are the details?

In the video, Cooke says, ""Today is International Pronouns Day, which is a day particularly important to people who identify as transgender, or gender non-conforming.""

""Being misgendered can have a huge impact on somebody and their personal well-being,"" she warns. ""It also can be used as a form of abuse for somebody, and that just isn't right.""

""Today,"" Cooke concludes, ""is about raising awareness, getting people to have conversations, and understanding why it is so important to understand the pronouns that somebody wishes to be used for them. Have a good day.""

Anything else we ought to know?

Cooke's page on the Cheshire Constabulary website points out that LGBTQ activism is near and dear to her heart.

A portion of her biography reads, ""In June 2017, I was appointed the UK National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for the LGBT+ Portfolio. I am striving to ensure that all of our staff feel able to come to work and to be themselves; be honest about their lives outside of work, without fear of reprisals or attitudes they may face, but also that all staff are comfortable to ask appropriate questions and learn.""

""I also want members of the LGBT+ community to be able to walk through our communities knowing that they are safe and understood,"" Cooke's biography concludes.

Misgendering is apparently becoming rather serious business in the U.K.

Earlier in 2019, a British woman was arrested after misgendering a transgender activist.

Authorities charged Kate Scottow, a 38-year-old mother of two children, with ""malicious communications.""

Authorities detained and questioned Scottow for more than seven hours in connection with the incident. During the investigation, authorities took her photograph, DNA samples, and fingerprints. A court also banned her from referring to the transgender activist as a man.

After her arrest, Scottow took her story to the internet, where it went viral.

On online forum Mumsnet, Scottow wrote, ""I was arrested in my home by three officers, with my autistic ten-year-old daughter and breastfed 20-month-old son present. I was then detained for seven hours in a cell with no sanitary products (which I said I needed) before being interviewed then later released under investigation ... I was arrested for harassment and malicious communications because I called someone out and misgendered them on Twitter.""

Burger King's ironic tweet — 'Women belong in the kitchen' —  becomes a nuclear public relations nightmare,"An attempt to publicize a pro-woman campaign fell flat on its face when Burger King faced an online tsunami of outrage after attempting to twist a common sexist phrase.

Burger King announced a program meant to encourage and support women to seek culinary careers in order to combat the disproportionate gender representation in the restaurant industry.

They did that by tweeting this:

Feminists and others on the left instantly flew into a rage over the phrase often used to demean women.



But the tweet was followed up by two others that explained why the account was using the phrase in order to support women.

""If they want to, of course. Yet only 20% of chefs are women. We're on a mission to change the gender ratio in the restaurant industry by empowering female employees with the opportunity to pursue a culinary career,"" the account added in a second tweet.

We are proud to be launching a new scholarship programme which will help female Burger King employees pursue their culinary dreams!

— Burger King (@BurgerKingUK) March 8, 2021

""We are proud to be launching a new scholarship programme which will help female Burger King employees pursue their culinary dreams!"" they concluded.



Critics of the regal burger retailer ignored the explanation of their tweet and bashed them for using the sexist phrase, even if ironically.

""I think your agressive defense is ham-fisted at best. Your scholarship program is good, but the naked one-line tweet reiterating a sexist trope was a mistake. If women are telling you they are offended, who are you to say the tweet is not offensive?"" asked actress Mira Sorvino.

""Attempting to hit a funny sarcastic stride was maybe not the move for this? Especially with the funny sarcastic phrase being identical to the funny sarcastic phrase misogynists use - it doesn't take on a new meaning when you add a disclaimer after,"" responded Stef Sanjani, a video game streamer.



The company at first refused to back down and instead responded defensively against the criticism but later relented.

""We hear you. We got our initial tweet wrong and we're sorry. Our aim was to draw attention to the fact that only 20% of professional chefs in UK kitchens are women and to help change that by awarding culinary scholarships. We will do better next time,"" they tweeted.



They also deleted the original tweet.

"Oxford faculty may nix Homer's 'Iliad,' Virgil's 'Aeneid' from Classics syllabus to close 'attainment gaps' among students","The Classics faculty at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom is proposing to remove Homer's ""Iliad"" and Virgil's ""Aeneid"" from the early stages of study in order to close ""attainment gaps"" among students, according to the Oxford Student, a campus newspaper.

What are the details?

This proposal is part of a series of reforms aimed at modernizing the first stage of the Classics degree, known as Moderations (aka Mods), the Student said.

But the Mods — culminating with a set of 10 exams — has been increasingly criticized in recent years due to attainment gaps between male and female candidates, as well as between candidates who have studied Latin or Greek to the ""A-Level"" and those who have not, the paper noted.

More from the Oxford Student:

The removal of Virgil and Homer papers, which take up two out of the ten Mods papers, have been marketed as a move that will reduce the attainment gaps and thus improve access to the subject. However many have questioned why the solution to this problem involves the removal of Homer and Virgil.



There have been a number of other recent reforms proposed by the faculty, including changes to the way in which students are streamed based on previous levels of study as well as an increase in the amount of language tuition available to all Classicists. However, this most recent reform has accused of being an unnecessary step by members of the Classics faculty who claim that the removal of the compulsory study of Homer and Virgil would result in an incomplete and less fulfilling course of Classical study.

What did one Classics student have to say?

Jan Preiss, a second-year Classicist at New College, set up a petition against the proposal, the paper said.

""Removing Homer and Virgil would be a terrible and fatal mistake,"" Preiss told the Oxford Student. ""[The proposal] would mean that firstly, Oxford would be producing Classicists who have never read Homer and never read Virgil, who are the central authors of the Classical tradition, and most of Classical literature, in one way or another, looks back to Homer and interacts with the Iliad. Removing it would be a shame because Homer has been the foundation of the classical tradition since antiquity, and it is impossible to understand what comes after him without studying him first.""

What did a professor have to say?

Professor Jonathon Prag told the paper that no decision has been made on the proposal.

Oxford University allows students 'affected' by George Floyd death to apply for special consideration in exams,"Facing pressure to act in recent weeks, prestigious British college Oxford University said students ""affected"" by George Floyd's death in the United States can apply for special consideration in their exams, the Evening Standard reported.

What are the details?

Vice chancellor and professor Louise Richardson told students about the decision in an open letter signed by the heads of Oxford's colleges, the paper said.

Richardson thanked students for informing her about ""the traumatic effect of the brutality which killed George Floyd"" — which sparked protests and rioting and statue vandalism in the United States — and added that the incident was ""a manifestation of institutionalized racism,"" the Evening Standard added.

""Any student taking university assessments who feels their performance has been affected should submit a self-assessment mitigating circumstances form after their final examination or assessment,"" she wrote, the paper said.

In addition, the Evening Standard noted that Oxford's ""heads of house"" will alert tutors and welfare staff about the potential need for a workload cut and ""urge colleagues to reach out"" to those who apply for special consideration in exams.

Anything else?

Richardson also told the Oxford students' union that ""many departments in social sciences have begun work on making their curriculum more inclusive and adding diverse voices to it"" such as ""integrating race and gender questions into topics"" and ""embedding teaching on colonialism and empire into courses,"" the paper said.

"Ozzy Osbourne moving back to England, says everything in the US is 'f***ing ridiculous'","Rock star Ozzy Osbourne criticized the United States and said that that he was moving back to England after more than two decades living in Los Angeles, California.

Osbourne made the comments in an interview with the Guardian.

""Everything’s f***ing ridiculous there,"" said Osbourne. ""I’m fed up with people getting killed every day. God knows how many people have been shot in school shootings. And there was that mass shooting in Vegas at that concert… It’s f***ing crazy.""

The iconic rocker has had severe health issues and underwent surgery in June. He was raised in Birmingham, England, and is 73 years old.

""I don’t want to die in America,"" he explained. ""I’m English. I want to be back.""

His wife, Sharon Osbourne had similar comments.

Fauci says another COVID-19 surge in the US is unlikely,"White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Biden and Trump administrations' leading voice during the pandemic, said Tuesday that he does not anticipate another major surge of COVID-19 cases in the United States.

""I would not be surprised at all, if we do see somewhat of an uptick,"" Fauci said during a Washington Post live event. ""The extent of it and the degree to which it impacts seriousness of disease like hospitalizations and death remains to be seen. I don't really see, unless something changes dramatically, that there would be a major surge.""

Fauci made those comments in answer to a question about whether the emergence of the BA.2 Omicron subvariant in the U.K. and other parts of Europe would cause a viral surge in the United States. He said that the U.S. has generally followed patterns observed across the sea, and that the increasing dominance of the BA.2 variant, loosening restrictions on face-masks, and waning immunity are all factors America has in common with Europe.

""What the UK is not seeing‑‑and that's the good news‑‑is an increase of severity or an increase in the use of intensive care unit beds or an increase in the all‑cause mortality, which means that despite the fact that there are cases going up, there does not appear to be any increase in the degree of severity of the outbreak,"" Fauci said. ""So, hopefully, when we do‑‑and I think it will be that we do‑‑see an uptick, hopefully, it won't be accompanied by an increase in hospitalizations, but it just remains to be seen.""

When asked whether policy makers would have the political will to reimpose coronavirus restrictions if that became necessary, Fauci gave a candid answer, predicting there would be resistance.

""I don't think there's much stomach for people to all of a sudden turn around, even if there is an uptick. I think that the desire to continue to go along in a way that is normal, as it were, I think there's going to be a lot of inertia, if not active pushback in people. If it is required to increase or go back to some of the mitigation, I think it's going to be a tough time convincing people to do that.""

He added that the government may try to appeal to people who are at ""high-risk"" from the virus to be ""prudent"" and follow the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations in the event of another surge.

""But that's all hypothesis. We don't know. Hopefully, we will not be put into that position, but if we are, we should be willing to and flexible enough to respond,"" Fauci said.



Still, that does not mean the pandemic is over, according to Fauci.

“We can’t claim absolute victory at this point. They’re still viral dynamics. We still have a highly transmissible virus among us, particularly the BA.2 which has a greater degree of transmissibility than an already highly transmissible BA.1, which is the original omicron. So the advice is proceed with life as normally as you possibly can, but be prepared that we might need to make modifications if things change,” Fauci said.

He also called on Congress to be prepared to pass additional COVID-19 relief and funding that will ""prepare us for the next challenge.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has made known her desire for Congress to pass an additional $45 billion for oral antiviral treatments, monoclonal antibody therapies and other pre-exposure prophylaxis, COVID-19 testing programs, new vaccine research, and global vaccination programs.

New Pentagon 'diversity and inclusion' officer once compared Trump to Hitler — using a photoshopped image,"A newly hired Defense Department officer charged with promoting diversity and inclusion within military ranks once compared former President Donald Trump to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler on social media.

What are the details?

The United States Special Operations Command, a division of the Defense Department that oversees the various special operations components of the U.S. armed forces, announced last week that it had appointed Richard Torres-Estrada as its first-ever ""Diversity and Inclusion"" chief.

In a post on Instagram announcing the hire, USSOCOM wrote that ""Torres-Estrada has nearly two decades worth of experience working diversity and inclusion programs and activities in federal agencies"" and now ""will guide the enterprise-wide effort to institutionalize and sustain [diversity and inclusion]"" at the command.

""We look forward to Mr. Torres-Estrada's contribution in enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of [special forces operations] through diversity of talent, helping us recruit the best of the best,"" USSOCOM added.



But shortly after the announcement was posted, past controversial social media posts published by Torres-Estrada began to circulate online.

One such post, published on Facebook last June, featured a side-by-side picture of Trump and Hitler, both appearing to hold a Bible.

""Here I leave this and slowly retire (to continue working from home)..."" Torres-Estrada wrote as a caption to the post, insinuating a comparison between the two.

Remarkably, the new diversity chief didn't think to verify the accuracy of the post before sharing it. The image of Hitler has since been discredited as fact-checkers confirmed the Bible was photoshopped into the original image.

Commenting on the news during his show Friday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson blasted Torres-Estrada and the Pentagon's decision to hire him.

The proposal appears to be aimed at funneling the aircraft to Ukraine as that country seeks to repel Russian invaders — but the U.S. has indicated that it is not on board.

""The authorities of the Republic of Poland, after consultations between the President and the Government, are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,"" the statement of Poland's minister of foreign affairs declared.



""At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes. The Polish Government also requests other NATO Allies – owners of MIG-29 jets – to act in the same vein,"" the statement added.



U.S. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby poured cold water on Poland's plan, saying that it is not ""tenable.""



""The prospect of fighter jets ""at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America"" departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby said in a statement. ""It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it. We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland's proposal is a tenable one.""

According to Reuters, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Tuesday that ""any decisions on delivering offensive weapons have to be taken by the entire NATO and on a unanimous basis.""

""This is why we are ready to give all of our fleet of jet fighters to Ramstein, but we are not ready to make any moves on our own because, as I said, we are not party to this war,"" Morawiecki said, according to the outlet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pentagon-new-diversity-inclusion-officer-trump-hitler,2022-03-09
"After 55,000 people show support, a new 'period emoji' will soon be released to destigmatize menstruation","A ""period emoji"" will be included in the upcoming release of new smartphone images, after nearly 55,000 people weighed in to support a campaign aimed at destigmatizing menstruation.

What are the details?

Children's rights charity Plan International UK launched the campaign for a period emoji after conducting a 2017 survey ""and discovered just how much shame and stigma still impact girls' and women's experiences of having their period."" The organization created five designs, and 55,000 people voted on which one they liked best.

The winning image was dubbed ""period pants."" Plan International UK submitted it to the emoji powers-that-be at Unicode, but ""sadly, the design didn't get accepted."" Undeterred, Plan International UK partnered with NHS Blood and Transplant and submitted its second-place design — the blood droplet — which was accepted.

Lucy Russell, head of girls' rights and youth at Plan International UK, issued a statement celebrating the period emoji's acceptance:

""For years we've obsessively silenced and euphemized periods. As experts in girls' rights, we know that this has a negative impact on girls; girls feel embarrassed to talk about their periods, they're missing out, and they can suffer health implications as a consequence.

""The inclusion of an emoji...is a huge step toward normalizing periods and smashing the stigma which surrounds them,"" Russell added. ""An emoji isn't going to solve this, but it can help change the conversation. Ending the shame around periods begins with talking about it.""









Yahoo Style UK reported that the online reaction to the new e-sticker has been mixed, ranging from social media users calling it ""wonderful news"" to ""disgusting.""

Anything else?

Along with the blood droplet symbol, Unicode is rolling out another 58 emojis in March. Several are focused on ending stigmas against people with disabilities, such as wheelchair emojis and an ear with a hearing aid. A handful of new food images are also included, like a waffle and a beverage box.

Another new emoji raising eyebrows is the so-called ""pinching hand,"" which is already being referred to online as the ""small penis emoji.""

"Pfizer says its new COVID-19 pill cuts risk of hospitalization and death among high-risk patients by 89%, will file for FDA authorization by Thanksgiving","Pfizer hyped its experimental antiviral pill that treats COVID-19 on Friday. The drug maker announced that the pill – Paxlovid – reduced hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients by 89% in clinical trials.

Pfizer's drug – known as PF-07321332 – is a SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor antiviral therapy that is ingested. PF-07321332 blocks an enzyme that the virus needs to replicate. Pfizer's ingestable COVID-19 treatment is coadministered with a low dose of ritonavir – an older antiviral medication commonly used in treatments for HIV. Ritonavir ""helps slow the metabolism, or breakdown, of PF-07321332 in order for it to remain active in the body for longer periods of time at higher concentrations to help combat the virus,"" Pfizer said.

Pfizer's trial featured 1,219 unvaccinated high-risk adults who were infected with COVID-19. Within three days of symptom onset, the study's participants were given a Paxlovid pill or a placebo every 12 hours for five days.

The trial found that 0.8% of the 607 people who were given Paxlovid were hospitalized compared with 7% of the 612 patients who were given a dummy pill. None of the people who were given the COVID-19 pill died, and there were 10 deaths among the participants who received the placebo.

Pfizer said the trial was stopped early because the effect was so impressive and that it would soon attempt to get the COVID-19 pill approved by the FDA.

""At the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee and in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pfizer will cease further enrollment into the study due to the overwhelming efficacy demonstrated in these results and plans to submit the data as part of its ongoing rolling submission to the U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) as soon as possible,"" Pfizer said.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC that the drug maker plans to submit authorization filing to the Food and Drug Administration before Thanksgiving.

In a statement, Bourla said, ""Today's news is a real game-changer in the global efforts to halt the devastation of this pandemic.""

""These data suggest that our oral antiviral candidate, if approved or authorized by regulatory authorities, has the potential to save patients' lives, reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections, and eliminate up to nine out of ten hospitalizations,"" Bourla said.

Annaliesa Anderson – chief scientific officer for Pfizer's hospitals business unit – said, ""We are really over the moon that we did see such high efficacy in this study. It has tremendous implications for patients globally.""

Bloomberg reported, ""In a third large trial, Pfizer is exploring if the drug could be used as a prophylactic medicine for people who live with someone who has come down with COVID-19, meaning a person would take the drug to avoid contracting the virus.""



The outlet added that a Pfizer spokesperson said the company is looking to produce more than 180,000 units of the drug by the end of this year and at least 50 million packs by the end of 2022.

Pfizer has not indicated how much the COVID-19 pill would cost.

Pfizer's announcement of a COVID-19 pill arrives one day after the U.K. approved an oral treatment for coronavirus by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Merck's COVID-19 pill – branded as Lagevrio – uses the drug molnupiravir to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus to prevent it from multiplying. Patients who received molnupiravir within five days of COVID-19 symptoms had about a 50% decrease in the rate of hospitalization and death.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/period-emoji-destigmatize-menstruation,2021-11-05
'It's nonsense': Piers Morgan blasts policy replacing 'breastfeeding' with 'chestfeeding' in transgender-inclusive effort at UK hospital,"UK talk-show host Piers Morgan tore into a transgender-inclusive policy that instructs midwives at one hospital to say ""chestfeeding"" instead of ""breastfeeding"" among other language changes.

What did he say?

Morgan — who's famously against political correctness — piped up on Wednesday's episode of ""Good Morning Britain"" to take issue with the story he saw reported on the front page of the Times.

""Midwives have been told to refer to 'chestfeeding' rather than 'breastfeeding' and replace the term 'mother' with 'birthing parent,'"" Morgan said before reading a Twitter user's post that said, ""I'm transgender myself, and Morgan is 100 percent correct. This isn't what the majority of transpeople ask for, and it hinders our rights, not helps us.""

Morgan continued: ""That's my point ... I want transgender people to have respect and dignity and equality. I don't think you get there by telling midwives to stop using the term 'breastfeeding' because it may upset a few people when 99% of the people in there are breastfeeding. It's nonsense, and this kind of PC-cop nonsense with the language ... it has the opposite effect to what you think it does. It annoys people ... it doesn't bring you any inclusivity. It becomes exclusive; it alienates people.""

Here's the clip:

What else do we know about the policy?

According to the Times, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust is the first in the country to formally implement such a policy for its maternity services department, which now will be called ""perinatal services.""



Staff also have to been told to replace ""breastmilk"" with the terms ""human milk,"" ""breast/chestmilk,"" or ""milk from the feeding mother or parent,"" the paper said.

Other language changes include replacing ""woman"" with ""woman or person"" and ""father"" with ""parent,"" ""co-parent,"" or ""second biological parent,"" depending on the circumstances, the Times reported.

What else has Morgan said?

Morgan is a classical liberal who highly values free speech and takes issue with those who try to squelch it — but he appears to have a special place in his heart for those who tout politically correct language.

In 2019, Morgan made big headlines when he lampooned the arrival of a gender-neutral penguin at London's Sea Life, which prompted the ""Good Morning Britain"" co-host to announce that he was now identifying as a ""two-spirit penguin"" — a reference to a ""two-spirit person"" as one of 100 genders.

Afterward, the UK's communications regulator got almost 1,000 complaints from viewers over Morgan's jab — but he was eventually cleared as the regulator, Ofcom, wouldn't investigate him.

Also in 2019, Morgan appeared on a Sunday program hosted by the Daily Wire's Ben Shapiro and ripped fellow liberals who've ""become utterly, pathetically illiberal"" and have embraced a ""version of fascism.""

And back in 2017 when violent, left-wing protests broke out over conservatives giving speeches on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, leading the school to cancel conservative commentator and author Ann Coulter's speech over security concerns, Morgan hit back in a Daily Mail column saying that while Coulter is ""a woman whose opinions I love to hate,"" UC Berkeley was way off base.

He wrote that the ""truth about many modern liberals is that they don't believe in free speech at all"" except ""if people agree with them."" He added that if liberals ""don't like what they're hearing, they scream and shout, punch and kick, petrol bomb and stab, and furiously demand the offender be silenced and banned.""

""This dramatic shift in liberal behavior from peaceful protest to violent hateful censorship is a vile, virulent virus that first infected vast swathes of America intelligentsia and has now spread across to my own country, Britain,"" Morgan added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pfizer-covid-pill-trial-results,2021-02-10
Piers Morgan blasts American-born royal Meghan Markle for going MIA during Trump state visit: 'Shameful',"Piers Morgan, former CNN host and current ""Good Morning Britain"" anchor, blasted Meghan Markle for not making an appearance during President Donald Trump's state visit.



Last week, Trump was in the U.K. to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day. You can read more about the visit here.

What did Morgan say?

In a lengthy editorial published on the Daily Mail, Morgan said that it was highly inappropriate for Markle, an American-born entertainer who married Prince Harry in 2018, to avoid Trump during the state visit.

""Where was Meghan Markle?"" Morgan wrote. ""That's the question nobody seems to want to ask after President Donald Trump's week-long state visit to the U.K.""

""She's the only American in the British royal family, and the leader of HER country was here in her adopted country as a guest of Her Majesty the Queen,"" Morgan continued. ""Yet as virtually every other senior royal, including her husband Prince Harry, was seen on parade to welcome President Trump, there was no sign at all of the Duchess of Sussex.""

Morgan went on to point out that Markle, who gave birth to a child in May, purportedly remained at her home, Frogmore Cottage, in Windsor, and said that she opted to remain home with the couple's child.

""[T]he moment Trump had gone, Meghan suddenly popped up at the Trooping of the Colour, in an open-top carriage, looking in radiant good health and with a permanently beaming grin,"" he continued.

""[C]all me suspicious, but I don't think her absence from Trump's visit had anything to do with her baby, and everything to do with her dislike of the president,"" the commentator added, calling it ""unacceptable"" and ""not part of the deal.""

He continued, ""Royal events don't get a lot bigger than a state visit by the President of the United States,"" and pointed out that only three U.S. presidents have ever embarked on a state visit, including former President George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Trump.



""This was a very big deal for the royals and for the president,"" Morgan wrote.

""[W]e all know why she did it — she hates Trump with a passion, and views him, as she once said on TV, as a 'divisive misogynist,'"" he went on. ""[M]y firm guess is that she deliberately snubbed Trump because she was absolutely terrified of being photographed with him and looking like she may be enjoying his company — rather than clubbing him over the head with a giant hammer.""

Instead, Morgan wrote, Markle wasn't just ""giving the metaphorical bird to Trump,"" but she also gave it to the queen.

He concluded, ""As the only American among the royals, Meghan Markle should have been there to greet the President and his family on behalf of her fellow Americans.""

""By staying at home, then turning up all bright and cheerful the moment Trump left,"" he countered, ""she displayed a woefully selfish disregard for royal duty.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/piers-morgan-blasts-breastfeeding-chestfeeding-language,2019-06-10
"Piers Morgan blasts 'disrespectful' British anti-Trump protesters: 'When we needed the Americans in World War II, they were there for us'","Piers Morgan, former CNN host and current ""Good Morning Britain"" anchor, blasted protesters demonstrating President Donald Trump's visit to the U.K.

Trump arrived in England Monday for a state visit to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day. You can read more about the visit here.

What did he say?

During Monday's broadcast of ""Good Morning Britain,"" Morgan spoke out against the hundreds of thousands of protesters across London, calling them ""disrespectful"" and the protests unnecessary.

""I think, actually, indeed, they ... are a little bit disrespectful to be waving baby balloons all around the place at the President of the United States,"" he explained. ""When we needed the Americans in World War II, they were there for us.""

""And if our response [to that country] is to have bigger protests against the leader of United States, than it ever was against the leader of Saudi Arabia ... or China ... or Russia ... There's something a bit warped about our values,"" Morgan said.

Should President Trump's State Visit Be Protested? | Good Morning Britain www.youtube.com

""Is Trump really worse than Putin or King Salman?"" he later asked during another portion of the show.

""Americans fought and died alongside us on D-Day,"" he added.

Trump's visit coincides with the 75th anniversary of D-Day.

More than 20,000 police officers are expected to be stationed at more than 20 locations across the U.K. during the president's visit. The Daily Mail reports that the patrolling effort will cost about $23 million.

The outlet also reports that protesters plan to pilot a 20-foot blimp depicting Trump as an ""angry baby,"" as well as deploy at 16-foot robot featuring the likeness of the U.S. president sitting on a gold toilet.

"Piers Morgan cleared by UK regulator after nearly 1,000 complaints pour in after he made fun of gender-neutral penguin","Piers Morgan — co-host of ""Good Morning Britain"" — has been speaking out strongly of late against left-wing ideology.

Last month, he blasted the co-founder of radical climate crisis group Extinction Rebellion as a hypocrite for not reducing her ""own carbon footprint"" while telling others to do so and tore into an Extinction Rebellion protester who was dressed as, er, broccoli.

And in August he appeared on a Sunday program hosted by The Daily Wire's Ben Shapiro and ripped fellow liberals who've ""become utterly, pathetically illiberal"" and have embraced a ""version of fascism.""

Now what?

In that vein, Morgan apparently had it up to here during a September GMB broadcast that featured the arrival of a gender-neutral penguin at London's Sea Life, which prompted Morgan to announce that he was now identifying as a ""two-spirit penguin"" — a reference to a ""two-spirit person"" as one of 100 genders, Metro UK reported.

""What are you doing to these kids? What's a two-spirit person? What's wrong with male and female out of interest?"" he asked, the outlet said. ""I'm a penguin. Identifying as a two spirit penguin. Everyone happy with that?""

Oh boy.

As you might expect, the woke crowd didn't take too kindly to Morgan's jab at gender-neutrality, and the outlet said Ofcom — the UK's communications regulator — received almost 1,000 complaints from viewers over the host's jab.

Not to worry

Well, Metro UK noted in a follow-up piece that Morgan was cleared this week and that Ofcom wouldn't investigate him — which amused the host greatly, as he read the findings on-air.

""Thank you, Ofcom, and thank you to those who complained — you have empowered me,"" he said relaying the news, the outlet reported. ""That's going to hurt, right?""

Morgan added, ""Personally quite pleased about that. I love complaining,"" Metro UK said.

Although he noted the Ofcom statement indicated his swipe ""came close to ridicule of those with a particular characteristic with the potential to offend some viewers.""

The outlet added that Morgan also said ""it's not transphobic to think that 100 genders is ridiculous. One of these 100 is called astra something, it means your gender is an identification with the moon and the stars. If that's your gender, I'm allowed to be a two-spirit gender. That's how it works.""

More from Metro UK:

Continuing to gloat in his glory, Piers said: ""Thank you Ofcom for showing a bit of common sense. My thing with this is everything is having to be changed to cater to a very small number of people, and very few people know what these are and my thing is, I don't think that's the correct way to do this.""



He added: ""These things have to be discussed without the hysterical Twitter mob saying cancel him.""

Piers Morgan savagely eats juicy steak while interviewing vegan protester: 'I love eating steak',"Piers Morgan recently interviewed a vegan activist while eating a delicious steak.

On the latest episode of his show ""Piers Morgan Uncensored,"" Morgan interviewed a vegan activist whose group, Animal Rebellion, protested inside the Nusr-Et Steakhouse in London, which is owned by the Turkish restauranteur known as ""Salt Bae.""

The broader points that Morgan sought to address were the nutrition side effects of abandoning animal products and why aggressive vegan protesters think intentionally interrupting restaurants is acceptable. The interview, however, immediately went off the rails.

""I don’t like vegans very much. I don’t think any of you are very healthy,"" Morgan told Animal Rebellion spokesperson Nathan McGovern.

""I’m not surprised by that, Piers,"" McGovern responded.

""I think you all look pretty pasty-faced and unhealthy to me. But that’s your choice,"" Morgan fired back. ""What I don’t do is I don’t go running into vegan restaurants and start screaming abuse at you all and have to be pulled out by people because you’re ruining everyone’s fun. Why do you do that to meat eaters?""

Later, Morgan added, ""[Vegan protesters] have no respect for meat eaters. But if we were doing the same thing to them, they'd all go nuts. ... If I came into your little vegan hellholes and began screaming abuse, you'd all throw your toys out of the pram, as you do on a daily basis.""

McGovern, however, defended his group's actions, but could not explain how its tactics will persuade other people to go vegan.

Then one of Morgan's production crew members brought him a plate of steak.

""You see, all you’ve achieved is — you’ve made me want to do this,"" Morgan said as he ate a piece of a medium-rare steak.

""That’s absolutely fine. You go for it,"" McGovern responded.

""But here’s my point: I love eating steak. I’m not gonna stop eating steak. And the very last thing on earth that will stop me eating steak is people like you with your pasty faces running into our restaurants, telling us to stop eating steak,"" Morgan said.

"Piers Morgan storms off set of his morning show over Meghan Markle comments, and then quits the show altogether","Piers Morgan stormed off the set of the morning show he co-hosted and then quit the show altogether over outrage at his comments against Meghan Markle.

Viewers of ""Good Morning Britain"" registered their outrage with Morgan after he said that he didn't trust what Markle said during her controversial interview with Oprah Winfrey about contemplating suicide.

On Tuesday's episode of the show, co-host Alex Beresford took him to task for the comments and noted that Morgan's animus could have come from being previously rejected as Markle's paramour.

""I understand that you don't like Meghan Markle, you've made it so clear a number of times on this program. And I understand that you've got a personal relationship with Meghan Markle, or had one and she cut you off,"" said Beresford.

""Has she said anything about you since she cut you off? I don't think she has, but yet you continue to trash her,"" he continued.

Morgan got up and walked off the show at that point.

""Okay, I'm done with this, sorry, no, sorry,"" said Morgan. ""See you later, sorry, can't do this.""

""This is absolutely diabolical behavior!"" said Beresford after Morgan walked out.

Morgan tweeted later about the exchange.

""I just prefer not to sit there listening to colleagues call me diabolical,"" he wrote.

Morgan's comments were under investigation by Ofcom, the communications regulator for Great Britain, which said that they had received over 40,000 complaints registered against him.

Soon after, ITV said in a brief statement that Morgan had left the show permanently.

""Following discussions with ITV, Piers Morgan has decided now is the time to leave Good Morning Britain,"" ITV said. ""ITV has accepted this decision and has nothing further to add.""

Morgan later elaborated on his comments and made it clear that mental illness and suicide are serious issues that shouldn't be treated lightly.

He had previously been investigated and cleared by Ofcom over comments he made in Nov. 2019 mocking a ""gender-neutral penguin"" at London's Sea Life exhibit. The media regulator received over 1,000 complaints about his politically incorrect statement.

Piers Morgan rips into 'hypocritical' climate activist and her 'own carbon footprint' issues: 'Why don't you practice what you preach?,"British television host Piers Morgan earlier this week blasted a climate activism leader as a hypocrite for not reducing her ""own carbon footprint"" while telling others to do so.

The ""Good Morning Britain"" host targeted Skeena Rathor, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion — a radical, left-wing outfit that's been staging demonstrations in the U.K. to force attention on climate change.

What was said during the segment?

Morgan began by asking Rathor how she got to the studio — to which she replied that the station sent a car to pick her up.

""Do you have a TV at home?"" Morgan pressed.

Rathor was clearly taken off guard, speaking with a halting voice while completely sidestepping the question.

Morgan continued to query the activist, who said his question was ""not relevant to the planet's emergency.""

Here's the meat of Morgan's point:

Do your kids use iPads or computers — yes or no? Can you answer these questions? Do you have air conditioning? Do they have it in their schools? Do you walk your kids to school? ... You see the problem with all this. You go on about ""my kids can't get out of bed because they're all so terrified"" — I'm not surprised they're terrified 'cause [their] mom's telling them every day that the planet's about to end, and yet I bet your own carbon footprint on all the stuff I've just mentioned is terrible.



So why don't you give your computer, give up your television, give up your air conditioning, walk your kids to school, get a bike to the studio? Why don't you practice what you preach?""

'Really not about individual carbon footprints'

Rathor defended herself and other climate activists by saying ""it's really not about individual carbon footprints"" but that climate change is a ""systems-wide issue,"" and everyone is stuck in it. She's just trying to ""raise the alarm"" from within the system, Rathor said — and couldn't do so, after all, if she lived off the grid in the woods.

Morgan still harped on Rathor and others like her who lead ""completely hypocritical lives. If you genuinely believe the planet's about to end, start with you're own carbon footprint ... you do one thing, and you say another.""

Piers Morgan refuses to back down over Meghan Markle criticisms despite UK agency launching investigation,"Piers Morgan said Tuesday that he will not apologize for expressing doubt about claims from Meghan Markle that she experienced suicidal thoughts after joining Britain's royal family.

Morgan's defiant response comes after the United Kingdom's regulatory agency governing telecommunications in Britain launched an investigation into ""Good Morning Britain"" over Morgan's comments.

How did Morgan respond?

After officially quitting ""Good Morning Britain"" on Tuesday after being ridiculed by his co-hosts for not believing Markle, Morgan said he will not apologize.

""On Monday, I said I didn't believe Meghan Markle in her Oprah interview. I've had time to reflect on this opinion, and I still don't. If you did, OK. Freedom of speech is a hill I'm happy to die on,"" Morgan tweeted.

""Thanks for all the love, and hate. I'm off to spend more time with my opinions,"" he added.

What is the background?

Morgan incited controversy on Monday while reacting to Markle's interview with Oprah Winfrey, when he doubted Markle's claim that her struggles with mental health were dismissed by the royal family.

""I'm sorry, I don't believe a word she says,"" Morgan said Monday on ""Good Morning Britain.""

When a co-host expressed dismay over Morgan's reaction, he doubled down. ""I wouldn't believe her if she read me a weather report, and the fact that she's fired up this onslaught against our royal family, I think is contemptible,"" Morgan said.

Ofcom, the U.K. media regulator, revealed Tuesday it had opened an investigation into Morgan's comments after fielding more than 40,000 complaints.

""We have launched an investigation into Monday's episode of 'Good Morning Britain' under our harm and offence rules,"" the agency told Variety.

Why did Morgan quit?

The TV host stormed off the stage of ""Good Morning Britain"" on Tuesday after his co-hosts confronted him about his opinions.

ITV, the network that hosts ""Good Morning Britain,"" later released a statement:

Following discussions with ITV, Piers Morgan has decided now is the time to leave Good Morning Britain. ITV has accepted this decision and has nothing further to add.

Prior to leaving the show, Morgan explained that he did not believe Markle generally, but specifically her claim that members of the royal family dismissed her mental health struggles because of negative optics.

Morgan clarified that he was not dismissing mental health struggles altogether.

""When we talked about this yesterday, I said, as an all-encompassing thing, I don't believe what Meghan Markle is saying generally in this interview and I still have serious concerns about the veracity of a lot of what she said,"" Morgan said.

""But let me just state for the record on my position on mental illness and on suicide. These are clearly extremely serious things and should be taken extremely seriously and if someone is feeling that way they should get the treatment and the help they need every time,"" he continued. ""And if they belong to an institution like the royal family and they go and seek that help they should absolutely be given it.""

""It's not for me to question if she felt suicidal, I am not in her mind and that is for her to say,"" Morgan added. ""My real concern was a disbelief frankly ... that she went to a senior member of the royal household and told them she was suicidal and was told she could not have any help because it would be a bad look for the family.""

""If that is true a) that person should be fired and b) the royal family have serious questions that need to be answered,"" Morgan said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/piers-morgan-rips-into-hypocritical-climate-activist,2021-03-10
"Police storm family home, mistakenly arrest 12-year-old for toy gun. Mom plans to sue.","A British mother plans to sue the Metropolitan Police after officers stormed her home and arrested her 12-year-old son after he was seen with a toy gun.

A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police, however, says he reviewed the incident and believes the officers worked professionally and well within their scope of duties.

What are the details?

Alice Mina Agyepong, 42, said that she was napping in her home last week when ""dozens of officers"" raided her Camden, England, home and took her 12-year-old son, Kai, into custody.

According to the Evening Standard, a passerby reportedly phoned police after seeing the child with a toy gun in his living room.

When officers arrived in Agyepong's home, they handcuffed the terrified child and arrested him.

When it was clear that the officers made a mistake, they removed the cuffs and released the 12-year-old.

Agyepong, who is black, said that the police racially profiled her son, who has never been in trouble with the law.

""I'd fallen asleep on the sofa and Kai was next to me on the laptop,"" she said. ""There was this loud knock at the door and they were shouting 'Armed police, get your hands up!' Kai opened the door and was handcuffed.""

Agyepong said her two daughters ran down the stairs to discover the source of the fracas.

""I could see the little red laser lights from the police guns on my children,"" she recalled. ""I just tried to keep them all calm because I was scared one of them was going to get hurt. We had to walk slowly out of the house with our hands up.""

The outlet reported that Agyepong and her daughters ""were made to stand in a neighboring road in their nightclothes for more than an hour"" while police and their sniffer dogs scoured Agyepong's three-story home for a firearm. Kai was forced into the back of a police van during the search.

The only gun investigators turned up was Kai's plastic pellet gun.

'What must the neighbors have thought?'

Agyepong, who is a housing association governance officer, launched a complaint with the department accusing it of racial profiling. The outlet reports that the case has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

Agyepong said that her son never even saw an actual firearm until that evening.

""What must the neighbors have thought?"" she said. ""It was humiliating. Kai is trying to put on a brave face, but he is embarrassed. This shouldn't be happening to any innocent person, let alone a child his age.""



Kai told the outlet that frightening ordeal was painful.

""The handcuffs really hurt, and I asked them to loosen them but they wouldn't, and I had marks around my wrists when I took them off,"" he recalled. ""They arrested me for having a firearm, and I told them 'I don't have a gun' and I've never seen a proper gun in real life before.""

In a statement, a spokesperson for the department said, ""A male in the property was arrested on suspicion of a possession of a firearm and taken into a police van. Officers found an item which was identified as a toy 'BB' gun and not a firearm. The officers de-arrested the youth and he and the other members of his family returned into their address. A senior officer contacted the teenager's mother to discuss her concerns.""

'We take every report of a firearm seriously'

A spokesperson for the department told the BBC that the department's ""most senior firearms officer"" is ""content"" with the way the search on Agyepong's home was carried out.

Commander Kyle Gordon insisted that the officers were nothing but professional throughout the entire ordeal.

He also said that the department takes seriously any incidents of reports of firearms possession in the area.

""There have been a number of well-publicized shootings in London in recent months where members of the public have been injured, and as the public would rightly expect we take every report of a firearm seriously in order to protect our communities,"" Gordon said.

""I have personally watched body-worn video of the incident, and whilst I can understand concerns in terms of how the incident has been reported in some quarters, I am content from what I have seen that the officers were professional throughout and took time to explain to the residents what was happening and why,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/piers-morgan-uk-agency-investigating-markle-criticisms,2020-07-28
Police billboard warns UK citizens that 'being offensive' is against the law — and the backlash is brutal,"A photo of a billboard displayed on a street by Merseyside Police in the United Kingdom has been getting a good bit of attention.

Meant to show solidarity with the LGBTQ community and encourage people to report hate crimes, the banner warned citizens that ""being offensive is an offence,"" Metro reported.

What was the reaction?

After the photo of the banner hit Twitter over the weekend, folks hit back — hard:

""Utterly chilling,"" one commenter wrote. ""In a free society the right to be offensive is fundamental. This isn't North Korea!""

Others reacted similarly:

""Being offensive is NOT an offence,"" another user wrote, ""despite your nonsense corrupted interpretation of hate crime laws, sometimes in debate you may offend people who are easily offended ... that is NOT a crime ... it's debate, and it's time you stopped the bloody overreach.""

""I'm a gay man, and I don't appreciate this kind of heavy-handed intimidation telling people how to speak and think,"" another user said. ""[P]eoples' minds change through dialogue ... not by you telling people what they can say.""

""I'm a gay man, and I don't appreciate this kind of heavy-handed intimidation telling people how to speak and think,"" another user said. ""[P]eoples' minds change through dialogue ... not by you telling people what they can say."" ""According to your van, being 'offensive' is actually a crime — and there's a big man with a stick to get the message across,"" another user said. ""Do you actually understand freedom of speech as a right in this country?""

""This is a catastrophe. I'm gay, and I spent a chunk of my childhood living in Bromborough. You've harmed gay people with this crap because it looks like we're demanding special treatment,"" another commenter noted. ""It's a horrible look. Just get back to proper policing.""

And we can always count on British TV host Piers Morgan to properly lampoon governmental attempts to regulate speech, and he blasted police for the billboard on ""Good Morning Britain"":

What happened next?

Soon after the backlash hit, Merseyside Police apologized for the message conveyed on the billboard.

""We would like to clarify that 'being offensive' is not in itself an 'offense,'"" Superintendent Martin Earl noted in a Monday statement, adding that although ""well-intentioned,"" the message ""was incorrect, and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused.""

Earl still emphasized that ""hate crime is an offence and will not be tolerated"" and ""can come in various guises that can include assault, criminal damage, verbal, and written online abuse.""

Anything else?

U.K. free speech and hate crime law differ from American law. According to the Daily Mail, ""general offensive comments are not crimes"" across the pond. In addition, a hate crime perpetrator must be ""motivated by hostility or demonstrating hostility toward the victim"" based on the victim's ""protected characteristics"" (e.g., disability, race, religion, sexual orientation, or transgender identity), the outlet added.

More from the Daily Mail:

A hate crime can include verbal abuse, intimidation, threats, harassment, assault and bullying, as well as damage to property. The perpetrator can also be a friend, carer, or acquaintance who exploits their relationship with the victim for financial gain or some other criminal purpose.



However, even comments that do not qualify as hate crimes can be logged by police as ""non-crime hate incidents.""



Reports of non-crime hate incidents can show up in criminal record checks for six years, yet there are no grounds to appeal against them.

Police say four black men carried out attack in which Black Lives Matter activist was shot in head in London,"Four black men carried out the attack in which prominent Black Lives Matter activist Sasha Johnson was shot in the head Sunday during a party in London, police told BBC News.

What are the details?

Detective Chief Inspector Richard Leonard, who is leading the investigation, told BBC News that about 30 guests had been at the party and that the four attackers dressed in ""dark clothing"" went into the garden ""through a side entrance.""

""In the ensuing melee a firearm has been discharged injuring Sasha,"" Leonard added to the network.

Johnson was taken to intensive care in critical condition, BBC News previously reported.

The Taking the Initiative Party, which Johnson helps lead, told the network that the attack followed ""numerous death threats.""

But police said there was no evidence yet that the attack on the 27-year-old was targeted or that she received credible threats, BBC News added.

Imarn Ayton, a friend of the victim, told the network she did not believe Johnson ""was the intended victim.""

""As far as I am aware ... this incident is more related to rival gangs as opposed to her activism,"" Ayton added to BBC News.

Detective Chief Inspector Jimi Tele said: ""This was a shocking incident that has left a young woman with very serious injuries. Our thoughts are with her family who are being provided with support at this terribly difficult time,"" according to the network.

'The police is no different from the KKK'

As it happens, Johnson was caught on video last year giving a speech during which she noted that ""the police is no different from the KKK.""

She also said police ""stand around and protect statues and buildings instead of people"" and that ""we need a black militia.""

""We need our own political party,"" Johnson also declared, adding that the ""back of racism is capitalism.""

What else do we know about Johnson?

Black Lives Matters UK said it was shocked by the shooting of ""a young mother and fearless political campaigner who was at the forefront of many BLM protests last summer,"" BBC News said — and that while Johnson isn't part of BLM UK, ""she impressively founded a new Black-led political party and was dedicated to resist anti-Black racism.""

Police in the UK failed to pursue dozens of child sex abuse suspects over concerns about racial tensions,"Greater Manchester Police and the Manchester city council declined to adequately pursue child sex abuse suspects partially out of fear that such could spark ""racial hatred,"" an independent investigation found.

The revelation is tied to a 2004 operation called Operation Augusta that began after the death of 15-year-old rape victim Victoria Agoglia.

The operation identified 57 victims of sexual abuse, and 97 suspects involved in grooming and abuse in the area. The victims were mostly white girls between the ages of 12 and 16, and the suspects were primarily from Asian backgrounds.

Despite the fact that police had names, addresses, and workplace information for the suspects, ""very few of the relevant perpetrators were brought to justice and neither were their activities disrupted.""

""Concerns were expressed about the risk of proactive tactics or the incitement of racial hatred,"" the report reads. ""The authorities knew that many were being subjected to the most profound abuse and exploitation but did not protect them from the perpetrators. This is a depressingly familiar picture and has been seen in many other towns and cities across the country.""

According to the Independent, the investigation into the 97 suspects did not receive adequate resources before being closed down with a total of three convictions. A recent incident of racial tension due to unrelated cases involving the Kurdish community reportedly caused officers to be reluctant about the sex abuse investigation.

Manchester officials have apologized for the failures in light of the new report.

""This report makes for painful reading,' said Joanne Roney, Manchester City Council chief executive. ""We recognize that some of the social work practice and management oversight around 15 years ago fell far below the high standards we now expect. We are deeply sorry that not enough was done to protect our children at the time.""

UK police will enter private homes and break up Christmas gatherings if they violate lockdown rules,"U.K. law enforcement officials plan on entering homes to break up Christmas gatherings if occupants break any COVID-19 lockdown rules, according to The Sun.

A cabinet minister recently announced that it's possible that the government will be forced to severely restrict in-home gatherings and household mixing to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 during colder months.

What are the details?

David Jamieson, West Midlands' police and crime commissioner, said that his officers will certainly investigate whether citizens are breaking lockdown measures during the upcoming holiday season.

In remarks to the Telegraph, Jamieson said, ""If we think there's large groups of people gathering where they shouldn't be, then police will have to intervene. If, again, there's flagrant breaking of the rules, then the police would have to enforce. It's not the police's job to stop people enjoying their Christmas, however, we are there to enforce the rules that the government makes, and if the government makes those rules, then the government has to explain that to the public.""

Jamieson also warned that people are reaching a boiling point when it comes to COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions.

""We're sitting on a time bomb here,"" he said. ""We're getting very near the stage where you could see a considerable explosion of frustration and energy. ... Things are very on the edge in a lot of communities, and it wouldn't take very much to spark off unrest, riots, damage.""

The Sun also reported that Jane Kennedy, who is police and crime commissioner in Merseyside, said that she also will enforce a potential crackdown on illegal gatherings over the coming holidays if necessary.



Environment Secretary George Eustice, according to The Guardian, said that it was ""too early to outline exactly what restrictions would be in place over the festive season,"" and said that ""families would be banned from 'coming together in large gatherings'"" if necessary.

The Guardian added:

A letter from the Liberal Democrats' leader, Ed Davey, the party's Scottish and Welsh leaders and the Alliance party deputy leader in Northern Ireland has called for a “four nations summit"" to agree on uniform guidance for families at Christmas.



The letter to the four UK governments, which have each been setting their own restrictions, says: “We must accept the inevitability that people are going to travel to be with their loved ones during the festive time of year.""



In areas of England under tier 1 measures, people must abide by the rule of six indoors, but in other areas social mixing between households inside is not allowed except where support bubbles have been formed.

The outlet projected that more than 8 million people across England will be impacted by the most strict of the tiers mentioned above by the week's end.

What about having 'normal' holidays?

Eustice told LBC radio that while U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is an advocate of having somewhat ""normal"" holidays, he is prepared to utilize all steps to cut down on virus transmission.

""We want people to live and have Christmas as close as possible to normal,"" he insisted. ""It's a really important family time, we understand that. ... The prime minister said he wants us to be able to enjoy Christmas and for families to be able to come together.



“It's too early to say though exactly what restrictions will be in place by Christmas and obviously if we do need to have restrictions in place and prevent families from coming together in large gatherings, if that's necessary to control the virus, that's what we'll have to do,"" he added.

Eustice insisted that the winter holidays could, at any rate, be significantly different due to the coronavirus pandemic when compared with previous years.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-in-the-uk-failed-to-pursue-dozens-of-child-sex-abuse-suspects-over-concerns-about-racial-tension,2020-10-28
UK police warn: Mocking drug dealer's hair may lead to prosecution for 'abusive' online messages,"United Kingdom police are busy searching for a drug dealer who breached his prison release conditions — but now cops are turning their attention to yet another legal problem: People mocking his hair.

You see, police in Gwent, Wales, posted a Facebook photo of 21-year-old Jermaine Taylor in the hopes the public could help cops locate him — but that led to hundreds of jokes, puns, and memes about his hair, BBC News reported.

Such as police are ""combing the area"" for Taylor, the outlet said.

Watch what you say in the UK



All the cracks about Taylor's oddball follicles prompted cops to warn social media posters that their comments could get them in trouble, BBC News said, adding that posting offensive online messages can lead to prosecution.

""We're really grateful to everyone who is assisting us in locating Jermaine Taylor, and we must admit a few of these comments have made us laugh,"" police said Monday, the outlet noted. ""However, when the line is crossed from being funny to abusive, we do have to make sure we are responsible and remind people to be careful about what they write on social media.""

Taylor was sentenced to three years in prison in September 2017 for ""being concerned in supplying controlled drugs,"" BBC News reported, adding that he breached his license conditions after his release last December.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-private-homes-christmas-gatherings,2019-08-12
Police to begin checking students for knives at some London schools after increase in stabbings,"Police will install knife arches at schools across three boroughs in London, following the latest stabbing of a 17-year-old in broad daylight over the weekend.

""Knife arches will be in place at schools over the next two weeks, and officers have increased reassurance patrols around the Balham area in light of last Wednesday's stabbing,"" said Chief Superintendent Sally Benatar of the Basic Command Unit for southwest London, the Sun reported. ""We prioritize effective safeguarding, and our schools' officers are working hard to protect and educate our young people in the dangers of carrying knives.""

Saturday's bloody attack on the teenager occurred aboard a bus in northwest London. No arrests have been made in connection with the crime. The victim's condition is not immediately known.

Metropolitan Police data showed a 16 percent rise in knife-related crimes in 2018 over the previous year, according to the Sun. Since January, at least 1,299 stabbings have occurred in London.

""Following these distressing events, we decided to implement the use of stop and search powers using Section 60 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act,"" Benatar said. ""When it comes to long-term solutions to violent crime, we encourage the proactive use of stop and search where reasonable grounds exist.

""This proves to be one of our most effective means of taking dangerous weapons off the street,"" Benatar added.

Benatar also empowered officers in south London to search anyone for weapons without cause.

Is the problem widespread?

Crimes involving knives or other sharp instruments are up 30 percent across the United Kingdom since 2011, according to the report.

"Pope Francis: For Lent, please stop insulting people on social media","Pope Francis added a new suggestion to the list of things Catholics should consider abstaining from during the 40-day season of Lent: online trolling.

The pope said during Ash Wednesday remarks that in addition to giving up junk food or other vices during the lead-up to Easter, Christians should also abstain from social media conflict, according to Reuters:

Lent, he said in partially improvised remarks, ""is a time to give up useless words, gossip, rumours, tittle-tattle and speak to God on a first name basis,"" he said.



""We live in an atmosphere polluted by too much verbal violence, too many offensive and harmful words, which are amplified by the internet,"" he said. ""Today, people insult each other as if they were saying 'Good Day.'""

Not only should people stop attacking one another online during Lent, the pope said, but they should consider unplugging from technology in general in order to get closer to God. From the Verge:

""We live in an environment polluted by too much verbal violence, by many offensive and harmful words, which the internet amplifies,"" said Pope Francis. ""We are inundated with empty words, with advertisements, with subtle messages. We have become used to hearing everything about everyone and we risk slipping into a worldliness that atrophies our hearts.""



""Hearing everything about everyone"" is a remarkably good description of how the current internet can feel — though the Pope's prescription, granted, is more specific than most digital detox programs. ""Lent is the right time to make room for the Word of God. It is the time to turn off the television and open the Bible. It is the time to disconnect from your cell phone and connect to the Gospel,"" he said.

Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, a 40-day period of fasting, reflection, and good deeds leading to the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Easter.

Pope Francis may approve edit to The Lord's Prayer. But is the change theologically correct?,"The Lord's Prayer, found in Matthew 6 and Luke 11, is the most famous Christian prayer, recited by hundreds of millions of Christians around the world each day. In fact, it is the only prayer Jesus provided his followers. He gave the prayer to distinguish his followers from the Jewish leaders, whom Jesus referred to as ""hypocrites.""

But now, Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, may approve an edit of the prayer over what some experts believe is a theological error.

What are the details?

Researchers ""from a theological, pastoral and stylistic viewpoint"" concluded after 16 years of research that a line from the prayer referring to ""temptation"" is incorrectly translated in English, according to Express UK.

The line ""lead us not into temptation"" should be edited to ""abandon us not when in temptation,"" the alleged experts say.

The altered version has been submitted to the Vatican and is likely earn the approval of Pope Francis, who just last year voiced contempt over the idea that God might lead his people into temptation.

""It's not a good translation,"" Francis said last year. ""I am the one who falls. It's not Him pushing me into temptation to then see how I have fallen. A father doesn't do that; a father helps you to get up immediately.

""It's Satan who leads us into temptation — that's his department,"" he added.

At the time, Francis also gave his stamp of approval for edits already confirmed in other languages, such as the French and Spanish translations, arguing church liturgy must be given modern language.

But is the edit theologically correct?

Many scholars would agree with the idea that God, who the Old and New Testaments both agree is good, would not lead his children into temptation. However, when examining Genesis 3, which is where Bible readers learn of humanity's fraction from their Creator, we learn that temptation is not something God induced, but rather is seemingly a natural part of being human.

Indeed, Jesus, who is God become flesh, was ""led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil"" following his baptism (Matthew 4:1). The Greek word the New Testament writers use for ""spirit"" is pneuma. The reference refers to one part of the triune God (Father, Son, Spirit). Pneuma is also the same word used by Greek writers who translated the Hebrew Bible into what is known as the Septuagint. Its Hebrew equivalent is ruach, which in the Hebrew Bible refers to God's Spirit.

Additionally, the Greek word used in the prayer for ""temptation"" is peirasmos. Its core meaning is ""temptation,"" but the idea behind the word is more nuanced, also suggesting ""trial"" and ""testing.""

At any rate, the theme remains the same: Being human provides the vulnerability to be tempted, but it is never God who does the tempting. In Genesis 3 it was the talking ""snake."" In Genesis 4 it was ""sin."" And after Jesus' baptism it was ""the devil.""

Meanwhile, the Bible does not directly address why God allows humans to be vulnerable to temptation. However, we learn in Genesis 3 that relational destruction and death, both with God and other humans, is the result of humanity's decision to redefine good and evil on their own terms, instead of trusting God.

When Eve saw the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, she saw that it was good (note that this is the first time in the story anyone other than God declares anything in creation to be ""good"") — and then indulged herself, believing the lie of the snake that God was holding out on humanity, and that eating the fruit would make her ""like God."" God provided humanity with free will, and as the Old Testament paints over and over, humanity continually fails the test of faith.

Prince Andrew agrees to settlement in Jeffrey Epstein sex abuse case,"Prince Andrew has settled out of court with a woman who accused him of sexual assault while she was under the control of international sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, reported CNBC.

The woman, Virginia Giuffre, previously sued Prince Andrew after accusing him of sexually assaulting her when she was just 17 years old.

Giuffre said that she was dedicated to “holding Prince Andrew accountable for what he did to me.”

“The powerful and rich are not exempt from being held responsible for their actions,” Giuffre said, “I hope that other victims will see that it is possible not to live in silence and fear but to reclaim one’s life by speaking out and demanding justice.”

The settlement amount was not disclosed in the court’s filing, but it did say that the prince will make “a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffre’s charity in support of victim’s rights.”

Prince Andrew’s legal team failed multiple attempts to get the suit against him dismissed, but now that the parties have settled, a dismissal is expected to come soon from the judge presiding over the case.

Giuffre’s attorney wrote, “The parties anticipate filing a stipulation of dismissal of the case within thirty (30) days. In the interim, the parties request that the court suspend all deadlines and hold the action in abeyance.”

A document attached to the attorney’s statement stated, “Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre’s character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks.”

It continued, “Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.”

The Telegraph reported that the prince’s mother, Queen Elizabeth II, helped fund her son’s expensive legal fees. And the prince sold off an elaborate ski resort that he owned along with his ex-wife to help finance his defense.

After sitting for a poorly received interview with the BBC, Prince Andrew hired a high-power legal team, including Clare Montgomery, an attorney who formerly defended Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.

Last month, Prince Andrew was stripped of his military titles and various other honorifics that distinguished him as a member of England’s royal family.

"Prince Harry, Elton John accuse newspaper of phone-tapping","Duke of Sussex Prince Harry, singer Elton John, and other celebrities filed a lawsuit on Thursday against the Daily Mail news website, accusing the outlet of phone-tapping and other privacy breaches.



According to Reuters, additional plaintiffs in the lawsuit include actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost; Elton John's husband, filmmaker David Furnish; and Doreen Lawrence, the mother of a teenager who was murdered in London in 1993.

The law firm Hamlins, representing some of the individuals in the case, alleged that the Daily Mail placed listening devices inside cars and homes to listen to private phone calls. The lawsuit also accused journalists with the newspaper of providing payments to police officials in exchange for sensitive information and impersonating individuals to obtain medical records.

The case stated that the plaintiffs became aware of ""highly distressing"" evidence that they were victims of a privacy breach by the Daily Mail and its publisher, Associated Newspapers.

Hamlins reported, ""They have now therefore banded together to uncover the truth, and to hold the journalists responsible fully accountable, many of whom still hold senior positions of authority and power today.""

The law firm said it is representing Prince Harry and Sadie Frost in the case against the widely read newspaper. Elton John, Elizabeth Hurley, David Furnish, and Doreen Lawrence are being represented by the law firm Gunnercooke.

Associated Newspapers provided a statement on Sunday in response to the allegations, calling the claims ""unsubstantiated and highly defamatory.""

""We utterly and unambiguously refute these preposterous smears which appear to be nothing more than a pre-planned and orchestrated attempt to drag the Mail titles into the phone hacking scandal concerning articles up to 30 years old,"" a spokesperson for Associated Newspapers stated.

""These unsubstantiated and highly defamatory claims — based on no credible evidence — appear to be simply a fishing expedition by claimants and their lawyers, some of whom have already pursued cases elsewhere.""

In February, Prince Harry filed a libel lawsuit against the Mail on Sunday, an online newspaper also published by Associated Newspapers. He claimed that the statements in one of the articles regarding his legal battle with the British government were defamatory. A judge at the High Court in London agreed and ruled in Harry's favor.

Prince Harry rips 1st Amendment as 'bonkers' — and more than a few Americans get plenty annoyed: 'Show some utter respect',"Fresh on the heels of boldly commanding top podcaster — and MMA fighter — Joe Rogan to ""just stay out of it"" in regard to Rogan suggesting that young people should not get the COVID-19 vaccine, Prince Harry's outspoken mouth is getting him in trouble again.

What did he say this time?

The Duke of Sussex — who recently left his royal family behind in England for the sunnier environs of southern California, since which he's nabbed a considerable windfall through deals with American companies like Netflix and Spotify, the Daily Mail reported — was conversing on Dax Shepard's podcast Thursday when the subject of paparazzi taking photos of celebrities' children came up.

""I don't want to start, sort of, going down the First Amendment route because that's a huge subject and one in which I don't understand because I've only been here for a short period of time, but you can find a loophole in anything,"" Harry said, adding that ""laws were created to protect people.""

The prince added, ""I believe we live in an age now where you've got certain elements of the media redefining to us what privacy means. There's a massive conflict of interest. And then you've got social media platforms, trying to redefine what free speech means. ... And we're living in this world where we've almost, like, the laws have been completely flipped by the very people that need them flipped so they can make more money, and they can capitalize off our pain, grief, and this sort of general self-destructive mode that is happening in the moment.""

And soon Harry delivered the shot heard 'round the world: ""I've got so much I want to say about the First Amendment. I still don't understand it, but it is bonkers."" (In fairness, Shepard agreed: ""It is bonkers."")

The prince's comments can be heard in context after the 39-minute mark of the podcast.

How did folks react?

To put it mildly, a number of Americans didn't much care for Harry's commentary on the Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees citizens the right to freely express themselves, practice whatever religions they choose — or none at all — and to assemble and petition the government.

To say nothing of the fact that the prince is a guest here, making a load of cash here, and enjoying a lifestyle here protected by U.S. laws — and on top of that admitting that ""I still don't understand"" the First Amendment, yet summoning the arrogance to dismiss it as ""bonkers"" — a number of notable U.S. citizens fired back hard.

""We fought a war in 1776 so we don't have to care what you say or think,"" Meghan McCain of ""The View"" said in reaction to Harry's comments. ""That being said, you have chosen to seek refuge from your homeland here and thrive because all of what our country has to offer and one of the biggest things is the 1st Amendment — show some utter respect.""

Others shared McCain's sentiments:

Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas quipped in rather understated fashion that it's ""nice"" that Harry ""can say that.""

GOP U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, also of the Lone Star State, noted that Harry "" just doubled the size of my Independence Day party.""

Megyn Kelly reminded him that it's ""'b

""Don't let the door knob hit you, Windsor,"" Fox News' host Laura Ingraham tweeted.

Author Nick Adams — who's from Australia and says in his Twitter bio that he's ""American by choice"" — declared that ""Prince Harry should go back to the UK!""

Even fellow Brits got into the act. Former Brexit leader Nigel Farage observed that ""for Prince Harry to condemn the USA's First Amendment shows he has lost the plot. Soon he will not be wanted on either side of the pond.""

Dan Wootton of the UK's GBNews tweeted that ""the First Amendment is one of the biggest reasons why the USA is a bastion of free speech and freedom of expression. The fact Prince Harry doesn't like it because he thinks rich privileged folk deserve more rights than everyone else says a lot!""

Speaking of, Harry and Meghan just added more to their already considerable coffers with a new partnership with Proctor and Gamble, Yahoo Finance reported Sunday.

Anything else?

According to the Daily Mail, Harry also criticized Prince Charles, Prince Philip, and the queen during the podcast and complained he had suffered ""genetic pain,"" which led to royal aides demanding that give up his royal titles.

During the 2020 election cycle, Harry and Meghan issued a video widely interpreted as a campaign ad for then-candidate Joe Biden.

When asked for his reaction to the couple weighing in on the race at the time, then-President Donald Trump said, ""I'm not a fan of hers, and I would say this — and she probably has heard that — but I wish a lot of luck to Harry, 'cause he's gonna need it.""

In an interview with the Sun, Gallagher — who led Oasis to worldwide superstardom in the '90s while feuding with his younger brother, Liam, the group's vocalist — said he sympathizes with Prince William for having a younger brother ""shooting his f***ing mouth off with s**t that is just so unnecessary. I'd like to think I was always the William.""

He added, ""Prince William. I feel that f***ing lad's pain,"" the Sun noted.

Gallagher, 54, has endured many verbal shots from his younger brother, who's 46, after Oasis called it quits a decade ago, the paper said.

Which more than likely fueled Gallagher calling out ""f***ing a**hole"" Prince Harry for publicly ""dissing your family"" — and the guitarist-songwriter told him to ""shut up,"" the paper said.

He even took a shot at the equally controversial Meghan Markle, Harry's outspoken wife, the Sun reported: ""This is what happens when you get involved with Americans. As simple as that.""

It's worth noting that Prince Harry also commanded top podcaster — and MMA fighter — Joe Rogan to ""just stay out of it"" after Rogan suggested that young people should not get the COVID-19 vaccine and soon after criticized the First Amendment as ""bonkers,"" which drew lots of backlash.

Kudos from Piers Morgan

Outspoken British TV personality Piers Morgan — who parted ways with ""Good Morning Britain"" earlier this year over his criticism of Markle — loved Gallagher's take:

Morgan also tweeted that Gallagher's interview with the Sun was ""brilliant"" and added ""thank God there are still stars like @NoelGallagher who speak their mind, don't care who gets 'offended' & never whine about how awful their pampered privileged lives are. More please.""

Not Gallagher's first shot across the bow

This wasn't the first time Gallagher addressed headline-grabbing subjects. Last September, he said he refused to wear masks in public and that ""there's too many f***ing liberties being taken away from us now."" And in 2017, he blasted the U.K. government for failing to stop terrorism.

""Our government are seemingly powerless to f***ing stop this s**t,"" Gallagher told the New Musical Express after a deadly bombing. ""I have children, and they're growing up in London, and they take the tube, I take the tube – we all take public transport because I can't drive. And there's bombers roaming free around the whole f***ing city, and the government and the one before them and the one after that will be powerless to stop it because of some hippy ideal about people's religious beliefs.""

Professor: We c​an fight climate change by not having any more babies — then letting human race become extinct,"A professor who teaches in the United Kingdom says in her new book that we can solve climate change by deciding to not have any more babies and simply letting the human race die out, CambridgeshireLive reported.

Patricia MacCormack — a continental philosophy professor at Anglia Ruskin University and researcher of ""feminism, queer theory, posthuman theory, horror film, body modification, animal rights/abolitionism, cinesexuality, and ethics"" — notes in ""The Ahuman Manifesto"" that humans have failed to see the damage we've done to each other and other living species on Earth, the outlet said.

What are the details?

""The basic premise of the book is that we're in the age of the Anthropocene, [and] humanity has caused mass problems, and one of them is creating this hierarchal world where white, male, heterosexual, and able-bodied people are succeeding, and people of different races, genders, sexualities, and those with disabilities are struggling to get that,"" she told CambridgeshireLive.

""This is where the idea of dismantling identity politics comes in — they deserve rights not because of what they are, but because they are. The book also argues that we need to dismantle religion and other overriding powers like the church of capitalism or the cult of self, as it makes people act upon enforced rules rather than respond thoughtfully to the situations in front of them.""

MacCormack added to the outlet that capitalism has enslaved the human race to the point of “zombiedom,"" and ending human reproduction is the only way to repair the damage to the world.

She also told CambridgeshireLive that her book's ideas are ""joyful"" and full of ""radical compassion, which cares for the world. It's not about our death so much as it's about celebrating the tools that exist to care for a decelerating Earth. People wonder why I don't think humans are exceptional, dominant beings — but when I ask them why they think that, I never get a good answer back.""

Here is MacCormack talking about the subject last year:

"Progress in cancer treatment has saved 3.5 million lives since 1991, experts say","According to new research, the last decade has seen ""unprecedented progress"" in the treatment of cancer, and more people than ever are surviving the disease, reports CBS News.

Annual statistics reported by the American Cancer Society (ACS) found that the U.S. cancer death rate has declined by 32% from 1991 to 2019 – a decrease that the ACS says saved 3.5 million lives.

""The U.S. cancer death rate is steadily declining, and more people than ever before are living longer and fuller lives after a cancer diagnosis,"" states this year’s American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Cancer Progress Report. ""In fact, the number of children and adults living with a history of cancer exceeded a record 18 million in January 2022.""

Research into cancer-fighting has led to a number of recent innovations. Between August 1, 2021, and July 31, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration approved “eight new anticancer therapeutics, 10 already approved therapeutics for use for new cancer types, and two new diagnostic imaging agents,” according to CBS News.

Earlier this week, researchers announced that they have genetically modified a herpes virus to direct an antibody to infect and destroy tumors. About 40 patients have tried the treatment as part of clinical trials, reports the BBC. Lead researcher Kevin Harrington told the BBC the treatment responses seen were ""truly impressive"" across a range of advanced cancers. ""It is rare to see such good response rates in early-stage clinical trials, as their primary aim is to test treatment safety, and they involve patients with very advanced cancers for whom current treatments have stopped working,"" Harrington said.

Dr. Marianne Baker, of Cancer Research UK, said this discovery is just the start. ""Scientists discovered that viruses could help to treat cancer 100 years ago, but it's been challenging to harness them safely and effectively,” Baker said to the BBC. ""This new viral therapy shows promise in a small-scale early trial - now we need more studies to find out how well it works.""

In just the past year, the number of cancer survivors has increased by more than a million.

Cancer is still the second-biggest cause of death in the U.S., killing an estimated 602,350 people in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, researchers are optimistic that the rate of people surviving the disease will only continue to accelerate.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/professor-we-can-fight-climate-change-by-not-having-any-more-babies--then-letting-human-race-become-extinct,2022-09-25
Protesters — mostly Muslims — permanently banned from demonstrating against LGBTQ curriculum at UK elementary school,"A United Kingdom high court judge permanently banned demonstrations against an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum that have been taking place outside an elementary school for several months, BBC News said.

Justice Mark David John Warby ruled that an exclusion zone around Anderton Park School in Birmingham will remain, as the protests — undertaken by Muslims for the most part — have had a negative effect on students and staff, including 21 teachers who've been treated for stress, the outlet said.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

What are the details?

Many parents and activists claimed the curriculum contradicts their Islamic faith and is not ""age appropriate"" since protests began in June, BBC News said.

The court last month heard that ""untrue"" and ""harmful"" allegations were made about the school on social media, including that a visiting imam claimed to parents there were ""pedophiles"" in the school, the outlet said, adding that other false claims included that the school had a ""pedophile agenda"" and staff were ""teaching children how to masturbate.""

""None of this is true,"" Warby said as he handed down the ban at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre, BBC News said. ""None of the defendants have suggested it was true, and the council has proved it is not true.""

The lessons had been ""misrepresented by parents,"" he said, according to the outlet, adding the school doesn't promote homosexuality and seeks to weave the language of equality into everyday school life.

Lead protester Shakeel Afsar, who has no children at the school, told BBC News he's ""bitterly disappointed with the ruling and said the court is ""one-sided"" and that the judge, another official, and key witnesses had been white — as opposed to the ""diverse"" protesters.

""We can continue to protest in the same area that we have been protesting in since June this year,"" he added. ""These young children are not being taught the status of law.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/progress-in-cancer-treatment-has-saved-3-5-million-lives-since-1991,2019-11-26
Christian star athlete posts what Bible says about homosexual behavior. Now Rugby Australia wants him gone.,"Israel Folau is a star rugby player and a devout Christian who isn't afraid of expressing his religious beliefs.

But stating those beliefs has landed the 30-year-old in hot water with Rugby Australia, which said one of his social media posts warrants termination of his contract, CNN reported, which is worth $4 million.

Folau's Instagram post last month — which has not been deleted — listed a ""warning"" to ""drunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists, idolaters,"" and then noted underneath the list, ""Hell awaits you. Repent! Only Jesus saves.""

""Those that are living in sin will end up in Hell unless you repent,"" he added in the caption. ""Jesus Christ loves you and is giving you time to turn away from your sin and come to him.""

Folau also quoted the King James version of Galatians 5:19‭-‬21, from which his Instagram post was inspired — and features a much longer list of wrongdoings.



How did officials react?

The rugby league issued Folau a code of conduct breach in April, CNN said, and he requested a hearing. After the three-day hearing, Rugby Australia found Folau guilty, the network noted.

""The panel has today provided a judgement that Israel Folau committed a high-level breach of the Professional Players' Code of Conduct with his social media posts on April 10, 2019,"" Rugby Australia said in a news release, Reuters reported.

The disciplinary panel said it will ""take further written submissions from the parties to consider the matter of sanction. A further update will be provided after the panel delivers its decision on sanction,"" CNN said.

Folau plays fullback for the Wallabies and was expected to star for his country at this year's World Cup, the network said, adding that his contract with Rugby Australia runs through 2022. Folau was warned last year after making a comment on social media saying that gay people would go to hell unless they repented, CNN added.

'I'll stand on what the Bible says'

Citing an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald last month, CNN indicated Folau refused to apologize for the post.

""I'll stand on what the Bible says,"" he said. ""I share it with love. I can see the other side of the coin where people's reactions are the total opposite to how I'm sharing it.""

Reuters said a local media report indicated Folau and his advisers last week rejected a $1 million offer to walk away from the game.

What are others saying?

CNN said former Australia rugby coach Alan Jones wrote an opinion column for the Australian calling the situation ""a rugby crisis which has morphed into a social crisis which will open gigantic wounds in relation to freedom of speech and freedom of religion.""

Peter Beattie, head of the Australian Rules and Rugby League for which Folau previously played, said Folau ""fails"" at the league's ""inclusiveness culture"" — meaning his return to that league is likely out of the question, CNN said.

British rugby player Billy Vunipola received a formal warning from the Rugby Football Union and his club Saracens after defending Folau in an Instagram post, the network added.

""What he's saying isn't that he doesn't like or love those people. He's saying how we live our lives needs to be closer to how God intended them to be,"" Vunipola wrote, CNN said. ""Man was made for woman to pro create that was the goal no?""

Playing European rugby might not happen, either, as the president of the Toulon rugby club, Mourad Boudjellal, told French sports journal L'Equipe that Folau is ""a moron; he ought to clear out. Or he needs to buy himself a brain. He still has the Ku Klux Klan; then he'll see what it's like on the other side,"" LifeSite News said.

Anything else?

Sportswear brand Asics dropped Folau's contract over the issue, CNN said in a separate story.

""Asics is dedicated to sports and its healthy contribution to society,"" Asics said in a statement, CNN noted. ""We believe sport is for everyone and we champion inclusivity and diversity. While Israel Folau is entitled to his personal views, some of those expressed in recent social media posts are not aligned with those of Asics. As such, our partnership with Israel has become untenable and he will no longer represent Asics as a brand ambassador.""

Queen Elizabeth II has contracted COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated,"Queen Elizabeth II has tested positive for COVID-19, the BBC reported.

Buckingham Palace told the BBC that the queen is experiencing ""mild cold-like symptoms"" but expects to continue ""light duties"" during the coming week.

The palace's statement said, ""Her Majesty is experiencing mild cold-like symptoms but expects to continue light duties at Windsor over the coming week. She will continue to receive medical attention and will follow all the appropriate guidelines.""

The queen, who is 95 years old, was recently in contact with her eldest son, Prince Charles, who also tested positive for COVID-19. Both Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles are fully vaccinated. This is Charles's second bout of COVID-19 after contracting it in 2020.

Despite her elevated age, the queen will continue with ""light duties"" as she recovers during the week.

The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, took to Twitter to wish the queen a ""swift recovery"" and a ""rapid return to vibrant good health.""

The New York Times reported that it is unclear who passed the virus along to the queen.

The Times said, ""The circumstances of the queen's infection remained clouded in questions. Charles was at Windsor Castle, where she is in residence, on Feb. 8 for an investiture ceremony,"" but did not conclude that the prince had passed the virus onto his mother as there has been an uptick in cases among those around the queen.

The queen contracting COVID-19 comes as the English government is preparing to stop requiring face masks to be worn in public places and COVID-19 passports will not be mandatory for large events, ABC News reported.

Johnson said, ""We will trust the judgment of the British people and no longer criminalize anyone who chooses not to wear one.""

These restrictions are reportedly being eased because government scientists believe that the omicron variant has peaked in the United Kingdom.

Government data indicates that more than 90% of British citizens over the age of 60 have received more than two doses of a COVID-19 vaccination. In most parts of the United Kingdom, infection rates are dropping.

In the spring of 2020, around the same time Prince Charles contracted COVID-19, Prime Minister Johnson was treated in an intensive care unit after falling ill to the virus.

Radical environmentalists launch campaign to deflate SUV tires,"A radical self-described ""activist hub"" is calling for people to go around and deflate the tires on American SUVs to raise awareness about climate change.

Calling SUVs ""the 2nd-largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions since 2010,"" the group, Adbusters, gave instructions on how climate activists can deflate SUV tires as a means of ""non-violent"" protest to ""convey the seriousness of this crisis in tangible ways.""

""This is a gentle escalation of methods to drive the urgency of this climate crisis home and engender a systemic aversion to SUVs,"" the group tweeted last week.

""So here's what we do: Wedge gravel in the tire valves, leaflet the SUV to let them know the tires are flat and why it was done, and walk away.

""It's that simple. If we organize, we can hit enough SUVs in particular neighborhoods to spark reporting and spread the metameme,"" Adbusters said.

The group called on activists to organize on non-traceable apps and go neighborhood-by-neighborhood, deflating tires and attaching leaflets to each SUV that explain why the car was vandalized.



A copy of the suggested leaflet reads in part: ""SUVs are disproportionately fueling the climate crisis ... and they're totally [unnecessary.] The climate crisis is spiraling out of control, making drastic action necessary. So we deflated your tires.""



""Targeting SUVs is good way to hit the automotive industry where it hurts. SUV sales are playing a massive role in the expansion of the auto industry, both as a percentage of global market share and in total numbers,"" the group said.

If an SUV owner is unaware their vehicle was targeted, it could be dangerous. Driving on a flat tire reduces the vehicle's handling and can cause structural damage to the wheel, brakes, alignment, and potentially other car components including the suspension and steering system, according to auto care company Firestone.

Activists were advised to target ""wealthy areas"" so that SUVs belonging to working people would be spared. Vehicles with disabled stickers or hangers were also not to be targeted.

Adbusters hopes this campaign will attract media attention for its cause. The group claimed that similar campaigns in Sweden and the U.K. achieved success, citing the illegal activities of another climate alarmist group called the Tyre Extinguishers.

The BBC reported Monday that dozens of SUV vehicles parked in an upmarket area of Edinburgh, Scotland had their tires deflated by vandals. Leaflets left on some of the vehicles branded them ""polluting death machines"" and were signed by ""The Tyre Extinguishers.""



The Tyre Extinguishers website declares that the group's goal is ""to make it impossible to own a huge polluting 4x4 in the world’s urban areas."" To justify their actions, the activists claim self-defense against ""climate change, air pollution and unsafe drivers.""

Authorities said more than 100 vehicles were targeted, according to BBC.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/queen-elizabeth-ii-has-contracted-covid-19-despite-being-fully-vaccinated,2022-04-11
LGBT protesters succeed in shutting down first Chick-fil-A in the United Kingdom,"According to the New York Times, LGBT advocacy groups in England have succeeded in convincing The Oracle shopping center in Reading not to renew Chick-fil-A's lease, leading the company to announce that it permanently close the Reading location at the end of this six month period.

Chick-fil-A opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Reading on October 10th. An LGBT group, Reading Pride, immediately sprang into action, organizing a protest called ""Get the Chick Out"" that was designed to close down the restaurant. As part of the protest, activists stood outside The Oracle shopping center and held signs and chanted at customers.

Reports indicated that in spite of the protests, the Reading Chick-fil-A was doing brisk business; however, management of The Oracle decided to cave to the protesters. In a statement released by Reading Pride, the group claimed that the mall had promised to ""review their selection process"" for future tenants in order to avoid angering the group in the future.

A spokesman for The Oracle declined to provide a comment on the issue to the Times.

While Chick-fil-A was initially reported to be considering an expansion into the London market, a spokesman for the company sounded a much more cautious note to the Times on the possibility of expanding elsewhere in England after the Reading experience, saying only, ""We are always looking and learning, and do so through pop-up locations, but nothing else to share right now.""

Chick-fil-A has likewise been the target of numerous protests by LGBT groups in the United States ever since the company's CEO Dan Cathy admitted in 2012 to donating groups that supported the ""biblical definition of the family unit,"" but has nonetheless grown to become the third-largest fast food chain in the country, behind only McDonald's and Starbucks, in spite of the fact that Chick-fil-A only operates six days a week and has far fewer locations than many fast food chains.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/radical-environmentalists-launch-campaign-to-deflate-suv-tires,2019-10-19
"Google demonetized The Federalist after complaint of 'racism' from UK group, NBC News claims","Google demonetized conservative news site The Federalist on Tuesday, after being notified that a far-left United Kingdom media watchdog accused the outlet of publishing ""racist articles"" about Black Lives Matter protests, according to NBC News.

Amid outrage over Google's actions, the search giant delivered a different story, claiming ""The Federalist was never demonetized"" and saying the issue has been settled because the conservative outlet removed its comments section in response to their threat.

What are the details?

NBC News reported that ""two far-right sites,"" ZeroHedge and The Federalist, ""will no longer be able to generate revenue from any advertisements served by Google Ads"" because ""research revealed [Google] was profiting from articles pushing unsubstantiated claims about the Black Lives Matter protests.""

A Google spokesperson wrote in an email to NBC News, ""We have strict publisher policies that govern the content ads can run on and explicitly prohibit derogatory content that promotes hatred, intolerance, violence or discrimination based on race from monetizing. When a page or site violates our policies, we take action. In this case, we've removed both sites' ability to monetize with Google.""

NBC News went on to report that it had informed Google that The Federalist made the ""blacklist"" of a U.K. nonprofit called the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which now boasts about having The Federalist defunded — along with numerous other conservative American sites.

NBC News bragged, ""Google blocked The Federalist from its advertising platform after the NBC News Verification Unit brought the (Center for Countering Digital Hate) project to its attention.""

After NBC News published its story, conservatives condemned Google's actions against The Federalist. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) tweeted, ""@Google dominates the search business, they dominate the ad business, and now they want to dominate what you're allowed to think. Who's next after banning @FDRLST and Zero Hedge? @BreitbartNews? @NRO? #stopthebias""

Breitbart, another conservative site mentioned by Blackburn, actually is on the same Center for Countering Digital Hate blacklist.

Amid the pushback, Google denied the claims its own spokesperson had emailed to NBC.

Google tweeted, ""The Federalist was never demonetized. We worked with them to address issues on their site related to the comments section. Our policies do not allow ads to run against dangerous or derogatory content, which includes comments on sites, and we offer guidance and best practices to publishers on how to comply.""

Google added, ""As the comment section has now been removed [by The Federalist], we consider this matter resolved and no action will be taken.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reading-england-chick-fil-a-closes,2020-06-16
Iran claims to have captured a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz,"Iran has claimed to have captured a British-flagged oil tanker that was traveling through the Strait of Hormuz.

Iran and the U.K. have been squabbling over another oil tanker

On July 4, the United Kingdom seized an Iranian oil tanker, the Grace 1, that it suspected of violating sanctions against Syria. Iran's supreme leader threatened to seize a British oil tanker if the Grace 1 was not released.

On July 10, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard tried unsuccessfully to take control of the oil tanker British Heritage. However, this attempt was foiled by the Royal Navy ship HMS Montrose, which positioned itself in between the Iranian gunboats and the oil tanker. Iran would later deny that the incident happened.

On Friday, the Supreme Court on the British territory of Gibraltar extended the time that the Grace 1 could be detained for 30 additional days. Jeremy Hunt, the U.K.'s foreign minister, said that the Grace 1 would be released if Iran could give assurances that it would not violate the sanctions against Syria.

The U.S. also had a recent incident with the Iranians in the Strait of Hormuz. On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced that a U.S. Navy ship had shot down an Iranian drone that was ""threatening safety of ship and ship's crew."" Iran has denied that this ever happened.

Here's what happened now

On Friday, the owners of the tanker Stena Impero released a statement that said it had been ""approached by unidentified small crafts and a helicopter during transit of the Strait of Hormuz while the vessel was in international waters."" The tanker had been heading to Saudi Arabia before this happened.

The company, Stena Bulk, said it was ""presently unable to contact the vessel which is now heading north towards Iran.""

So far the British government has only said that it is ""assessing the situation following reports of an incident in the Gulf.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-google-moves-to-demonetize-the-federalist-after-complaint-of-racism-from-uk-group-nbc-news-claims,2019-07-19
Theresa May's government found in contempt of Parliament over its handling of Brexit,"The British Parliament has found Prime Minister Theresa May's government to be in contempt.

Why was her government found in contempt?

Parliament had asked Theresa May's government to publish legal advice from the Attorney General to the Cabinet on which it had based its version of a Brexit deal. The advice looked at all the potential legal implications of the current Brexit deal. May refused to publish on the basis that such “candid"" legal advice given to ministers should be understood to be confidential.

On Tuesday, British House of Commons voted 311 to 293 to hold May's government in contempt.

Commons votes 321 to 299 to approve Dominic Grieve's amendment (d), to the business of the House motion on the #WithdrawalAgreement.

— UK House of Commons (@HouseofCommons) December 4, 2018

What does this mean for May's government?

May's government will now have to turn over the legal advice to Parliament. It will then be looked over to make sure that it doesn't contain any confidential information before being released to the public.

“We have tested the opinion of the House twice on this very serious subject,"" Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons said after the vote took place. “We have listened carefully and in light of the expressed will of the House, we will publish the final and full advice provided by the Attorney General to Cabinet. But recognizing the very serious constitutional issues this raises, I've referred the matter to the privileges committee to consider the implications of the humble address.""

""I know there are some in this House and in the country who would prefer a closer relationship with the European Union than the one I'm proposing, indeed who would prefer the relationship that we currently have and want another referendum,"" May told Parliament.

""The hard truth is that we will not settle this issue and bring our country together that way, and I ask them to think what it would say to the 52% who came out to vote Leave in many cases for the first time in decades if their decision were ignored.""



What does this mean for Brexit?

That depends on what's in the documents that will now be released. Critics of Brexit suspect that these documents must contain predictions that Brexit will not go as well as May's government has been predicting, since they were not released immediately.

A judge in the European Union ruled on Tuesday before this vote took place that the U.K. could cancel its Brexit plans without getting the approval of all the remaining EU member states. May and her government objected to this ruling, saying that it was pointless because they planned to go through with Brexit.

A parliamentary vote on May's version of a Brexit deal is scheduled to be held on Dec. 11. In March, the U.K. invoked Article 50 of the EU treaty, which set the wheels in motion for the nation to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, with or without a deal in place.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-iran-claims-to-have-captured-a-british-oil-tanker-in-the-strait-of-hormuz,2018-12-04
"UK women and equalities minister torches BLM movement, critical race theory in House of Commons floor speech","The UK's Women and Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch, a member of the Conservative Party, delivered a strong condemnation of the Black Lives Matter movement and critical race theory on the floor of the House of Commons — saying such ideologies have no place in British schools.

What are the details?

""What we are against is the teaching of contested political ideas as if they are accepted fact,"" Badenoch explained. ""We don't do this with communism, we don't do this with socialism, we don't do it with capitalism — and I want to speak about a dangerous trend in race relations that has come far too close to home to my life, and it's the promotion of Critical Race Theory, an ideology that sees my blackness as victimhood and their whiteness as oppression.""

""I want to absolutely clear,"" she continued. ""This government stand unequivocally against Critical Race Theory.""

Badenoch then went after BLM, saying, ""Some schools have decided to openly support the anti-capitalist Black Lives Matter group, often fully aware that they have a statutory duty to be politically impartial.""

""Black lives do matter, of course they do,"" the minister said. ""But we know that the Black Lives Matter movement — capital B.L.M. — is political. I know this, because at the height of the protests, I have been told of white Black Lives Matter protesters calling — and I'm afraid ... I apologize for saying this word — calling a black armed police officer guarding downing street a 'pet n*****.

""That is why we do not endorse that movement on this side of the House,"" Badenoch reiterated. ""It is a political movement, and what would be nice, would be for members on the opposite side to condemn many of the actions that we see this political movement, instead of pretending that it is completely wholesome anti-racist organization, that there is a lot of pernicious stuff that is being pushed and we stand against that.""

She argued, ""We do not want to see teachers teaching their white pupils about white privilege and inherited racial guilt. And let me be clear: any school which teaches these elements of Critical Race Theory as fact, or which promotes partisan political views such as defunding the police without offering a balanced treatment of opposing views, is breaking the law.""

A debate on Black History Month

According to the Daily Record, Badenoch was ""responding to the general debate on Black History Month.""

She added, ""But why does this issue mean so much to me? It is not just because I'm a first generation immigrant, it is because my daughter came home from school this month and said 'we're learning Black History Month because every other month is about white history.'

""This is wrong and this is not what our children should be picking up,"" she concluded. ""These are not the values I have taught her.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-theresa-mays-government-found-in-contempt-of-parliament-over-its-handling-of-brexit,2020-10-21
Study shows religious couples enjoy far more satisfying sex than their secular compatriots,"A study published in the Journal of Sex Research on August 26 indicates that free love and godless sex may not be as great as once advertised. Sex engaged in by religious married couples is reportedly more satisfying, particularly for married women with strong religious associations.

Social demographer Dr. Nitzan Peri-Rotem, of the University of Exeter, and Columbia University professor Dr. Vegard Skirbekk analyzed data from the third British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles to explore the links between religiosity and sex frequency and satisfaction.

Although they anticipated finding that religious individuals would have less non-marital sex and commit less adultery than their non-religious peers, the likelihood that religious couples fulfilling their duties were also having more fun was not among their initial hypotheses.

Among those surveyed, men and women who stated that religion was either very or fairly important reportedly had significantly less frequent sex than those who were irreligious, but Peri-Rotem and Skirbekk noted frequency was more of a concern for unpartnered individuals and couples who didn't live together.

Although religious couples involved in the study reported having less sex than their unpartnered, unmarried, or remotely paired peers, it turns out they have a generally more satisfying sex life.

While there was not a pronounced difference in satisfaction of married religious men as compared with their non-religious compatriots, religious married women were far more sexually satisfied than irreligious women.

Monogamy also came out a winner. Women who reported having more than ten sexual partners or no sexual partners at all experienced lower overall satisfaction from sex.

It turns out that more sex also doesn't mean greater satisfaction — that the law of diminishing marginal utility apparently applies. According to Peri-Rotem and Skirbekk's research, ""too much"" sex may lead to lower levels of satisfaction.

A free-love disposition and higher approval of sex without love was found to be negatively associated with sexual satisfaction for both men and women. Alternatively, a disapproval of sex without love and of casual sex was demonstrated to be linked with higher satisfaction from sex life in both men and women.

The religiosity of respondents in the study was gauged by questions such as ""How important are religion and religious beliefs to you, now?"" Frequency of religious service attendance (e.g., monthly attendance, yearly attendance, etc.) was also factored in. Peri-Rotem and Skirbekk accounted for religious denomination as well, which included the following categories: no religion, Anglicans, Roman Catholics, other Christians, and non-Christian religions.

The study was conducted in the United Kingdom, which is now majority non-religious. A minority of men (11%) and women (16%) said that religion and religious beliefs are very important to them. Another 22% and 27% respectively noted that religion is fairly important.

A 2021 Gallup poll indicated that three in four Americans identify with a specific religious faith, 69% identifying with a Christian religion; 49% of Americans noted that religion is ""very important"" in their life, and 27% suggested religion is ""fairly important."" If the link identified in this British study between religiosity and sexual satisfaction holds in the U.S., and there is a similar proportion of partnered or married couples, it is possible that the U.S. boasts more sexually satisfied individuals per capita than the U.K.

A 2020 American study published in the Journal of Family Psychology similarly found that religiosity ""consistently had a positive indirect association with sexual satisfaction through sexual sanctification."" That is to say, religious married people who view their sexual bond as sacred tend to experience greater levels of sexual satisfaction.

One of the study's authors, Nathan Leonhardt, noted, ""If people received religious messages about how sexuality is sacred, sanctioned for being cocreators with God, and designed to help couples bond, experience pleasure, and enhance their commitment to each other, religion could be a positive force in their relationships.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-uk-equalities-minister-torches-blm-movement-critical-race-theory-in-house-of-commons-floor-speech,2022-09-02
Rep. Ilhan Omar stands with Venezuelan dictator Maduro,"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said in an interview that she ""absolutely"" did not support Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, and that she thought that the aid that the United States was sending into that country was a pretext for an eventual military invasion of Venezuela.

What's happening in Venezuela?

Venezuela's current leader, Nicolás Maduro, was re-elected in 2018 with 68 percent of the vote in what was largely condemned by the international community as a fraudulent election.

Under Maduro's leadership, the economy of Venezuela has spiraled out of control. Venezuelans have reportedly taken to eating garbage in order to survive.

As the leader of the National Assembly, Guaido declared himself to be the legal interim president according to the guidelines laid out in the Venezuelan constitution. The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and most of South America and Europe have thrown their support behind Guaido and recognized him as the rightful leader of the country.

Russia and China have supported Maduro's regime, while Mexico, Uruguay, and Vatican City have all called for a dialogue between the two sides.

The U.S., Brazil, and Colombia recently tried to send supplies to the starving Venezuelan people. Soldiers loyal to Maduro have violently blocked these aid shipments from entering the country.

Prominent Democrats, including Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and former Vice President Joe Biden have joined the Trump administration in expressing their support for Guaido. Pelosi even met with an ambassador representing Guaido on Jan. 13.

What did Rep. Omar say?

When Omar was asked, during an interview with The Intercept, what she wanted to see happen in Venezuela, she spoke out against what she said were American threats.

Well the constitution of Venezuela says that there needs to be an election called within 30 days and we're waiting for that to happen. What we should be involved in is having diplomatic conversations and bringing people to the table and being a partner in facilitating that. But we are threatening, we are threatening intervention. We're sending humanitarian aid that is in the guise of, you know, eventually invading this country and the people of the country don't want us there.

Asked if she joined the U.S. government in supporting Guaido, she replied ""absolutely not.""

She also clarified that she was ""certainly"" trying to move the Democratic Party's foreign policy further to the left.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/religious-couples-have-better-sex,2019-03-01
Report: Students as young as 6 learning about genital 'self-stimulation' in UK sex-ed program called All About Me,"Children as young as 6 years old are learning ""rules"" for genital ""self-stimulation"" through a new sex-education program in the U.K. titled All About Me, the Daily Mail reported.

Warwickshire County Council is rolling out the program across 241 primary schools, the outlet said, adding that other counties could add All About Me next year as part of the government's Relationship and Sex Education overhaul.

What are the details of the program?

The Daily Mail said it obtained documents related to All About Me that instruct teachers to tell students between 6 and 10 years of age about ""rules"" for ""touching yourself."" The ""rules about self-stimulation"" explanation appears in the Year Two lesson plan for 6- and 7-year-olds, the outlet added.

In the Touching Myself section, teachers are instructed to tell students that ""lots of people like to tickle or stroke themselves as it might feel nice"" and that it may include touching their ""private parts"" — which is ""very normal"" and not ""dirty,"" the Daily Mail said.

Kids are warned it's ""not polite"" to touch themselves in public, and that it's acceptable to do so alone in a bathroom, shower, or bed, the outlet said, adding that students are quizzed on scenarios that are ""OK"" and ""not OK.""

One scenario involves a girl named Autumn who ""likes to touch herself between her legs"" when she's alone in a bathtub as ""it feels nice,"" the Daily Mail reported.

All primary schools will be required to teach compulsory relationships education starting next September as part of the government's RSE reforms, the outlet said, adding that next year parents won't be allowed to withdraw children from these lessons.

Warwickshire County Council said the lessons are ""tailored to the age and development level of the children"" and that ""while some of the material may be sensitive for some, we believe it is important for children … to get clear and consistent information about this important but often overlooked subject,"" the outlet added.

'Effectively sexualizing very young children'

Politicians who had supported the RSE reforms voiced concern, the Daily Mail said.

Member of Parliament David Davies told the outlet, ""I and many other parents would be furious at completely inappropriate sexual matters being taught to children as young as six. These classes go way beyond the guidance the government is producing and are effectively sexualizing very young children.""

Parents at Coten End Primary School in Warwick met sex-education consultant Jonny Hunt, one of the All About Me creators, in June and questioned the content, the Daily Mail said — specifically self-stimulation instruction.

""This is not sex education but actually information around safe and appropriate touching,"" Hunt said, according to the outlet. ""However uncomfortable adults may find it, children of all ages will self-stimulate from time to time. They may do this when anxious or simply because it feels nice.""

'They won't use the term masturbation'

Naomi and Matthew Seymour, whose two sons attend Coten End, told the Daily Mail they strongly disagree with Hunt's assessment and because they're concerned their sons will be exposed to issues they're ""not ready to hear,"" the couple removed them from school for the week during which the program was taught.

""My wife cried the first time she read what was going to be in the lessons,"" Matthew Seymour, 38, told the Daily Mail. ""This sexualization of our children is just totally inappropriate. They are calling it self-touching and they won't use the term masturbation, but when you read it, that's exactly what they're talking about. We don't want to start picket lines and wave banners. We're just an ordinary family. I think many families who had seen these lesson plans would feel the same way we did.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rep-ilhan-omar-says-she-absolutely-does-not-support-maduro-opponent-juan-guaido,2019-09-26
Research: Erectile dysfunction drug may slow or reverse heart failure,"A new study shows heart failure may be slowed or possibly reversed when treated with a drug commonly used to treat erectile dysfunction in men.

British Scientists at the University of Manchester found that tadalafil, which is sold under the brand name Cialis, was an effective treatment for heart failure in sheep, according to the study published on Wednesday in Scientific Reports.

""This discovery is an important advance in a devastating condition which causes misery for thousands of people across the UK and beyond,"" professor Andrew Trafford, one of the study's authors told Medical Xpress.

Although the research in humans is limited, Trafford believes the findings showed promise for patients suffering from the debilitating condition.

""We do have limited evidence from human trials and epidemiological studies that show Tadalafil can be effective in treating heart failure,"" he said. ""This study provides further confirmation, adds mechanistic details and demonstrates that Tadalafil could now be a possible therapy for heart failure.

What is heart failure?

Heart failure is a chronic, progressive condition that occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs for blood and oxygen, according to the American Heart Association.

Symptoms may include shortness of breath, persistent coughing or wheezing, fluid retention, fatigue, confusion, and increased heart rate. The five-year survival rate is lower than many common cancers.



How does the medication work?

The researchers induced heart failure in the animals using pacemakers. The physiology of sheep hearts is similar to human hearts, according to the authors.



Once the animals' hearts showed progressive signs of heart failure, the scientists started administering tadalafil. The dosage was similar to the amount used to treat erectile dysfunction in men.

Over a short period, the sheep's heart failure stopped, but most importantly, the effects of the condition were reversed.

Tadalafil blocks an enzyme called Phosphodiesterase 5 or PDE5S for short, which prevents tissues from responding correctly to catecholamines including epinephrine, also known as adrenaline.

The drug stopped the reaction to PDE5S and restored the heart's ability to respond to adrenaline and force blood throughout the body.

What else?

Trafford told Medical Xpress that erectile dysfunction patients who have used the medication might have inadvertently received protective benefits.

""It's entirely possible that some patients taking it for erectile dysfunction have also unwittingly enjoyed a protective effect on their heart,"" Trafford said.

But he doesn't recommend attempting to treat heart failure without the advice of a doctor.

""Tadalafil is only suitable as a treatment for systolic heart failure — when the heart is not able to pump properly — and there may be interactions with other drugs patients are taking,"" Trafford added.

The British Heart Foundation funded the study.

A restaurant assured a severely allergic teenager that his meal didn't contain dairy — then he died of anaphylactic shock,"A severely allergic teenager in the United Kingdom died after a restaurant served him food with dairy in it, despite assuring him that it was safe.

What happened?

Owen James Carey visited the Byron Burger in London on his 18th birthday in April 2017. He asked the restaurant specifically if the meal he had ordered was free from any dairy, explaining that he was incredibly allergic to it. They assured him that it was dairy free. The menu also indicated that the meal did not contain dairy.

Except there was dairy. The chicken in the sandwich he had ordered was fried in buttermilk.

Coroner Briony Ballard said in a statement on Friday, ""The deceased made serving staff aware of his allergies. The menu was reassuring in that it made no reference to any marinade or potential allergenic ingredient in the food selected.""

Ballard also said that Carey suffered ""a severe anaphylactic reaction from which he died.""

The restaurant CEO weighed in

""We have heard what the Coroner said about the need to communicate about allergies,"" Simon Wilkinson, the CEO of Byron, said in a statement after the ruling on Friday. ""It is clear that the current rules and requirements are not enough and the industry needs to do more — more to help support customers with allergies and more to raise awareness of the risks of allergies.""

Wilkinson also said that his restaurant ""always did its best to meet our responsibilities,"" although he acknowledged that ""this will be of no comfort to Owen's family.""

Carey's family is trying to keep this from happening to other people

""We want restaurants to have to display clear allergen information on each individual dish on their menus. The food industry should put the safety of their customers first,"" Carey's family said in a statement.

They asked the government to ensure that restaurants took these precautions.

""It is simply not good enough to have a policy which relies on verbal communication between the customer and their server, which often takes places in a busy, noisy restaurant where the turnover of staff is high and many of their customers are very young,"" the family added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/research-erectile-dysfunction-drug-found-to-slow-or-reverse-heart-failure,2019-09-16
Retired officer buys old police cruiser. It turns out it belonged to his beloved late father: 'It's as if the car has come back home',"A retired police officer who was looking to find a car similar to that of his late dad's hit the jackpot — and he ended up purchasing his late father's police cruiser after spotting it on eBay.

What are the details?

Greg Barnett, a 47-year-old retired police officer from the U.K., was searching eBay for a car like his father's old police cruiser, and he couldn't have been luckier: The car wasn't simply like his father's old police cruiser — it was his father's old police cruiser.

Greg's father, Barrie Barnett, was a a driving instructor for Durham Constabulary who died in 2007 at the age of 65.

When Barnett saw the listing for the 1978 Vauxhall VX90, which was painted like those patrol cars he'd seen in his hometown of Durham, England, he was instantly intrigued.

He said he began to scroll through the listing's photos when he came across an expense sheet that bore his father's name and handwriting.

""I was gobsmacked when I saw the receipts with my father's signature on it,"" he said. ""It blew me away.""

Barnett told SWNS, ""That was it — you could have picked me up off the floor after that! The last time I saw [the car] it was in 2008 or 2009.""

What happened next?

He immediately reached out to the seller, who was located 300 miles away in Wells. The seller said that he purchased the old vehicle from a government lot.

Barnett said he shelled out about $11,500 for the vehicle.

""It brought a lot of memories flooding back,"" he added. ""It's as if the car has come back home.""

Ricky Gervais destroys Hollywood liberals: 'You're in no position to lecture the public about anything',"British comedian Ricky Gervais tore into Hollywood on Sunday night as the host of the 77th annual Golden Globe Awards.

Gervais told millions of viewers watching around the world that the room filled with A-list actors and corporate moguls, such as Tom Hanks, Al Pacino, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, were in no position to lecture the country on politics—or anything else for that matter.

""So, if you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech. You're in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg. So, if you win, come up, accept your little award. Thank your agent and your god, and f*** off!""

So-called ""woke"" corporations were not spared of the comic's ridicule either as Gervais took aim at the business practices of several entertainment giants.

""...You say you're woke but the companies you work for...Apple, Amazon, Disney...if ISIS started a streaming service you'd call your agent, wouldn't you?""

The star of the UK version of the series, ""The Office,"" even dropped an ""Epstein Didn't Kill Himself"" joke.

""Spoiler alert, season two [of ""After Life""] is on the way. So, in the end, he obviously didn't kill himself. Just like Jeffrey Epstein. Shut up, I know he's your friend but I don't care.""

""Just bizarre,"" he said of liberals' support for Facebook's move. ""Progressive Democrats, who once stood for Civil Rights, Liberty,Free Speech now stand for censorship & removing parent rights.""

On Sunday, the actor and comic noted that all speech should be covered under the umbrella of free speech.

""Free Speech is ALL SPEECH! The UK and Australia don't have protected speech. And we are not protecting our 1st Amendment. #EternalVigilance,"" he said.

Anything else?

In a 2018 interview with the New York Daily News, Schneider — a former longtime Democrat — said that he switched his party affiliation to independent because of his concerns over an overly politically correct culture.

""[Schneider] enjoys finding humor in making fun of liberals so they can find the 'hypocrisy' in their actions,'"" a portion of the interview read.

"Royal Air Force head of recruitment, a woman, quits over UK diversity policy that excludes white men: Report","The head of recruitment for the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force, a senior female officer, has reportedly resigned in protest of a diversity policy critics say has set ""impossible"" targets and jeopardized U.K. national security.

White male applicants are being excluded from job offers in the RAF under diversity guidelines set by Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston, Sky News reported. Sources who spoke to the outlet complained that diversity targets set by air force leadership have led to hiring restrictions that are threatening military preparedness, comparing the situation to the pre-World War II era.

""Then you look at the head of the RAF and he's prepared to break the operational requirement of the air force just to meet diversity [targets],"" one source said.

""I think he needs to be hauled up by the Ministry of Defense and told: 'This is the defense agenda, get on it.'""

Defense leadership in the United Kingdom has set a target to increase the ratio of female recruits joining the armed forces to 30% by 2030. In the RAF, officials aim to have 40% of all recruits be women by the end of the decade, which is more than double the current level, according to Sky News.

A similar target has been set for ethnic minorities, with the Ministry of Defense aiming to have 20% of all air force recruits be non-whites in the same time frame, Sky News reports.

Critics say recruitment policies are handicapping the RAF's ability to meet operational inflow requirements — the number of new recruits needed to ensure the air force maintains the full range of operations needed to secure the country and assist allies abroad.

""We are all really pro-diversity and we want to see better representation across the services, but … levels of ambition for ethnic targets … are absolutely crazy,"" a source said. ""There is no scientific or cultural background to these particular levels of ambition.""

But the Ministry of Defense disputes the allegations.

""There is no pause in Royal Air Force recruitment and no new policy with regards to meeting in-year recruitment requirements,"" a spokesperson for the RAF told Sky News.

""Royal Air Force commanders will not shy away from the challenges we face building a service that attracts and recruits talent from every part of the UK workforce.

""As with the Royal Navy and British Army, we are doing everything we can to encourage recruiting from under-represented groups and ensure we have a diverse workforce.

""The Royal Air Force has a well-earned reputation for operational excellence that is founded on the quality of all our people. We will always seek to recruit the best talent available to us.""

However, sources who spoke to Sky News said the Head of Recruitment and Selection — a Group Captain — handed in her resignation because RAF leadership pressured her to pause extending job officers to white male applicants in the hopes that women and minorities would fill vacant roles by the end of the fiscal year.

The defense sources complained that under Wigston's leadership, the air force has enacted a ""woke"" diversity agenda — changing terms like ""airman"" to the more gender-neutral ""aviator,"" emphasizing politically-correct use of pronouns, and permitting staff to grow beards.

Russia hackers allegedly trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine research,"Hackers linked to Russian intelligence services are attempting to steal coronavirus vaccine research from pharmaceutical companies and other organizations, according to security officials from the U.S., the U.K., and Canada.

The three nations alleged on Thursday that hacking group APT29, also known as ""Cozy Bear"" and ""the Dukes,"" is trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine research. The U.S. National Security Agency, U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre, and Canada's Communications Security Establishment all agree that the hacker group is ""almost certainly part of the Russian intelligence services.""

""Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of COVID-19 vaccines,"" according to the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre. ""The group uses a variety of tools and techniques to predominantly target governmental, diplomatic, think-tank, healthcare and energy targets for intelligence gain.""

APT29, which is associated with the Russian military spy agency GRU, is reportedly using custom malicious software to target organizations around the world. The malware being used is called ""WellMess"" and ""WellMail,"" according to the 16-page advisory.



Targets include health care agencies, pharmaceutical companies, academia, medical research organizations, and local governments, security officials warned.

""In recent attacks targeting COVID-19 vaccine research and development, the group conducted basic vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses owned by the organizations,"" the joint advisory stated. ""The group then deployed public exploits against the vulnerable services identified.""



""It is completely unacceptable that the Russian Intelligence Services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic,″ said Dominic Raab, Britain's foreign secretary. ""While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behavior, the U.K. and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health.""

""APT29 is likely to continue to target organizations involved in COVID-19 vaccine research and development, as they seek to answer additional intelligence questions relating to the pandemic,"" the advisory concludes.

Russia has denied the allegations.

""We do not have information on who might have hacked into pharmaceutical companies and research centers,"" Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the TASS news agency. ""We can only say one thing: Russia has nothing to do with these attempts. We do not accept these accusations, as well as the usual accusations of interference in the 2019 (sic) election.""

U.S. officials have made similar accusations about theft of COVID-19 research against China.

""At this very moment, China is working to compromise American health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and academic institutions conducting essential COVID-19 research,"" FBI Director Chris Wray said last week.

Cozy Bear was identified as one of the Russian-linked groups that hacked into the Democratic National Committee computer network and stole emails and phone calls before the 2016 presidential election.

In early April, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning that cyber espionage groups were attempting to exploit the coronavirus pandemic.



""Both [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure and Security Agency] and [National Cyber Security Centre] are seeing a growing use of COVID-19-related themes by malicious cyber actors,"" the alert stated. ""At the same time, the surge in teleworking has increased the use of potentially vulnerable services, such as virtual private networks, amplifying the threat to individuals and organizations.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/royal-air-force-head-of-recruitment-a-woman-quits-over-uk-diversity-policy-that-excludes-white-men-report,2020-07-16
Russia launched anti-satellite weapon in space according to US,"The U.S. and United Kingdom accused Russia of testing a weapon that could attack satellites in space. The U.S. Space Command said on Thursday that it had evidence that Russia ""conducted a non-destructive test of a space-based anti-satellite weapon"" last week.

The U.S. Space Command alleges that a Russian satellite ""injected a new object into orbit"" on July 15. The Russian satellite named ""Cosmos 2543"" released an unidentified object into orbit near another Russian satellite.

Cosmos 2543 is reportedly an inspector satellite, but the U.S. Space Command said the satellite's activity was ""inconsistent with their stated mission"" as an inspector satellite.

The U.S. State Department questioned the motives of the Cosmos 2543 satellite in 2018 when it exhibited ""characteristics of a space-based weapon."" The Department of State declared the behavior ""hypocritical and concerning.""

""This event highlights Russia's hypocritical advocacy of outer space arms control, with which Moscow aims to restrict the capabilities of the United States while clearly having no intention of halting its own counter space program — both ground-based anti-satellite capabilities and what would appear to be actual in-orbit anti-satellite weaponry,"" said Dr. Christopher Ford, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State.

""We don't have definitive proof, but I think it is,"" Brian Weeden, director of program planning for the Secure World Foundation, told The Verge. ""It stands out as different from all the other rendezvous and proximity operations that have been going on.

""It's mostly satellites coming close to other Russian satellites or other Russian rocket bodies slowly — like a slow approach over several days,"" said Weeden. ""And then they might back away, and then they'll come close again, then they'll hang out nearby. That's the sort of thing we've been watching.""

""On July 15, Cosmos 2543 deployed a smaller object at a relatively high speed (roughly 200 m/s or about 400 mph) that is unusual for the typical satellite deployment,"" Weeden said.

In January, Cosmos 2543 and another Russian ""inspection satellite"" named Cosmos 2542 were spotted seemingly stalking a U.S. reconnaissance satellite operated by the National Reconnaissance Office that is named ""USA 245,"" known to space experts as a ""KH-11.""



""We view this behavior as unusual and disturbing,"" Gen. John ""Jay"" Raymond, Commander of U.S. Space Command and U.S. Space Force Chief of Space Operations, told Time magazine in February. ""It has the potential to create a dangerous situation in space.""

""The United States finds these recent activities to be concerning and do not reflect the behavior of a responsible space-faring nation,"" Raymond said.

""Last November the Russian government launched a satellite that subsequently released a second satellite,"" Gen. Raymond told CNBC in February. ""These satellites have been actively maneuvering near a U.S. government satellite … which the Russian government characterized as 'inspector satellites.'""

Now Raymond is pointing out that Russia's Cosmos 2543 is likely a weapon.

""The Russian satellite system used to conduct this on-orbit weapons test is the same satellite system that we raised concerns about earlier this year, when Russia maneuvered near a U.S. government satellite,"" Raymond said in a statement. ""This is further evidence of Russia's continuing efforts to develop and test space-based systems, and consistent with the Kremlin's published military doctrine to employ weapons that hold U.S. and allied space assets at risk.""

The Space Command claims there was also a Russian anti-satellite test carried out in 2017. Russians launched a satellite and ""a smaller satellite was birthed"" and then ""a projectile was launched"" from the satellite, Stephen L. Kitay, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, told the Pentagon last month.

Kitay said that China and Russia were ""actively developing capabilities to negate U.S. allied and partnered space systems, we are left with no choice but to ensure we are prepared with the necessary means to protect and defend ourselves from attacks to our systems.""

""I wish I could say that space was a sea of tranquility and a sanctuary from attack. But the fact of the matter is, space is contested,"" Kitay added. ""Outer space has emerged as a key arena of potential conflict in an era of great power competition.""

"Report: Russian forces firing rockets at Kharkiv physics institute, which houses a nuclear reactor","Russian invaders have reportedly fired rockets at a Kharkiv, Ukraine, physics institute — a building that is said to house a nuclear reactor and more.



What are the details?

According to a Sunday report from The Independent, Ukraine's national security service has claimed that forces have been firing rockets at the institute, which they say could prompt a ""large-scale ecological disaster.""

The outlet reported that Russian forces are firing missiles from Grad launchers, which reportedly do not have precise targeting.

The facility, which houses a nuclear research division called Neutron Source, and is said to store at least 37 nuclear fuel cells.

It is unknown at the time of this reporting whether the inside of the building — and more particularly, the area in which the reactor and other nuclear materials are stored — sustained any damages from the rockets.

This week, Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs Emine Dzheppar said that the embattled country “continues to collect evidence of [Russian] war crimes for the Hague.”

What else?

The disturbing news comes on the heels of a near-miss at a Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, nuclear power station in which Russian forces stormed the facility and took over at gunpoint.

According to The Independent's report, Malcolm Grimston — honorary senior research fellow at Imperial College London's center for energy policy — said that the level of artillery necessary to destroy a nuclear power station would be immense, and beyond mere bullets and fire, indicating that Russian forces want to overtake the facility, and not trigger a large-scale disaster.



“So it’s much more consistent at least at this stage with them wanting to take a facility that happened to be a nuclear facility in that area, but not to cause a radiological incident,” he reasoned. “These power stations are an enormous asset; Ukraine gets more than half of its electricity from nuclear power. You would expect the Russians to want to maintain that because if they’re going to run it as part of Russia, it will still need energy.”

According to the Evening Standard, Linda Thomas-Greenfield — U.S. ambassador to the United Nations — on Saturday warned that Putin’s forces were closing in on a third plant in the Yuzhnoukrainsk area.

Thomas-Greenfield warned that nuclear power stations ""cannot become part of this conflict.""

Russian TV channel condemns war as staff walk out while live on air,"Staff at an independent Russian television station signed off their final broadcast by decrying war and walking out of the studio in protest.

According to a report from Newsweek, Russian authorities ordered the station to cease broadcasting over its coverage of the country's invasion of Ukraine. The reported noted that Russian authorities demanded media refrain from referring to President Vladimir Putin's invasion as a ""war"" and instead insisted they use the term ""special military operation."" Those in violation of the newly authorized law face up to 15 years in prison.

What are the details?

Station staffers signed off their final show on Thursday and walked out of the studio

""No to war,"" Natalia Sindeyeva, the station's general director, said on Thursday as staff left the studio and made the decision to air Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake,"" which according to the report, ""was aired on Soviet state TV during the collapse of the Soviet Union.""

""We need strength to exhale and understand how to work further,"" Sindeyeva said in a statement shared on the channel's website. ""We really hope that we will return to the air and continue our work.""

Ukraine News UK tweeted video footage of the walkout and captioned it, ""The Entire staff of the Russian TV channel 'the rain' resigned during a live stream with last words: 'no war' and then played 'swan lake' ballet video (just like they did on all USSR tv channels when it suddenly collapsed).""

Independent Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy this week also shut down.



""The Ekho Moskvy board of directors has decided by a majority of votes to liquidate the radio channel and the website of Ekho Moskvy,"" editor in chief Alexei Venediktov said in a statement on the closure.

Russia's prosecutor general in a statement said that such ""fake news"" — or ""information known to be false regarding the actions of Russian servicemen"" as ""part of a special operation to protect the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic"" is illegal and will not be tolerated.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan says Trump not worthy of state dinner — but look what Queen Elizabeth did,"London Mayor Sadiq Khan made headlines last week when he declared that President Donald Trump is ""not in the same class"" as previous United States presidents, citing George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and, therefore, is not worthy of a state dinner.

Fortunately for Khan, he will not have to sit through a state dinner with Trump when the president visits the United Kingdom next month.

But that does not mean Trump will not be honored with a state dinner.



In fact, according to Express UK, Queen Elizabeth II will honor Trump with a state dinner at Buckingham Palace — but Khan is not on the guest list.

""The mayor has not been invited to the state banquet,"" Jonathan Weisgard, Khan's spokesman, told Newsweek.

Khan has long been a vocal critic of the president. Khan's criticism reached a fever pitch after Trump implemented a temporary travel ban that prevented certain citizens from Muslim-majority nations, all of which have deep connections to terrorism, from traveling to the U.S. Khan, who is Muslim, has characterized the controversial policy as a ""Muslim ban.""

Meanwhile, Trump has been equally critical of the London mayor and the so-called ""knife control"" policies enacted in London.

Singer Sam Smith announces that he wants you to call him 'they/them',"Pop singer Sam Smith announced on Instagram Friday that he was changing his preferred pronouns to ""they/them.""

Smith, who has won multiple Grammys and had several number one singles in the UK, announced in March that he identified as non-binary, and that he believed he was ""neither male nor female.""

In Friday's Instagram post, Smith said, ""Today is a good day so here goes. I've decided I am changing my pronouns to THEY/THEM ❤ after a lifetime of being at war with my gender I've decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out.""

Smith continued, ""I've been very nervous about announcing this because I care too much about what people think but f*** it! I understand there will be many mistakes and mis gendering but all I ask is you please please try. I hope you can see me like I see myself now. Thank you.""



Smith concluded his post, ""Love you all. I'm scared s**tless, but feeling super free right now. Be kind x.""

Smith also thanked a number of people in the ""non binary/trans community"" who had helped him and given him ""clarity and understanding"" in his struggle.

"San Francisco Federal Reserve undercuts Biden's narrative on inflation — and no, it's not Putin's fault","The San Francisco Federal Reserve published a study this week that appeared to contradict President Joe Biden's narrative about inflation.

What is the background?

Americans are battling historic inflation and growing economic woes that appear to have no end in sight. In fact, the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the consumer price index has increased 7.9% over the past 12 months.

Unfortunately, the buck does not stop with Biden. The president has blamed inflation and other economic problems on COVID-19, the supply chain, and even Russian President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine.

What does the report say?

The study sought to understand why U.S. inflation is increasing at a much higher rate than other advanced economic countries.

The reason? The economists pointed toward COVID-19 relief bills, which pumped the economy, and Americans' pockets, full of income. In fact, they argued the stimulus bills account for about 3% of inflation.

""Since the first half of 2021, U.S. inflation has increasingly outpaced inflation in other developed countries,"" the study said.

""Estimates suggest that fiscal support measures designed to counteract the severity of the pandemic’s economic effect may have contributed to this divergence by raising inflation about 3 percentage points by the end of 2021,"" the bankers explained.

Without the massive COVID relief bills, the economists suggested the U.S. could have experienced deflation, which has benefits and drawbacks. Still, they argued the impacts of deflation ""would have been harder to manage,"" a comment that should be taken with a grain of salt considering the government is having a difficult time managing the inflation crisis.

Importantly, the study failed to conclude that Putin is to blame for inflation.

Anything else?

Because of inflation, Americans will spend approximately $5,200 more than last year, Bloomberg reported.

Inflation will mean the average U.S. household has to spend an extra $5,200 this year ($433 per month) compared to last year for the same consumption basket, according estimates by Bloomberg Economics. The excess savings built up over the pandemic, and increases in wages, will cushion those costs, and allow spending to expand at a decent pace this year. But accelerated depletion of savings will increase the urgency for those staying on the sidelines to join the labor force, and the resulting increase in labor supply will likely dampen wage growth.

According to a recent NBC poll, a ""plurality of Americans"" blame Biden and his policies for inflation, while they overwhelmingly reject Russia's culpability for America's economic woes, NBC News reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sam-smith-changes-pronouns,2022-03-30
"Scientist behind 'gold standard' model that predicted 500K deaths in UK (and 2 million in US) admits he was off, now says there will be 20K or fewer in the UK","Dr. Neil Ferguson, the extremely influential epidemiologist behind the coronavirus model that led the United States and the United Kingdom to enact shutdown measures to combat the pandemic, has now drastically revised his estimates.

Ferguson, who leads a team of researchers at the Imperial College in London, informed members of the U.K. Parliament Wednesday that deaths in the country as a result of COVID-19 are unlikely to exceed 20,000, and in fact could be much lower, the New Scientist reported.

""There will be some areas that are extremely stressed, but we are reasonably confident — which is all we can be at the current time — that at the national level we will be within capacity,"" Ferguson said.

That is a far cry from the Imperial College report last week that estimated 510,000 Britains could die from the virus if shutdown measures weren't taken, and swiftly. In the same report, it was estimated that as many as 2.2 million Americans would die.

Ferguson said the revision came after new data from around Europe suggested the virus' infection rate is higher than initially thought, and as a result, the research team has updated the virus' reproduction number.

The report was the key factor that triggered the U.K. and U.S. governments to suddenly shift from a comparatively relaxed position on the virus to draconian community mitigation measures. The New York Times reported that Ferguson has shared his projections with the White House task force and sent a copy of the report days prior.

The Times also reported that ""with ties to the World Health Organization and a team of 50 scientists, led by a prominent epidemiologist, Neil Ferguson, Imperial is treated as a sort of gold standard, its mathematical models feeding directly into government policies.""

'This is a remarkable turn'

In a Twitter thread Thursday morning, author and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson wrote, ""this is a remarkable turn from Neil Ferguson, who led the [Imperial College] authors who warned of 500,000 UK deaths.""

""He now says both that the U.K. should have enough ICU beds and that the coronavirus will probably kill under 20,000 people in the U.K. — more than 1/2 of whom would have died by the end of the year in any case [because] they were so old and sick,"" Berenson continued.

""Essentially, what has happened is that estimates of the viruses transmissibility have increased - which implies that many more people have already gotten it than we realize - which in turn implies it is less dangerous,"" he said, before adding: ""Not surprisingly, this testimony has received no attention in the US - I found it only in UK papers. Team Apocalypse is not interested.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/san-fran-federal-reserve-undercuts-biden-s-narrative-on-inflation,2020-03-26
Scientists grow synthetic embryo with brain and beating heart for first time ever,"Researchers from the University of Cambridge have created embryos from mouse stem cells that form a brain, a beating heart, and the foundations of every other organ in the body. This is a “further point in development than has been achieved in any other stem cell-derived model,” the university notes.

The scientists say their results, which come after more than a decade of work, could help researchers understand why some embryos fail while others go on to develop into a healthy pregnancy.

“Our mouse embryo model not only develops a brain, but also a beating heart, all the components that go on to make up the body,” said Cambridge professor Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, who led the team.

“This period of human life is so mysterious, so to be able to see how it happens in a dish – to have access to these individual stem cells, to understand why so many pregnancies fail and how we might be able to prevent that from happening – is quite special,” added Zernicka-Goetz.

An article posted on Cambridge’s website explains that if the methods developed by Zernicka-Goetz’s team are shown to be successful with human stem cells, those methods could also be used to “guide development of synthetic organs for patients awaiting transplants.”

“There are so many people around the world who wait for years for organ transplants,” said Zernicka-Goetz. “What makes our work so exciting is that the knowledge coming out of it could be used to grow correct synthetic human organs to save lives that are currently lost. It should also be possible to affect and heal adult organs by using the knowledge we have on how they are made.""

Scientists are working to develop synthetic human models similar to the mouse models used in this research. Their hope is to better understand the mechanisms behind processes that would be otherwise impossible to study in real embryos.

Currently, according to the Cambridge article, UK law “permits human embryos to be studied in the laboratory only up to the fourteenth day of development, but there are no rules around synthetic embryos.”

“It’s like discovering a new planet that we didn't know existed,” Zernicka-Goetz said.



The results were reported last week in the journal Nature.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scientist-predicted-500k-deaths-now-says-20k,2022-08-29
Scientists are monitoring a new COVID subvariant spreading in the UK that could be more contagious than ​Delta,"A new coronavirus subvariant that could be more contagious than the Delta variant has begun to spread in the U.K. — and scientists around the world are taking notice.

What are the details?

In a report issued last week, the U.K. Health Security Agency noted that AY.4.2, a descendant or sublineage of one of the Delta variants, has started to spread in the country and is now under ""monitoring"" status.

While data so far on the new subvariant is sparse, U.K. scientists said the viral strain ""accounted for approximately 6% of all sequences generated"" and was ""on an increasing trajectory"" in the week beginning Sept. 27.

According to BBC News, AY.4.2 was first discovered in July and had been slowly increasing since then, up until a few weeks ago, when the new subvariant's trajectory rose signififcantly.

In a tweet thread posted on Saturday, University College London Genetics Institute Director Francois Balloux indicated that the subvariant may be 10% more contagious than the most dominant Delta variant, called AY.4, which erupted like wildfire across the globe during the late summer months.

""As such, it feels worthwhile keeping an eye on it,"" Balloux noted, though he added that early indications show AY.4.2 to be only ""marginally"" more transmissible than its parent strain.

""It's nothing compared with what we saw with Alpha and Delta, which were something like 50% to 60% more transmissible,"" he told BBC.

What has been the reaction?

At this juncture, most scientists are in agreement with Balloux that the subvariant is not a cause for panic.

The new strain has not yet been elevated to a ""variant of concern"" status by the U.K. government, and in other places where it has been found — such as in Denmark and the U.S. — it has not shown a notable upward trajectory.

But everyone seems to agree that further testing and continued monitoring are needed.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as the commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under former President Trump, acknowledged that the strain is likely not a ""cause for immediate concern,"" but called for ""urgent research"" to figure out if it is more transmissible or has partial immune evasion.

""We should work to more quickly characterize these and other new variants. We have the tools,"" he tweeted over the weekend. ""This needs to be a coordinated, global priority for Covid same as similar international efforts have become standard practice in influenza.""

Dr. Jeffrey Barrett, a director of the COVID-19 Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, tweeted that AY.4.2 is the only Delta descendent ""steadily increasing,"" which suggests it has a ""consistent advantage"" over other strains.

Why does it matter?

The new data could be a fluke and the new subvariant's spread could fizzle, but it's worth pointing out that data out of the U.K. in the late spring foreshadowed the Delta variant's eventual spread in the U.S. months later.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scientists-grow-synthetic-embryo-with-brain-and-beating-heart-for-first-time-ever,2021-10-20
"Scotland residents complain police are fining them for leaving home to buy wine, other nonessential items","Scotland residents are complaining that police are fining them for leaving home to buy wine and other nonessential items, Edinburgh Live reported.

Come again?

The outlet noted that a reader contacted the editorial staff to say she was fined 30 pounds (just over $30) for leaving her residence to buy wine and snacks.

""I was walking through Holyrood Park on Sunday afternoon (5 April) [when] two officers asked to look inside my bag, and then fined me for only having crisps, other snacks, and a bottle of wine,"" she told Edinburgh Live.

A West Lothian resident tweeted that ""two people I know in West Lothian: a nurse in uniform leaving a patient's house and someone leaving a shop with just a bottle of wine [were] fined £30,"" the outlet added.

Another woman tweeted a complaint to Police Scotland that her friend was ""given a fine for buying a bottle of Prosecco,"" Edinburgh Live added.

The outlet said United Kingdom lockdown rules set up last month state residents should be leaving their houses only for ""very limited purposes,"" among them shopping for ""basic necessities."" The outlet added that that is causing confusion since there's no list defining basic necessities.

The other side of the coin

It should be noted that the woman who contacted Edinburgh Live about being fined for buying wine and snacks admitted to the outlet she had refused to comply with the officers' request to return home immediately.

In addition, a 41-year-old woman from York was fined 660 pounds (just over $825) and arrested by British Transport Police for ""loitering"" at Newcastle Central station on April 1, Edinburgh Live said, adding that she reportedly refused to tell police why she was traveling.

Scotland's parliament just voted to make pads and tampons 'free.' CBS News reported 'the US could be next.',"Scottish parliament voted almost unanimously on Wednesday to provide ""free"" feminine hygiene products to anyone who needs them, by offering pads and tampons in certain public spaces to the tune of an estimated $31 million annually.

The move makes Scotland the only country in the world to offer ""free"" sanitary products to all women, and CBS News — citing a proposed bill by a Democratic congresswoman from last year — reported that ""the U.S. could be next.""

What are the details?

Reuters reported, ""The Period Products (Free Provision) Scotland Bill passed through its first stage with 112 votes in favor, none against and one abstention."" The second stage involves members offering amendments to the legislation.

As it stands now, the proposal would mean the Scottish government would pay to make sanitary products available free of charge at places like pharmacies and community centers ""for anyone who needs them,"" according to the BBC. The country already has a federal policy of providing such products at schools and universities.

The bill's sponsor, Monica Lennon, celebrated the measure as a ""milestone moment for normalizing menstruation in Scotland and sending out that real signal to people in this country about how seriously parliament takes gender equality,"" the Washington Post reported.

Scotland's new law is in response to the movement against ""period poverty,"" the concept that not all women and girls can afford sanitary products. A gender-equality activist movement has taken hold of the issue, arguing that it is the government's responsibility to provide feminine hygiene products to the public or at the very least reduce or remove so-called ""tampon taxes"" on such items.

According to Reuters, one demonstrator participating in a rally outside Scottish Parliament on Tuesday held a sign that read, ""Access to menstrual products is a right. Period.""

CBS News reported Wednesday that:

In March 2019, Congresswoman Grace Meng, a Democrat from New York, announced the Menstrual Equity for All Act, the first comprehensive bill to address the challenges that women and girls face in obtaining feminine hygiene products in America.



'The fact that there are people who aren't able to afford these products, and as a result, may miss school may miss work, face certain stigma — I think it's a human rights issue that, especially in the United States of America, women should not have to be dealing with,' Meng said.



Meng's bill would make menstrual hygiene products free for women in prison. It would allow states to use federal funds to supply pads to girls in school. And it would require that these products be covered by Medicaid.

What CBS News did not report is that the last action on Meng's bill was taken in May of last year, when it was referred to a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee.

Nonetheless, CBS News wrote in promoting its story on the action of Scottish parliament's ""plans to make period products free for all women"": ""Scotland is the first nation in the world to do so, and the U.S. could be next.""

Sen. Tim Scott says there was 'no justification' for officer to shoot Jacob Blake,"South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate and the lawmaker who led the GOP's unsuccessful police reform effort earlier this year, said he saw ""no justification"" for a Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officer to shoot Jacob Blake seven times in the back, according to CBS News.

What did he say? ""Looking at the video, I saw no justification whatsoever for those cops to shoot that young man, Jacob,"" Scott told Gayle King. ""We need to get to the root of the issue. As the pastor who prayed before the news conference for the family said, this is a sin issue not a skin issue, though it seems to be happening far more often to folks who are African American than not. That frustrates me, to be honest with you.""

King pushed back, saying it is a ""skin issue"" when considering how police treated Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old from Illinois who killed two people during riots Tuesday night, contrasted with how police treated Blake. Rittenhouse was not arrested at the scene of the shootings, but was later arrested and charged with first-degree murder.



Is Scott correct? There is still debate about whether Officer Rusten Sheskey was justified in shooting Blake. Sheskey and other officers arrived at the scene due to a domestic disturbance call. Blake's girlfriend reportedly called 911 on him and accused him of taking her keys and refusing to leave the premises.



Officers attempted to subdue Blake, who resisted arrest, and deployed stun guns, which also failed to stop him. Blake freed himself from officers and walked from the passenger side of his car to the driver's side, where he opened the door and reached into the vehicle. That's when Sheskey shot him seven times in the back at close range.

Police say a knife was found on the floor of the driver's side where Blake was reaching, but they did not clarify whether Blake was holding the knife when he was shot, or whether it was on the floor and they believed him to be reaching for it.

What's going on now? Blake is still in the hospital, reportedly paralyzed from the waist down—a condition which doctors are still unsure whether it will be permanent. Blake's father reported that his son is handcuffed to his bed, but that police aren't dealing why.



State court records show that Blake had a warrant out for third-degree sexual assault and domestic abuse that was issued on July 7.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scotlands-parliament-just-voted-to-make-pads-and-tampons-free-cbs-news-reported-the-us-could-be-next,2020-08-27
"Senate Republicans' report: COVID-19 'more likely than not' man-made, result of Wuhan lab leak","Over 1 million Americans have been killed by COVID-19. A new Senate report claims that those lives were likely taken, not as the result of some evolutionary mishap, but rather as the result of human meddling.

The report's primary conclusion stands in stark contrast both to the COVID natural-origins narrative advanced by members of the scientific establishment, the communist Chinese regime, and the media and to the assertion made in the 2021 Congress report, which claimed a lab origin ""extremely unlikely.""

Last year, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) announced a bipartisan Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP) effort to explore the origins of COVID-19. For the past fifteen months, Republicans on the committee have reviewed hundreds of studies, interviewed various experts, and analyzed numerous reports concerning the source of the virus.

The 35-page interim report, signed solely by Burr and released on Thursday, is the product of these efforts, evidencing Republicans' commitment to establish the full truth about COVID's origins as well as their refusal to soon forgive or forget.

What are the details?

For years, some suggested — especially those with vested interests in the alternative not being found true — that the COVID-19 virus came from a bat in the Wuhan wet market or from a bat cave. If that were the case, then those performing radical experiments on coronaviruses in a sketchy Chinese lab with U.S. federal funding could not be held responsible for tens of millions of deaths.

According to the Senate GOP interim report, those theories have been found wanting.

Among the reasons to doubt the natural zoonotic spillover hypothesis were:

The intermediate host species for the virus ""if one exists, remains unidentified."" Within six months of the first human SARS case, health officials found the intermediary species responsible (palm civets and raccoon dogs).

""Unlike SARS, the genomes of early COVID-19 cases from the first months of the pandemic do not show genetic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 having circulated in another animal species other than humans.""

""The low genetic diversity of the earliest SARS-CoV-2 samples suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is most likely the result of a single successful spillover of SARS-CoV-2.""

After detailing the untenability of the claim of natural origins, the report states that, based on the data publicly available, the ""COVID-19 pandemic was, more likely than not, the result of a research-related incident.""



The report reaffirmed that China's Wuhan Institute of Virology, where coronavirus gain-of-function experiments had been conducted for years, is the likely ""high-risk"" source of the virus. Numerous biosafety failures at the WIV were detailed, all ""relevant to the containment of an aerosolized respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2.""

New insights

Although much of the report restates with greater confidence claims and evidence previously reported on, Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University, noted that Senate Republicans broke new ground with their discussion of communist China's rapid vaccine development.

The report stated that ""it is unusual"" that communist Chinese researchers were able to hit early milestones in COVID-19 vaccine development quicker than the United States.

In the exhibits provided and the questions asked, HELP Republicans intimated that China had access to the full genomic sequence of the virus well in advance of January 11, 2020, when a professor in China uploaded it to a global virus database in violation of communist Chinese restrictions on sharing information relevant to the novel virus.

In addition to being suggestive of China's willingness to hide critical lifesaving information from the world, the foreknowledge of genetic information about the virus might indicate a working Chinese understanding of SARS-CoV-2 predating the outbreak.

Response and next steps

The report appears to vindicate those castigated in recent years for suggesting that the virus was synthetic and released from the Wuhan lab. The New York Times and the Washington Post both called the claim that COVID-19 came from the WIV a ""fringe theory.""

CBS News had denounced Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) as a conspiracy theorist.

Sen. Richard Burr said he hopes the report ""will guide the World Health Organization and other international institutions and researchers as they proceed with planned work to continue investigating the origins of the virus. Uncovering the answers to this critical question is imperative to our national and international ability to ensure that a pandemic of this size and scope does not happen again.""

Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) issued a statement on Thursday in which he lauded the HELP committee Republican staff ""for their evidence-based report that confirms the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted from a research-related incident.""



Marshall considered the domestic implications of the Republican members' findings and suggested that the ""lack of NIH grant oversight may have contributed to the horrible introduction of COVID-19 to the world.""

Having recently connected NIAID Director Anthony Fauci to EcoHealth Alliance's gain-of-function experiments in China, Marshall wrote, ""If Dr. Fauci is truly open minded, as he claims to be, then he will release all texts, emails, communications, and grant records completely and without redactions.""

Fauci has long suggested that the virus occurred naturally. He repeatedly dismissed the lab-leak theory, calling it a ""circular argument."" However, in recent months, he has reportedly adopted an ""open mind."" It may have been previously closed owing to the responsibility he might have to assume, having previously defended federal funding for research on bat coronaviruses at the WIV.

House Republicans have indicated that when they win a majority in November, they will hold Fauci accountable.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted, ""Dr. Fauci lost the trust of the American people when his guidance unnecessarily kept schools closed and businesses shut while obscuring questions about his knowledge on the origins of COVID. He owes the American people answers.""

ABC News reported that Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) stated in August, ""Retirement can't shield Dr. Fauci from congressional oversight.""

While the House prepares to press Fauci and others for answers pertaining to COVID-19's ""likely"" lab origins, the Senate will press on with its bipartisan investigation.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chair of the HELP committee, indicated that the bipartisan review of COVID's origins will continue. In a Thursday statement she said, ""It is absolutely critical we learn the lessons from this pandemic so that we never find ourselves in a similar situation again—and that, of course, includes undertaking a full examination of how COVID-19 first emerged.""

"Serial killer may be prowling the streets of Stockton, already linked to at least 6 deaths: Report","At least six people in California have died and one person has suffered non-fatal injuries in connection with at least one shooter in the city of Stockton, and many now suspect that a serial killer may be on the loose.

According to police, the shootings of at least seven people — all of which were fatal, except one — can be tied directly back to one individual. Those shootings stretch as far back as April 2021 and continued as recently as September 27. All of the shootings have taken place within a few square miles, in the wee hours of the morning, while the victim was all alone.

""By definition, you could probably very well call this serial killings,"" Stockton police Chief Stanley McFadden said on Friday.

Police say they have ""physical evidence"" to link all the cases together, though they did not confirm that such evidence was related to ballistics. They did confirm that they have at least one common person of interest, whom they say is responsible for shooting:

Lawrence Lopez Sr., 54, on September 27, 2022

The unidentified woman is the only female victim and the only victim to have survived. As race and age do not appear to be a factor, police speculate that the shooter instead looks for an opportunity to ""ambush"" possible victims who happen to be out alone late at night.

""It wasn’t a robbery,"" McFadden stated. ""Items aren’t being stolen. They’re not talking about any gang activity in the area or anything. It’s just element of surprise.""

Police have released a grainy security image of the person of interest. The person is dressed all in black and no face can be seen. Police are asking the public to help them apprehend this potentially dangerous individual, though they have not ruled out the possibility that others may be involved as well.

Sharon Osbourne leaves 'The Talk' after controversial on-air comments defending Piers Morgan,"Host Sharon Osbourne has parted ways with 'The Talk,' according to a statement released by CBS on Friday. The statement claims both that Osbourne voluntarily decided to leave the show because of the impact of her March 10th comments, and also that CBS had concluded in its review of the incident that ""Sharon's behavior toward her co-hosts during the March 10 episode did not align with our values for a respectful workplace.""

The decision finally closes a chapter that had seen the show take an extended hiatus after a heated on-air discussion regarding former British television personality Piers Morgan's comments about Meghan Markle, which led to his exodus from ""Good Morning Britain"" and an investigation by United Kingdom's regulatory agency governing telecommunications.

What happened?



In a widely publicized interview with Oprah Winfrey in early March, actress Meghan Markle, who married Prince Harry and became Duchess of Sussex in 2018, made a number of sensational claims about her time with the royal family, including accusations of racism. Morgan responded to the interview on air on March 9th by stating that he did not believe Markle's comments, which led to a controversial exchange with co-host Alex Beresford, who accused Morgan of having an axe to grind with Markle over his ""personal relationship with Meghan Markle, or had one and she cut you off."" Beresford continued, ""Has she said anything about you since she cut you off? I don't think she has, but yet you continue to trash her.""

At this point, Morgan stormed off the set of the show and announced that he was leaving the show later that day. Morgan's comments sparked an investigation by Ofcom, the British regulatory agency charged with overseeing communications in Britain, which reported that they received over 40,000 complaints about Morgan's commentary.

The following day, Osbourne and her co-hosts discussed the Morgan controversy on-air on ""The Talk,"" which Osbourne has hosted since 2010.

Osbourne, who has been a long-time friend of Morgan, defended Morgan in an argument with co-host Sheryl Underwood that turned increasingly combative. ""Did I like everything he said? Did I agree with what he said? No. Because it's his opinion. It's not my opinion… I support him for his freedom of speech, and he's my friend.""

Osbourne said that she felt like she was ""about to be put in the electric chair because I have a friend who many people think is a racist and that makes me a racist."" Underwood then asked how she would respond to people who asserted that defending Morgan's comments were racist, to which she responded, ""for me, at 68 years of age to have to turn around and say 'I ain't racist' – what's it got to do with me? How could I be racist about anybody? How could I be racist about anybody or anything in my life? How can I?""

At this point, Underwood attempted to send the show to commercial, but Osbourne repeatedly talked over her, challenging her to ""educate me"" and saying to a visibly upset Underwood, ""Don't try and cry because if anyone should be crying, it should be me.""

The next day, Osbourne issued an apology on Twitter to ""anyone of color that I offended and/or to anyone that feels confused or let down by what I said."" CBS announced that the show would be taking a hiatus, which was originally scheduled to last for a mere few days, while it investigated the on-air exchange, including Osbourne's contention that she was ""set up"" by the show's producers, who she claimed ambushed her with a topic she was not prepared to discuss. However, during the course of the investigation, other current and former hosts of the show publicly accused Osbourne of racist behavior, as well as making crude comments about the sexual orientation of actress Sara Gilbert.

CBS eventually announced that the hiatus would be extended, and as the controversy dragged on, Osbourne claimed that she was being sent out as the show's ""sacrificial lamb"" for having defended Morgan.

In Friday's announcement, CBS denied Osbourne's claims, saying that their internal review ""did not find any evidence that CBS executives orchestrated the discussion or blindsided any of the hosts."" Additionally, CBS promised that it was ""coordinating workshops, listening sessions and training about equity, inclusion and cultural awareness for the hosts, producers and crew.""

Osbourne did not immediately respond to requests for comment from multiple news outlets.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/serial-killer-may-be-prowling-the-streets-of-stockton-already-linked-to-at-least-6-deaths-report,2021-03-27
'Significantly more contagious' COVID-19 variant from UK has hit the US,"A variant of COVID-19 spreading through the United Kingdom is now in America, as confirmed by Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) who announced Tuesday that his state has discovered its first case of the ""significantly more contagious"" virus.

What are the details?

Polis' office issued a notice saying that a man in his 20s tested positive for the B.1.1.7. variant to COVID-19, pointing out that the individual ""is currently in isolation in Elbert County and has no travel history.""

The governor said in a statement, ""There is a lot we don't know about this new COVID-19 variant, but scientists in the United Kingdom are warning the world that it is significantly more contagious.""

According to The Daily Mail, the B.1.1.7. mutation is possibly as much as 70% ""more infectious and more of a concern for children,"" and has been detected in roughly 60% of the recent COVID-19 cases in London.

But the The Washington Post reported:

Although the U.K. variant appears more contagious, it is not leading to higher rates of hospitalizations or deaths, according to a report from Public Health England, a government agency. Nor is there any sign that people who were infected months ago with the coronavirus are more likely to be reinfected if exposed to the variant, according to the report. All available evidence indicates that vaccines, and immunity built up in the population, should be protective against this variant.



Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokeswoman Belsie González said in an email to CBS News that the agency ""is aware of Colorado's report of the first U.S. case associated with the U.K. variant of COVID-19.""

González noted, ""In addition to the reported case in Colorado, we expect that there will be additional cases that are likely to be detected in the coming days.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sharon-osbourne-leaves-the-talk-after-controversial-on-air-comments-defending-piers-morgan,2020-12-30
"WATCH: Sky News promo has Trump casting giant, diaper-clad shadow across UK ahead of state visit","Well, this is something, alright. It's the new promo that Sky News has put out to pitch their wall-to-wall coverage of President Trump's three-day state visit to the UK, which begins on Monday, June 3rd.

The ad shows a giant shadow crossing over London, Buckingham Palace, even the Queen, as dramatic music swells to a crescendo, when the shadow's caster is revealed: a giant blimp of Trump as a baby in diapers.

Watch:

That blimp or parade balloon, whatever you may call it, has made several appearances since Trump took office, as Blaze readers surely recall.

That is truly a test of the eye of the beholder. Are they mocking him? Fearing him? Is it casting him as bigger than the UK? More important? What is his shadow?

Or it's just a humorous play on the fact that he's coming, that his visit is really big news, and also that the baby ballon that protesters use every time he crosses the pond or there's a protest has become a bit of a cultural phenomenon.

That would be my bet. But hey, what do I know, I'm just an American.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/significantly-more-contagious-covid-19-variant-from-uk-has-hit-us,2019-06-02
'I'm very embarrassed to be American': Watch soccer fans who shouted 'F*** Trump' on Fox after World Cup give post-chant interviews,"After the U.S. women's national soccer team took a second consecutive World Cup trophy on Sunday, there was widespread celebration from Americans around the world, both on television and on social media.

Naturally, there are always apples that spoil the bunch, and in this case it was rowdy fans in the background of a live Fox News Channel shot from a bar in France. Afterward, the gang was interviewed about the moment. But before we get to that scintillating clip, here's the Fox News shot that went mega-viral on Sunday afternoon.

Naturally, here's a great big LANGUAGE WARNING before you click play.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

The video went everywhere, and verified people like video producer for MoveOn, Sarah Pearlman, who first shared it, thought it was just the bee's knees, as the kids say. As you can imagine, there were a number of other verified Twitter accounts on the left that found the clip delightful.

But it wasn't the end of the story. You may have thought it was a passing or momentary outburst from folks a little drunk and a lot excited, and bound to result in a bit of regret by those accidentally made famous when the clip went viral.

But nope.

Irish blog/online newspaper JOE.co,uk caught up with the revelers and interviewed them shortly after the clip was heard round the world, and talked with them about it, about America, and in some ways, talked a little bit about the actual sporting event that took place.

""""Right now I'm very embarrassed to be American,"" said the fan JOE identified as having started the ""F*** Trump"" chant.

The others weren't much better. These obviously millennial Americans had put on quite an international show with their mantra, and the interviews they gave afterward had almost as much substance.



""I mean, I think our team really represents what America is about,"" said the ringleader, in a red but non-MAGA baseball cap that had a non-Betsy Ross American flag on it. ""So we have diversity racially, we have an LGBTQ population represented, and that's what Americans get behind.""

""So, I think Trump is really the old guard and it's kind of the last grasp for them to keep power,"" he continued. ""But power should be divided amongst everyone.""

The next person interviewed was a female fan, whose remarks consisted in the main of observing that the players are also female.

After that was a young male fan, who explained how female fans should feel now that the World Cup has presented a great opportunity for them to see ""their idols"" on a big stage for the first time ever in this, the team's fourth win.

They cut back to the red American flag hat-wearing ringleader, who said it's ""definitely a risk taking a political stance"" that may 'alienate some fans"", but that ""whether it's [Megan] Rapinoe, whether it's NBA stars like LeBron [James] or Steph Curry, it's gotta come from the population."" It's not exactly clear what that meant, but his easy command of current NBA news shows what a true fan of sport he is.

""Hopefully in 2020, there'll be a different story, because right now, I'm very embarrassed to be American,"" the sports expert jock said thoughtfully. ""it's time for people in our country to stop believing all these lies. It's really depressing that there are those that are so uneducated that they'll believe everything he says.""

The rocket science continued with the next interviewee, who said that ""so far as this tournament's been going, I think it's been huge for the women in general."" He also added that he thinks ""this tournament and this game is just going to be very impactful.""

As that engaging fellow went off, presumably to chew on a pipe and contemplate the whirling, transient nodes of thought careening through a cosmic vapor of invention that were aglow in his mind, the JOE cameras turned next to another American youth, this one in mirrored sunglasses, who discussed the increasing popularity of women's soccer as evidenced by the fact he saw so many Americans there in Europe across ""an entirely different sea.""

Next, they cut back to the young woman from earlier in the video who'd observed that the women's soccer team members were women. In her second shot at the camera, she said that the tournament is ""huge"" already, ""just because the viewership and the attendance of the games.""

The clip ends with a shot from the bar as the crowd sings ""We Are the Champions,"" although based on the discussion, it's not exactly clear who ""we"" is supposed to be.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sky-news-trump-promo-shadow-baby,2019-07-08
Social media divided over viral video that shows 2 officers breaking up a mall fight between a white teen and black teen,"A New Jersey police department is under fire after their response to a mall fistfight between two teens.

Viral video documenting the incident has social media divided, with some wondering why two officers cuffed a black teen while the other teen, a white male — who, according to the video, appears to have physically instigated the fight — casually watched, even sitting on a nearby couch while viewing the spectacle.

What are the details?

The fight broke out at Bridgewater Commons mall in Bridgewater Township, New Jersey, on Saturday, and video captured the two boys arguing.

The black teen, 14-year-old Z'Kye Husain, said that the fight began when he stood up to the as-yet identified white teen for bullying a younger boy.

""“He was kind of saying, like, ‘You’re a little kid, you’re my little pet,’ and stuff like that,” he told WNBC-TV.

The white teen was seen in the video shouting at Z'Kye, pointing his finger in his face as an increasingly agitated Z'Kye began pushing his hand away.

The white teen appeared to then shove Z'Kye, prompting the two to begin throwing punches at one another.

The white teen then tackled Z'Kye onto the nearby couch as he continued swinging.

Z'Kye, in response, swung at the white teen, striking him several times.

After several moments, two Bridgewater police officers intervened and yanked the two boys apart.

One of the officers pushed the white teen onto the couch and assisted her partner in cuffing the black teen — who was pinned face-down on the ground at that point — while the white teen watched. The male officer was seen holding the teen to the floor with his knee on the teen's mid-back as the female officer assisted, plying her knee on the teen's upper back.

The officers were able to cuff the black teen without any incident, and the teen did not fight back.

The white teen remained on the couch as officers scrambled to detain Z'Kye.

Z'Kye told WNBC that he remained calm because he knew that he'd have no problem following police orders.

""I was, like, calm because I knew not to be scared,"" he reasoned. ""Just stay calm and not move and do what they tell me to do.""

In a statement to NBC News, the mall announced that both teens have been banned from the shopping center for three years.

What has been the response?

Z'Kye's mother, Eboné, told the station that she can't fathom why it would take two police officers to restrain and cuff a teenage boy who was not resisting.

“It doesn’t take two cops to hold a 14-year-old boy down who’s not resisting, while the other boy is just kind of going free and still going off on my son. It just doesn’t make sense,” she said. “It’s not fair that we are constantly having to fear the cops. I’m just glad it happened where there were a whole bunch of eyes on the situation, ’cause I don’t know what would have happened.”

In a Monday statement on the incident, a spokesperson for the Bridgewater Police Department said, ""We recognize that this video has made members of our community upset and are calling for an internal affairs investigation.""

The post in its entirety read:

The Bridgewater Twp Police Department is aware of a video on social media of our officers stopping a fight in progress at the Bridgewater Commons Mall. We recognize that this video has made members of our community upset and are calling for an internal affairs investigation. The officers were able to respond quickly to this incident and stop it from escalating because of a tip we received from the community. We have requested that the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office assist us in this matter and are requesting patience as we strictly adhere to the New Jersey Attorney General’s Internal Affairs Directive. https://www.njoag.gov/iapp/ We appreciate the videos that we have already received from community members and ask that anyone who has a video of this incident please email it to tips@bridgewaterpd.com. The men and women of the Bridgewater Township Police Department are thankful for our community partners and look forward to continuing to build our positive relationships.





What did people say?

The department's Monday post received a plethora of attention, with a lengthy thread debate containing least 2,700 comments.

In response to the post, one angry Facebook user thundered, “The fact that one of your officers turned their back and their gun to someone who was just involved in a fight, allowing that person to STAND and approach the officers and the person they were fighting is justification for termination.”

""Before commenting let the investigation be done,"" another user reasoned. ""Commenting beforehand only shows ones own ignorance. TY Bridgewater PD for making Bridgewater one of the safest towns in the nation!!""

“We want an independent investigation,"" another user demanded, arguing that both teens ought to have been detained. ""If we are going to restrain youth, both should have been restrained. Blackness is not more threatening."" One user called for people to wait for the results of the investigation before forming an opinion.

""Thank you for hosting this discussion and undergoing the review,"" the user wrote. ""Your professionalism is key. If mistakes were found to be made, I have no doubt that the force will continue to develop as it had along with Bridgewater these decades.""

Another wrote, ""Your officers have done immeasurable damage to the students in our community. Their actions have proven that white privilege and racism exist in their community and that black children cannot trust the police to be fair. You should reach out to the school system to attempt to rectify this. Trust of the police must be earned. Actions speak louder than empty words so it won’t be easy. Very disappointed and disgusted with the officers and police department in general.""





What else?

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy (D) expressed concern over the video on Tuesday.

""Although an investigation is still gathering the facts about this incident, I’m deeply disturbed by what appears to be racially disparate treatment in this video,"" he tweeted. ""We’re committed to increasing trust between law enforcement and the people they serve.”

Z'Kye has hired civil rights attorney Ben Crump in connection with the detainment.

""Z’Kye, an 8th grader, was noble to defend his friend from bullies; however, it is evident that officers immediately assumed that because of the color of Z’Kye’s skin, him acting nobly was not even in the realm of possibility. That video says it all,"" Crump said in a statement shared to social media. ""Z’Kye was no more of a threat to those officers than the white teen who fought with him. This is another example of the kind of racial bias that we need to root out of our system of policing. These officers need to be reprimanded and retrained to overcome the implicit bias that results in unequal — and often dangerous — treatment of black people.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/soccer-fans-eff-trump-interviewed,2022-02-17
Social media 'influencer' goes viral after licking a toilet. Now he's reportedly in the hospital with COVID-19.,"A Beverly Hills social media influencer is reportedly hospitalized after contracting COVID-19 — mere days after licking a public toilet bowl.

What are the details?

The influencer, 21-year-old ""Larz,"" went viral earlier this week after sharing a video of himself licking a toilet bowl, according to the Daily Mail.

He reportedly shared the video with the caption ""RT to spread awareness for the Coronavirus.""

Larz announced in a since-deleted tweet that he was diagnosed with the coronavirus.



According to The Gay UK, video of the incident gained more than 90,000 views before being yanked off the internet.

A later post reportedly included a video of the influencer lying in a hospital bed. In the video, he reportedly says that he's ""pretty doped up from his meds.""

What else?

The social media influencer gained notoriety after reportedly being involved in viral videos featuring him licking stores' ice cream cartons and more.



He was just one of many young people who engaged in a bizarre summer 2019 trend of defiling ice cream in stores and filming the act for posterity.

Larz, who interviewed in 2019 with Dr. Phil McGraw, also previously said that his own family is ""irrelevant.""

""None of them have followers, if they got followers or got rich, I'd probably talk to them again,"" he reasoned.

Outrage mounts over 'soft' treatment of Islamic terrorist responsible for abuse and deaths of four Americans,"Sudanese-born former British national El Shafee Elsheikh joined ISIS and committed atrocities in Iraq and Syria between 2012 and 2015. Elsheikh was personally involved in the kidnapping, torture, and murder of 26 journalists and aid workers, including four Americans. Spared the death penalty by former U.S. Attorney General William Barr so that British prosecutors would cooperate, the Islamic terrorist was ultimately brought to the U.S. to stand trial. He was subsequently given eight life sentences by a U.S. District Court in Virginia on August 19.

Although he was expected to spend the rest of his days in solitary confinement at an American supermax prison, the Daily Mail reported that he has been assigned to a laxer prison where he may be permitted to fraternize with other prisoners. This revelation has stoked outrage as well as fears that the 34-year-old terrorist may radicalize some of the prison population.

The terrorist will reportedly avoid the supermax on account of his lawyers suggesting he has exhibited ""signs of mental and physical deterioration from his present and past detention."" The lawyers reportedly cited several instances of prisoner suicides at supermax prison ADX Florence as additional cause for concern.

Research director at the Centre for Crime Prevention David Spencer told the MailOnline, ""If it's special treatment for him and it's on the grounds of his mental health it looks soft in light of what he's done and the impact of his horrific actions on his victims and their loved ones.""

Spencer noted that the decision not to confine Elsheikh to the supermax prison where other such terrorists and murderers posing threats to national security are kept demonstrates ""a lack of consistency.""

One U.S. prison insider told the Mirror that the victims' families have no idea how Elsheikh, the highest-profile ISIS fighter to stand trial in the U.S., avoided the supermax prison. ""They were sure he was to see out his days at ADX, but they have now been told he has been sent to the lesser penitentiary. It's a huge kick in the teeth.""

The difference

ADX Florence, dubbed the ""Alcatraz of the Rockies,"" is America's highest-security ""supermax"" prison. Run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, ADX Florence is home to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who committed the Boston Marathon bombing; Theodore Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber; Ramzi Yousef, the architect of the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing; Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman; and a handful of other terrorists and violent degenerates.

The prison's 410 or so inmates are confined to single-person 7'x12' cells for 23 hours a day. In prisoners' single hour outside their concrete boxes, they are shackled and placed in a concrete ditch, ten steps wide.

ADX Florence inmates eat and sleep alone.

The Islamic hate preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri reportedly begged to be released, clawing on his door to get out. Hamza's lawyers deemed the prison's conditions ""inhuman and degrading.""

Elsheikh has reportedly been spared internment in ADX Florence, whose ""inhuman"" conditions are far more humane than those he subjected his victims to. Instead, he will spend his sentence at USP Florence High.

USP Florence High, located on the same site, is home to 638 inmates. Unlike ADX Florence, which is a super-maximum security prison/administrative maximum ""control-unit"" prison,"" Florence High is a high-security federal prison. The prison has visitation, educational program areas, a barbershop, a commissary, a chapel, and an exercise area.

Unlike ADX Florence, Florence High enables interaction among inmates and keeps prisoners in a less restrictive environment.

The crimes

Raj Parekh, lead prosecutor and first assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, had requested that Elsheikh's punishment reflect the Islamic terror group's engagement in ""the systematic torture and abuse of their victims, ultimately resulting in the horrific deaths of at least eight American, British and Japanese citizens, among others, including gruesome executions that were videotaped and broadcast globally.""

Elsheikh's captives were tortured in a variety of ways, including waterboarding, mock executions, food deprivation, electric shocks, and prolonged beatings. Some of those who survived the tortures were pitted to fight one another. Many were executed on camera. Videos of their beheadings were widely circulated on social media.

Elsheikh received his guilty verdict for hostage taking and conspiracy to commit murder in April.

Judge T.S. Ellis III said the terrorist's conduct could only be described as ""horrific, barbaric, brutal, callous, and, of course, criminal.""

The radicalization risk

In England, the nation to which Elsheikh had fled as a child refugee, prisons are hotbeds for Islamic extremism and radicalization.

In 2014, former chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick, who had spent time in over 40 jails, said he observed a trend of inmates convicted of terrorism offenses trying to influence and pressure others.

Counterterrorism expert Ian Acheson, tasked with investigating the spread of Islamic extremism, indicated that Islamic hate literature proliferated in prisons. ""My team found evidence that jihadist radicalization is such a serious problem inside some of Britain's jails that it threatens prison legitimacy.""

A number of terror attacks in Britain were executed by criminals who had been radicalized in U.K. prisons.

When the current prime minister of Britain, Liz Truss, then the justice minister, examined the trend, she noted, ""We cannot have a situation where we have extremist prisoners influencing others who are vulnerable to those messages.""

Islamists like Anjem Choudary, linked to a network of violent jihadists and brutal slayings, often find a receptive audience behind bars. Choudary, who ultimately was placed in solitary confinement, had radicalized a wave of Muslims and encouraged them to wage jihad.

Former al Qaeda recruiter Jesse Morton claimed in 2016 that ""when I was incarcerated for terrorist-related crimes, [radicalization] went on very frequently in general, mainstream or medium or high-security prisons as well.""

While radicalization in prison remains a problem in Britain, the U.S. has by no means been immune.

Former Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.) acknowledged, ""Over the years, our Federal prisons have become a breeding ground for radicalization.""

Prison radicalization expert Mark Hamm, a professor at Indiana State University, told FoxNews.com, ""It is not the sheer number of prisoners following extremist interpretations of religious doctrines that poses a threat ... Rather, it is the potential for the single individual to become radicalized.""

While not immune to prison radicalization, a 2018 George Washington University policy paper indicated that American prisons like ADX Florence benefit from ""isolation strategies.""

Unlike in some European countries that use co-location strategies, in which extremists are concentrated in one facility to lessen the likelihood they will radicalize those who do not already share their views, in certain American prisons, extremists can be locked down and atomized ""so that they can neither form ties to other extremists nor radicalize others.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/social-media-influencer-goes-viral-after-licking-a-toilet-now-hes-reportedly-in-the-hospital-with-covid-19,2022-09-27
"Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, wife of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, tests positive for COVID-19","Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.

What are the details?

Midday on Thursday, the prime minister tweeted, ""I have some personal news to share today. Sophie recently returned from a speaking event in the UK, and last night she was experiencing mild flu-like symptoms. She's feeling better, but following the advice of our doctor she is self-isolating as we wait on COVID-19 test results.""



Trudeau went on to say that he would ""be self-isolating and self-monitoring"" and work from home until his wife's test results came back.

On Thursday evening, the prime minister's office announced that Gregoire Trudeau tested positive for COVID-19 and said in a statement:

The Prime Minister is in good health with no symptoms. As a precautionary measure and following the advice of doctors, he will be in isolation for a planned period of 14 days. Also on the advice of doctors, he will not be tested at this stage since he has no symptoms. For the same reason, doctors say there is no risk to those who have been in contact with him recently.

Mrs. Gregoire Trudeau issued a statement following her diagnosis, saying in part, ""Although I'm experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon. Being in quarantine at home is nothing compared to other Canadian families who might be going through this and for those facing more serious health concerns.""

She added, ""I send you all my courage and warm thoughts (but only 'get better' hugs from afar!)""

Spain's prime minister asks EU to debate considering COVID-19 an endemic virus like the flu and end the pandemic,"The prime minister of Spain has joined a growing chorus of European leaders calling for COVID-19 to be treated as an endemic virus like the flu, rather than a pandemic virus necessitating enormous disruptions in people's lives.

In a radio interview with Spain's Cadena SER on Monday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said it is time to re-evaluate COVID. He called on the European Union to debate the possibility of treating the virus as an endemic illness, according to CNBC.

“The situation is not what we faced a year ago,” Sanchez said, explaining that it is safe for Spanish children to return to school after the holidays.

“I think we have to evaluate the evolution of COVID to an endemic illness, from the pandemic we have faced up until now,” he added. The Spanish leader said European nations should debate a gradual reappraisal of the pandemic ""at the technical level and at the level of health professionals, but also at the European level.""

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson made similar remarks last year, when he said the British public eventually will have to ""learn to live with the virus."" Although the Omicron variant has caused a ""tidal wave"" of new cases, according to Johnson, the U.K. government has not yet enacted new coronavirus restrictions. In fact, the U.K. has reduced the period of required isolation for individuals who test positive for COVID from seven days to five, CNBC reported.

U.K. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC on Sunday that the country was on the road ""from pandemic to endemic"" as disruptive coronavirus restrictions are eased.

Now that Omicron cases appear to be falling in the U.K., experts say the country could be one of the first to declare the pandemic over.



A pandemic virus is said to become endemic when viral infections are commonly found in the population, usually in seasonal intervals. Over time, as most people develop natural immunity to the disease or get vaccinated against it, the virus will affect only relatively small segments of the population, rather than hitting everyone hard at once.



While Sanchez and a handful of other European leaders argue that COVID-19 is beginning to look like an endemic disease, health experts say it is too early to consider COVID endemic. The World Health Organization forecast Tuesday that in the next six to eight weeks, more than half the people in Europe and Central Asia could be infected with the Omicron variant, which is highly contagious though appears to cause less severe disease.

“In terms of endemicity, we’re still a way off, and I know there’s a lot of discussion around that right now,” Dr. Catherine Smallwood, a senior emergency officer at the WHO Europe, said at a press conference Tuesday.

Her comments come as European nations reported record numbers of COVID infections caused by the Omicron variant. In recent days, France has reported more than 300,000 new daily cases, and Germany reported 80,430 new infections on Wednesday, a record high, according to Reuters.



“Endemicity assumes that there’s stable circulation of the virus, at predictable levels and potentially known and predictable waves of epidemic transmission,” Smallwood said.

“But what we’re seeing at the moment coming into 2022 is nowhere near that, we still have a huge amount of uncertainty, we still have a virus that’s evolving quite quickly and posing new challenges so we’re certainly not at the point of being able to call it endemic.

'Terror-related'?

Police say that details are still coming in regarding the events at London Bridge, but as a precaution, they are treating it as ""terror-related.""

At this stage, the circumstances relating to the incident at #LondonBridge remain unclear. However, as a precaution, we are currently responding to this incident as though it is terror-related.



One man has been shot by police. We will provide further information when possible.

On June 3, 2017, a terrorist attack on London Bridge left eight dead and dozens more injured.

The three Islamic State terrorists, inspired by ISIS, rammed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before exiting the vehicle and going on a stabbing spree in the nearby Borough Market.

The terrorists shouted, ""This is for Allah,"" as they swung their knives indiscriminately.

As of yet, there are no reports linking terrorism with Friday's incident.

Starbucks UK partners with LGBTQ charity that helps trans kids find hormone treatments,"Starbucks U.K. is launching a partnership with a charity that advises transgender children on gender dysphoria, including, but not limited to, locating access to hormone treatments.

The charity also connects children and their parents with resources to help determine what resources they may need should they decide to transition.

What are the details?

Starbucks will sell ""mermaid tail cookies"" that will benefit the charity. Proceeds from the sales of the cookies will go to expanding the charity's outreach, reports say.

According to BBC LGBT correspondent Ben Hunte, who revealed the news on Twitter Friday, the charity is called Mermaids, an organization that aims to act as an advocate for trans kids and their parents.

On Twitter, Hunte wrote, ""Breaking @StarbucksUK is launching a £100,00+ partnership with trans equality charity @Mermaids_Gender. Starbucks will sell a 'mermaid tail cookie' and launch a national ad campaign promoting trans rights.""

""The money,"" he continued, ""will extend the Mermaids helpline.""

According to Mermaids' website, the grassroots organization has ""evolved into one of the UK's leading LGBTQ+ charities, empowering thousands of people with its secure online communities, local community groups, helpline services, web resources, events and residential weekends.""

The site also advises parents on how to handle your child's gender dysphoria, placing utmost importance on support.

""Supporting your child doesn't mean they'll take a particular direction or follow a particular medical pathway, like hormone therapy or gender affirming surgeries,"" the site says. ""Still, if they do, then medical transition in young people usually consists of taking hormone blockers after the initial stages of puberty.""

""Hormone blockers stop the young person's body changing in ways they don't want it to at that time, in the hope it will alleviate any distress those changes may be causing them,"" the site adds. ""Blockers simply give time for them to reflect; they can stop at any point and a puberty typically associated with the gender they were assigned at birth will resume.""

What else?

A video advertisement for the campaign aired on Sunday, according to The Independent.



The outlet reports that the video features a transgender navigating the difficulty of being referred to by his previous female name.

""James,"" who was formerly known as ""Jemma,"" can be seen in various stages of discomfort in hearing people call him ""Jemma"" though he's clearly male-presenting.

Later in the clip, James visits his local Starbucks, where the baristas refer to him as James and nothing else. It concludes with a smiling James, and hashtag #WhatsYourName.

Susie Green, CEO of Mermaids, says, ""The funds raised through #whatsyourname will allow us to make a meaningful change to our helpline that supports young trans people and their families who are so desperately in need of access to information and reassurance.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stabbing-attack-on-london-bridge,2020-02-04
MSNBC reporter offers a fake definition of 'democratic socialism' that even socialists have debunked,"From Walter Duranty denying the horrors of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union to another New York Times reporter, Herbert Matthews, assuring the public that Cuba's Fidel Castro was ""decidedly anti-communist,"" leftists have historically relied on gullible American journalists to spread misinformation on their behalf. As it tends to do, history repeats itself this year.

With the strong possibility of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) becoming the nominee of the Democratic Party, liberal media personalities are already working overtime to normalize the self-described democratic socialist and his movement. The effort was kicked off by economist Paul Krugman who opined in a risible New York Times column, ""Bernie Sanders Is Not a Socialist,"" that the septuagenarian presidential candidate's use of the label is the result of bad ""personal branding"" and not a reflection of his ideology — his pledge to nationalize nearly a third of the American economy and record of endorsing militant Trotskyites be damned, I guess.

Not to be outdone, on Friday MSNBC reporter Stephenie Ruhle released a video that attempted to normalize Sanders' and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's ideology with a definition of democratic socialism that is demonstrably false.

According to Ruhle, ""while democratic socialists do borrow some ideas from socialism, they are not what you think of when you think traditional socialists."" She then defines democratic socialism as the enactment of some socialist ideas through the democratic process.

""They are not calling for communal ownership of property,"" she insisted, adding ""the goal of democratic socialists is to control prices of certain essential services..."" Ruhle then claimed the U.S. already has democratic socialism and cites Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare as examples.

These claims are illogical and untrue. Democratic socialists are explicitly calling for collective ownership and control of property and while Ruhle is right that they seek to establish socialism through the legislative process, her baseline definition of ""socialism,"" as harmless government programs, has no basis in the actual, and very ambitious, agenda of democratic socialists. Don't take my word for it, democratic socialist leaders say so themselves.

In fact, the very first sentence of a 2018 Voxarticle written by Jacobin's Meagan Day, titled ""Democratic socialism, explained by a democratic socialist,"" is a direct quote from Ruhle claiming that democratic socialism does not mean ""communal ownership of production,"" which the author then proceeds to debunk. ""In the long run, democratic socialists want to end capitalism,"" Day wrote — point blank, without any equivocations.

Day goes even further and admits that while some political observers — like MSNBC's Ruhle — seem to equate democratic socialism with FDR's programs, the democratic socialist agenda is far more radical than that of New Deal liberals: abolishing the free enterprise system. ""Our goal is not to rein in the excesses of capitalism for a few decades at a time — we want to end our society's subservience to the market.""

Other democratic socialist leaders have been equally explicit. The national director of the Democratic Socialists of America said in an August 2018 radio interview that their movement seeks ""a society where workers control things,"" including converting private businesses into employee-owned co-ops.

Democratic socialists have also rejected claims that they only want the United States to be more like Scandinavia. As Marquette University professor Michael A. McCarthy explained in a Jacobin article titled ""Democratic Socialism Isn't Social Democracy,"" their goal is far more ""public ownership of the economy than currently exists"" in countries like Denmark and Sweden.

These are not just the musings of activists and intellectuals. Bernie Sanders' own ""Corporate Accountability and Democracy"" plan calls for collective control and ownership of corporations by forcing owners to give up 20% of their stock and 45% control of their enterprises. As British economist Ryan Bourne argued in a February 2020 article, these policies are even more radical than those proposed by the UK's Jeremy Corbyn, who no one disputes is a socialist.

Plainly stated, for Stephanie Ruhle's definition of ""democratic socialism"" to be true, one would also have to believe that the way prominent democratic socialists define their own ideology — both what it is and what it is not — is false. Of course, this defies common sense, but MSNBC insists on insulting the intelligence of its viewers to normalize left-wing extremism. At one point in her video, Ruhle even suggests that Karl Marx's assertion that socialism is interchangeable with communism was wrong, which is so absurd that it is laughable.

The fact is that despite the best efforts by MSNBC, the New York Times, and others to gaslight American voters, we know exactly what democratic socialism is and what it is not because, to their credit, democratic socialists are more honest than they are. To paraphrase Groucho (the better) Marx: Who are you going to believe, MSNBC or your lying eyes?",https://www.theblaze.com/news/starbucks-partners-charity-that-helps-trans-kids-find-hormone-treatments,2020-02-29
Store caves to Twitter mob outraged at sign asking customers to report tampon thieves. Mob adds stealing tampons is OK since they 'should be free.',"A grocery store in the United Kingdom hatched a plan that most would consider rather normal: Curtailing shoplifters.

So a sign reading ""Help us build safer communities — report shoplifting to a member of staff"" was placed by the tampons in a Tesco store in Kensington, London, BuzzFeed News reported.

Oops

Soon a photo of the sign was posted on Twitter with the following retort: ""We really need a genuine conversation as a society about what 'safety' means.""

""Signs like these encourage ordinary people to be suspicious and resentful toward their neighbors, rather than be angry about the root causes of someone needing to shoplift menstrual products,"" the poster, Oonagh Ryder, told BuzzFeed News. ""The UK has very high levels of inequality due to the decisions of successive governments, with increasing numbers of people unable to afford basic necessities.""

The sentiment caught fire, the outlet reported. Here are just a few of the subsequent reactions:

""Shoplifting isn't the problem,"" another Twitter user added. ""It's the fact that sanitary products aren't free and accessible to those who menstruate.""

Another user noted, ""If the government can offer free condoms then they should offer free sanitary products.""

""If I see someone stealing feminine hygiene products of all things from a huge chain supermarket, I'm minding my business.... and you should, too,"" another Twitter user said.

""These products should be free,"" yet another user declared. ""I'ma pretend I ain't seen nothin', ladies.""

Caving to the mob

With that, Tesco caved — apologizing for the sign and removing it, BuzzFeed News reported, adding that a company spokesman said claimed the sign in the viral photo was placed ""in error.""

""We know that the cost of buying essential sanitary products can be a real struggle for some, which is why we were the first retailer to cover the cost of the 'tampon tax' [also known as the 'pink tax'] to make these items more affordable,"" the spokesperson added to the outlet. “We want everyone to feel welcome in our stores and are very sorry for any offense caused.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stephanie_ruhle_fake_definition_socialism,2020-02-07
George Mason student activists want to keep Justice Brett Kavanaugh from teaching summer course,"Some university students in Virginia are urging the school's administrators to stop Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh from teaching a study abroad summer course in the United Kingdom.

Dozens of students at George Mason University in Fairfax told Campus Reform that the sexual misconduct allegations made against Kavanaugh by college professor Christine Blasey Ford last summer were reason enough to block him from teaching.

""[T]he accusations against him are enough to make it a negative thing to have him on campus,"" some students reportedly said.

GMU's Antonin Scalia Law School hired Kavanaugh to co-teach a two-week course titled, ""Creation of the Constitution,"" in Runnymede, England, starting in June, according to The College Fix.

Blasey Ford claimed that Kavanaugh had attempted to sexually assault her decades ago when she was in high school. Kavanaugh adamantly denied the accusations.

A federal investigation cleared Kavanaugh of the allegations, and he was later confirmed as a Supreme Court justice.

What's the story?

Several students from a student-led advocacy group, dubbed Mason For Survivors, shared their grievances against the hiring of Kavanaugh during Wednesday's Board of Visitors meeting.

""As a survivor of sexual assault this decision has really impacted me negatively,"" one female student said, according to The College Fix. ""It is affecting my mental health knowing that an abuser will be part of our faculty.""

""We are fighting to eradicate sexual violence on this campus. But the hiring of Kavanaugh threatens the mental well-being of all survivors on this campus,"" another female student said during the meeting.

Others said they would be uncomfortable just knowing Kavanaugh could be on the school's campus.

""As someone who has survived sexual assault three times, I do not feel comfortable with someone who has sexual assault allegations like [that] walking on campus,"" a female student reportedly told the board.

The group has also started an online petition demanding that the university end its affiliation with the Supreme Court justice.

""Terminate AND void ALL contracts and affiliation with Brett Kavanaugh at George Mason University,"" the petition reads.

The petition calls for the university to hold a town hall meeting to ""discuss Kavanaugh's hiring and implications for students and the university"" no later than April 25 and it requests that the administration release ""any and all documents"" related to Kavanaugh's position on the faculty.

The petition, which has garnered more than 3,300 signatures, also calls on school officials to issue a ""formal apology"" to sexual assault survivors.

What did the university say?

GMU President Angel Cabrera has shown no intention of giving in to the students' request to remove Kavanaugh from teaching the course.

""I respect the views of people who disagreed with Justice Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation due to questions raised about his sexual conduct in high school. But he was confirmed and is now a sitting Justice,"" Cabrera said, according to Fox News.

""The law school has determined that the involvement of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice contributes to making our law program uniquely valuable for our students. And I accept their judgment,"" he added. ""This decision, controversial as it may be, in no way affects the university's ongoing efforts to eradicate sexual violence from our campuses.""

What else?

Some students believe that the decision shows that the university doesn't care for their safety and well-being.

""As a survivor, as a student who comes to this university, and expects to have a good education, to experience a happy, safe place, I am insulted. Cabrera, our president, it seems as if he's not standing with survivors, it's as if he doesn't care about us as students, and about our safety, and our well-being,"" GMU student Elijah Nichols told WDVM-TV.

Studies find potentially effective medicine for coronavirus treatment and prevention that's readily available,"Three separate medical studies have found a potentially effective treatment for the coronavirus that could also be useful in preventing infections in some cases.

The coronavirus, known as COVID-19, is viewed as a particularly potent threat because there is currently no medical treatment and no preventative vaccine, so any hope of slowing down the spread and death rate could be significant.

What's the treatment? Multiple studies showed that the use of chloroquine to treat the coronavirus can lead to faster recovery and shorter hospital stays for patients.



Chloroquine is normally used as an anti-malarial drug, used for the prevention and/or treatment of malaria. It's available in the United States by prescription, and can be safely taken by men and women of all ages, including pregnant women.

Doctors in China and South Korea have observed that the coronavirus patients treated with chloroquine show reduced fever and better lung CT images, and so far research has not found any negative effects of the treatment.

From a study done in consultation with Stanford University School of Medicine, UAB School of Medicine, and the National Academy of Sciences:

According to South Korean and China human treatment guidelines, chloroquine is effective in treating COVID-19. Given chloroquine's human safety profile and existence, it can be implemented today in the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world. Medical doctors may be reluctant to prescribe chloroquine to treat COVID-19 since it is not FDA approved for this use. The United States of America and other countries should immediately authorize and indemnify medical doctors for prescribing chloroquine to treat COVID-19. We must explore whether chloroquine can safely serve as a preventative measure prior to infection of COVID-19 to stop further spread of this highly contagious virus.

UK catching on? The study noted that Europe may be aware of the potential use of chloroquine to treat coronavirus, shown by a recent move by the United Kingdom to add chloroquine to a list of medicines that can't be exported.

New study suggests 'vast majority' of people infected with COVID-19 see 'at least six months' of protection after recovery,"A new U.K.-based study has found that the majority of people who were previously infected with COVID-19 have very high levels of antibodies for six months or more following an initial infection, possibly protecting them from a second infection for that time period.

What are the details?

On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Naomi Allen, professor and chief scientist at the U.K. Biobank — where the study was carried out — said that long-lasting antibodies prompt researchers to believe reinfection during that period of time will be rare.

The study was carried out on 20,000 volunteers and was composed of a combination of existing U.K. Biobank participants and their adult children and grandchildren over the age of 18 years.

The resulting report pointed out, ""Among participants who had tested positive for previous COVID-19 infection, 99% retained antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 for three months, the results showed. After the full six months of follow-up in the study, 88% still had them.""

""The vast majority of people retain detectable antibodies for at least six months after infection with the coronavirus,"" Allen explained. ""Although we cannot be certain how this relates to immunity, the results suggest that people may be protected against subsequent infection for at least six months following natural infection.""

According to Sky News, Allen added, ""More prolonged follow-up will allow us to determine how long such protection is likely to last.""

The study also found that the proportion of the U.K. population with antibodies ""rose from 6.6% at the start of the study period in May/June 2020 to 8.8% by November/December 2020.""

Sky News reported that despite the findings, researchers insist that there is still a possibility that they can pass the virus on to others during the period following convalescence.

Professor Rory Collins, U.K. Biobank's principal investigator, added, ""Both with vaccines and indeed with past infection, we don't yet know what impact that has on the ability to be carrying the virus and transmitting to others.""

He added, ""One important message both for people who have been infected, and for people being vaccinated, is you may be protected, to some extent, but you may still put others at risk.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/studies-find-potentially-effective-medicine-for-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention-thats-readily-available,2021-02-03
Liberals try to cancel 'Euphoria' star Sydney Sweeney because guests at her mother's birthday party wore 'MAGA-inspired hats' and 'blue lives matter' shirts,"Sydney Sweeney is an up-and-coming Hollywood actress with 49 acting credits already at the age of 24. However, her fans turned on the star of the HBO show ""Euphoria"" on Saturday after Sweeney shared photos of her mother's birthday party on social media. Liberals attempted to cancel Sweeney because guests at the birthday party were wearing ""Make America Great Again"" inspired hats and a ""blue lives matter"" shirt.

Sweeney's family – who are from Idaho – held a surprise birthday party for her mother, who turned 60. Best friends of the mother told her that they were taking her line dancing at a bar in town. However, there was a surprise birthday party at a barn.

A sign welcomed guests to ""Lisa's 60th Hoedown.""



Sweeney shared photos on Instagram of the party – which included line dancing, a mechanical bull, and ax-throwing.

In one of the photos, a man is seen wearing a ""thin blue line"" or ""blue lives matter"" t-shirt as he gleefully hugs Sweeney's mother and grandmother.

Sweeney's brother posted photos of some guests who donned red ""MAGA"" inspired hats that read: ""Make Sixty Great Again.""





Then cancel culture took over on social media. On Saturday, ""Sydney Sweeney"" was trending on Twitter because fans of the celebrity were furious that guests at her mother's birthday party were possibly conservative.

One person wrote on Twitter, ""She’s a white woman from America, idk why the internet is so outraged when she is quite literally doing what white women from America do.""



Someone tweeted, ""Idk why everyone’s surprised? All those times you’ve seen her and not known she was raised by Republicans?""

Others insinuated that the family was involved in the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol building or that they look like they use racial slurs. Some commentators called her family ""trash"" and ""inbred."" Others demanded that the actress ""delete"" the photos. One Twitter user said that Sweeney deserved ""lashings.""

The backlash from the Twitter reactions caused Sweeney to have to release a statement about the attire of people at her mother's surprise birthday party.

Sweeney wrote on Saturday night, ""You guys this is wild. An innocent celebration for my mom's milestone 60th birthday has turned into an absurd political statement, which was not the intention. Please stop making assumptions. Much love to everyone and Happy Birthday Mom!""

Taliban hunts down and kills Afghan sniper who helped British Army and was abandoned after disastrous America-led pullout: 'Entirely predictable this would happen',"President Joe Biden's much-maligned pullout of U.S. personnel from Afghanistan that stranded Americans and American allies in the region also forced international allies to make similar moves. And now the world is learning just how dangerous the retreat was for many of the stranded Afghans who helped the West in the fight against the Taliban and terrorism in the South Asian country.

A Tuesday report from the Times of London told the tragic story of an Afghan sniper who was trained by and served with British special forces and was then left behind when the Biden-instigated pullout chaos ensued.

The Taliban executed the Afghan sniper, identified only as ""N"" in order to protect his relatives, the Times said. He was ""shot multiple times in front of his family in Kabul,"" former British Army Col. Ash Alexander-Cooper told the paper.

Alexander-Cooper, who served with ""N"" on the same operations and served eight tours in Afghanistan, said the 28-year-old man was the father of five and had been hiding in the capital city but was found and killed Monday. The murdered Afghan was part of a British-trained ""elite unit"" who had fought on the front line.

The colonel told the Times that authorities should have seen this coming.

""It was entirely predictable this would happen for all of those left behind who were given no guidance,"" he said. ""He's been in hiding because of the threat he faced but they found him and he was shot multiple times, executed in front of his family.""

Alexander-Cooper posted a censored photo of ""N"" to Twitter on Monday, with a warning that the world could expect more of this kind of horror from the Taliban.

""For those leaders still unsure, this is not a game,"" he wrote. ""'N' was a executed by the Taliban in cold blood just a few hours ago. His crime? Years of loyal & professional service, mentored by British units. There is no 'amnesty'. Abandoned by us, this murder will not be the last.""

""Murdered in front of his family, he is survived by his wife & 5 children under the age of 9, the youngest of which was only 10 days old,"" the colonel wrote in a subsequent tweet. ""This is the reality of the 'new Taliban'. Talk of inclusivity, diversity & amnesty is a joke & some are falling for it. Wake up.""

Another source, former Afghan interpreter Rafi Hottak who now lives in the U.K., told the Times that ""N"" was on a list Hottak had compiled of 700 Afghans who wanted to go to England but had ultimately been left behind. He confirmed to the Times that ""N"" was indeed a sniper and a member of the U.K.-trained elite unit of Afghans known as CF333.

According to Hottak, he had been ""asking the UK government for years and especially in recent months to evacuate all those who served alongside the British forces as they were their eyes and ears.""

Since the pullout ended, the British government has been telling Afghans eligible for resettlement in the U.K. to make their way to third countries, but for many, the journey is too dangerous, the Times said.

The Ministry of Defense said the nation's forces were able to get 15,000 people out of Kabul during the pullout and that the ""commitment to Afghanistan and those who supported our mission there endures.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sydney-sweeney-maga-blue-lives,2021-09-14
"Former Afghan official says Taliban is killing children and the elderly, posts graphic photos of reported victims","The man who was recently the interior minister for Afghanistan under now-former President Ashraf Ghani alleged on Twitter this week that the Taliban is currently killing Afghan children and elderly citizens. He also inncluded graphic photos of purported child victims of the terror group.

As things in Afghanistan continue to deteriorate under the Taliban following President Joe Biden's disastrous policy of pulling out of the South Asian country while negotiating and relying upon the goodwill of the terrorist organization, Masoud Andarabi, the onetime government official dismissed by the former Afghan president, posted a stark notice to the social media site.

""Taliban are trying to rule over people by terrorizing, killing young children and elderly citizens,"" Andarabi wrote. ""Taliban can not govern the nation by such actions. In Andarab, taliban [sic] have been carrying out unwarranted searches of homes, capturing people without reason or justification and killing innocent citizens.""

""As a result,"" he continued, ""people have had to rise against their brutality to protect their lives, honor, dignity and property.""

Included with the messages were heartbreaking photos of a baby and children who were allegedly beaten and killed by the Taliban.

You can read the original tweets here, as well as see the photos he attached to the post. WARNING: The photos are graphic and disturbing.

Insight on the fall

Andarabi was fired from his post of interior minister by Ghani back in March, Reuters reported, during a series of attacks against Afghan security forces.

One official reportedly told the outlet that Andarabi ""had failed to arrest a militia commander whose forces shot down a helicopter in central Wardak province ... killing nine security force members."" Andarabi, the unnamed official said, had been ordered to arrest the militia member weeks earlier for his involvement in multiple other attacks against Afghan forces.

However, according to ""India Today,"" Andarabi was removed by Ghani after warning against a hasty retreat by U.S. forces in the decimated country.

During an interview with ""India Today,"" the former minister told viewers that the country still has a chance to avoid a ""very dark future,"" but it will require changing current policies that will leave Afghanistan alone.

""This was a classic miscalculation of the active government, particularly the national security council and president's advisers,"" Andarabi said of the now-defunct Ghani government, adding, ""They really misplayed it.""

Taliban flaunts newly seized US military hardware in victory parade,"The Taliban did a victory lap this week after U.S. military forces were officially withdrawn from Afghanistan. In the days following the U.S. troops leaving Afghanistan, the Taliban held parades with American military hardware to celebrate the United States withdrawal after nearly 20 years of military engagement.

On Monday, the last American military plane departed Afghanistan, marking the formal ending of the Afghanistan War, which was the longest war in U.S. history. The Taliban held parades highlighting newly seized U.S. military equipment, including Black Hawk helicopters, armored tactical vehicles, and firearms.

There was a cavalcade of captured Humvees driving in a procession outside Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city. There was also a U.S. Black Hawk helicopter flying overhead with the Taliban flag.



According to Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction quarterly reports, the United States sent 1,178 Humvees to the former Afghan government between April 2020 and July 2021, which have a total cost of more than $278 million, Barron's reported.



According to CBS News, the price tag for a UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter is $5.9 million.

One video shows Taliban militants holding U.S. firearms investigating a hangar at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, which had four CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters, according to New York Times reporter Christiaan Triebert.

It is not immediately known the exact amount of viable weapons that the U.S. left behind in Afghanistan because of President Joe Biden's chaotic evacuation, but one U.S. intelligence official told Reuters that the Taliban likely controls ""more than 2,000 armored vehicles, including U.S. Humvees, and up to 40 aircraft potentially including UH-60 Black Hawks, scout attack helicopters, and ScanEagle military drones.""

The BBC reported that the Afghan Air Force was operating 167 aircraft, including attack helicopters and planes, at the end of June, according to a report by the U.S.-based Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.



Before the Taliban was able to capture the capital of Kabul, Afghan soldiers fled to neighboring Uzbekistan with 22 military planes and 24 helicopters, the New York Post reported.

""The kinds of equipment we're talking about, while certainly there's a lethality component to it, it doesn't pose a threat to the United States, it doesn't pose a threat to neighboring nations,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said. ""These are not the kinds of things that the Taliban can make great strategic use out of.""

Last week, former President Donald Trump blasted the Biden administration for leaving so much U.S. military equipment for the Taliban.

""And not, nobody can even comprehend that much equipment. Thousands of vehicles,"" Trump said. ""It should be bombed. We cannot let them have that equipment.""

""I want every single nail, screw, and bolt,"" he said of U.S. equipment in Afghanistan. ""I then would have, with the exception of Bagram, which I would have kept, I would have bombed all of the bases, because I don't want to give those bases to Russia, China, or even the Taliban. I would have bombed every base.""

Taylor Swift cancels concert at horse race after pressure from animal rights activists,"Pop superstar Taylor Swift has cancelled an upcoming performance at an Australian horserace event following outcry from animal rights activists.

Swift was slated to headline the Melbourne Cup on Nov. 5. But the Victoria Racing Club, which hosts the event, released a statement Saturday announcing that Swift had cancelled her performance. The changed was blamed on a scheduling issue.

""Regrettably, Taylor is no longer able to make it to this year's Melbourne Cup. Changes to her Asian promo schedule have made it logistically impossible for her to be here. To all of Taylor's fans, we hope to see Taylor in Australia in 2020,"" the statement read.

However, Swift's cancellation comes after animal rights activists claimed Swift was ""endorsing animal abuse"" by agreeing to perform at the race, according to the BBC.

One group in particular, Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses, even began the social media campaign ""#NupToTheCup"" to pressure Swift into canceling her performance.

""Horses are being killed for gambling profits and entertainment. If Taylor Swift cares at all about other animals the way she appears to care about cats, she will cancel her show and make a strong statement that animal abuse is unacceptable,"" the group said.

The Melbourne Cup has been a lightning rod for controversy in recent years. The race is connected to the deaths of six racehorses since 2013, including one, The Cliffsofmoher, which had to be euthanized on the track last year after suffering a significant injury.



Although Swift's cancelation was blamed on a scheduling conflict, the coalition said Saturday that Swift's decision was related to the pressure placed on her.

""The pressure on Taylor Swift to cancel her performance was significant. Her fans did not want to see her supporting animal abuse,"" the group said. ""Whilst the reason being used by the racing industry is a scheduling mix up, it appears to us that she has responded to those calls.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taliban-us-weapons-afghanistan-parades,2019-09-21
Teenager mysteriously loses eyesight and hearing — doctors cite a bizarre cause,"A British teenager has been struck with a mystery illness and doctors believe it may be due to malnutrition stemming from years of his devouring the same junk food.

The case report was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine according to NBC News.

The boy had complained of fatigue when he was 14 years old. A doctor at the time advised him about his diet and gave him a B12 vitamin injection.

A year later he began to lose his hearing. He was sent to a specialist.

A year after that he began to lose his eyesight.

By age 17, the boy was legally blind.

Doctors observed damage to the boy's optic nerve, but could not identify a cause. The boy denied that he ingested tobacco, alcohol, or drugs, and then admitted

""However, the patient confessed that, since elementary school, he would not eat certain textures of food,"" read the report.

""He had a daily portion of fries from the local fish and chip shop and snacked on Pringles, white bread, processed ham slices and sausages,"" it continued.

Doctors concluded that the teen was suffering from a lack of essential nutrients from his poor diet. They gave him nutritional supplements, which appeared to stop the deterioration, but didn't improve his sight.

They also recommended the teen seek mental illness help for the extreme behavior as a result of his being a ""fussy"" eater.

"Temporary global government should tackle COVID-19, former UK prime minister says. His idea is smacked down hard.","Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown pleaded with world leaders to form a temporary global government to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, The Guardian reported.

What are the details?

Brown — who's left-of-center politically and was the head of the U.K.'s Labour Party — was a central figure behind international efforts to combat the Great Recession a decade ago, the paper said, adding that he believes a coalition of leaders, including those from the health field and international organizations, should have executive powers to coordinate the response.

""This is not something that can be dealt with in one country,"" Brown said, The Guardian noted. ""There has to be a coordinated global response.""

He also said his proposed global task force would fight the crisis in two ways: By finding a vaccine and organizing production, purchasing, and preventing profiteering, the paper noted.

More from The Guardian:

Many countries have announced economic packages in the past two weeks but Brown said a task force could: make sure the efforts of central banks were coordinated; take steps to prevent the record flight of capital from emerging market economies; and agree a joint approach to the use of government spending to boost growth.



Brown said there had been resistance in 2008 to using the G20 as a vehicle for tackling the financial crisis, but that it should be clear to world leaders that there was no possibility of a go-it-alone approach working.

""We need some sort of working executive,"" Brown added to the paper. ""If I were doing it again, I would make the G20 a broader organization because in the current circumstances you need to listen to the countries that are most affected, the countries that are making a difference and countries where there is the potential for a massive number of people to be affected — such as those in Africa.""

What was the reaction?

As you might expect, Brown's idea of a temporary global government was met with just a bit of resistance, as evidenced by Twitter users' comments, including those of former UK Independence Party leader Gerard Batten:

Others called Brown's idea ""a Trojan Horse for much worse"" and said he ""wants to enslave humanity.""

""If Gordon Brown can call for a global government to tackle the COVID-19 then it's time to wake up and realize the New World Order is being put in place in our own very eyes,"" another user said.

Brexit leader Nigel Farage was equally blunt:

Tennessee grocery store employees hide in freezers as more than a dozen people are shot in store attack,"Tennessee grocery store employees reportedly hid in freezers during Thursday afternoon's mass shooting in which at least 15 were injured and at least one person was killed.

The gunman — identified Friday by CNN as Uk Thang — also died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said, and a motive is not known at the time of this reporting.

What are the details?

The horror unfolded Thursday afternoon at a Kroger in Collierville, Tennessee, as the suspect opened fire on shoppers and employees alike, People reports.

Authorities say the woman killed in the shooting was identified by her family as Olivia King.

King's son, Wes, acknowledged his mother's death in a Facebook post.

He wrote, ""This type of crime needs to stop being glossed over and sanitized. No one deserves this. Our family is devastated by this senseless act of violence. We ask that you pray for the repose of the soul of our mother, Olivia King. We also ask everyone for their prayers for all families and friends affected by the events today, as well as for God's mercy on the shooter and his family. Thank you.""

During a news conference, Collierville Police Chief Dale Lane described the scene as ""horrific.""

""I've never seen anything like it,"" he admitted. ""There were numerous employees that were working. We found people hiding in freezers and locked offices. They were doing what they were trained to do: run, hide, fight.""

Brignetta Dickerson, an employee, said that she hid in the back of the store when the gunfire began ringing out.

""He kept on shooting, shooting, shooting,"" she said. ""He shot one of my coworkers in the head, and then shot one of the customers in the stomach, and then my other customer got kind of, like, cuts because of the asphalt.""

Fox News reported that police said 44 employees were in the store at the time of the shooting.

A Kroger spokesperson said the company is praying for the families of those injured and killed in the attack.

""We are deeply saddened by the incident that occurred at our Kroger store located on New Byhalia Rd. in Collierville, TN – a suburb of Memphis,"" a spokesperson said of the incident. ""The entire Kroger family offers our thoughts, prayers and support to the individuals and families of the victims during this difficult time.""

The spokesperson added, ""We are cooperating with local law enforcement, who have secured the store and parking lot. The store will remain closed while the police investigation continues, and we have initiated counseling services for our associates.""

Lane concluded, ""This is a horrible day in Collierville. Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and friends involved in the senseless tragedy. Please keep our community in your thoughts and prayers. At this time, there are no known threats to the Collierville community and our department is working diligently to prevent further violence.""

The shooting remains under investigation.

What else?

On Friday, CNN reported that Thang, the 29-year-old suspect, was a third-party vendor for the store.

Kroger on Friday issued a follow-up statement as more information became available.

""In the hours since the shooting, we're learning of truly heroic acts that included associates, customers and first responders selflessly helping to protect and save others,"" Kroger said in the statement. ""We will remain forever grateful to the first responders who so bravely responded to protect our associates and customers.

Tesla will continue paying salaries of Ukrainian employees who return home to fight,"As a way to support Ukraine in its fight against invading Russian forces, Tesla has announced that it will continue paying the salaries of Ukrainian employees asked to return to their homeland to fight for at least three months.

The announcement was disclosed in an internal email to employees in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, CNBC reported. The outlet noted, however, that it wasn’t immediately clear whether the policy had been or would be extended to employees in North America and elsewhere around the globe.

The company reportedly said that after the three-month time period, it would reassess the situation depending on how the conflict is going.

""For any Tesla employees who is a Ukrainian national and has been asked to return to Ukraine for active duty as a reservist, we will maintain their employment and salary for 3 months, with a view to assessing after this period as needed,"" read the email, sent by Axel Tangen, Tesla's director of Northern Europe.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called up military reservists late last month as Russian troops continued to mass around the country's borders. Only days later, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion, sending Europe into its bloodiest land war since World War II.

Since the start of the invasion, Zelenskyy has leaned on the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people, promising to supply weaponry to any citizen who would remain and fight.

The United States and several other Western nations have responded to Russia's unprovoked attack by heavily sanctioning the invading country while supplying Ukraine with a deluge of armaments and high-tech weaponry.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, too, has been aiding the war efforts. Tangen's email announcing the three-month pay for military policy shed light on Musk's enterprise to quickly bring fortified internet service to Ukraine.

""Tesla teamed up with SpaceX to provide coverage expansion for its Starlink services to help provide an alternative internet infrastructure,"" Tangen wrote, noting that volunteers tested, configured, and shipped several hundred Starlink units to Ukraine this month.

He added that ""in true Tesla fashion, the solution has been put together in less than 3 days.""

Additionally, Tesla’s Energy team assembled and provided lithium-ion battery storage systems known as Tesla Powerwalls to run the Starlink equipment.

Ukraine vice prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who also oversees digital transformation for the country, personally thanked Musk on Twitter, writing, ""Received the second shipment of Starlink stations! [Elon Musk] keeps his word! Thank you for supporting Ukraine and peace in the entire world!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tennessee-grocery-store-employees-hide-in-freezers-as-more-than-a-dozen-people-are-shot-in-store,2022-03-10
Family opens up about 12-year-old who hung himself after COVID-19 lockdowns left him ‘sad and lonely’,"The family of a 12-year-old boy from Texas who hung himself last spring is speaking out about the tragedy in hopes of raising awareness about youth suicide amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Hayden Hunstable, of Aledo, Texas, took his own life last April after feeling isolated and lonely due to the nationwide lockdowns spurred on by the pandemic, the boy's father, Brad, 42, recently told Metro UK. He was discovered in his bedroom by his 8-year-old sister.

""I had no idea he was struggling or depressed, he was such a happy kid and loved his friends and family,"" his dad told the news outlet. ""But Covid is a perfect storm for suicide and depression. I think everything just got on top of him, he felt overwhelmed and he made a tragic decision.""

Brad Hunstable recalled that he was shocked and horrified, especially since there were no warning signs and he didn't have any clue that his son was depressed.

""On April 17 our water went out at the house and my dad came over, Hayden helped us fix it. It was a beautiful sunny day and I gave him a hug and a kiss on the head. Then when my dad left there was just me, Kinlee and Hayden at home. There was only a 30 minute window,"" he recalled. ""Hayden had gone upstairs.""

""Then my daughter ran downstairs and said Hayden has hung himself. I ran up there, pulled him down and tried to save him. I performed CPR but I couldn't save him. He was gone. I saw something horrific that day and I don't wish it upon anybody. I still get nightmares about it,"" he said.

Hunstable said that his son was active in the community and loved going to school and seeing his friends. But he said the isolation from classmates coupled with his dislike for virtual learning could have resulted in Hayden feeling depressed.

""He loved football and he loved being around people, he was very social,"" the father told Metro. ""He was a little guy but he had the heart of a lion. He was beloved by his friends and family.""

Hayden may have been triggered into making a ""tragic impulse decision"" after he broke a second monitor at home, his father added. For Christmas 2019, Hayden's parents got him a monitor to play video games on, but he had broken it out of frustration.

""We told him he would not get another one, but then lockdown hit and I told him he would have to work to get a new one,"" Hunstable said. ""He did some chores around the house and we got him a cheaper one in April because it was his birthday on April 21st and he wanted to play with his friends.""

When police were investigating his death, they reportedly discovered that he had broken the new monitor, as well.

""I don't know if he was scared about getting into trouble or anxious about not being able to speak to his friends and ruining his birthday,"" Hunstable said. ""He either did it in impulsive anger or he got himself in a situation he couldn't get out of.""

Now, Hayden's family is determined to use his death to bring positive change. They founded ""Hayden's Corner,"" a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising awareness about youth suicide and produced a video, ""Almost Thirteen,"" which shares Hayden's story.

Almost Thirteen PSA youtu.be

""I am on a mission to solve youth suicide. Parents need to have conversations with their kids about their feelings,"" Hunstable told Metro. ""We need to talk to kids about suicide and talk to kids about how to deal with depression. Kids get depressed and they need to be taught how to deal with their problems.""

Since the start of the pandemic, several have voiced concerns over the unintended consequences of shelter-in-place orders and school closures, noting that while lockdown restrictions may protect people from the coronavirus, the forced isolation may also take a toll an mental health.

In May, California doctors reported that they had seen more deaths from suicide that from the virus. Then in June, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control discovered that more than one quarter of young adults in the country contemplated taking their own life. Just last month, Las Vegas schools decided to reopen as ""quickly as possible"" after a rash of student suicides rocked the school district.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tesla-paying-ukrainian-employees-who-return-hom-to-fight,2021-02-11
'The Family Sex Show' — sex-ed production aimed at kids as young as 5 that features 'non-sexual nudity' — canceled in UK after 'unprecedented threats',"""The Family Sex Show"" — a sex-education stage production aimed at children as young as 5 years old that features ""non-sexual nudity"" — has been canceled in the United Kingdom after ""unprecedented threats"" launched at the company putting on the show.

What are the details?

The show ""features non-sexual nudity and explores topics such as consent, pleasure, queerness, and gender,"" BBC News said, adding that it targeted ""children as young as five.""

In response, more than 38,000 people signed a petition calling for the cancellation of the show, which was set for May performances at Bristol's Tobacco Factory, BBC News reported in a follow-up story. The petition called ""The Family Sex Show"" ""profoundly irresponsible"" and ""wholly inappropriate.""

With that, the theater said on its website that ""performances of The Family Sex Show by ThisEgg at Tobacco Factory Theatres have been cancelled ... due to the unprecedented threats and abuse directed at our building and team.""

The show's creators — ThisEgg — tweeted that it's ""regrettable that violent and illegal threats and abuse directed at the company and venues by a small group of people with extremist views has prevented families from opting to attend something that was transparent, consensual and legal.""

ThisEgg added that ""these public performances would have offered safe and positive learning to children, young people, and guardians about rights, bodies, sex and relationships, advised by safeguarding and educational specialists.""

In addition, ThisEgg said it created a website outlining what ""The Family Sex Show"" is all about. The topics include Bodies & Touch, What Is Sexuality? What Are My Pronouns? and Loving Ourselves.

Anything else?

BBC News reported that some parents anonymously said they were OK with the show and would be happy for their kids to see it, including one Bristol mom who said it was a ""great idea"" and that her children ""would laugh the whole time and put their hands over their eyes and then say to me, 'Why on earth did you bring me here?'""

Bristol therapist and sex education specialist Stephanie Healy told the network she understands why the show would seem ""scary"" for some parents but urged them to ""be brave.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-12-year-old-lockdown-suicide,2022-04-19
The Spectator buried an offer for free champagne deep within an essay by UK Labour party leader Keir Starmer — more than 11 hours later nobody had responded,"United Kingdom Labour Party leader Keir Starmer authored a pamphlet published by the Fabian Society that runs more than 11,000 words in length, but The Spectator pulled a stunt that may indicate nobody gave the piece a thorough reading when the outlet published it on its own website.

Deep within the lengthy work by the member of parliament, The Spectator inserted a sentence that informed readers they could obtain a bottle of Pol Roger champagne if they visited a certain web address.

""The first person to go to spectator dot co dot uk slash essay can claim a bottle of Pol Roger,"" the rogue sentence abruptly announces in the midst of Starmer's voluminous work.

But the outlet reported that many hours after posting Starmer's writing with that extra sentence, not a single person had laid claim to the offer of free champagne.

""At 10 a.m. yesterday we published Keir Starmer's essay in full online,"" The Spectator noted on Friday. ""Buried two thirds of the way through the dreary disquisition was a secret offer for one lucky reader who braved the full text – the reward of a free bottle of Pol Roger to drown their sorrows. Unfortunately some 11 hours later no one had managed to spot the offer and thus it went unclaimed as of 9:30 p.m.""

The link leads to a form where people are invited to input their email address and optionally provide a response about how they would sum up Starmer's piece in a sentence.

""Congratulations for getting so far through the speech! To claim your bottle of Pol Roger, enter your email below and (optional) answer the question,"" the page declares.

The website reported that later, after the offer was referenced in a Daily Telegraph column, people started to fill out the form.

""Several dozen applications have now come in, along with various answers to our question about Starmer 'How would you sum up his essay in a sentence?'

Group of environmental activists pledge not to have any children because of climate change,"A group of environmental activists in the United Kingdom say that they're too ""freaked out"" about the potential effects of climate change to have children.

""Our planet is in a kind of collapse,"" Blythe Pepino said in an interview with BBC News. ""The natural world is collapsing around us, and that's actually happening right now. And I'm so disappointed by the response by our authorities to this crisis, and so freaked out by it, everything I've read, that I've — basically last year I came to the decision that I couldn't bring a child into that.""

Pepino is the founder of a group called BirthStrike, a group of about 60 women who have pledged not to have any children until they are assured that Earth ""no longer faces global extinction."" She said that the women behind the group ""realized it was really important to tell the public that there are people out there who are so scared about this that they feel that they can't actually have a family.""

In a separate interview, Pepino told the Times of London that she has a partner ""and would like to have children with him. We're really in love and it feels like the right thing to do."" However, after she read the 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] she ""realized how wrong it would be to bring a child into a world on the brink of catastrophe.""

Another member of the group, Alice Brown, told the BBC that she has felt ""so hopeless"" about the loss of biodiversity on the planet. She said her ""decision to be on Birthstrike has mostly come from not wanting to pass that fear on to someone else.""

Brown said that her choice wasn't just about ""being a nature and wildlife enthusiast"" but that the she believed the path the Earth was heading down was ""dangerous.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-spectator-buried-an-offer-for-free-champagne-deep-within-an-essay-by-labour-party-leader-keir-starmer-but-more-than-11-hours-later-nobody-had-acted,2019-03-04
"Thousands of New Yorkers have been quarantined due to coronavirus concerns. Some could face fines, prosecution if they leave home.","Thousands of New York City residents have been quarantined over concerns that they may have been infected with the strain of coronavirus, formally known as COVID-19, as city officials dial up their response to the outbreak.

According to a Thursday update from Mayor Bill de Blasio's office, the city's department of health was monitoring 2,773 people in ""home isolation"" as of that morning, and some of those under observation could face fines and even jail time if they leave their homes, according to the New York Post.

Some of those under observation are voluntarily quarantined, while others are under mandatory quarantine orders. When it comes to enforcing mandatory quarantines, New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot explained at a Thursday news conference alongside de Blasio, ""the powers that we have could include the police powers that we have; no one wants it to come to that.""

So far, however, the commissioner also explained that ""there hasn't been anyone on mandatory quarantine that has tried to, the term of art is 'elope,'"" and added ""as the Department of Health, we have taken every measure possible to make it as easy as possible for these individuals to remain in quarantine,"" which includes communicating with them on a daily basis.

Compliance for those mandatory quarantines are enforced by ""disease detectives"" performing spot checks on patients a couple of times per week, Deputy Health Commissioner Demetre Daskalakis explained at the news conference.

""And so we really are in effect case managing them from a distance and then also spot checking them to make sure that they're compliant,"" Daskalakis said.

According to the Post, some of the thousands of people being monitored for the virus could face fines or jail time if they leave their homes. While there is no penalty for breaking a voluntary quarantine, the newspaper explains, violating a mandatory quarantine could come with fines ranging from $200 and $2,000 per day in the city. In addition, a mandatory quarantine violation that puts public health in immediate danger could result in arrest and prosecution for a misdemeanor.

When asked how many of the current quarantines mandatory, rather than voluntary, Barbot listed a couple who recently returned from virus-hit Iran, as well as ""a number that changes on a daily basis in terms of returning passengers from the five affected countries, China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and now Japan.""



A woman who returned from Iran with her husband last week marked the city's first case of COVID-19 after the wife tested positive for it, officials announced Sunday. City health officials confirmed the city's first case of community spread Tuesday after a attorney who commutes to Manhattan for work contracted the virus. De Blasio also cautioned that as the virus outbreak progresses, more stringent quarantine measures will likely be necessary.

""I think a good way to think of this is we are climbing a ladder right now,"" De Blasio said when asked by a reporter about the consequences of people not following the rules when instructed to quarantine. While ""we do see very good results on a voluntary level and we do see overall dynamics in the city,"" with the prospect of more virus cases ""we're going to get more and more mandatory as needed.""



The news comes as the virus continues to spread through the United States and the rest of the world. On Thursday, Maryland became the latest state to announce confirmed cases of the disease. As of Friday morning, numbers from Johns Hopkins University said there were over 100,000 global cases of the disease and that there had been over 3,400 deaths.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/these-activists-say-that-theyre-too-freaked-out-to-have-children-because-of-climate-change,2020-03-06

""When I say climate change, what do you think of? I think jobs. Green jobs. Green jobs,"" she said, mocking Biden's global warming plan. ""Build Back Better, blah, blah, blah!

""We must find a smooth transition towards a low carbon economy. There is no Planet B. There is no Planet Blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,"" she continued, repeating phrases from a speech by French President Emmanuel Macron.



""This is not about some expensive, politically correct dream at the bunny hugging or blah, blah, blah. Build back better, blah, blah, blah. Green economy, blah, blah, blah,"" Thunberg added, deriding UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

""Net zero, blah, blah, blah!"" she said. ""Climate neutral, blah, blah, blah. This is all we hear from our so-called leaders — words, words that sound great but so far, has led to no action or hopes and dreams. Empty words and promises!""



Thunberg previously mocked John Kerry, Biden's U.S. special climate envoy, over a suggestion that technological advances could help fight global warming while preserving the high standard of living in Western countries. She fired off a dismissive tweet with a link to his comments.

""Great news! I spoke to Harry Potter and he said he will team up with Gandalf, Sherlock Holmes & The Avengers and get started right away!"" she mocked.

Thunberg has also complained that Chinese state-owned media was ""fat-shaming"" her in a critique from June.

Tom Cruise takes COVID protocol enforcement to the next level a month after infamous rant: UK paper says he bought 2 robots to patrol the movie set,"Remember Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise's expletive-laden rant against workers reportedly violating COVID-19 protocols on the set of his ""Mission: Impossible 7"" movie last month — the one where he screamed about how the ""motherf***ers"" who violated on-set pandemic policies would be fired if they ever did it again?

A refresher: ""They're back there in Hollywood making movies right now because of us! Because they believe in us and what we're doing! And I'm on the phone with every f***ing studio at night, insurance companies, producers, and they're looking at us and using us to make their movies!"" he screamed in December. ""We are creating thousands of jobs you motherf***ers!""

It's the rant he followed up with a second foul-mouthed shaming when his first diatribe made international headlines and was splashed on tabloid covers.

Well, it turns out he was super serious about making sure everyone follows every protocol put into place and has reportedly gone beyond just threatening that if he happens to see violators, they're ""f***ing gone""

Since he can't be everywhere at once to police each employee's' every move, he has purchased robots to be his eyes and ears to keep an eye on scofflaws, the U.K.'s Sun reported Wednesday.

According to the Sun's entertainment guru, Simon Boyle, sources revealed that Cruise paid big bucks for two robots to patrol the movie set in England and make sure workers are following COVID-19 directives.

""Tom is so serious about making sure the shoot isn't shut down that he's splashed out on these robots as he can't be everywhere to ensure people are behaving themselves,"" a source said.

The source told Boyle that the robots can also administer ""on-the-spot"" COVID-19 tests to workers.

""The robots are really sophisticated and rather intimidating. It's like the Terminator only not as violent.""

Noting that the rant was probably over the top, the source admitted that Cruise was right on principle and that many observers sympathized with the star.

""He gets paid a lot for these films but he also knows that he is lucky to be working and staff on the film from top to bottom rely on this film going ahead,"" the person added. ""You don't have to go far to see how just how much the pandemic has affected jobs.""

Top infectious diseases expert says double masking may actually increase COVID infection: 'May do more harm',"Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert, said Sunday that wearing two face masks as a precautionary measure against the coronavirus may actually increase the chances of becoming infected.

What's the background?

As public health experts fear the spread of potentially more contagious COVID-19 variants, Dr. Anthony Fauci endorsed last week the practice of ""double masking"" — wearing a cloth face covering over a surgical face mask.

Speaking on NBC's ""Today"" show last week, Fauci called double masking ""common sense.""

""If you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on, it just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective and that's the reason why you see people either double masking or doing a version of an N-95,"" Fauci said.

But what is Osterholm saying?

Osterholm, who served on President Joe Biden's COVID-19 Advisory Board during the presidential transition, explained on NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that double masking could enhance infection.

""When we talk about double masking, remember what we're really talking about is just trying to prevent the virus from being excreted by me into the air or me inhaling the virus from someone else in the air, and it's both a function of face fit and face filtration,"" Osterholm said.

Osterholm, who is the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, used swimming goggles as an analogy to explain the downside to double masking.

""Think about your swim goggles. When's the last time anybody leaked at the lenses? They leak at the fit,"" Osterholm began.

""So, what we're concerned about is that many of these face cloth coverings do have already compromised fit or filtration capacity,"" he continued. ""If you add on another mask, you may actually make it tougher for the air to move through the two cloth area, and then at that point, it causes more air to actually leak around the sides, which actually enhances your ability to get infected.""

In fact, Osterholm claimed that double masking may do ""more harm"" than good.

I'm not saying that some couldn't be used in a better way. But at the same time, there are many that actually, you may do more harm. Let me just say right now one thing that's really, to me, very important is we see up to 25% of people who wear it under their nose. You know, that's like fixing three of the five screen doors in your submarine. You know, what's going on there? We've got to get people to start using these right. That would help right there tremendously.

Full Osterholm: 'We Need To Get As Many One-Doses … As We Possibly Can"" | Meet The Press | NBC News www.youtube.com

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not yet issued guidance about double masking.

Toronto Police Service tweets about 'Missing Woman',"The Toronto Police Service raised eyebrows on Thursday by tweeting about a ""Missing Woman"" while posting the photo of an individual who looks like a bearded man.

""The Toronto Police Service requests the public's assistance locating a missing woman. Isobella Degrace, 27, was last seen on Saturday, June 25, 2022, at 3 a.m., in the Ryerson Avenue and Bathurst Street area. She is described as 5’10"", with a thin build, shaggy blonde hair, and a full goatee. She was last seen wearing a black t-shirt and grey pants. Police are concerned for her safety,"" a news release states.



The Toronto Police Service's seemingly preposterous post caught many people's attention, including Blaze Media CEO Tyler Cardon who remarked, ""My goodness. It's real. The absolute dumbest time to be alive.""

Seth Dillon, CEO of the popular satire website The Babylon Bee, tweeted, ""The world has become too absurd to be satirized.""

""You've spelt 'Man' incorrectly @TorontoPolice,"" former Brexit Party MEP Christina Jordan tweeted.

Actor Matthew Marsden wrote, ""I mean, I’m not a biologist, but….""

Some people mocked the police's post with satire: ""Guys my dog is missing, let me know if you see her,"" someone tweeted while sharing a picture of a bird.

The post highlights the absurdity of radical gender ideology, but leftists in the U.S. and abroad continue to peddle the ridiculous concepts that fly in the face of reality.

Halifax, a bank over in the UK, recently faced backlash for tweeting ""Pronouns matter"" along with a name tag that included the pronouns ""she/her/hers"" beneath the name ""Gemma.""

Trans activist stokes controversy by saying that gender reassignment surgery does not help many with gender dysphoria,"British trans activist Charlie Evans made big news last week when she announced that she is detransitioning, and that many trans people have approached her saying that gender assignment reassignment surgery does not help gender dysphoria.

According to Sky News, Evans was born female, but decided to live as a male before she detransitioned in 2018. Evans, who is a trans rights activist, announced that she would no longer be taking her hormone therapy or identify as male, and she says she received a huge response.

""I'm in communication with 19 and 20-year-olds who have had full gender reassignment surgery who wish they hadn't, and their dysphoria hasn't been relieved, they don't feel better for it.""

According to Evans, she has been approached by ""hundreds"" of people — mostly females in their mid-20s who are same-sex attracted — who have asked her either to speak out, or to help them find support for their own efforts to detransition.

Evans says that she was motivated to take her struggle public when, after giving a talk, she was approached by a young woman who had also detransitioned. ""She said she felt shunned by the LGBT community for being a traitor. So I felt I had to do something,"" Evans said.

Evans has started a nonprofit organization in Newcastle, England, that seeks to provide support for trans people who want to transition back to the gender of their birth.

According to the Sky News article, one of the people Evans has helped detransition complained that many of the centers in the UK that offer support for people who want to transition do not do a good job of appropriately counseling subjects about alternatives.

The woman, who asked to be identified by Ruby, said, ""When I was at my gender clinic to get referred for hormones, we had a session where I went over my mental health issues and I told them about my eating disorder and they didn't suggest that that could maybe connected with my gender dysphoria. For everyone who has gender dysphoria, whether they are trans or not, I want there to be more options for us because I think there is a system of saying, 'okay here's your hormones, here's your surgery, off you go'. I don't think that's helpful for anyone.""

As previously reported at TheBlaze, NHS centers in the UK have begun offering gender transition support to children as young as 3 or 4, and have seen skyrocketing rates of participation in gender transition services. One such facility, the Tavistock and Portman NHS trust, disputed Evans' characterization, saying, ""Decisions about physical interventions made in our care are arrived at after a thorough exploration process. While some of our patients may decide not to pursue physical treatment or drop out of treatment, the experience of regret described here is rarely seen.""

Evans, who describes herself in her twitter bio as a ""freelance science journalist,"" tweeted a challenge to the scientific community about the prevalence of gender reassignment surgery.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/toronto-police-service-missing-woman,2019-10-06
"Trans comedian strips naked, plays keyboard with penis on live TV in UK: 'I'm a perfect woman!'","Warning: graphic content.



A British comedian who identifies as transgender recently went on live television and put on a rousing performance, singing, stripping naked, and using his penis to play a keyboard.

On Friday during a 40th-year celebration one-off revival of the 1980s British comedy series ""Friday Night Live,"" comedian Jordan Gray took to the stage and gave an expletive-laden rendition of ""Do-Re-Mi"" and ""Better Than You,"" a song written for Gray's Edinburgh Fringe show entitled ""Is It a Bird?"" ""Bird"" is British slang for a woman.

At the conclusion of the three-minute bit, Gray grinned and asked rhetorically, ""You know the best thing about live TV?""

Gray then answered his own question: ""I can do stupid stuff like this!""

He then proceeded to tear off the bright pink jumpsuit he was wearing to reveal surgically constructed female breasts and bare male genitals.

The theme of ""Better Than You"" is self-evident. Gray lists various reasons why he is better than everyone else, and all the reasons he gives are sexually explicit.

""I'm a perfect woman,"" Gray insists. ""My t*** will never shrink. And I'm guaranteed to sq****. And I do a**l by default.""

Gray, who competed on ""The Voice"" in 2016, also made various ""gay"" jokes throughout the clip. At one point, he even admitted, ""I used to be a man.""

""What a moment,"" tweeted Channel 4, which aired the TV special.

In the tweet, Channel 4 also included a full-length clip of the performance, except for the ending when Gray removed his clothes and grabbed his penis. The video includes a warning for foul language and what Channel 4 has characterized as ""adult humour.""

The performance itself has received mixed reviews. Helen Joyce, an outspoken critic of transgenderism, quickly denounced it as a ""sex crime.""

""Absolutely disgraceful. A sex crime committed on camera. While idiots whoop and cheer,"" Joyce tweeted.

Baroness Emma Harriet Nicholson of the House of Lords, who likewise supports traditional marriage, stated that she would be issuing a complaint letter regarding the stunt, though she did not specify to whom she would write.

However, actor Jason Isaacs, best known for his portrayal of Lucius Malfoy in the ""Harry Potter"" film series, thoroughly enjoyed the phallic performance.

""So much more dignified than parliament today,"" he tweeted in part.

The U.K. has different rules regarding profanity and nudity on television. Pink News defended Gray's naked keyboarding by asserting that the show segment aired ""well after the 9pm watershed, the time when nudity and other adult content is allowed on TV.""

Gray has expressed no remorse. On Saturday, he publicly thanked Channel 4 for airing the clip and for letting him ""be a part of comedy history.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trans-activist-detransition,2022-10-24
"Trans females do have advantages over biological women when 'bigger, stronger, fitter, and faster' matters — and could compete in new category: UK study","A wide-ranging study from the United Kingdom concluded that transgender female athletes — i.e., biological males who identify as female — do have physical advantages over biological female competitors when ""being bigger, stronger, fitter, and faster"" makes a difference.

That said, the study also said an option to keep things fair could be creating ""open"" competition categories in order to include transgender female athletes, the study's guidance said.

What are the details?

The study — under the auspices of UK Sport, among other organizations — found that some sports are ""gender-affected"" and some sports are not. Sports that are not gender-affected include darts, curling, shooting, and equestrian, the study said.

Gender-affected sports that ""rely significantly on physical capacity – physique (including height), strength, stamina"" include rowing, volleyball, and climbing, the study said.

Other gender-related considerations involve competition safety — specifically whether particular sports involve contact (basketball), collision (rugby), or combat (boxing, martial arts).

In general, the study said if a sport is not gender-affected, a participant's gender identity is not crucial in terms of creating an advantage over other competitors.

But it's a different story in gender-affected sports, as transgender women likely will have advantages, the study said.

""Transgender women are on average likely to retain physical advantage in terms of physique, stamina, and strength,"" the study added. ""Such physical differences will also impact safety parameters in sports which are combat, collision or contact in nature.""

In addition, the study said ""testosterone suppression is unlikely to guarantee fairness between transgender women and natal females in gender-affected sports.""

Solution

The study's guidance suggested that gender-affected sports offer additional categories to accommodate transgender female competitors — for example, keeping a ""female"" category and adding an ""open"" category.

Athletic organizations ""may choose to offer sport in which the female category is protected for reasons of competitive fairness and/or safety if they are gender affected. These sports would offer both a female category and an open category. Female entries would be required to declare themselves as recorded female at birth,"" the study said, adding that ""an open category would be available for any competitor to enter.""

Anything else?

Transgender females competing against biological females has been a growing issue in sports over the last several years.

Of late the primary figure has been New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard, who — by qualifying for this summer's Tokyo Games — became the first transgender athlete to compete at the Olympics.

Hubbard exited quickly from the women's competition, however.

Trans woman reports man to police for his ‘gender critical’ tweets. Judge says too bad — that’s free speech.,"A British judge ruled Friday that a man who issued ""gender critical"" comments on Twitter is protected by free speech.

What are the details?

According to Reuters, a British judge issued the ruling after a transgender woman complained to authorities that a man on social media made what she called ""brazen transphobic comments.""

Former police officer Harry Miller allegedly shared 31 ""gender critical"" remarks between November 2018 and January 2019.

One such message included, ""I was assigned mammal at birth, but my orientation is fish. Don't mis-species me.""

The outlet also reported that he made remarks about Caitlyn Jenner — formerly known as Olympian Bruce Jenner.

The unnamed trans woman called authorities and filed a complaint. Upon investigation, authorities determined that Miller's Twitter remarks were considered a ""non-crime hate incident.""

Reuters reported that Humberside police paid a visit to Miller about the complaint, which Miller said ""left him with the impression that continuing to tweet could cause Miller to face criminal prosecution.""

In response, Miller took legal action against the police, insisting that authorities tried to tamp down Miller's freedom of speech.

What did the judge say?

Judge Julian Knowles at London's High Court said that Miller's remarks were lawful and protected by free speech.



""In this country we have never had a Cheka, a Gestapo, or a Stasi,"" Knowles declared. ""We have never lived in an Orwellian society.""

Knowles added:

The claimants' tweets were lawful and there was not the slightest risk that he would commit a criminal offense by continuing to tweet. I find the combination of the police visiting the claimant's place of work, and their subsequent statements in relation to the possibility of prosecution, were a disproportionate interference with the claimant's right to freedom of expression because of their potential chilling effect.

Miller said that he stands by his remarks and is not biased against transgender people.

""I want to raise awareness by stating that which used to be instinctively obvious — a biological man is a man, and a biological woman is a woman,"" he insisted. ""To claim otherwise is extraordinary.""

According to the BBC, Miller added, ""This is a watershed moment for liberty — the police were wrong to visit my workplace, wrong to 'check my thinking.'""

Miller's lawyer, Paul Conrathe, said, ""It is a strong warning to local police forces not to interfere with people's free speech rights on matters of significant controversy.""

What else?

In a statement, the Humberside Police said it acted in good faith.

""Our actions in handling the incident were carried out in good faith but we note the comments of the judge and we will take learning from this incident moving forward,"" the statement read.

The police are still able to classify the remarks as ""non-crime hate incident,"" but Miller plans to appeal the decision. The BBC reported that the appeal has been granted and will go straight to the Supreme Court.

Transgender activist says all children should be put on puberty blockers until they can decide their gender,"A popular transgender activist recently called for all children to be put on puberty blockers until they are able to decide which gender they want to be.

What are the details?

Lauren McNamara, known by followers as ""Zinnia Jones,"" argued earlier this month that children should be legally able to consent to the administration of puberty blockers since they already de facto consent to the ""permanent and irreversible changes"" that come naturally through puberty.

""If children can't consent to puberty blockers which pause any permanent changes even with the relevant professional evaluation, how can they consent to the permanent and irreversible changes that come with their own puberty with no professional evaluation whatsoever?"" she wrote on Twitter.

The YouTuber went on to argue that ""an inability to offer informed consent or understand the long-term consequences is actually an argument for putting every single cis and trans person on puberty blockers until they acquire that ability.""

Her comments followed a court case in the U.K. involving Keira Bell, a 23-year-old biological female who sued the British National Health Service's gender-identity youth clinic for prescribing her puberty blockers when she was 16 years old. Bell, who since regrets becoming a male, argued that the clinic did not do enough to ""challenge"" her decision to transition.

Judges ruled in the lawsuit that ""it is highly unlikely that a child aged 13 or under would be competent to give consent to the administration of puberty blockers"" and ""it is doubtful that a child aged 14 or 15 could understand and weigh the long-term risks and consequences of the administration of puberty blockers.""

But, ""in respect of young persons aged 16 and over, the legal position is that there is a presumption that they have the ability to consent to medical treatment,"" read the ruling.

McNamara argued in her tweet thread that puberty became ""optional"" when technology was developed to ""enable deliberate choice between natal puberty and puberty induced by cross-sex hormones.

What else?

According to her YouTube fan page, McNamara is an atheist American commentator who has ""posted numerous videos critical of religion, especially in regards to its attitudes towards LGBT people. Zinnia is openly transgender and has been on hormone replacement therapy since September 2012.""

""Zinnia was assigned male at birth and given name Zachary Antolak in 1989 in Chicago,"" but she ""became aware of her sexuality as a gay male at an early age,"" her profile states.

""After years identifying as a gay male, Zinnia finally came to the conclusion that she was actually a trans woman in 2011 and started a romantic relationship with her close friend and lesbian Heather McNamara, becoming an adoptive mother towards Heather's two children. Zinnia is currently in a polyamorous relationship with Heather and another trans woman named Penny,"" it continues.

Transgender cyclist blocked from women's championship race after boycott threats from biologically female contestants,"A transgender female cyclist was blocked from participating in the women’s British National Omnium Championship over the weekend, as Emily Bridges is still registered as a male cyclist, the Guardian reported.

In addition, a number of the race's participants were said to be ready to boycott the race if Bridges was in it, the outlet added.

What are the details?

Bridges, 21, set a national junior men’s record over 25 miles in 2018, the Guardian said, adding that the cyclist began hormone therapy last year to reduce testosterone levels.

However, a number of biological female cyclists discussed boycotting Saturday's event because they believed Bridges has an unfair advantage, the outlet said, adding that Bridges was involved with the Great Britain Academy program as a male cyclist until being dropped in 2020.

In addition, Bridges is still registered as a male cyclist and can't race as a woman until the male ID expires, according to Union Cycliste Internationale regulations, the Guardian said.

How did Bridges react?

Bridges was “disappointed” with UCI’s decision, the outlet said.



“We have been in close discussions with the UCI regarding Emily’s participation this weekend and have also engaged closely with Emily and her family regarding her transition and involvement in elite competitions,” British Cycling said, according to the Guardian. “We acknowledge the decision of the UCI with regards to Emily’s participation, however we fully recognize her disappointment with today’s decision.”

A comprehensive scientific review by the five British sports councils in September said there were “retained differences in strength, stamina, and physique between the average woman compared with the average transgender woman or non-binary person registered male at birth.""

Transgender female athletes competing against biological female athletes has been a growing issue on the world stage, particularly over the last year with transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard going to the Olympic Games and transgender swimmer Lia Thomas competing in last month's NCAA women's championships. Hubbard didn't win in Tokyo, but Thomas was victorious in one swimming event.

Podcaster Joe Rogan said last week that Thomas' participation is an ""assault on women's sports.""

President Joe Biden's administration reportedly soon will overhaul rules for college athletes to favor transgender participants; Title IX — a 1972 law that bans sex discrimination in education — also will outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

Another transgender male gives birth — and wants documentary about pregnancy to show 'trans people are actually quite normal',"Back in January, a story emerged about a gay male who impregnated his transgender partner who identifies as male — and the birth of the Texas couple's baby came to light in March.

Image source: KENS-TV video screenshot

Now a documentary about another transgender male — and the ups and downs involved in Freddy McConnell's pregnancy — is hitting the film festival circuit. It's titled, ""Seahorse: The Dad Who Gave Birth,"" because male seahorses give birth to their young.

The Guardian put together an extensive profile on McConnell — who was born female and is gay — noting the birth of baby Jack and everything that led up to it:

Here's the description of ""Seahorse"" trailer on YouTube:



One trans man's pioneering quest to fulfill an age-old desire: to start his own family. Freddy is 30 and yearns to start a family but this poses unique challenges. He is a gay transgender man. Deciding to carry his own baby took years of soul searching, but he was unprepared for the reality of pregnancy, both physically and challenging society's fundamental understanding of gender & family. To him what feels pragmatic, to others feels confronting; this was not part of his plan. Against a backdrop of hostility towards trans people, he is forced to confront his naivety. Made with unprecedented access & collaboration, it's an audacious & lyrical story about what makes us who we are. This is the story of the dad who gave birth.

'I feel like a f***ing alien'



McConnell — a 32-year-old who lives in Great Britain — started taking testosterone at 25 and had ""top surgery"" to remove breast tissue a year later, The Guardian said. McConnell considered a hysterectomy, the paper said, but never went through with it — as having children was on McConnell's mind.

""In the film, we see how discombobulated McConnell becomes when he stops taking testosterone as he tries to conceive, using a sperm donor, and his body, in effect, goes into reverse,"" The Guardian noted. ""He starts having periods again ('I don't like the idea that I've got tampons in my bag,' he winces); his facial hair gets wispier, his hips broaden, his tummy softens, and he starts to speak less from his chest and more from his throat. 'Every time I think about it, I think, ""What the f*** am I doing?""' he says. At one point, a tearful McConnell sobs into the camera in the middle of the night: 'I feel like a f***ing alien.'""

Normalizing transgenders

McConnell also told the paper that ""the thing he most wants the film to do is normalize trans people.""

""It sounds wishy-washy, but I thought it could be a good opportunity to spread empathy,"" McConnell added to The Guardian. ""I think empathy is key in convincing people that trans people are actually quite normal, and live lives that are not sensational or scary.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

As you probably expect, McConnell disagrees with the notion that biology is fixed and that trans women are not really women and trans men are not really men, the paper said.

""Many of these people haven't met a trans person, and the monstering and caricaturing is not based on reality,"" McConnell added to the Guardian. ""Not everyone gets a chance to meet a trans person — but that is often what changes everything for someone who can't get their head around it. So I thought this film could be in lieu of meeting somebody — you could spend an hour and a half with me.""

More from the profile:



McConnell discovered there were trans men in America who were having babies, and spoke to his doctor about becoming pregnant. Even then, he was still battling with the idea. He worried that he might be ridiculed or attacked; that people would think he was transitioning into a woman; that as a man carrying a baby he was having his cake and eating it.

""I went back and forth for ages. But for me, having that genetic link is something I felt I needed to have. It took me so long to feel OK about wanting kids, because there's a stigma attached to it,"" McConnell told the Guardian. ""It took me a long time to separate identity from biology. I'm just using my hardware to do a thing. It's pragmatic.""

'It is not something that I can choose, or leave behind, or change'

When McConnell was asked about reasons for having a child, the Kent resident told paper, ""Straight people don't get asked, 'Why didn't you adopt? Why was it so important to be genetic parents?' So why do gay and trans people get asked that?""

McConnell also had to work on separating a transgender identity and physical realities, the Guardian said.

""It is not something that I can choose, or leave behind, or change,"" he said. ""It's not something predicated on my physical state. It's a thing, it's part of me. So if I'm pregnant, it doesn't change me being trans.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The subject of the documentary also confessed to the paper, ""I hated my early 20s. I just didn't know what was going on. I don't think it's possible to explain what gender dysphoria is like to somebody who doesn't feel it. All I know is testosterone and my transition changed everything and made life not just livable, but enjoyable. The self-questioning, second-guessing quietened down. It didn't go totally, because that's just part of who I am. But the gender dysphoria disappeared.""

More from the Guardian profile:

More than anything, Seahorse is a love story — or a series of love stories. There is McConnell and his son, McConnell and his mother, and McConnell and CJ. At the beginning of the film, CJ and McConnell are living together as best friends and partners. CJ is non-binary and uses the gender-neutral pronoun ""they."" ""My partner and I both have ovaries,"" McConnell explains to the camera. We see the two of them sitting on the sofa with their laptops, looking at sperm donor sites. ""This is like our version of having sex,"" laughs McConnell. ""Talking about having a child together, and the ideal donor.""



""It's very satisfying,"" CJ says.



""Then we have a cigarette afterwards."" They laugh.



But halfway through the film, CJ decides not to parent a child with McConnell. ""CJ's told me they're not involved any more,"" a devastated McConnell tells the camera. The idea of being a solo parent is a different prospect, and initially he is full of doubt: what is he doing to his body, is it safe, is he capable of bringing up a child alone? Meanwhile, the withdrawal of testosterone is playing havoc with his hormones. In a moment of glorious bathos, McConnell tells the camera, Garbo-like, that he wants to be left alone. He laughs when I remind him of this now, all the tears and drama. ""I felt so bad for my mum. She had to put up with me.""

More children?

The paper asked McConnell if more children are on the horizon: ""I would love to have more children, but I'd also love to not have to carry them, necessarily. Though I haven't ruled it out."" The Guardian then asked if ""lower surgery"" is being ruled out for now: ""Erm, yeah. Yeah ... Ruled out seems strong.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

And what does McConnell want audiences to get from ""Seahorse""?

""I'd like people to feel they can relate to whatever bit of the story echoes with their own experience,"" McConnell told the paper. ""Hopefully people will come away thinking they've seen something relatable, a universal story about love and family and wanting to have kids.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-female-cyclist-blocked-from-women-s-championship-race-boycott-threats-loomed,2019-04-24
Transgender male YouTuber says 'it can be quite hard to navigate having periods as a guy',"Jamie Raines — a transgender male YouTuber — told PinkNews UK that ""it can be quite hard to navigate having periods as a guy when everything to do with periods is aimed very much towards women.""

Raines noted in a video for PinkNews that ""trans men can experience periods, and nonbinary people can as well"" and that ""transgender men are real men — we're just born a little bit different to other guys.""



Raines stopped having periods after starting testosterone about seven years ago — but three years into the treatment the periods resumed during a testosterone medication switch, the video noted.

The YouTube figure called the resumed periods an ""incredibly, very unwelcome guest.""

History

Raines recalled that between the ages of 12 and 14 when periods started ""I felt very down"" and that they ""took me completely by shock.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Periods became a ""massive source of dysphoria for me,"" Raines — who's had ""top surgery"" — added.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

And when they returned during the YouTube figure's testosterone switch, Raines said it was ""straight back to that very dysphoric feeling that I had years ago.""

""I just remember, again, being stuck on the toilet crying, just not knowing what to do,"" Raines noted, adding that ""it just kind of like shook me.""

However, the YouTuber added that ""being further along in my transition"" helped in getting over having resumed periods for a brief time.

Oh, and Raines has at least one complaint about sanitary products — namely that ""the advertising and packaging are very female orientated.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-male-gives-birth-want-soshow-trans-are-actually-quite-normal,2019-07-31
Transgender man gives birth after sperm donation from transgender woman: 'It felt so right',"Reuben Sharpe began living as a man in 2007 and took male hormones, which gave him a beard, a deep voice, and masculine features, the Mirror reported.

But the Brit — now 39 — still had maternal instincts and stopped taking testosterone six years ago in the hope of one day having a child, the outlet noted.

Then Reuben met fellow wedding photographer Jay in a pub, and they became a couple, the Mirror said.

Jay, 28, has undergone a double breast removal but is nonbinary, doesn't identify as male or female, and uses the pronouns ""them"" and ""they"" rather than ""he"" or ""she,"" the outlet added.

Getting pregnant

Soon Reuben talked to Jay about getting pregnant.

Referring to Jay, Reuben told the Mirror, ""I realized I would have to talk to them. If they didn't want kids, we'd have to break up. I managed to bring up the subject, but luckily Jay was open to the idea.""

The couple then found a sperm donor on Facebook — a transgender woman who can still produce sperm, the outlet said.



""I thought they would be perfect,"" Reuben told the Mirror. ""Sperm donation is a big decision to make, but when we asked the donor, it felt so right. We sent a message on Facebook to ask.""

Soon a doctor — who also is transgender — inserted the donor's sperm into Reuben's womb, and tests confirmed a pregnancy, the outlet said.

Three months ago, baby Jamie was born, the Mirror reported.

“I finally feel complete,"" Reuben told the outlet. ""It wasn't that I was desperate to have the birthing experience or pregnancy experience, but I wanted a child, and I had the facility to do it.""



'Invasive questions'

But not all was tea and crumpets for the couple, particularly when they ventured into medical facilities for tests.

“I found it frustrating that people didn't just ask my gender or not use it. I look like a man, have a beard. It's bizarre you wouldn't just avoid saying 'she,'"" Reuben added to the Mirror. ""People asked very invasive questions about body parts and how I'd give birth. Giving birth isn't a trans thing. Women give birth in different ways, too.""

However, Reuben also acknowledged to the outlet that ""I actually liked my pregnant body and liked being bigger. It was very affirming, and I really enjoyed it — I'm a man and I get pregnant. There's a lot of changes to go through, but I felt free of that. Women struggle with their bodies when they go through pregnancy, too, so it isn't something a trans man would exclusively feel.""

The future

The couple — who plan on marrying next year — told the Mirror that raising Jamie among like-minded people in Brighton is a priority.

“It's about having the right kind of community around us so they are able to see different kinds of family set-ups,"" Jay added to the outlet. ""All we can do is try to be really open from the start with them and other people around us — give them the best chance.""

Reuben and Jay also refuse to be hemmed in by traditional mother and father roles, the Mirror said, adding that Jay is open to giving birth in the future.

“Like with many things, people have got it into their heads 'this is a female thing, this is a male thing.' Having a child is male, female, everyone,"" Reuben added to the outlet. ""Even when people go through that pregnancy experience with their partner, it's a joint thing. Wanting to have a baby doesn't feel like a female thing for me. I don't think pregnancy is the ultimate female experience, therefore it didn't challenge me as a man. It doesn't make a woman less of a woman if she's not keen on pregnancy, infertile, doesn't want a baby. This isn't a trans issue — it affects everyone.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-male-youtuber-says-it-can-be-quite-hard-to-navigate-having-periods-as-a-guy,2020-01-02

The U.K. High Court ruled on Wednesday that McConnell would not be registered as the child's father, and would remain the child's mother according to the official birth certificate.

McConnell, 32, sought to change the designation on the legal document after a registrar told him that current law ""required people who give birth to be registered as mothers"" on certificates, according to CNN. A lengthy battle ensued as a result of McConnell's desire to change his designation from ""mother"" to father.""

Andrew McFarlane, who is president of the High Court's family division, said that being a ""mother"" refers to the biologically carrying and delivery of a child.

""Being a 'mother,' whilst hitherto always associated with being female, is the status afforded to a person who undergoes the physical and biological process of carrying a pregnancy and giving birth,"" McFarlane said, insisting that there is a ""material difference between a person's gender and their status as a parent.""

McFarlane added, ""It is now medically and legally possible for an individual, whose gender is recognized in law as male, to become pregnant and give birth to their child. Whilst that person's gender is 'male,' their parental status, which derives from their biological role in giving birth, is that of 'mother.'""

McConnell shared the news Wednesday on Twitter, and revealed that he is going to appeal the high court's ruling.

He wrote, ""I'm saddened by the court's decision not to allow trans men to be recorded as father or parent on their children's birth certificates.""

""I fear this decision has distressing implications for many kinds of families,"" he continued. ""I will seek to appeal and give no more interviews at this stage.""

Transgender man who had baby wants to be 'father' on birth certificate. Official rules 'he could only be registered as...mother.' Now it's on.,"A few months back, TheBlaze reported on a gay biological female who underwent a gender transition to male — and became pregnant.

Freddy McConnell's pregnancy hit the film festival circuit via the documentary ""Seahorse: The Dad Who Gave Birth,"" so titled because male seahorses give birth to their young. The Guardian put together an extensive profile on McConnell, noting the birth of baby Jack and everything that led up to it.

Birth certificate dust-up

As it turns out, the 32-year-old Brit is a Guardian multimedia journalist, and the paper said in follow-up piece that McConnell could become the ""first transgender man to give birth and seek to be called the child's father ...""

More from The Guardian:



Prior to attending a fertility clinic he applied for a gender recognition certificate, which was granted before he gave birth. This meant he was legally male when his child was born. But when he went to register the birth and insisted he should be registered as the father, the registrar said he could only be registered as the child's mother.



McConnell sought a judicial review in the family division of the high court of that decision and during the case, which has yet to conclude, his identity and that of his child were protected by an anonymity order.



However, media organisations requested that order was lifted, arguing that McConnell had been cooperating with a documentary about the conception, pregnancy and birth of his child, using his real name, and that he had been interviewed about his experiences in the Guardian.

But a high court ruled that McConnell's identity cannot be kept private in the birth certificate case, the paper said. McConnell argued that ""he and his child could be victimized and bullied as a result,"" The Guardian added.

As whether McConnell is allowed to be called the child's father on the birth certificate, the paper said that judgment is expected later this week.

'Protecting my child has always been and will always be my number one concern'

""Protecting my child has always been and will always be my number one concern,"" McConnell said, according to The Guardian. ""This was the purpose of the anonymity order. Now that my anonymity has been lifted, I embrace the opportunity to draw focus on to the need for equality in this area of the law. All children should be able to have their legal parents correctly and accurately recorded on their birth certificates.""

McConnell's legal team told the paper that their client and ""all transgender fathers, whether or not they carry their babies"" will be forced under the UK's system to register as ""mother"" on children's birth certificates — and that transgender women will be forced to register as ""father"" in all cases.

""Having an accurate birth certificate is vital as it stays with someone for their entire life and forms part of their identity,"" McConnell's lawyer Karen Holden added to The Guardian. ""We took on this case to support changing a part of UK law that denies equality, creates inaccurate documentation and fails to serve multiple groups with the LGBTQ+ community.""

More from the paper:



When McConnell was born, his registered gender was female. He realized he was trans in 2010, aged 23, and lived as a male, starting testosterone treatment in April 2013. In 2016, he sought advice from a fertility clinic about getting pregnant and his hormone treatment was suspended, his menstrual cycle restarted and he became pregnant in 2017 through artificial insemination using sperm from a donor.



His case demanding to be registered as the child's father was heard at the high court in February, but the court reconvened in May after it emerged that McConnell was co-operating with the documentary Seahorse, about the conception, pregnancy and birth, which had been shown at film festivals and is set to be broadcast later this year by the BBC. Throughout he is openly named, but there was no reference to his claim to be registered as the child's father.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-man-who-had-baby-receives-ugly-surprise-after-filing-to-be-childs-father-instead-of-mother,2019-07-17
Transgender model outraged after porn offer retracted due to model's penis — and UK police are investigating 'report of a hate incident',"A United Kingdom transgender model is outraged after a porn offer was retracted due to the transgender model's penis, Hull Live reported.

Transgender woman Ria Cooper, 25 — who became Britain's youngest transgender female at 15, the outlet said — said a photographer promised to help promote her career then suddenly stopped all contact after discovering Cooper is a transgender, Hull Live reported.

'It's like calling someone who is black the N-word'

Cooper told the outlet the man ""messaged me saying he wanted to take my picture, have sex with me, and film it to make money, and then once he found out I was trans, he stopped all contact with me. I am reporting this as a hate crime. It's like calling someone who is black the N-word.""

Cooper added to Hull Live that the man made contact after Cooper began sending links to fans on social media showing the model's new glamour portfolio. Then Cooper noted to the outlet that the photographer said he couldn't work with Cooper because the model has ""a c***.""

""This is absolutely f****** disgusting behavior,"" Cooper said, according to Hull Live. ""No one should be treated like this — this is discriminating and appalling behavior ... [it] doesn't matter if I have c*** or not. The pictures should be judged as they are. It says on my social media profile that I am a ladyboy, I didn't ever say that I wasn't, and I thought he knew. I want to be a glamour model and a porn star — that's what I want to do. I don't think I should be treated like this.""

Police investigating 'report of a hate incident'

The man's actions angered Cooper so much that the model contacted police and declared that the hate crime and transphobia must be taken more seriously, the outlet reported.

""I just think those comments could easily make someone commit suicide,"" Cooper told Hull Live, which also said Humberside Police confirmed officers are investigating the allegation.

""We received a report of a hate incident yesterday, on Wednesday, October 16,"" a police spokeswoman noted to the outlet. ""The report has been logged and will be investigated.""

Here's a video of a 2017 interview with Cooper discussing changing genders:

"Transgender-rights 'misogynists' screamed, banged on windows of UK feminists' event while 'police did absolutely nothing,' journalist says","Transgender-rights activists intimidated women attending a U.K. feminists' event while police stood by and did nothing, a journalist said.

Activist group Queer AF Brighton descended upon the Woman's Place UK event Monday, claiming the meeting was spreading transphobia, the Daily Mail reported.

Journalist Julie Bindel tweeted video of flag-waving protestors outside the feminists' event:

Bindel noted the ""load of trans-activist misogynists screaming, shouting and banging on the window while the police did absolutely nothing.""

'Like we were under siege'

Ali Ceesay, who helped run the feminists' meeting, told the Daily Mail that ""100-plus protestors ... were shouting, chanting and blocking people's entrance. One young woman had a full blown panic attack inside the building. It was terrifying. They were banging on panes of glass; it was hideous, and the police didn't stop them. The policing was a joke. We also had some of our attendees have liquid thrown in their face. It felt very much like we were under siege.""

Here's what it sounded like inside the event space:

What did Queer AF have to say?

Queen AF called Women's Place UK a ""hate group"" in a Facebook post Tuesday and defended the protest, saying members ""marched to the venue to make noise outside of the building"" and that ""WPUK members were rude and aggressive to the small group of protesters that stood handing out counter fliers.""

The post added that ""protesters successfully held noisy space either side of the building for about three hours until the last members departed, sad and frustrated that their meeting was disrupted throughout. This disruption included chants such as: WPUK, are a hate group! You stop the hate group, we'll stop the protest! Hey, hey, ho, ho, transphobia has got to go!""

What did police have to say?

A police spokesperson said in a statement that officers ""ensured that those wishing to attend"" the meeting ""were able to gain access"" and that ""protest liaison officers spoke with those gathered outside to facilitate this and to reduce the impact that their protest was having on the meeting and the local community,"" the Daily Mail said.

""We accept that the initial protest was very noisy and officers did engage to seek a reduction in scale and to put a stop to those who were banging on windows in an attempt to disrupt the meeting,"" police added, according to the outlet, and that ""there have been no reports of crimes, no damage to the building, no arrests, and the participants left the meeting without further incident.""

Anything else?

Queer AF told the Brighton Argus the women's group running the meeting appropriates feminism and spreads a transphobic message.

But Ceesay — of Women's Place UK — told the Daily Mail that ""in law ... we have several protected characteristics. One of those is sex. It's that piece of law that gives women sex-based rights that protects us. There's a push within some of the more extreme LGBT communities to replace sex for a looser definition of gender identity. What this means is we lose our rights under this nefarious and undefinable concept of gender identity — and therefore we lose our women-only services.""

The outlet added that conflict between the groups includes whether ""gender-neutral"" restrooms are acceptable, or if they deny biological females their right to private spaces.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-model-outraged-after-porn-offer-retracted-due-to-models-penis-and-uk-police-are-investigating-report-of-a-hate-incident,2019-09-24
Transgender rugby player — born male and nicknamed 'Beast' by female teammates — once collapsed 'girl' opponent 'like a deckchair',"Kelly Morgan — born Nicholas Gareth Morgan — is a transgender rugby player who's been nicknamed ""Beast"" by teammates on the Porth Harlequins Ladies squad in Wales, BBC Sport reported.

Injury ended Morgan's rugby pursuits as a teenager, the outlet said — and then Morgan spent a decade wrestling with gender identity and transitioned to female.

Image source: BBC Sport video screenshot

Now Morgan is back playing and hopes to compete soon in the Welsh women's leagues, the outlet added.

Welsh Rugby Union guidelines state Morgan can play as long as blood-measured testosterone levels are within a certain range, BBC Sport said, adding that the league is ""fully committed to the principles of equality.""

Morgan has taken daily doses of estrogen for the last 18 months, the outlet noted.

'Beast'



Morgan, 33, stands at 6 feet tall and has been nicknamed ""Beast"" by teammates, BBC Sport said.



Club captain Jessica Minty-Madley recounted to the outlet a time when Morgan ""folded a girl like a deckchair during a game, which was quite funny, but they're still friends.""

BBC Sport said Morgan accepts that transgender women may enjoy size and strength advantages over biological female opponents: ""I do feel guilty, but what can you do? I don't go out to hurt anybody. I just want to play rugby.""

Image source: BBC Sport video screenshot

Brian Minty, who founded the team four years ago, joked to the outlet that Morgan is ""going to be a good, good player for the next few years, as long as we can stop her injuring players in training.""

Minty added to BBC Sport that he's ""always taken rugby as a totally inclusive sport, and we're happy to welcome Kelly to the club.""



Coach Wayne Mansell told the outlet that ""Kelly has made a brave decision to do what she's done, and if the WRU says she can play, she can play.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-rights-misogynists-screamed-at-uk-feminists-event,2019-08-22
Transgender weightlifter's victories anger women's rights group: 'Males competing in women's sport is blatantly unfair',"A women's rights group isn't happy about New Zealand transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard's gold medals earlier this month at the Pacific Games in Samoa and is calling on the country's Olympic committee to ""defend women's sport,"" Reuters reported.

""Kiwis (New Zealanders) know that males competing in women's sport is blatantly unfair,"" according to Ani O'Brien of New Zealand lobby group ""Speak Up For Women,"" which wants athletic competition categorized by biological sex rather than gender identity, the outlet said.

""As a nation we pride ourselves on being good sports, and going into the Olympics next year this is not a good look,"" O'Brien added, Australia's ABC News reported.

What's the background?

Hubbard — a biological male who won two silver medals in a women's world championship two years ago — took home two gold medals and a silver medal in the women's competition at the Pacific Games in Samoa.

Hubbard bested all opponents in the women's +89k snatch — for participants weighing 196 pounds or above — and the overall women's +89k, the Pacific Games site said. Hubbard won silver in the women's +89k clean and jerk, the site also said.

The 41-year-old — who represented New Zealand as Gavin Hubbard before a gender transition about six years ago — is now the Oceania senior champion, the Commonwealth senior champion, and the Pacific Games senior champion, Stuff reported.

Transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard asks critics to 'treat people like me with respect' youtu.be

What did Samoa's prime minister have to say about Hubbard's victories?

After Hubbard bested Samoa's Feagaiga Stowers in the Pacific Games, Samoa's prime minister wasn't pleased.

""This fa'afafine [a Samoan third gender] or man should have never been allowed by the Pacific Games Council president to lift with the women,"" Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi told the Samoa Observer, according to Australia's ABC News. ""No matter how we look at it, he's a man, and it's shocking this was allowed in the first place.""

The prime minister added to Reuters that ""I realize we have to (be) inclusive, and we cannot exclude these people"" but ""they ought to participate in these Games in their own category.""

New scientific study

In 2015, International Olympic Committee guidelines ruled that transgender athletes can compete as women if their testosterone levels are below 10 nanomoles per liter for at least 12 months before their first competition, Reuters said.

But some scientists say the restriction doesn't do enough to suppress natural advantages of biological males, including bone and muscle density, the outlet added.

Researchers at the University of Otago in New Zealand said in a peer-reviewed study published earlier this month that the IOC guidelines were ""poorly drawn"" and the mandated testosterone level was still ""significantly higher"" than that of women, Reuters noted.

The study added that the IOC should end its ""binary"" approach to competition — i.e., male and female categories — and adopt a transgender category or otherwise look for a way to balance inclusion and a level playing field, the outlet said.

But the study was panned by transgender advocates and athletes, Reuters added.

""The opinions of scientists although valid, are just that, opinions,"" New Zealand mountain biker Kate Weatherly — who transitioned as a teenager and became a national champion competing against women — told the outlet. ""I'm not winning by crazy margins and the anecdotal evidence does point to me having little to no advantage.""

Not so fast



Dr. Nicola Williams, research director for the UK's Fair Play for Women, told Australia's ABC News that Hubbard had an unfair advantage that couldn't be reversed by the IOC lowering testosterone limits.

""Any reduction in testosterone, even to zero, wouldn't actually reverse the male performance advantage that someone has when they go through male puberty, because we can't reverse that,"" Williams told the outlet. ""So even if the IOC do reduce [the limit] down to five, it's still blatantly unfair.""

She added to Australia's ABC News that ""within 20 years, women have built their discipline from scratch, and it's now being undermined by people that don't have female bodies essentially. Those people are now winning, and Laurel Hubbard is the evidence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-rugby-player-nicknamed-beast-once-collapsed-girl-opponent-like-a-deckchair,2019-07-30
Transgender woman complains bank disallows phone transactions because 'I sound like a man',"A UK transgender woman is complaining that a bank has been disallowing phone transactions because ""I sound like a man.""

""I opened the account in October last year,"" Ellen Westerleigh told the Nottingham Post regarding HSBC bank. ""I had to order a new card, and they sent a card that said Mr. rather than Miss. They said it was an error. Every time I ring up to speak about my account they say I 'don't sound like a woman.' I have to prove who I am, and I shouldn't be having to do that.""

Image source: Twitter

'I know I sound like a man, but that's not the point'



Westerleigh added to the paper, ""I know I sound like a man, but that is not the point. I do feel uncomfortable ringing up my bank. It has happened three or four times, and it is ridiculous. It has got to a point where I have to go into my branch and show my ID, and I do not live near my branch. The nearest is the City Centre.""

The 22-year-old lives in Strelley, the Post said — which is about five miles or an 18-minute drive from Nottingham City Centre.

The latest incident was when HSBC refused to transfer money from Westerleigh's account because the bank didn't believe the person on the phone was Westerleigh despite security questions having been answered, the paper reported.

""I have told them several times 'I am transgender.' It is in my file. I should not have to keep saying it,"" Westerleigh added to the paper. ""They do not take the trans community seriously. They just think we are not that gender.""



What is Westerleigh's background?



Westerleigh — who used to be known as Kurtis — became Ellen last September after being uncomfortable as a male for a long time, the Post said.

""I grew up with two sisters, and it was obvious,"" Westerleigh told the paper. ""I always wanted to put on dresses or play with their toys. In September, I thought it was time to be true to myself.""

Westerleigh — who said ""Ellen"" was chosen due to inspiration from TV host Ellen DeGeneres — is now waiting for hormone therapy and a sex change, the Post reported.

What is HSBC saying?

HSBC told the paper that its customer care team is reviewing Westerleigh's complaint and has recently made changes to its systems and training to support transgender customers.

""We are very sorry for the disappointing level of service experienced by Miss Westerleigh, and are committed to learning from this to help ensure it doesn't happen again,"" a HSBC spokesman told the Post. ""We are a proud and active supporter of customers and colleagues across the broad spectrum of diversity of sexuality and gender identity. We want everyone to be able to access simple and smart banking solutions that work for them, and we will continue working with our LGBT+ colleagues and customers to ensure we're getting it right.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-weightlifters-victories-anger-womens-rights-group,2019-08-02
"Transgender women uses hammer to threaten UK store manager — then avoids jail time after judge can't decide between male, female prison","A transgender woman who used a hammer to threaten a store manager in the United Kingdom was spared jail time when a judge couldn't decide whether to send the attacker to a male-only or female-only prison, the Daily Mail reported.

What are the details?

Leila Le Fey, 40, pleaded guilty to common assault and possession of an offensive weapon after trying to steal wine from a store in Brighton last November, the outlet said.

Judge Stephen Mooney initially sentenced Le Fey to six months in jail, but defense lawyers argued that LeFey would be forced to go to an all-male prison after their client failed to present a Gender Recognition Certificate, the Daily Mail noted.

Such a document can be issued only if someone has transitioned for two years, and the outlet said it's unknown when Le Fey transitioned or if Le Fey has undergone any sex reassignment surgery.

Attorney Rebecca Upton also said Le Fey would be vulnerable in a male-only prison and couldn't be kept in solitary confinement, the Daily Mail said, adding that the judge recalled Le Fey to court an hour after his initial sentence.

""We live in a society which acknowledges and embraces diversity and allows and encourages people to live the life they want to,"" Mooney said, according to the outlet. ""Sometimes society does not make the necessary or appropriate adjustments in all ways it can to reflect the adjustments of society as a whole.""

With that, the judge gave Le Fey a six-month suspended sentence in the ""hope for some form of rehabilitation,"" the Daily Mail said.

What's the background?

An intoxicated Le Fey threatened store manager Enoch Adetayo with a hammer after entering the store at 4 a.m., the outlet said.

Adetayo told police he managed to grab the hammer Le Fey pulled out, the Daily Mail added.

""You were caught in the act of taking some wine and confronted by Adetayo, who was perfectly within his rights to challenge you,"" Mooney told Le Fey, according to the outlet. ""People who work in convenience stores offer a service to the community. They do so for little pay and deserve to be protected.""

The judge also said ""there is no excuse whatsoever for what you decided to do,"" the Daily Mail said.

Anything else?

Le Fey has previous convictions for more than 50 offenses, including brandishing a bladed article in public, shoplifting, and low-level violence, the outlet said.

Upton argued that Le Fey's November offense occurred during a period of addiction to alcohol and drugs, the Daily Mail said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-woman-complains-bank-disallows-phone-transactions-because-i-sound-like-a-man,2020-02-27
"Media says Trump called Meghan Markle 'nasty', he just denied it, and there's actual audio","The media has had big news about a big feud the last few days, with blaring headlines and clicky tweets shouting that President Trump called Meghan Markle ""nasty.""

Reading those headlines one would be sure that he made some Trumpian comment about the Duchess of Sussex, unprompted and unwarranted, ahead of his big state visit. A regular ""own goal"" attempt to score on someone for no reason.

On Twitter, though, the Trump War Room disputed that story, calling it false and fake news in a slew of tweets. One, which included the actual audio (below), said this.

Fake News CNN is at it again, falsely claiming President Trump called Meghan Markle ""nasty.""

The media, particularly CNN reporters, pushed back, there was back and forth, and on Sunday morning, Trump weighed in himself.

I never called Meghan Markle “nasty."" Made up by the Fake News Media, and they got caught cold! Will @CNN, @nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it!

So what really happened? Well if you read the headlines, you may be surprised by the context.

Here is a transcript:

And here is the audio:

Fake News CNN is at it again, falsely claiming President Trump called Meghan Markle ""nasty."" Here is what he actually said. Listen for yourself! pic.twitter.com/kLuPXBLMhf

— Official Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) June 1, 2019

After the Trump War Room tweeted, the MSM treated it as their own goal for having proved Trump said what they said he didn't say.

But if we can be real for a second, there is an obvious material difference between the implication that Trump went out of his way to insult the Duchess as nasty, and what actually happened.

Trump was confronted with her past criticism. He said he didn't know that she was nasty toward him.

If you say something ugly behind my back, and I don't know, and someone tells me, and I say ""I didn't know so-and-so was ugly that one time"", I'm not calling you ugly. I'm saying I didn't know you said something ugly.

That's more than obviously what happened here. Pitching a headline like ""Trump calls Markle nasty"" is disingenous at the least. At the most, it's clickbait.

Trump characterized Markle's prior behavior as nasty. ""I didn't know she was mean [to me]."" The ""to me"" or ""like that"" or ""in that instance"" is not only very overtly implied as part of the sentence, he makes it even more plain whwen he says he thinks it's nice that there's an American princess and that she'll ""do excellently.""

""She will be very good,"" he said.

It's not really something that should require this degree of explanation. The media obviously tried to blow it up into some slam on Markle that it obviously wasn't, and then played a game of Twitter dunking on the War Room for tweeting the context.

That is, again, not being a journalist. It's being an activist, perhaps, or a click-monger.

Trump said ""nasty."" It's on tape. That's a fact. The media characterized it as something that it wasn't. That, too, is a fact. If there's a media person out there reading this, instinctively siding against Trump and thinking to yourself ""that's exactly what he said, so we're right"" … I suggest you really look deep and ask yourself whether you're being a journalist or a hater.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-women-uses-hammer-to-threaten-uk-store-manager--then-avoids-jail-time-after-judge-cant-decide-between-male-female-prison,2019-06-02
Trump signs executive order issuing sanctions against Russia,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday slapping sanctions on Russia over the country's use of chemical weapons.

What's the background?

The new sanctions were put in place in retribution for Russia's poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal. Skripal worked for Russian military intelligence, but gave information to MI6, the United Kingdom's foreign intelligence service. After he was discovered, he fled to England.

On March 4, 2018, Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were found slumped on a bench near a shopping center in Salisbury, England. Authorities in the U.K. later determined that they had been poisoned by the Soviet-made nerve agent Novichok, which had been placed on the front door of Skripal's house.

The Russian government denied that they were involved in the incident. Two members of the Russian intelligence agency GRU whom the British suspected of being involved in the attack claimed that they had only been in the vicinity of Skripal's house at the time of his poisoning so they could visit the Salisbury Cathedral.

Skripal and his daughter survived the attack, but a woman died after inadvertently coming into contact with the discarded container that had been used to transport the nerve agent.

The U.S. has agreed with the U.K.'s assessment that the Russian government was behind the attack. The U.S. government has already joined the U.K. and several other countries in expelling some Russian diplomats over the Skripal incident. It also imposed some sanctions on Russia related to this case in August 2018.

What happened now?

In a statement to The Hill, an unnamed senior official with the Trump administration explained:

After the first round of sanctions in response to Russia's use of 'novichok' in an assassination attempt against a private citizen in the United Kingdom, Russia did not provide the assurances required under U.S. law so we are imposing the second round of sanctions.

According to Reuters, the State and Treasury Departments came up with these sanctions and sent them to the White House in March.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-markle-uk-nasty-state-visit,2019-08-02

Video recorded by a reporter from Leading Britain's Conversation showed the man at first arguing with protesters while wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat — the symbol of Trump's 2016 campaign that's become a lightning rodfor agrowing number of those on the left who say the MAGA hat is synonymous with racism, bigotry, and hatred.

'Off our streets! Nazi scum!'

But soon the clip showed the man without his hat as surrounding protesters appear to push him around.

At one point the mob — led by a livid light-haired female who stood just inches from the man's face — chanted ""Off our streets! Nazi scum!""

Finally, to the protesters' delight, what appeared to be a milkshake landed on the man's head.

"Trump extends travel ban to UK and Ireland, hints domestic travel restrictions might be next","President Donald Trump announced that the United States will be extending its European travel ban to the United Kingdom and Ireland during a Saturday morning press briefing on the COVID-19 virus, according to Fox News.

""We are looking at it very seriously, yeah, because they've had a little bit of activity unfortunately,"" Trump said when he was asked by a reporter about rumors that the European travel ban would be extended to the two nations. ""So we're going to be looking at that -- we actually already have looked at it and that is going to be announced.""

U.K. and Ireland Travel Bans

Vice President Mike Pence confirmed later that travel from the U.K. and Ireland would be suspended beginning at midnight Monday night. Pence said the decision was based on a unanimous recommendation by public health experts consulted by the White House.

Pence clarified that the restrictions do not apply to Americans who are currently abroad; however, the vice president said U.S. nationals will be tested for the virus upon their arrival at certain points of entry in the United States. Additionally, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the travel ban applies to foreigners who have been in the U.K. or Ireland within the last 14 days.



Fox News also reported that the ban ""does not apply to U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and foreign diplomats,"" nor does it apply to trade cargo.

Domestic travel next?

President Trump also hinted that the administration is looking to temporarily curb domestic U.S. travel.

When he asked by a reporter if he was considering any U.S. travel restrictions, Trump said: ""Yes, specifically from certain areas, yes we are.""

""We're working with the states and we're considering other restrictions, yes,"" Trump added. Pence later explained the administration is ""considering a broad range of measures,"" but said ""no decisions have been made yet.""

The European travel ban extension and possible domestic restrictions would be the latest in a series of measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.





On Wednesday, Trump announced the U.S. would limit travel from Europe for 30 days. At the time, the U.K. and Ireland were exempt from the measures, which were limited to Europe's ""Schengen Area"" consisting of 26 countries, including France, Italy, Switzerland, Norway, and Germany. In February, the Trump administration imposed travel restrictions on China and Iran.

"Democrat Tulsi Gabbard celebrates McAuliffe's loss, says big Republican win in Virginia is a 'victory for all Americans'","Former Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard celebrated Republican Glenn Youngkin's victory over Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia gubernatorial election. Gabbard — a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate — stated that the Republican candidate winning Virginia was a benefit to all Americans.

Gabbard said Wednesday, ""McAuliffe's loss is a victory for all Americans. Why? Because it was a resounding rejection of efforts to divide us by race, the stripping of parental rights, and arrogant, deaf leaders. This benefits us all.""

This is the latest instance of Gabbard slamming members of her own party. Last week, the former lawmaker from Hawaii bashed the Biden administration for starting a legal appeal to reverse a U.K. judge's decision to not extradite the WikiLeaks founder to the U.S. to face espionage charges.

""The increasingly authoritarian Biden/Garland administration is doubling down on its crusade against our constitutionally protected rights of freedom of speech, assembly, etc. by continuing its vindictive retaliatory crusade against Julian Assange,"" Gabbard tweeted with the hashtag ""FreeAssange."" ""If they succeed, it will be another nail in the coffin of democracy—in our country and around the world.""

In late September, Gabbard attacked President Joe Biden for being ""judge, jury, executioner"" when he accused Border Patrol agents of abusing migrants — a narrative that was debunked.



""I consider Joe Biden a friend. But he's absolutely wrong and he needs to apologize to the American people for saying what he said,"" Gabbard said. ""Here's why: He's somebody who's been very outspoken as being against autocrats, autocracies, dictators. But what he essentially did was act as judge, jury, and executioner for these Customs and Border Patrol agents on horseback.""

""The bigget issue that this points to, which is one that we all need to be concerned about, is that if we are no longer a country of laws, if we are no longer a country where we know we will be presumed innocent unless proven guilty, then we don't have a democracy,"" Gabbard stated. ""And that's the increasing feeling that a lot of us have is we are losing our democracy and moving closer and closer to what essentially is an autocracy.""

During a Fox News appearance in early September, Gabbard unloaded on Hillary Clinton for allegedly attacking her for being an ""outsider.""

""It really points to the fact that we have a situation in our country where the powerful elite, people like Hillary Clinton and those around her — the deep state, the media — they're all colluding to destroy outsiders who they deem as posing a threat to their power,"" Gabbard said. ""So essentially, what they do is they create this dictatorship, those who are outsiders, those who put country first, those who are not afraid to to challenge the establishment, and those who don't toe the line, they do all they can to silence, and censor, and eliminate these outsiders if they indeed pose a threat to their power.""

In early October, Gabbard needled Democratic and Republican leaders for the 20 years the United States military was engaged in Afghanistan – the longest war in American history.

""Overall, when we really look at the last twenty years that we spent there, I think there's a few important lessons to take away. Our mission to go into Afghanistan, initially to go after Al-Qaeda, the jihadist terrorists who attacked us on 9/11, declared war against us, was justified. We sent special forces in there who very expeditiously and effectively defeated Al-Qaeda,"" Gabbard, who served in the Hawaii Army National Guard, stated. ""What went wrong after that was when leaders in our country lost sight of that very direct and important mission and instead began to embark on regime change wars and nation building exercises and as we've seen over the last twenty years in Afghanistan specifically, even senior leaders in our government across Democrat and Republican administrations didn't really know what our mission there was.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump_coronavirus_travel_ban_extended,2021-11-04
"Turkey amasses tanks, armored vehicles along southern border, slowly moves into Syria","Turkey is amassing tanks and armored vehicles in cities along its southern border, following President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's vow to take over the fight against ISIS in Syria when American troops withdraw. Erdogan also recently pledged to ramp up strikes against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in the embattled country, and local reports say some Turkish troops have already crossed into Syria.

What are the details?

According to the Daily Mail, Turkey has built up forces in its border cities of Kilis and al-Rai, and the country's foreign minister says they will begin moving into Syria as soon as possible amid anticipation of the imminent pullout of roughly 2,000 American military personnel.

On Sunday, President Donald Trump announced that he was in contact with Erdogan over the U.S. troop withdrawal, and voiced his confidence in Turkey's ability to ""eradicate whatever is left of ISIS in Syria.""

I just had a long and productive call with President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey. We discussed ISIS, our mutual involvement in Syria, & the slow & highly coordinated pullout of U.S. troops from the area. After many years they are coming home. We also discussed heavily expanded Trade.

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2018



President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of ISIS in Syria....and he is a man who can do it plus, Turkey is right “next door."" Our troops are coming home!

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018

Local media said Turkish military vehicles were being amassed along the country's southern border Monday, and some troops had already crossed into Syria, AFP reported.

Anything else?

Washington's relationship with Ankara has improved in recent days, according to Bloomberg. In the past week, the U.S. State Department notified Congress of a proposal to sell Patriot missiles to Turkey, and Erdogan extended an invitation for President Trump to visit Turkey next year.

The Pentagon announced Monday that outgoing Defense Secretary James Mattis signed the order to pull American troops out of Syria. According to Reuters, the withdrawal could begin within weeks.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tulsi-gabbard-virginia-election-victory,2018-12-26
"Rittenhouse, Libs of TikTok, Catturd get verification badges","Twitter has started rolling out the option to pay $7.99 per month to get a blue verification badge, a move that comes not long after billionaire Elon Musk announced a plan to offer the badges for $8 per month.

The accounts of Kyle Rittenhouse, Libs of TikTok, and Catturd now bear the blue badges.

""Thank you @elonmusk!"" Rittenhouse tweeted.

""My $8 investment into getting to witness liberal meltdowns has paid off. Best $8 I ever spent!"" Libs of TikTok tweeted.

""Seriously, how bad is this going to trigger the Left?"" Catturd tweeted. ""I can't stop laughing.""

Last week, Musk referred to the organization's previous ""lords & peasants system"" for obtaining the badges as ""bulls**t,"" adding, ""Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.""

Currently, the new version of Twitter Blue is only available to users in certain countries who use Apple's iOS, though Musk has said that the plan is to eventually expand the offering to other platforms and nations.

""Rollout of new verified Blue is intentionally limited just to iOS in a few countries with very little promotion. As we iron out issues, we will expand worldwide on all platforms,"" Musk tweeted. ""In days to come, we’ll add granularity to verified badge, such as organizational affiliation & ID verification,"" he wrote.

""The new Twitter Blue is currently available for in-app purchase on iOS only in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, with plans to expand,"" Twitter notes. ""New Twitter accounts created on or after November 9, 2022 will not be able to sign up for Twitter Blue at this time.""

""The definition of Verification and the accompanying blue checkmark is changing. Until now, Twitter used the blue checkmark to indicate active, notable, and authentic accounts of public interest that Twitter had independently verified based on certain requirements,"" the company says. ""Now the blue checkmark may mean two different things: either that an account was verified under the previous verification criteria (active, notable, and authentic), or that the account has an active subscription to Twitter Blue. Accounts that receive the blue checkmark as part of a Twitter Blue subscription will not undergo review to confirm that they meet the active, notable and authentic criteria that was used in the previous process.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/turkish-forces-massing-along-syrian-border,2022-11-10
Twitter removes Dr Scott Atlas tweet saying masks don't stop COVID-19,"Dr. Scott Atlas, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, had one of his tweets removed by Twitter on Sunday. The tweet in question, had Atlas claiming that face masks don't prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Atlas, who is a neuroradiologist and health care policy expert, wrote on Saturday: ""Masks work? NO: LA, Miami, Hawaii, Alabama, France, Phlippnes, UK, Spain, Israel. WHO:'widesprd use not supported' + many harms; Heneghan/Oxf CEBM:'despite decades, considerble uncertainty re value'; CDC rvw May:""no sig red'n in inflnz transm'n""; learn why.""

Atlas, who is a Hoover Institution Senior Fellow, also shared a link to an article in ""The American Institute for Economic Research"" that argues against the effectiveness of face masks against coronavirus.

Atlas quote-tweeted his original post with a follow-up post that read: ""That means the right policy is @realDonaldTrump guideline: use masks for their intended purpose - when close to others, especially hi risk. Otherwise, social distance. No widespread mandates. #CommonSense.""

Twitter stated that the tweet violated the social media company's rules on disputed or misleading information: ""If we determine a Tweet contains misleading or disputed information that could lead to harm, we may add a label to the content to provide context.""

Twitter's official blog from May defines ""misleading information"" as ""statements or assertions that have been confirmed to be false or misleading by subject-matter experts, such as public health authorities.""

Atlas told Newsweek that ""he didn't understand why Twitter had deleted his tweet, which included abbreviated citations of multiple sources, some months old, on the effectiveness of widespread mask wearing.""

""Twitter seems to be censoring the science if it goes against their own goals of public indoctrination,"" Atlas said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wear face masks to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.

""We are not defenseless against COVID-19,"" said CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield. ""Cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus – particularly when used universally within a community setting. All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.""

The removal of Atlas' post comes a week after Twitter flagged one of President Donald Trump's tweets about COVID-19. Twitter censored the president because he declared that he is ""immune"" to COVID-19.

""A total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday,"" Trump wrote. ""That means I can't get it (immune), and can't give it. Very nice to know!""

Twitter also locked the official account of the New York Post after the paper published an article that featured alleged emails from Hunter Biden regarding his reported overseas dealings. The New York Post's Twitter account appeared to be still locked as of early Sunday afternoon.

Previously, Atlas caused a stir in July when he told Glenn Beck, ""There is zero science to back up claims that the schools should be closed or even opened with any constraints whatsoever.""

""Frankly, one of the most egregious failures of the policy people is, not just allow[ing] fear to infiltrate their own thinking and do lockdowns, which are severely harmful,"" Atlas told Beck. ""But secondly, they have failed to reassure the public about the facts, and about the relative risk here. It's a very serious dangerous disease — for a group of people. And we know who those people are. They are high-risk, elderly people with comorbidities. Everyone else, it's not a high-risk disease.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/twitter-blue-verification-badges-subscription,2020-10-18
"Twitter suspended UK rapper Zuby for misgendering. All he said was, ‘Ok dude.’","Twitter allegedly suspended British rapper Zuby from the platform Wednesday after he commented ""Ok dude"" in response to another user who claimed to be ""sleeping with more women"" than he. That user turned out to be a trans activist who identifies as a female.

Zuby — who rose to fame last year after he jokingly posted videos of himself breaking the women's deadlift and bench press records while identifying as a woman — took to Twitter recently to share advice with women on ""how to land a great guy.""

That's when another user under the account name ""Pronoun Enforcer"" replied to the post, saying, ""I'm like 95% sure i'm sleeping with more women than you and this is terrible advice.""

Zuby then replied to that comment by simply saying, ""Ok dude"" — a remark that Twitter reportedly found to be ""hateful"" after further review.

""Pronoun Enforcer,"" or transgender left-wing activist Emily Gorcenski, had apparently reported Zuby to the Twitter authorities, complaining that his comment misgendered her. After a week of back-and-forth with Zuby, Twitter decided to suspend him and offer him two options: appeal the ruling or remove the content. If he removed the content, his account would be reinstated after 12 hours, but if he appealed, the incident would be reviewed again. He appealed, but on Wednesday, he found out that his appeal had been rejected and so he had to delete the tweet.

""There was no other option,"" he told the Washington Examiner.

Gorcenski posted on Twitter soon after the decision taking credit for the action taken against Zuby's account, celebrating by saying, ""Lol misogynist down. Pronouns enforced.""

Zuby confirmed the news that his Twitter account had been temporarily suspended on his Instagram despite his appeal.

""I've been temporarily locked out of Twitter for tweeting 'OK dude' in response to someome [sic]. Apparently that violates the 'hateful conduct' policy. Wow... I've appealed it,"" he said including a screenshot of the incident.

""It wasn't even a gendered statement, not that it should even matter,"" Zuby added in his conversation with the Examiner. ""I used it as a synonym for like, 'Yeah, whatever.' I didn't go and research the person I was responding too. Perhaps I should have because they're an antifa activist who spends their time trying to doxx people and get people kicked off platforms that they don't like.""

Several Twitter users have pointed to times when Gorcenski has used violent rhetoric on the platform, including one tweet, which allegedly read: ""I now call all antifa groups to consider the TERF (Trans-exclusionary radical feminist) movement to be properly considered to be a white supremacist movement and treated like the Nazi platform that they are. No one gets left behind.""

At the time of publication, Zuby's Twitter account appeared to be online, but he has yet to post since the incident.

Update: After Gorcenski's account was ranked in a people ""who need their phone taken"" away list by the Washington Examiner's Siraj Hashmi on Thursday, Gorcenski quote-tweeted the ranking with an ironic critique.

""Getting offended over free speech by advocating for the silencing of people with different viewpoints,"" Gorcenski said in regards to being placed on the list, apparently not recognizing the irony.

"U.K., EU finally reach Brexit deal","After years of wrangling, the British government has finally announced a trade deal with the European Union that will govern the trade relationship between the U.K. and European mainland after Brexit.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the deal, which must still be ratified by the British parliament and the EU, on Twitter.





Britain officially left the E.U. on January 1, 2020, after Brexit was approved by a voter referendum in June of 2016. Since the Brexit vote, the British government has been attempting — without success — to hammer out a trade deal with the European Union in order to avoid potentially disastrous trade consequences, including the imposition of tariffs and restrictions on the exportation of British goods to the European continent.

Although Britain officially left the EU in January, it has continued to operate under E.U. rules throughout 2020 while Boris Johnson's government attempted to hammer out an agreement with the EU.

Failure to successfully negotiate a deal that could be ratified by the British parliament ultimately doomed the government of former Prime Minister Theresa May, who resigned in June 2019, saying, ""it it is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new prime minister to lead [Brexit negotiations].""

Johnson's government led an aggressive negotiation which began in March and has continued almost continuously since. One of the last remaining obstacles to a deal was disagreement about EU fishing rights in U.K. waters, a thorny issue that threatened to derail the whole agreement even as late as this week.

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen praised the deal in a statement, saying, ""It has been a long and winding road but we have got a good deal to show for it. It is fair, it is a balanced deal and it is the right and responsible thing to do for both sides.""

As a result of the deal, British MPs have been recalled to Parliament for an emergency session to read the deal and vote on it before the current agreement expires on December 31st. Most observers believe that the deal will pass the British parliament; however, its fate in the EU remains slightly more uncertain.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/twitter-suspended-zuby-for-saying-ok-dude,2020-12-24
UK abruptly reverses move to allow easy home abortions due to coronavirus; officials claim it was a 'publishing error',"The United Kingdom's Department of Health announced earlier this week that, due to coronavirus lockdowns, women would be able to have abortion pills prescribed to them remotely so they could take them at home.

That reported change was quickly reversed by the department, which claims it was a ""publishing error,"" but now members of Parliament are upset about the reversal of a change many of them favored, according to the Independent.

""It's absurd to expect women to be able to travel during lockdown for a vital healthcare procedure that could be done at home,"" Labor MP Stella Creasy said. ""That risks thousands of women being forced to continue an unwanted pregnancy because they cannot access medical services.""

The initial change: In a since-removed announcement on a government website, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced the temporary suspension of a requirement that women seeking abortions have to see a doctor in person first and have two physicians sign off on the procedure. From the Independent:

The move was in response to a number of organisations who wrote to the health secretary urging him to amend the law during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak to stop non-essential travel of women to undergo an abortion.



The new measures make the home, whether that of the patient or medical practitioner, a suitable venue to take both abortion pills, confirmed the Department of Health and Social Care.

The change would've allowed women to consult with doctors on abortion by telephone or video call.

The reversal: The same day, the department announced that the rules on abortion were not changing, and that the published document announcing the change was an error.

The Department of Health says reported changes to the abortion law, that would allow women to take both pills at home during the coronavirus outbreak, are not going ahead.



A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson told The Independent: ""This was published in error. There will be no changes to abortion regulations.""

Lawmakers who supported the change are now inquiring about why the law was reversed to keep abortion restrictions in place, as the publication of the announcement appears to indicate there was at least some consideration of easing the law to allow women to get home abortions during the coronavirus lockdown.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/u-k-eu-finally-reach-brexit-deal,2020-03-25
"UK issues allergy alert over COVID vaccine after 2 fall ill, now says vaccine should only be given where resuscitation measures are available","U.K. regulators say that those people with history of allergic reactions to medicine or food should avoid the COVID-19 vaccine, according to a Wednesday report from the BBC.

The United Kingdom began the process of rolling out the vaccine on Tuesday, following a Dec. 2 approval.

The urgent guidance comes after at least two NHS workers experienced allergic reactions to the new Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Tuesday. Both workers — who reportedly have a history of experiencing allergic reactions — are expected to recover.

What are the details?

Regulators at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said that the two workers experienced an ""anaphylactoid reaction,"" which is ""much milder than anaphylaxis.""

The reaction, according to to the news agency, ""tends to involve a skin rash, breathlessness, and sometimes a drop in blood pressure.""

NHS medical director Stephen Powis said that the two unnamed NHS workers are on the mend.

""As is common with new vaccines, the MHRA have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination after two people with a history of significant allergic reactions have responded adversely,"" he said in a statement on the matter.

According to ABC News, regulators will work to investigate the NHS workers' reactions to the vaccine.

Dr. June Raine, head of the United Kingdom's medical regulatory agency, explained, ""We're looking at two case reports of allergic reactions,'' adding, “We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn't a feature.""

""But if we need to strengthen our advice, now that we have had this experience with the vulnerable populations, the groups who have been selected as a priority, we get that advice to the field immediately,"" she said.

Business Insider reported that health officials have yet to reveal which element of the vaccine caused the reaction in the two NHS workers.

""All regions involved with the vaccination program have been alerted,"" NHS England said according to the outlet, ""and from Wednesday all patients receiving the vaccine will be asked beforehand if they have a history of allergic reactions.""

Further, regulators say that the vaccine should only be administered in facilities where ""resuscitation measures are available.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-abruptly-reverses-move-to-allow-easy-home-abortions-due-to-coronavirus-officials-claim-it-was-a-publishing-error,2020-12-09
UK bans car ad featuring a mother with a baby because of its ‘harmful gender stereotypes’,"The United Kingdom has banned what it deemed harmful advertisements from running in the country after it enacted its ban on commercials that promote ""harmful gender stereotypes.""

What are the details?

The commercial spot, which is an advertisement for Volkswagen's electric eGolf car, features a mother placidly reading a book on an outdoor bench while her baby rests peacefully in a nearby stroller.

Other people featured in the ad include a man camping on a clip, three male astronauts on a spacecraft, and a male para-athlete running a track.

A spokesperson for the ASA said, ""By juxtaposing images of men in extraordinary environments and carrying out adventurous activities with women who appeared passive or engaged in a stereotypical care-giving role, we considered that the ad directly contrasted stereotypical male and female roles and characteristics in a manner that gave the impression that they were exclusively associated with one gender.""

Volkswagen e-Golf Commercial / Advert 2019 www.youtube.com

""We concluded that the ad presented gender stereotypes in a way that was likely to cause harm and therefore breached the Code,"" the statement added.

Jess Tye, who is investigations manager at the ASA, told the BBC that the scenes contained in the Volkswagen ad can certainly cause ""real-world harms.""

""It's about thinking about what the cumulative effect of those gender stereotypes might be,"" Tye explained.

What else?

The ban on controversial advertisements went into effect in June after the ASA determined that advertisements featuring men and women in stereotypical fashion could be ""limiting people's potential."" The rules stipulate that advertisements ""must not include gender stereotypes that are likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offense.""

The Volkswagen ad wasn't the only commercial impacted by the move, either: The ASA nixed a Philadelphia Cream Cheese commercial after it portrayed fathers as bumbling and scatter-brained while having the responsibility of caring for their children.

The ASA determined that the ad — which featured men caring for a child who was accidentally whisked away by a restaurant conveyor belt because they were distracted by food — ""relied on the stereotype that men were unable to care for children as well as women and implied that the fathers had failed to look after the children properly because of their gender.""

UK boarding school turns over its chaplain to anti-terrorism authorities — after he preached against school's LGBTQ policies,"A boarding school in the United Kingdom secretly turned over its chaplain to an anti-terrorism program after preaching a sermon in which he defended students' rights to question the school's new LGBTQ policies, the Daily Mail reported.

What are the details?

The Rev. Dr. Bernard Randall told students at independent Trent College near Nottingham that it was OK for them to disagree with the policies, especially if they go against Church of England principles, the outlet said.

One of the school's new policies was to ""develop a whole school LGBT+ inclusive curriculum,"" the Daily Mail said.

But when the powers that be at the boarding school deemed Randall's sermon ""harmful"" to LGBTQ students, the school turned him in to Prevent, which the outlet said normally identifies individuals at risk of radicalization.

However, after police investigated the tip, they told Trent College that the 48-year-old chaplain posed ""no counter terrorism risk, or risk of radicalization,"" the Daily Mail said, adding that Derbyshire Police confirmed the case ""did not meet the threshold for a Prevent referral.""

But it wasn't over

But the outlet added that Randall — a former Cambridge University chaplain and Oxford graduate — revealed that Trent College later informed him that his future sermons would be censored in advance and that his chapel services would be monitored ""to ensure that ... requirements are met.""

And then Randall was fired, the Daily Mail said.

While the outlet said he's suing for discrimination, harassment, victimization, and unfair dismissal, he shared that ""my career and life are in tatters.""

What did he say in his sermon?

Randall said his June 2019 sermon in the school chapel was prompted by concerns from students about an organization called Educate & Celebrate, which was invited to ""embed gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation into the fabric"" of the school, the Daily Mail said.



""You should no more be told you have to accept LGBT ideology than you should be told you must be in favor of Brexit or must be Muslim,"" Randall preached, according to the outlet.

However, he also encouraged students to ""treat each other with respect,"" the Daily Mail said.

And then a few days later, Randall said he was called to a meeting and told the sermon was inflammatory, divisive, and ""harmful to LGBT pupils,"" the outlet noted.

The Daily Mail said Randall only discovered the anti-terrorism referral because it was mentioned in documents given to him ahead of a disciplinary hearing: ""I had visions of being investigated by MI5, of men knocking down the front door.""

The school finally made Randall ""redundant"" on Dec. 31, 2020, according to Staffordshire Live, which cited the Christian Legal Centre, the organization supporting Randall.

Toby Young of the Free Speech Union told the outlet that Randall's sermon was ""fantastic"" and that it insists ""no one has a monopoly on moral truth. For Bernard Randall to lose his job as a result of this sermon is scandalous. What's so depressing about his treatment is the message it sends to the pupils. The central theme of his sermon is that children shouldn't be afraid to think for themselves. But the message the school has sent is the opposite. Schools should be teaching children how to think, not what to think.""

Andrea Williams — chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre — asked, ""Who are the extremists in this story? The partisan agency who teach young children that they can be born in the wrong body, or the school chaplain moderately presenting what the Christian church has taught about marriage, sex, and gender for the past 2,000 years?"" the Daily Mail said.

Randall's case is scheduled for a hearing in June, the outlet said, adding that Trent College declined to comment.

UK bus driver suspended after allegedly refusing to operate bus supporting Pride events,"A bus driver in the United Kingdom was suspended after allegedly refusing to operate a bus supporting Pride events, BBC News reported.

""This bus promotes homosexuality, and I refuse to drive it,"" he reportedly told passengers in Norwich, England, the outlet said, adding that the bus displayed rainbow-colored numbers in recognition of the city's Pride events in July.

A passenger shared on Twitter that the bus was delayed while another driver was found — and then she complained to staff at Norwich Park and Ride, BBC News reported.

What did the bus driver's bosses have to say?



Go East Anglia, which runs Konectbus, told the outlet the driver was suspended and an investigation had commenced. The company also noted on Twitter that it ""prides itself on values that support diversity and inclusion and has been a champion of Norwich Pride since 2017,"" BBC News said.

""We particularly want all customers of whatever background or sexual orientation to feel comfortable on our services.,"" Go East Anglia added, according to the outlet. ""As a company we do not condone any behavior from our drivers that does not support this view.""

What did an LGBTQ leader have to say?



""Our reaction is this type of prejudiced view is exactly why we started Norwich Pride in 2009, to ensure homophobia is visibly challenged and the city is safe and inclusive for all,"" Julie Bremner, trustee of Norwich Pride, told BBC News. ""We are pleased to see the bus company take action following this complaint. When the buses started showing a rainbow number in 2017, people in our LGBT+ community were delighted as this was another visible symbol to say Norwich welcomes all and is a city of diversity.""

"UK cinemas capitulate to Muslim demands, pull film about Muhammad's daughter following outcry","A popular U.K. cinema chain capitulated to demands from angry Muslim protesters over the weekend by announcing it would cancel all upcoming screenings of ""The Lady of Heaven,"" a new film about the daughter of the prophet Muhammad.

The stunning decision garnered immediate criticism online from free speech advocates and defenders of the arts.

The movie's executive producer, Malik Shlibak, called Cineworld's acquiescence ""unacceptable"" and went so far as to accuse the chain of ""bowing down to radical extremists,"" the Daily Mail reported. Likewise, Claire Fox, who sits in the House of Lords, slammed the move as ""disastrous for the arts, dangerous for free speech, a lesson to those who argue identity politics are no threat to democracy.""

Cineworld, on the other hand, defended its decision by claiming it pulled the film out of fear for staff and customer safety.

""Due to recent incidents related to screenings of 'The Lady of Heaven,' we have made the decision to cancel upcoming screenings of the film nationwide to ensure the safety of our staff and customers,"" the cinema chain said.

The incidents it was referring to were protests at theaters across the country, some hundreds strong, where furious Muslims blasted the movie as ""blasphemous."" 5Pillars, a Muslim news site, tweeted a photo on Sunday showing what it alleged to be ""200 Muslims protesting against sectarian hate film Lady of Heaven outside Cineworld in Broad Street, Birmingham.""

Shortly after, a video began circulating online showing the manager of Sheffield Cineworld informing protesters that Sunday night’s screening had been cancelled to loud cheers and cries of ""Allahu Akbar.""

Sheffield Cineworld Cancel Sectarian Hate Film ‘Lady of Heaven’ www.youtube.com

At issue for the Muslim protesters is the portrayal of Muhammad by an actor as well as the film's purportedly negative depiction of the religion's key figures and Muslim religion itself.

A petition on change.org signed by more than 100,000 people states: ""The film directly disrespects Prophet Muhammad who is depicted by an actor, deeply shocking and disrespectful to the best of creation. It is also a deeply racist film with all the main negative characters being portrayed by black actors. Furthermore it also portrays the companions of our Prophet Muhammad in a bad manner.""

But writing for the Spectator, columnist Brendan O'Neill noted that many of the protesters weren't so much religious fanatics but seeming members of the ""godless woke mob.""

To prove his point, he referred to one protester in Bradford, West Yorkshire, who reportedly said: ""We are very offended. We have a right not to be insulted,"" adding, ""You have no right to tell us our history. We will not let this film go on further.""

UK climate activist group claims to have deflated dozens of tires in NYC,"The climate activist group Tyre Extinguishers, which originated in the United Kingdom, claims to have reached American shores.

For the first time in the group's history, TE says that it has successfully deflated the tires of dozens of SUVs in wealthy New York City neighborhoods. On Tuesday, the group tweeted, ""BIG NEWS: TYRE EXTINGUISHERS STRIKE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK CITY! 40 SUVs disarmed in the Upper East Side, the first of many.""

Because of the supposed environmental damage caused by vehicles like SUVs, which require larger quantities of fuel, the group encourages people to deflate SUV tires (spelled with a Y in the U.K.) on cars parked in affluent areas to call attention to the issue. In order to avoid damaging the tires permanently, the group suggests that those sympathetic to their cause should unscrew tire valves on SUVs and insert a small object like a lentil bean inside to exert pressure. Once the valve has been loosely re-tightened, air can escape and the tire will deflate slowly.

Many TE participants also often leave on the windshield of a targeted vehicle a memo that attempts to explain to victims the purpose of their acts of petty vandalism.

""You'll be angry,"" the note admits, ""but don't take it personally. It's not you. It's your car.""

As the letter goes on, however, the tone becomes much less apologetic: ""That's why we have taken this action. You will have no difficulty getting around without your gas guzzler, with walking, cycling or public transit.""

Tyre Extinguishers claim to be decentralized with no formal leadership or governing principles other than that they ""want to see bans on SUVs in urban areas, pollution levies to tax SUVs out of existence, and massive investment in free, comprehensive public transport. But until politicians make this a reality, Tyre Extinguishers action will continue.""

Deflating tires is their method of choice to achieve that end.

They also warn that their influence is growing and that New Yorkers should expect to see more such tire attacks in the near future: ""This is the first action in New York City, the first of many.""

Though Yahoo! UK reported on incidents that TE committed in Edinburgh back in April, no American news outlets or New York police departments have yet confirmed the crimes that TE supposedly committed in New York recently. According to Gersh Kuntzman and Noah Martz of StreetsBLOG NYC, ""[T]he neighborhood’s 19th and 17th precincts both told a Streetsblog reporter that they had gotten no reports from SUV owners of anything of the sort.""

UK college falls over itself in apologies after students complain speaker linked to gay conversion therapy was part of Christian conference held at school,"One might argue — in these days of perpetual outrage — that the squeaky wheel indeed gets the grease.

Well, as long as it's the right kind of wheel.

What happened?

Seems a speaker linked to gay conversion therapy was part of a Christian conference held at Worcester College in the United Kingdom earlier this month, the Oxford Tab reported.

And when some students learned the Wilberforce Academy's conference included Mike Davidson — who advocates for ""professional assistance"" to help individuals ""leave behind unwanted homosexual practices"" — the perturbed students complained to Worcester College for hosting the conference, the Tab noted.

The students asserted that Davidson's stances are ""hateful and invalidating,"" the outlet added.

Who is Davidson?

Davidson is CEO of Core Issues Trust and X-Out Loud, the Tab reported, adding that he has said he ""takes people seriously who say they want to move away from homosexual practices and feelings"". Davidson spoke at a conference event titled, ""LGBT and Change,"" the outlet said.

Davidson's group also is concerned about the ""encroaching politico-religious identity of Islam"" and tries to ""understand how to respond to these doctrines,"" the outlet also noted. But some students deemed such language inflammatory and were disturbed by a conference session titled, ""The nature of Islam,"" the Tab reported.

What did the upset students do?

The angry students emailed Worcester's Junior Common Room president, LGBTQ+ representative, and Ethnic and Religious Minorities representative, the outlet said.

""Many of us come to uni hoping to be allowed to be ourselves and know we can trust our new community and home,"" the students' email read, according to the Tab. ""But how are we expected to place our trust in somewhere that, if it weren't for a leaflet being left behind at breakfast, would have left us unaware that they had hosted a group that has consistently aimed to persecute and strip us of our rights for our sexuality, gender, and or religion?""

Deluge of apologies

Check out the massive mea culpa from a Worcester spokesperson, according to the Tab:

""We deeply regret the distress caused to students, staff, and other members of the college community by the presence of the Wilberforce Academy conference. The college was not aware of the speaker list or program content in advance. The booking was taken in good faith, but it is clear that our procedures did not work as they should. We have begun an urgent review to ensure that this does not happen again. We have agreed with the JCR Committee that the profit from the conference will be set aside to fund dedicated equality, diversity, and inclusivity initiatives. We are working with students and other members of the college community to identify the most appropriate projects. We acknowledge that this was a serious failure that has caused significant distress, and we apologize unreservedly to all those who have been affected.""

The outlet also noted a reply from the co-chair of the SU LGBTQ+ Campaign:

""We stand in full solidarity with you and will do our best to take the necessary action to prevent this from being an issue again in the future. We were totally unaware this was happening and are extremely upset to hear that Worcester has hosted individuals propagating such a harmful rhetoric, and as you say, seemingly tried to do so without drawing attention to the fact it was happening. We agree that it is alarming that an organization with such a poor history across the university should continue to be given a platform, and are keen to prevent this from being the case in the future.""

Oh, and here's what the JCR Committee had to say, according to the Tab:

""We appreciate how promptly the college took action, to resolve their oversight in hosting the Wilberforce Academy. We were equally shocked and disappointed to hear about the conference, and we would like to thank the freshers who brought it to our attention and voiced their worries. We would like to encourage all students not to hesitate to contact us if something in college concerns them.""

How did Wilberforce Academy respond?

As you might imagine, Wilberforce Academy was not happy that the college apologized for hosting its conference — and called it an example of ""cancel culture.""

Andrea Minichiello Williams, chief executive of Christian Concern — which runs Wilberforce Academy — told the Tab the following:

""It seems that cancel culture has once again demonstrated the power of its grip in one of our top universities, fueled by a small group of activists who won't tolerate any view that departs from their own narrow ideology and who will resort to tactics of misrepresentation and sweeping allegations to get their way, seemingly frightening nearly everyone into submission. That a college now led by someone who has so often claimed to be a defender of freedom of expression in higher education is rumored to have capitulated to this aggressive movement is even more concerning. We very much enjoyed our week at the college, were very warmly welcomed, including by the Provost, received many compliments from the staff and were not aware of any complaints or concerns being raised with us at the time. Yet now we hear it alleged that the college has 'apologized' for hosting us! We will be seeking urgent clarification. Whatever happens, we will continue to speak of Jesus Christ who was himself an 'outsider' and by his words and actions demonstrated his commitment to reaching the marginalized, excluded, and vulnerable so that they could discover true hope and everlasting love through him, even sacrificing his own life to do so.""

UK college will pay students to monitor racist language and 'microaggressions' on campus,"The University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom announced that it's hiring students to monitor and stand up to ""microaggressions"" on campus as well as language deemed racist, BBC News reported.

What are the details?

Due to demand from the student body, 20 ""race equality champions"" will work two to nine hours weekly for a little over $12 per hour (U.S.) to challenge wrongdoings — and will be trained to ""lead healthy conversations"" about preventing racism on campus and how ""to help their peers understand racism and its impact,"" the outlet said.

The school said microaggressions are defined as ""subtle but offensive comments"" that might be unintentional but can upset minority groups, BBC News reported.

Examples of microaggressions, the outlet said, include phrases like:

""Stop making everything a race issue.""

""Why are you searching for things to be offended about?""

""Where are you really from?""

""I don't want to hear about your holiday to South Africa. It's nowhere near where I'm from.""

""Being compared to black celebrities that I look nothing like.""

Vice chancellor Koen Lamberts told BBC News the idea is to ""change the way people think about racism"" — and rather than wanting to control speech, the university says it's ""opening up a conversation.""

The Equality and Human Rights Commission last fall warned that racism was a ""common occurrence"" among some students, the outlet said, adding that examples included name-calling, physical attacks, and racist material on campus.

Anything else?

One might say speech in the U.K. isn't protected nearly as well as it is in America:

Interestingly, a recent poll found that among U.S. millennials, 51% believe hate speech should be against the law — so one can imagine the percentage in the same age group in the U.K. with its laws against certain kinds of speech.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-college-falls-over-itself-in-apologies-after-students-complain-speaker-linked-to-gay-conversion-therapy-was-part-of-christian-conference-held-at-school,2020-01-15
UK fires thousands of coronavirus contact tracers after reports they are watching Netflix and doing quizzes over lack of work,"The United Kingdom is firing a third of the contact tracers hired to track the spread of the coronavirus after reports that they had very little to do and were spending their time watching Netflix and doing quizzes.

Experts have opined that contact tracing is an essential technique to aid in stopping the spread of coronavirus. It involves tracers contacting people who might have been exposed to others infected with the virus.

'World-beating'

Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed in May that the UK would implement a top of the line contact tracing program.

""We have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and test operation that will be world-beating and yes, it will be in place by June 1,"" said Johnson at the time.

He said the government expected to hire 25,000 contact tracers that would be able to trace 10,000 new daily cases.

Barbecue, Netflix and quizzes

Three months later, he is facing criticism after numerous reports that many of those hired for the program have nothing to do.

One contact tracer told The Guardian that he heard many stories of others making very few calls.

""I've heard of tracers claiming to be sat in the garden having a barbecue so that they can stay logged in and clock up the hours,"" they said. ""They aren't alone – there's hundreds, if not thousands, of similar stories.""

Another report in the BBC documented a clinician who said her boss didn't give her anything to do for a week after being hired on as a contact tracer.

""I've had no contact from anyone. I've had no contact from supervisors,"" she said. ""I've literally been on the system, refreshed the system, and entertained myself during that watching Netflix.""

""All Boris [Johnson] has done has hired thousands of people so he can say 'we have this' but you have got thousands of people doing nothing,"" said another whistleblower to MailOnline.

On Monday, the National Health System announced that it would fire a third of those hired for contact tracing, from 18,000 down to 12,000.

In May, California Gov. Gavin Newsom revealed that the state had hired thousands of contact tracers he called ""disease detectives,"" who could help determine who needed to be quarantined to stop the spread of the virus.

'You're killing people! Go home!': UK cop blasts journalist documenting woman's removal from park; police said she was 'clearly not exercising',"Journalist Michael Segalov noted on Twitter that while walking through Finsbury Park in London on April 5 he spotted police confronting a woman who protested she was being treated unfairly.

What happened next?

""I have done nothing wrong,"" the woman could be heard saying on video Segalov recorded as police led her out of the park. ""I'm not resisting.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

After he followed the officers and the woman out of the park where they stopped by a pair of police vans, Segalov recounted in his Twitter thread that he was ""quickly surrounded — much closer than 2 meters — by 5 male officers. They stopped me being able to keep a safe distance. I explained calmly that I'm a journalist and was documenting an incident while walking.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

He then said Sgt. Gary Brown (3058U) got in his face and said he was ""not authorized to go around videoing"" before letting loose with some hollering: ""You're killing people! Go home!""



""Or you get fined,"" another officer told Segalov.

What happened later?



According to a complaint letter filed by the ITN network, Segalov felt the officer's spittle on his face, VICE reported.

More from the outlet:

The National Police Chiefs' Council guidance on working with journalists during the coronavirus outbreak clearly states that ""journalists are covered as key workers,"" acknowledges that there is ""a public interest in keeping the population informed,"" and that police will ""engage"" with journalists if they are unsure why they are outside. Journalists are expected to follow the guidelines on social distancing, which Segalov was doing until he was surrounded.

""We are in a public health emergency, not a police state,"" Segalov also noted on his Twitter thread. ""Surely officers must not be able to act without scrutiny, and journalists must not be aggressively stopped from documenting what they see.""

VICE also said Segalov wants an investigation into Sgt. Brown and the other officers as well as a public apology.

What did police have to say?

Police told the outlet that officers were encouraging a woman who was ""clearly not exercising"" to leave the park when ""a man, who identified himself as a journalist, began filming the interaction. The officers spoke to the man. We can confirm a complaint has been received in relation to that interaction which is currently being considered. We always expect our officers to engage with the public in a courteous and respectful manner and where this is not the case, their conduct will be reviewed and they can rightfully be held to account.""

According to the Islington Gazette, vans with loudspeakers have been at parks telling people, ""You should only be here for exercise. If you're not, then please go home.""

Pattern emerging?

TheBlaze recently reported on several disturbing incidents regarding United Kingdom police and their actions related to coronavirus social distancing measures:

On Monday, an expletive-filled video was posted to Twitter showing a man berating ""British f***ing police"" who allegedly bashed through his front door ""to make sure there's nothing going on"" amid the COVID-19 lockdown.

Content warning: More than a few F-bombs:

The previous week, a U.K. cop was caught on video telling a man he isn't allowed to sit in his own front garden due to the government's COVID-19 lockdown.

The officer also chastised the man for wanting to go to the supermarket twice — and that she saw him out earlier after making a nonessential purchase: ""You've already been to the shop once; I've seen you with two cans of pop.""

UK cop tells man he can't sit in his own front garden due to COVID-19 lockdown: 'I'm asking you to go indoors; are you refusing to go indoors?',"A police officer in the United Kingdom was recorded on video Thursday telling a man he wasn't allowed to sit in his own front garden due to the government's COVID-19 lockdown, Metro UK reported.

What are the details?

Daniel Connell — who recorded the incident — had been spending time in his Eastwood, Rotherham, front garden with his partner and two children when the officer approached him near his doorstep, the outlet said.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

""You cannot come on your front garden,"" the officer was heard saying, adding that she had a bodycam as well. ""I'm recording [this video]; you cannot come on your front garden.""



Metro UK noted that government guidelines allow people to spend as much time as they want in their own gardens during the lockdown period, although social distancing measures must be observed if the areas border public paths or roads.

Connell argued that the officer was contradicting government guidelines, the outlet said, but she didn't budge: ""You know when you look around and there's nobody out? It's because you can't come out.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

The officer also said it wasn't a person thing: ""It's not me; it's the government.""



Big Brother has powerful eyes

In what may be an even more disturbing exchange, Metro UK said the officer also chastised Connell for wanting to go to the supermarket twice — and that she saw him out earlier: ""You've already been to the shop once; I've seen you with two cans of pop.""

The outlet said the officer claimed his soft drink purchase was nonessential.

""I'm asking you to go indoors; are you refusing to go indoors?"" the officer asked Connell, after which he replied that he was indoors. She then walked away.

Here's the clip:

Mea culpability



In the wake of the incident, South Yorkshire Police apologized and said the officer in the video has now been reminded of the lockdown guidelines for the public, Metro UK noted.



""This encounter was well-intentioned but ill-informed, and we'd like to apologize for the way it was handled,"" South Yorkshire Police said, according to the outlet. ""We've spoken to the officer concerned and made our approach absolutely clear. Again, we apologize for any inconvenience caused and will continue our work to support the [National Health Service]. Current guidelines from the government allow for the use of your gardens both front and back. If you garden has a road or path running along it then be aware of social distancing if there is likely to be people passing by on foot — please use common sense.""

Alexander Stafford, member of Parliament for Rother Valley, said in response to the video that the officer's behavior ""is clearly not right"" and ""an overreach!""

UK court stops forced abortion order imposed upon disabled woman,"A British high court has overturned a ruling forcing an abortion on the child of a disabled woman in the United Kingdom, reports indicated on Monday.

According to a report at Catholic News Service, the English Court of Appeal —which includes Lord Justice McCombe, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Peter Jackson — overturned a ruling reached Friday by Justice Nathalie Lieven just days before.

The three-judge panel says that it will release the reasons for its ruling at a later date, according to the CNA report, but admitted that the circumstances of the case were unique.

Lieven permitted the involuntary abortion to go forward in a decision on Friday, despite the fact that the unborn child's grandmother made it clear that she would assume care for the child. Lieven also acknowledged the highly invasive nature of her ruling, but still decided the need for a coerced abortion outweighed that, despite the will of the mother, the grandmother, and a social worker.

""I am acutely conscious of the fact that for the State to order a woman to have a termination where it appears that she doesn't want it is an immense intrusion,"" Lieven ruled. ""I have to operate in [her] best interests, not on society's views of termination.""

Levien said that the abortion was in the developmentally disabled woman's ""best interests"" because she said that having the child would be more traumatic than killing it in utero and that she didn't understand the gravity of childbearing.

""I think she would like to have a baby in the same way she would like to have a nice doll,"" Lieven decided.

In a statement released after the decision, the pro-life Right to Life U.K. celebrated the decision, but said that its fight in matters like this was far from over.

""This is a very welcome decision that will save the life of the unborn child and the mother from a forced late-term abortion and much undue distress,"" said Right to Life U.K.'s Clare McCarthy. ""However, the horrific original ruling should never have happened.

""Unfortunately, we fear that this is not a one-off case,"" McCarthy's statement continues. ""We are calling on the Department of Health to urgently reveal how many women have been forced to have an abortion in the UK over the last 10 years and make it clear how they will ensure it will not happen again.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-cop-tells-man-he-cant-sit-in-his-own-front-garden-due-to-covid-19-lockdown,2019-06-24
"Report: COVID variant from UK 'likely' more lethal, could become dominant strand in America by March","British scientists believe that a coronavirus variant spreading throughout the United Kingdom is more lethal than the original COVID-19 strain.

Even more troubling, scientists believe the deadlier variant may become the dominant virus strain in the United States by March.

What are the details?

Government scientists in the U.K. revealed last week the viral variant, known as B.1.1.7, is ""likely"" responsible for an increased risk of hospitalization and death, the New York Times reported.

The variant has been reported in at least 82 different countries.

More from the Times:

The reasons for an elevated death rate are not entirely clear. Some evidence suggests that people infected with the variant may have higher viral loads, a feature that could not only make the virus more contagious but also potentially undermine the effectiveness of certain treatments. ...



But scientists are also trying to understand how much of the increased risk of death may stem from the propensity of the variant to spread very easily through settings like nursing homes, where people are already vulnerable.

Overall, scientists have estimated the variant is spreading 35% to 45% quicker than the original strain in the U.S. and is possibly 30% to as high as 70% more lethal, Axios noted.

However, Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, warned there remain ""several limitations"" with the results of the latest study by U.K. government experts.

Cevik told the Times ""there are other explanations of this increased severity,"" citing the variant being able to ""transmit disproportionately in settings with frailer people,"" like nursing homes.

Indeed, the study ""struggled to account for the presence of underlying illnesses in people infected with the new variant, and for whether the cases originated in nursing homes,"" according to the Times.

US dominance by March?

Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Research Institute who co-authored a U.S.-based study on the variant, predicted it would become the dominant strain in the U.S. by March if it spreads here at the same rate that it has in the U.K.

""We should probably prepare for this being the predominant lineage in most places in the United States by March,"" she said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new warnings about the variant last month.

""I want to stress that we are deeply concerned that this strain is more transmissible and can accelerate outbreaks in the U.S. in the coming weeks,"" Dr. Jay Butler, deputy director for infectious diseases at the CDC, said. ""We're sounding the alarm and urging people to realize the pandemic is not over and in no way is it time to throw in the towel.""

UK dementia patients to be tracked with monitors in their homes,"Dementia patients in England will soon be monitored in their homes with ""smart devices"" used to track any sudden change in behaviors. The intent of the program is to allow sufferers to avoid being placed in institutional care, but critics fear the new program violates an array of privacy rights.

What are the details?



The U.K.'s National Health Service is partnering with researchers at John Moores University to begin tracking a pool of 50 dementia patients this fall, with the goal of having the devices in 1,000 homes by 2020. Scientists say the meters are capable of alerting family members and caretakers if a patient experiences a fall, illness, or a decline in their medical state, the Sun reported.

A six-month trial of the monitors was conducted in 2017, giving officials the confidence to move forward in expanding the program. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said in a statement that the installation of such devices ""shows how innovative technologies enabled by smart meters can improve many aspects of our lives, not just our energy use.""

""This kind of technology has the potential to change someone's quality of life, and their families' lives, for the better by helping patients with long-term conditions stay at home and remain independent for longer,"" the statement continued.

Researchers have not yet secured funding from the Department of Health, but are moving forward with the trial regardless because private firms have expressed a willingness to foot the bill.

What about privacy concerns?

Patients must consent to having the devices installed. But according to the Daily Mail, ""privacy campaigners warn that the meters will hand suppliers a 'honeypot' of data which could be sold on to marketing firms or fall into the hands of hackers.""

Consumer rights advocate Martyn James told the Mail, ""Finding new and creative ways to support vulnerable people in their own homes is a good thing, but this proposal opens the door to a huge range of privacy concerns.""

He added, ""We should be extremely wary when it comes to allowing businesses and organizations access to this level of data — and the fact that it can be taken in this level of detail raises the question: What else is technology revealing about our private lives and what if it falls into the wrong hands? Burglars, for example, could use it to identify when people are out of the house.""

UK elementary school strips 'Lord' from Jesus in 'Away in a Manger' so 'all our children' can attend Christmas carol service,"A United Kingdom elementary school has stripped Jesus of his ""Lord"" title in the iconic ""Away in a Manger"" Christmas carol so all students can attend a Christmas-themed event, the Daily Mail reported.

So the phrase ""little Lord Jesus"" will be sung as ""baby boy Jesus"" when students at Whitehall Primary School in Chingford, Essex, attend a carol service and nativity play Tuesday at St. Peter and St. Paul Church, the outlet said.

What's more, a pair of modern hymns have been altered for the event, the Daily Mail reported: The phrase ""Jesus the savior"" from ""Love Shone Down"" has been replaced with ""Jesus the baby,"" and the words ""new King born today"" from ""Come and Join the Celebration"" has been replaced with ""a baby born today.""



Why?

""We are a community school serving children from a range of faith backgrounds,"" a school spokesman told the outlet. ""In the past, not all were able to come together to celebrate Christmas, so we have worked hard with our local church to ensure the celebrations this year are accessible to all our children to participate in, together, as one.""

A spokesman for the Diocese of Chelmsford — which includes St. Peter and St. Paul Church — added to the Daily Mail that ""the service maintains the traditional Christian message of the joy of Christmas in a way that can be celebrated by everyone, including those of other faiths and none.""

Some don't see it that way

One mother — who's also a former police officer — told the outlet the lyric changes are unacceptable and akin to taking ""Christ"" out of ""Christmas.""

""If he was just a baby boy named Jesus, there wouldn't be a celebration in the first place,"" the 36-year-old mother told the Daily Mail. ""He is our Lord and Savior and King of all Kings. That's the whole point. It is also a tradition. [The lyric changes are] taking away the traditions of the country.""

She added to the outlet that her two sons — ages 9 and 11, both of whom go to church and Sunday school — were upset when Whitehall head teacher Zakia Khatun announced the lyric changes: ""My kids are being stopped from having the freedom to express their beliefs. They are shocked.""



The mother also told the Daily Mail that during a Friday meeting Khatun insisted the school is inclusive of all children and that last year 60 children didn't attend the carol service and nativity play due to their religious beliefs. But the mom added to the outlet that the school is discriminating against Christian students.

""We live in a multicultural society, so we should respect other beliefs, but unfortunately Christianity is not getting respect,"" the mother told the Daily Mail. ""Ms. Khatun doesn't want the people who don't have the same beliefs to feel excluded, yet it's OK to exclude Christians.""

What did others have to say?

""This is a carol known throughout the world. The words 'Lord Jesus' are about the central message of Christmas, which is that God is with us in Jesus,"" Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, a former Bishop of Rochester, told the outlet. ""To put it very simply: that's what Christmas is about.""

Andrea Williams, chief executive of Christian Concern, also told the Daily Mail that ""removing the Lordship of Christ at Christmas guts the Christian message of its truth, around which the whole of Western civilization once based its culture.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-dementia-patients-tracking-monitors,2019-12-16
UK gov't condemns 'the creeping culture of censorship' and issues new policies to strengthen academic freedom,"The Department of Education in Britain issued a strong statement condemning suppression of free speech in higher education and affirmed that the government would defend free speech rights.

The statement was presented to the Parliament and released to the public on Tuesday.

""There are some in our society who prioritise 'emotional safety' over free speech, or who equate speech with violence. This is both misguided and dangerous,"" said Gavin Williamson, Secretary of Education.

""The rise of intolerance and 'cancel culture' upon our campuses is one that directly affects individuals and their livelihoods. Students have been expelled from their courses, academics fired and others who have been forced to live under the threat of violence,"" he continued.

""Though there are noble exceptions, often a blind eye has been turned to the creeping culture of censorship. A culture has been allowed to develop in which it is seen as acceptable, even virtuous, for an academic to sign an open letter that calls for another to be dismissed or defunded,"" he added.

Williamson said that he would change the policies at the Education Department in order to more fully protect free speech rights.

""I am deeply worried about the chilling effect on campuses of unacceptable silencing and censoring. That is why we must strengthen free speech in higher education, by bolstering the existing legal duties and ensuring strong, robust action is taken if these are breached,"" he explained.

One of those actions is the appointment of a new Free Speech and Academic Freedom Champion who would investigate accusations of infringement of speech and academic freedom. The Champion might recommend fines in some instances where the new policies were violated.

Free speech advocates like politics professor Eric Kaufman praised the development.

""This has implications well beyond universities and is to be welcomed,"" he tweeted.

Report: UK government believes it's possible that COVID-19 came from Chinese lab,"The United Kingdom government reportedly believes that the COVID-19 outbreak could have stemmed from an accidental leak at a Chinese laboratory.

At the time of this writing, most experts believe that the outbreak occurred after an animal infected a human at an outdoor animal market in Wuhan, China.

What are the details?

A Sunday report in the Daily Mail revealed that U.K. officials are not ruling out the possibility that the novel coronavirus outbreak could have emerged from a Chinese laboratory.

One government official told the outlet, ""There is a credible alternative [to the zoonotic theory] based on the virus. Perhaps it is no coincidence that there is that laboratory in Wuhan. It is not discounted.""

According to the outlet, there are at least two research laboratories in close physical proximity to the Wuhan animal market in question. Those laboratories are the Institute of Virology, and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control. The Institute of Virology, according to the outlet, is the ""most advanced laboratory of its type on the Chinese mainland.""

Previously, the U.K. Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee accused the Chinese government of spreading disinformation surrounding the virus.

""Disinformation about COVID-19 has already cost lives,"" the committee said last week. ""It is essential that the Government issues clear and transparent messages at home to confront and rebut disinformation spread by foreign powers.""

A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy said that ""there has been no scientific or medical conclusion yet on the origin of COVID-19, as relevant tracing work is still underway. The WHO has made repeated statements that what the world is experiencing now is a global phenomenon, the source is undetermined, the focus should be on containment, and any stigmatizing language referring to certain places must be avoided.""

What else?



Just last week, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius floated a similar theory in that an accidental leak took place in the area.

Rutgers University Professor Richard Ebright, who works at the school's microbiology institute, said that Wuhan scientists at such facilities were only using ""minimal protections"" while working with dangerous infections.

""Virus collection, culture, isolation, or animal infection at BSL-2 with a virus having the transmission characteristics of the outbreak virus would pose substantial risk of infection of a lab worker, and from the lab worker, the public,"" he said. He also insisted that there is no way to rule out a lab accident.

At the time of this writing, at least 1,292,564 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed around the world. At least 70,798 people have died because of the deadly virus.

"To decrease knife attacks, UK gov't office puts 'knife free' messages on chicken boxes — and gets mocked for racism. And mocked in general.","The United Kingdom indeed has been facing an uphill battle when it comes to knife attacks.

Statistics show knife crimes involving murders and robberies have risen for five straight years in England and Wales, Fox News reported. Authorities recorded 43,516 knife crime offenses between April 2018 and March 2019 — an 80 percent increase from the same period five years earlier when only 23,945 offenses were recorded, the cable network added.

Officials have tried a number of tactics to stem the tide of knife attacks: Replacing knives with blunt-tipped cutlery in the kitchens of domestic abuse victims; collecting knives through ""surrender"" boxes (one of which was broken into and cleaned out); a member of Parliament even suggested placing GPS trackers in the handles of every knife sold.

And much mockery ensued.

A new idea



But now the U.K.'s Home Office — the lead immigration agency there — is trying something new: Placing ""knife free"" messages on chicken boxes.

Image source: Twitter

That's right. Over 321,000 chicken boxes with the government's #knifefree campaign have been distributed to over 210 outlets in England and Wales, according to PA Media, which added that the insides of the boxes include young people's real life stories about choosing to pursue positive activities instead of carrying knives.

""These chicken boxes will bring home to thousands of young people the tragic consequences of carrying a knife and challenge the idea that it makes you safer,"" Policing Minister Kit Malthouse added to the PA Media.

But the mockery seemed worse this time, as some said the campaign is racist.

'What's next, #KnifeFree watermelons?'

""Is this some kind of joke?! Why have you chosen chicken shops? What's next, #KnifeFree watermelons?"" Labor member of Parliament David Lammy tweeted.

He added to The Guardian that the Home Office ""is pushing the stereotype that black people love fried chicken. This ridiculous stunt is either explicitly racist or, at best, unfathomably stupid.""

Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbot tweeted, ""Instead of investing in a public health approach to violent crime, the Home Office have opted for yet another crude, offensive and probably expensive campaign. They would do better to invest in our communities not demonize them,"" the Guardian said.

Others on Twitter offered more cutting reactions:

""When a civilization dies.""

""Remember when you guys ruled the world? Now look at you.""

""Wow. Clowned right out. This is top dumb.""

""The UK is a f***ing Monty Python skit.""

""The greatest generation weeps in shame at what you've become.""

""This is the stupidest s**t I've ever seen.""

""Honest to god if the best idea you have to tackle knife crime is to write stuff on fried chicken you should quit power forever in embarrassment, not tweet it out proudly like you've just solved world hunger you ridiculous sack of used d***s.""

UK immigration office argues that Christianity is not a peaceful religion while refusing asylum to Iranian convert from Islam,"The United Kingdom's lead immigration agency argued that Christianity isn't a peaceful religion — and even quoted Bible passages to bolster the claim — during the course of refusing asylum to an Iranian convert from Islam, the Independent reported.

The letter from the UK Home Office said the Book of Revelation is ""filled with imagery of revenge, destruction, death and violence"" and cited six passages, the paper said.

""These examples are inconsistent with your claim that you converted to Christianity after discovering it is a 'peaceful' religion, as opposed to Islam which contains violence, rage, and revenge,"" the letter added.

Nathan Stevens, the asylum-seeker's caseworker, argued back on Twitter: ""I've seen a lot over the years, but even I was genuinely shocked to read this unbelievably offensive diatribe being used to justify a refusal of asylum.""

He added, ""Whatever your views on faith, how can a government official arbitrarily pick bits out of a holy book and then use them to trash someone's heartfelt reason for coming to a personal decision to follow another faith?""

The Iranian national claimed asylum in 2016, Stevens added on Twitter, and he is appealing the decision.

What did the immigration office have to say?

The Home Office told the Independent the denial letter was ""not in accordance"" with its policy about claims based on religious persecution and said it's working to improve training for decision-makers on religious conversion.

What did others have to say?

Legal expert Conor James McKinney told the paper the letter is an example of the Home Office's tendency to ""come up with any reason they can to refuse asylum.""

""You can see from the text of the letter that the writer is trying to pick holes in the asylum seeker's account of their conversion to Christianity and using the Bible verses as a tool to do that,"" McKinney told the Independent. ""The Home Office is notorious for coming up with any reason they can to refuse asylum, and this looks like a particularly creative example, but not necessarily a systemic outbreak of anti-Christian sentiment in the department.""

Sarah Teather, director of the Jesuit Refugee Service in the UK, told the paper the letter is a ""particularly outrageous example of the reckless and facetious approach of the Home Office to determining life and death asylum cases.""

""Some of these cases require more legal knowledge to recognize than this bizarre misquoting of the Bible, but as this instance gains public attention, we need to remember it reflects a systematic problem and a deeper mindset of disbelief and is not just an anomaly that can be explained away,"" Teather added to the Independent.

Stephen Evans, chief executive of the National Secular Society, told the paper it's ""wholly inappropriate"" for the Home Office to use ""theological justifications for refusing asylum applications.""

""Decisions on the merits of an asylum appeal should be based on an assessment of the facts at hand — and not on the state's interpretation of any given religion,"" Evans also noted to the Independent. ""It's not the role of the Home Office to play theologian.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-govt-office-knife-free-messages-on-chicken-boxes,2019-03-22
UK justice secretary plans to bar biological males from women's prisons: 'It's obvious a woman cannot be born with a penis',"U.K. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab plans to prohibit biological males from being housed in women's prisons, following high-profile incidents involving transgender inmates.

According to the U.K. Daily Mail, an inmate with male genitalia, convicted of murder, who identifies as a woman was caught earlier this year having consensual sex with a younger female prisoner. Their sexual escapade was supposedly fueled by alcohol the two had illegally acquired. The incident occurred at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey, the largest women's prison in the country.

The incident became public in May, though it is unclear when it actually occurred. The inmate has since been transferred to a transgender housing unit at another facility.

This same biological male inmate also allegedly told one Bronzefield inmate ""I'm going to f*** you"" and told another ""I love p****. Why would I want to be in a man's prison?"" Allegations have also swirled that the inmate may have sexually assaulted another inmate, though the Ministry of Justice has no such complaint on file.

Another biological male in a U.K. woman's prison, Karen White, committed sexual assault against two female prisoners four years ago. In all, officials say there have been seven incidents of transgender women attacking female prisoners in England and Wales in recent years.

Raab's office examined these incidents and determined in July that inmates with male genitalia would no longer be housed with biological females. Exceptions to this policy could be made with the authorization of a minister.

""Once confirmed by the new Government in September,"" a spokesperson for Raab's office said late last week, ""[the new policy] would be implemented as soon as possible.""

Despite the optimism from the Ministry of Justice, the policy is likely to face serious legal challenges. It will also need to be approved by the new government, which will take office next month.

Still, many believe that, for too long, the rights of transgender inmates have been prioritized over the rights of biological women.

“The safety of female prisoners is being put at risk, and their dignity and privacy undermined, by being incarcerated with biological males, some of whom are known sex offenders,” one report about transgender prisoners in the U.K. reads.

“The Ministry of Justice acknowledges that this is causing high levels of fear and anxiety to women who are often already traumatised by their experiences of sexual assault and domestic abuse, yet the wish of trans-identifying males to be placed in the women’s estate is given priority,” it continues.

Raab himself weighed in on the issue of transgender inmates recently.

"UK lab offering $4,500 to human guinea pigs willing to be injected with coronavirus","A medical research firm based in the U.K. is offering more than $4,500 to individuals willing to serve as guinea pigs and be injected with two strains of coronavirus similar to COVID-19 in a bid to find a vaccine for the new deadly virus.

What are the details?

The offer comes from London-based company Hvivo, which is seeking 24 healthy individuals at a time to receive the weaker shots of coronavirus before being administered vaccines in what the Times of London described as ""a $2 billion race to find a vaccine"" for COVID-19.

According to the New York Post, participants would make around $4,588 to participate in Hvivo's ""flu camp,"" which entails a two-week quarantine where they must ""eat a restricted diet and avoid human contact and exercise.""

The firm is still awaiting approval from the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency before trials can begin — but even if it gets clearance quickly, a cure is not expected until next winter, despite more than 20 firms participating in the race to find a shot to prevent the virus that has already taken nearly 4,000 lives globally.

Anything else?

Here in the U.S., another firm is seeking participants for a COVID-19 vaccine study, but the pay is not as high, nor as quick, nor as risky.

Business Insider reported that Seattle's Kaiser Permanente Washington research clinic plans to enroll 45 healthy folks to participate in a 14-month trial to test three doses of a potential vaccine against the novel coronavirus for safety.

However, in the Seattle study, participants would not be injected with the coronavirus. The researchers are offering $100 per visit for volunteers to show up in person 11 times, offering a total payout of $1,100 for those willing to serve as guinea pigs to test out the safety of what could be a life-saving vaccine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-justice-secretary-to-bar-transwomen-from-femaleprisons,2020-03-10
UK anti-lockdown protesters sentenced for using 'abusive words and threatening behaviour' toward BBC journalist,"Five U.K. protesters who ""intimidated"" Nick Watt, a BBC journalist, were sentenced on Tuesday. The judge stated that the anti-lockdown activists used ""abusive words and threatening behaviour,"" reported the Independent.



On June 14, 2021, protesters gathered in Westminster to demonstrate against the government's lockdown response to COVID-19. At the time, England officials had just announced that they would extend the existing lockdown for another four weeks.

A video from the demonstration showed BBC journalist Nick Watt being followed around Downing Street by protesters. The activists in the footage ""intimidated"" Watt by calling him a ""traitor"" and banging on a metal baking sheet with a spoon.

The five convicted protesters included Djazia Chaib-Eddour, 44; Martin Hockridge, 58; Alexander Peat, 34; Christopher Aitken, 62; and Gary Purnell, 45.

All denied using threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behavior with intent to cause harassment, alarm, or distress. However, the court found each of them guilty of verbally abusing Watt.

Purnell, Peat, and Hockridge were each sentenced to 12 months of mandatory community orders and 200 hours of unpaid work. Chaib-Eddour received a 12-month community order, 100 hours of unpaid work, and 20 hours of rehabilitation.

An indefinite no-contact restraining order for Watt was placed against all of the demonstrators. In addition, they were each ordered to pay a fine of £395.

An arrest warrant was issued for Aitken, but he did not attend the hearing. Another protester, Joseph Olswang, 40, pleaded guilty at an earlier trial and was sentenced to 20 weeks in jail.

""This was an extremely unpleasant incident in which each of you used abusive words and threatening behaviour towards Mr. Watt,"" stated District Judge Louisa Cieciora. ""This was committed against somebody who was providing a service to the public, even if you did not agree that service was being performed to the standard it should have been.""

""At the time of the incident I was shocked and alarmed at what was happening to me,"" Watt said in his victim impact statement. ""I felt I was in immense danger.""

In a YouTube interview with Resistance GB, activist Martin Hockridge said, ""I very carefully used the word 'traitor' to describe the BBC because they've committed treason. Their role – which Nick Watt stated many times – was to educate, educate and inform in an impartial way the British public.""



Alexander Peat told Resistance GB that the protesters were found guilty before they ever entered the court. He said, ""It was trial by mainstream media even before we got into court."" Peat referred to the court system as a sham and stated, ""It was clear to me we were never going to stand a fair trial.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-lab-offering-4-500-to-human-guinea-pigs-willing-to-be-injected-with-coronavirus,2022-08-30

UK man helps connect troubled teen — who mugged his nephew at knifepoint — to job and educational opportunities,"Justice, mercy, and the opportunity for redemption still do exist, and one man in the United Kingdom has the video to prove it.

Winston Davis — a heating ""engineer"" and the chairman of Southside Young Leaders Academy, a charity helping young African and Afro-Caribbean boys become leaders — spent six weeks this summer tracking down the person who mugged his 12-year-old nephew at knifepoint in London Colney while the kid was on his way to buy a candy bar.

By reviewing CCTV video and canvassing the area, Davis was able to spot and confront the suspect. However, rather than the adult he presumed he'd met, Davis instead found himself face to face with a ""frightened boy,"" an unidentified 16-year-old who agreed to meet up with Davis and his nephew again to return the bag he'd stolen in the incident.

The young man was true to his word. He returned with the bag and offered his hand and an apology to Davis's 12-year-old nephew.

Davis filmed the meeting and shared it on Instagram and TikTok.

""The fact that you brought the bag back,"" Davis told the teen, ""that says a lot about you.""

Davis told reporters that he could tell there was ""something in [the teenager] that wants to go on and do good,"" despite difficult circumstances. During the meeting, Davis learned that the young man had no education or job, and that he had no parents to guide him.

""Sometimes children are so traumatized from what they’ve been through as young children that it’s really hard for them to have any connection or belief that they can do anything other than what they’ve been exposed to at such a young age,"" Davis stated.

Though Davis made sure that the young man understood that his previous behavior was unacceptable and that he shouldn't ever do it again, Davis then began reaching out to those in his social circles and on social media to connect the teen with job and educational opportunities.

""[H]e wants to work in computer engineering… this kid doesn’t need punishment, he needs help…"" the message on the Instagram post reads, ""if there is anyone that knows about career routes/training programs for him, please drop me a dm.""

The response was overwhelming.

""He’s got an opportunity to really, if he takes the opportunities that are presented to him, to really change his life,"" Davis said. ""It’s just, can he see far enough into the future? To be able to take advantage of the good nature and goodwill of so many people?""

London Colney is a village and civil parish about an hour north of London. It is located about 15 minutes from Davis's town of Watford, where, according to the Instagram post, he raises his nephew as his own son.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-man-convicted-on-136-rapes,2022-09-13
"UK mom who 'misgendered' trans woman now on trial. Her crime? Using social media 'to cause annoyance, inconvenience, and anxiety.'","The mother of two from the United Kingdom who was arrested in 2018 for allegedly referring to a transgender woman as a man in social media interactions is now on trial for the misdeed — specifically for ""using a public communications network to cause annoyance, inconvenience, and anxiety,"" the Daily Mail reported.

What's the background?

Three officers detained Kate Scottow of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, at her home before questioning her at a police station on Dec. 1, 2018, over a Twitter exchange with transgender activist Stephanie Hayden.

""I was arrested in my home by three officers, with my autistic 10-year-old daughter and breastfed 20-month-old son present,"" Scottow wrote on the Mumsnet online forum, the Daily Mail said in an earlier story. ""I was then detained for seven hours in a cell with no sanitary products (which I said I needed) before being interviewed then later released under investigation ... I was arrested for harassment and malicious communications because I called someone out and misgendered them on Twitter.""



At the time, Scottow had her photograph, DNA, and fingerprints taken — and authorities also took her cellphone and laptop.

Hertfordshire Police confirmed the arrest, the outlet said, and noted that ""we take all reports of malicious communication seriously."" Scottow was charged for malicious communication late last summer.

What's happening at the trial?

Hayden said the defendant referred to Hayden as ""he"" or ""him"" during a period of ""significant online abuse,"" the Daily Mail noted, adding that Hayden also is involved in similar legal disputes with others.



""I am litigious, I put my hands up,"" Hayden said during cross examination, the outlet noted. ""I use the law if I feel I have to use the law. That is a right I have got as a citizen of this country. I cannot tell you how many because, quite frankly, there have been a fair few.""

Scottow's lawyer also said Hayden has been in criminal courts 11 times for 21 offenses and spent six months in prison for obtaining property deception in years past, the Daily Mail noted.

Scottow also accused Hayden of posting a racist tweet, after which Hayden contacted a staff member at the defendant's university to raise concerns, the outlet said.

In addition, when police were interviewing Scottow at her home after Hayden's accusations, Scottow referred to Hayden as a ""he"" — and police officers corrected Scottow, who apologized, the Daily Mail said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-man-helps-connect-troubled-teen-who-mugged-his-nephew-at-knifepoint-to-job-and-educational-opportunities,2020-02-10

According to the Daily Mail, the Crown Prosecution Service said Scottow was charged over ""'persistent' messages designed to cause 'annoyance, inconvenience, or needless anxiety'"" between September 2018 and May.

The outlet reported that authorities charged Scottow on Aug. 21 ""after reviewing a file of evidence from Hertfordshire Police relating to social media posts.""

According to The Sun, a spokesperson said, ""We made the decision to charge Katherine Scottow after reviewing a file of evidence from Hertfordshire Police relating to social media posts.

""The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against Ms Scottow are now active and that she has a right to a fair trial,"" the spokesperson continued.

"UK nurse shocks live TV audience: 'If you’ve voted Conservative, you do not deserve to be resuscitated by the NHS'","After President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981, as he was about to undergo surgery, he joked to the doctors, ""I sure hope all of you out there are Republicans!"" His surgeon, a liberal Democrat, replied, ""Today, we're all Republicans,"" in what was unquestionably a compassionate and dutiful response.

A nurse in the United Kingdom is under fire for having the opposite response after she said on live television that conservative voters do not deserve to be resuscitated by the National Health Service.

Miranda Hughes, a registered nurse with the NHS, made those highly inflammatory and controversial comments during a debate on ""Britain on the Brink,"" hosted by Jeremy Vine. Her remarks drew swift backlash, with many calling for her to be suspended by the NHS or fired from her job.

“I could not handle the emotional stress of not being able to deliver for my patients,"" she said on the program. ""You’re squeezed to a point, you can't treat them how you want to treat them. You’re told persistently on the news that care homes are being ring fenced. It’s a lie.”

""I’m sorry,"" she continued, ""but if you’ve voted Conservative, you do not deserve to be resuscitated by the NHS.”

Her outburst caused members of the live audience to gasp and shake their heads. “It’s harsh, but I’m looking at these gentlemen and it makes me so angry,” she said before backtracking.

""Of course, I would [resuscitate Conservative patients], but it's appalling the way we've been treated,"" she said.

The sound bite provoked outrage online, where Hughes was condemned for essentially wishing millions of U.K. voters dead.

""How can a nurse who is responsible for the health care of others continue in her job, if she believes 14 million patients should be left to die? The two are wholly incompatible: Miranda Hughes must go,"" former journalist and member of the European Parliament Martin Daubney tweeted.

""This isn't 'cancel culture.' It's the consequences of being an unbridled bigot,"" he added.

""This repellant woman #MirandaHughes was an utter disgrace to her profession before rightly sacked by the private hospital where she worked. She should never, ever, be allowed to work again in health or social care,"" said British media personality Christine Hamilton.

Following the outcry, Hughes told the Telegraph she is set to lose her job with a south London-based private hospital.

""They can do that to me because of their media policy. I am not allowed to say anything. I have brought the company into disrepute. So yes, I am being sacked,"" she said in an interview.

“The reason I went on the program was that you cannot care for your patients. It’s impossible. Because I care too much. And even Jeremy Vine said to me, 'Working in the NHS broke you.'

“Well, yes it has, and it’s broken me again. I can’t do what’s right, and it frustrates the hell out of me because I’ve been sick myself. I’ve had to watch people die, and there are no resources to help.

""That is the point I was trying to make, and yet I had someone goading me from the other side of the studio and laughing. It made me so angry, and I directed the comment at him,” she said.

""I lost my temper and I said something inappropriate. Now I am going to lose my job because the Twitterati have gone to town,"" she added. ""I am being vilified for being some monster that doesn’t care, and unfortunately, the problem is I care too much.""

The Telegraph reported that Huges, a registered nurse with the Nursing and Midwifery Council, could face an investigation over whether her comments breached its professional code if someone files a complaint.

""Our Code is clear that professionals on our register must promote professionalism and trust at all times. Where concerns are raised with us, we'll always look into it and consider taking action if needed,"" the council said.

UK official says all knives should be fitted with GPS trackers to fight rise in stabbings. He's mocked mercilessly.,"Amid the ever-increasing number of knife attacks in the United Kingdom, one member of Parliament has suggested a technological way to fight back:

GPS trackers in the handles of every knife sold in the U.K.



Scott Mann — a conservative who represents North Cornwall — offered his solution Thursday on Twitter and also called for a national database for knives.

Image source: Twitter

""Every knife sold in the UK should have a gps tracker fitted in the handle,"" he wrote. ""It's time we had a national database like we do with guns. If you're carrying it around you had better have a bloody good explanation, obvious exemptions for fishing etc.""

Cut to the quick



To say that Mann's suggestion was met with a little bit of ridicule is an understatement.

Comedy writer James Felton replied, ""There are 66 million people in the UK. If every one of them owns just one knife that's 66 million knives to keep track of you brain genius how are you an MP.""

Tom Peck, a political sketch writer at the Independent, wondered ""have you got much in the way of a plan for how the police monitor the movement of the UK's, let's say 300 million knives?"" He added, ""And we'd better hope the bad guys don't do anything naughty like, say, forget to charge up their knives at night.""

Others were equally vicious to Mann:

""Think you need a GPS tracker fitted on yourself you absolute weapon.""

""There's been a stabbing"" / ""Quick, get me the GPS tracking for every knife in a 3 mile radius"" / ""OK, it says there are 120,000 of them, mostly in kitchens"" / ""Bollocks, thought we had them then"" / ""Could ask those young lads with the machete"" / ""Nah, they've got a mackerel, been fishing""

""Why stop with knives? Let's install gps trackers on every fork too""

""They have to put directions on shampoo bottles because of ppl like this.""

Some ramped up their ridicule with visual aids:

Knife control?

Mann's suggestion came in the wake of new figures showing 21,484 people were prosecuted or cautioned for knife offenses in England and Wales in 2018, the Evening Standard reported — the highest count since 2009 when it stood at more than 25,000.

Home Secretary Sajid Javid recently announced plans for new knife crime prevention orders, which could impose curfews or social media use restrictions on anyone 12 and older who police suspect of carrying a blade, the paper said.

And you might recall London Mayor Sadiq Khan implementing knife control last year after murders in that city — which had been traditionally safe given the dearth of guns — surpassed murders in New York City in February and March 2018.

UK PM Boris Johnson reportedly 'frightened' by his coronavirus experience and hesitant to lift lockdowns,"United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson survived a scare with COVID-19 that caused him to be hospitalized in the intensive care unit, and his firsthand experience with the disease caused by the novel coronavirus from Wuhan, China, has left him ""frightened"" and ""tentative,"" a member of Parliament told the Times of London.

The British lawmaker, identified only as a ""senior Tory MP,"" told the Times of London that Johnson's coronavirus experience is now influencing his decisions on when to ease restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the virus.

""The prime minister is in a funny place. I think he's quite frightened,"" the MP said. ""His illness and the warning from the doctors has really hit him hard. To find himself floored like this has got into his head. He has become really tentative.""

Like the United States, the U.K. is facing the dilemma of whether to resume normal economic activity and risk a resurgence of the virus, or whether to remain locked down and risking potentially catastrophic economic consequences.

Johnson, who is still officially on leave, told Cabinet officials last week that his primary concern is avoiding a second COVID-19 surge by lifting restrictions too soon. He fears that if there is a second surge of the virus after an attempted reopening, the subsequent lockdown will have to be even more severe.

In March, Johnson was actually criticized for the opposite perspective — he was hesitant to implement strict lockdowns in the face of warnings about the potential for the U.K. health system to get overwhelmed. Guto Harri, who was a spokesman for Johnson when he was mayor of London, said Johnson's libertarian leanings led him to resist potentially unnecessary interference in people's lives.

""It's not an absolute, but he does have to be persuaded that drastic measures are justified,"" Harri told NBC News. ""He also has a more benign view of human nature than the assumption that everyone needs to be treated like a child and be told by daddy what to do.""

UK police arrest WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange after Ecuador pulls his asylum status,"Police in England have arrested WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on Thursday after Ecuador revoked his asylum status.

Here's what we know

Assange was granted asylum by Ecuador in 2012, following an extradition request by Sweden where he was wanted on rape charges. This extradition request has since been rescinded, although Swedish prosecutors have not officially closed this case.

The U.S. Department of Justice has indicted Assange, according to a DOJ news release from Thursday.

""Assange engaged in a conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst in the U.S. Army, to assist Manning in cracking a password stored on U.S. Department of Defense computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network (SIPRNet), a U.S. government network used for classified documents and communications,"" the news release said.

London police have had a longstanding policy of arresting Assange if he ever left the embassy. After his asylum status was revoked, they were able to enter the embassy and arrest him.

The London Metropolitan Police said in a news release that Assange has been ""arrested on behalf of the United States.""



Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno said that during his time in the embassy, Assange had been ""discourteous and aggressive,"" had ""violated the norm of not intervening in the internal affairs of other states,"" had installed ""distortion equipment,"" and had ""mistreated guards.""

U.K. Home Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted that Assange was in custody, adding, ""No one is above the law.""

Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked classified data, decried Assange's arrest by ""the UK's secret police,"" calling it ""a dark moment for press freedom."" Of course, the police who arrested Snowden belonged not to some secretive outfit, but to the London Metropolitan Police.

Snowden himself is current living in Moscow where he has been granted asylum from the U.S. government, which wants to arrest him for leaking classified material.

Assange's WikiLeaks declared on Twitter, ""Ecuador has illigally [sic] terminated Assange political asylum in violation of international law.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-reportedly-frightened-by-his-coronavirus-experience-and-hesitant-to-lift-lockdowns,2019-04-11
UK police investigate British comedian over controversial tweet about new royal baby,"British police are reportedly investigating entertainment personality Danny Baker over a controversial tweet about the newest royal baby, whose parents are the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

What did the tweet say?

The tweet, which has since been deleted, was a picture of Prince Harry and wife Meghan holding their newborn son, Archie. However, instead of Archie, the picture showed the parents holding a chimpanzee dressed in clothes.

Baker added the caption: ""Royal Baby leaves hospital.""

The tweet contained obvious racist connotations because Meghan Markel is half-black, which makes Archie the first multiracial royal child.

The tweet resulted in Baker being fired from his radio hosting job with the BBC. The media company said Baker's tweet ""goes against the values we as a station aim to embody.""

""Danny's a brilliant broadcaster but will no longer be presenting a weekly show with us,"" the BBC said.



But why are police investigating?

According to Sky News, Metropolitan Police, which is responsible for law enforcement in London's 32 boroughs, confirmed they are investigating the incident.

""An allegation has been received by the Metropolitan Police Service on Thursday, 9 May in relation to a tweet published on the 8 May,"" a police spokesperson said. ""As is routine, the allegation will be reviewed and assessed by specialist officers.""

Unlike the U.S., certain incidents of racism can be considered criminal offenses in the United Kingdom, which doesn't guarantee its citizens the same level of speech protections as the U.S. Constitution provides Americans.

Has Baker apologized?

He posted a lengthy apology on Twitter Friday, characterizing the incident as a ""genuine, naive and catastrophic mistake.""

Good morning, everyone.

Following one of the worst days of my life I just want to formally apologise for the outrage I caused and explain how I got myself into this mess.

I chose the wrong photo to illustrate a joke. Disastrously so.

— Danny Baker (@prodnose) May 10, 2019

In attempting to lampoon privilege & the news cycle I went to a file of goofy pictures & saw the chimp dressed as a Lord and thought, ""That's the one!"" Had I kept searching I might have chosen General Tom Thumb or even a a baby in a crown. But I didn't. God knows I wish had.

— Danny Baker (@prodnose) May 10, 2019

Minutes later I was alerted by followers that this royal baby was of course mixed race and waves of panic and revulsion washed over me. Fuck, what had I done? I needed no lessons on the centuries slurs equating simians and people of colour. Racism at it's basest.

— Danny Baker (@prodnose) May 10, 2019

I am aware black people do not need a white man to tell them this. Deleting it immediately and apologising for the awful gaffe I even foolishly tried to make light of it. (My situation that is, not the racism involved.) Too late and here I am.

— Danny Baker (@prodnose) May 10, 2019

I would like once and for all to apologise to every single person who, quite naturally, took the awful connection at face value. I understand that and all of the clamour and opprobrium I have faced since. I am not feeling sorry for myself. I fucked up. Badly.

— Danny Baker (@prodnose) May 10, 2019

But it was a genuine, naive and catastrophic mistake. There is of course little media/twitter traction in such a straight-forward explanation. The picture in context as presented was obviously shamefully racist. It was never intended so - seriously who on earth would 'go there'?

— Danny Baker (@prodnose) May 10, 2019

Anyway i am now paying the price for this crass & regrettable blunder and rightly so. Probably even this final word from me will extend the mania. ('Dog whistle' anyone?) I would like to thank friends on here for their kinder words and once again - I am so, so sorry.

'The UK has gone mad': Police show knives they collected so they 'don't get into the wrong hands' — along with a spoon,"Amid the United Kingdoms efforts to stem the tide of knife attacks — some of which has resulted in widespread mockery — one police department is getting hammered for a Twitter photo.

In a Tuesday post, the Regents Park Police force said it ""conducted weapons sweeps, dealt with a person injured from a van reversing on them, reported a burglary, and collected all these from @scope charity shop who diligently didn't want them to get into the wrong hands & disposed of correctly & safely.""

No, your eyes don't deceive you. Among the objects in the photo is a spoon — and that fired up the ire of journalist Tim Pool, who mercilessly called out police:

Image source: Twitter, redacted

""Police didn't want this cache of weapons to fall into the wrong hands ... There's a f***ing spoon and a butter knife in this photo ... The UK has gone mad,"" he wrote, adding that the cops ""CHOSE to include the spoon. They could have just left it out. They really do think spoons are dangerous.""

It's not exactly clear which object is a butter knife, but the spoon is there for all to see.



What did others have to say?

As you might expect, the police force's ratioed post — with comments far exceeding likes — attracted reactions that were arguably even funnier than the spoon in the photo:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-police-investigate-danny-baker-tweet-royal-baby,2019-05-15
UK police official quit Twitter after hairstyle mockery gave way to 'sexist and homophobic' abuse — which was logged as 'hate incident',"A United Kingdom police official quit Twitter after mockery over her hairstyle gave way to ""sexist and homophobic"" abuse on the social media platform that Rachel Swann said was logged as a ""hate incident,"" BBC News reported.

What are the details?

Swann — Derbyshire's deputy chief constable — spoke to reporters on video concerning the evacuation of Whaley Bridge in August after a dam wall was damaged, the outlet said, adding that some viewers mocked her hairstyle on Twitter.

Then she said it got worse.

""I can take a bit of banter, but then it became sexist and homophobic, and really, really insulting,"" Swann told BBC Radio Derby, the outlet said. ""The bit that really hurt was when people said I had no standards, and I was letting policing down.""

She continued to the station: ""Yes, I am a woman. Yes, I might have a slightly different hairstyle. Yes, I am quite small. ... I could not believe that my mere existence could cause such a depth of feeling.""

One comment read, ""Is that what a senior police officer looks likely [sic] these days??"" BBC News noted.

The last straw

Then a press agency ""wanted to run a story on my hair,"" which prompted Swann to leave Twitter, the outlet said.

""My personal experience of the trolling and negative comments on social media are reflective of those that some people receive every day,"" she added to BBC News. ""Some of the comments were misogynistic and homophobic, and the abuse I received has been recorded as a hate incident, in the same way it would be for the public or my officers and staff. In recent years, we have seen children feeling bullied by their peers through personal attacks on social media; with youngsters in some cases so desperate it has resulted in suicide due to the pressures of the abuse.""

The outlet added that Swann has since returned to Twitter and hopes ""some good comes out"" of the situation.

""In a funny sort of way I made my stand without meaning to,"" she told BBC News. ""If some good comes out of that that's fine; it doesn't mean that it didn't hurt, it doesn't mean that it didn't upset me.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-police-knives-include-spoon,2019-11-27
UK police battling knife violence by replacing kitchen knives with round-tipped cutlery in homes of domestic abuse victims,"As the United Kingdom struggles with how to curb its ongoing knife crime epidemic, one police department has proposed a solution for cutting down on attacks in homes: Replacing knives with blunt-tipped cutlery in the kitchens of domestic abuse victims.

What are the details?

The Nottinghamshire Police Department recently floated the idea to the county's city council as a way of preventing potential victims from being stabbed to death by their partners, The New York Times reported. While critics of the plan initially laughed it off, the authorities have already purchased 100 specially-manufactured knives to be distributed to at-risk survivors who have been attacked or threatened with a knife in the past.

A pilot program is being launched to gauge the efficacy of the plan before deciding whether to continue it past the end of the year, police say. According to The Daily Mail, the force received $1.5 million in taxpayer dollars to implement the initiative.

The knife trade-in scheme has been met with mixed reviews. According to the BBC, domestic abuse survivors have called it everything from ""quite ludicrous"" to ""100 percent positive."" A retired judge told the outlet it ""could save lives,"" while psychologist and interpersonal abuse expert Dr. Jessica Eaton said on Twitter that the Nottingham police were ""morons"" for thinking blunt knives would prevent domestic attacks from happening.





Eaton told The Times, ""The problem is not the sharpness of the knife. The problem is male violence.""

She continued, ""The risk comes from the offender, not the knife. We know that blunt trauma can cause death. Just because a knife has been blunted doesn't mean that it won't pierce the skin or kill someone.""

But the Nottingham Police Department's new knife crime strategy manager says critics ""got the whole idea wrong.""

He told the BBC, ""It's a very small trial, and it will always be part of a much wider range of measures that we are doing to safeguard and protect that victim. We will simply have these (knives) as an offer to somebody in appropriate circumstances and they can have them if they think they want them.""

Anything else?

The U.K. has struggled for years to come up with schemes — such as ""surrender"" boxes — to reduce knife attacks in the country, but to no avail.

The UK is about to make watching porn more difficult for kids. Could the US do the same?,"Assessing pornographic material in the United Kingdom is about to becoming increasingly difficult after legislators approved a provision requiring websites that host pornographic material to verify the age of users.

What are the details?

Beginning next month, the UK will require any website hosting pornography to verify the age of its users, according to The Metro. This will ensure that people deemed too young to view the material — children younger than 18 — are not accessing the smut by falsely claiming age 18 or older.

Mainstream pornography websites will reportedly use an online age verification system called AgeID. James Clark, a spokesman for AgeID, told The Metro that prospective users will need to submit ample documentation to AgeID — such as a passport or other government-issued ID — before accessing the pornographic website.

Once verified, the users will be able to access pornography on all smut websites using AgeID.

Not all pornography websites will use AgeID, and there are other ways users will be able to verify their age, such as through the purchase of vouchers and other special IDs.

The UK released the guidelines last year after passing the Digital Economy Act in 2017. Failure to comply with the new rules will result in substantial fines and website blocks by UK internet service providers.

The writer's perspective: Why the US needs similar laws

Although scientists are just discovering the impacts of long-term pornography usage, research has already proved fruitful. In fact, scientists have discovered evidence showing that the human brain responds to pornography in the same manner it does chemical substances such as cocaine.

With the neurological response comes the cycle of addiction. And in the same way an addict develops a tolerance — the ""bump"" that previously got them high no longer does the job, now they need a line or two — pornography usage increases over time and the material consumed devolves from that which, at a cursory level, reflects natural human relationships to material that simulates violence, rape, and wholly unnatural sex acts.

The earlier this cycle begins in a young person's life, the earlier it descends into an addiction with far-reaching ramifications, most often surfacing as the degradation of humans — longtime pornography users view other humans as mere objects whose purpose is to satisfy their sexual urges — but sometimes even full-blown violence.

Though these impacts are nearly universal among pornography users, when young people are introduced to this pervasive world, their developing neurotransmitters are being wired in such a way that it will become much more difficult in the future to break their addiction to pornography and recover from long-term use.

If physically blocking young people from accessing pornography through mandatory age verification systems is the mechanism that prevents them from beginning of the cycle of addiction to vital stages of cognitive development, then by all means, let's implement similar provisions here in the U.S.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-police-replacing-kitchen-knives-with-round-tipped-cutlery-in-homes-of-domestic-abuse-victims,2019-03-06
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved to intensive care following COVID-19 diagnosis,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to an intensive care unit amid his fight against COVID-19.

Johnson announced last week that he was diagnosed with the coronavirus, but pledged to keep working as long as he was able.

What are the details?

Johnson, 55, was admitted to the hospital on Sunday for treatment after his condition took a turn for the worse and he began running a fever and a persistent cough.

The hospital moved him to the intensive care unit on Monday.

A spokesperson for the British government told Bloomberg that Johnson remains conscious, but was taken to the intensive care unit in case he needed a ventilator to breathe.

""Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened, and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital,"" the spokesperson said.

According to reports, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will ""stand in"" for Johnson, and running the country on an as-needed basis.

The BBC reported that a further statement from Downing Street reads, ""The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication.""

Raab added that there is an ""incredibly strong team spirit"" rallying for Johnson's recovery.

Johnson is the first major world leader to contract COVID-19 and is the first to be hospitalized because of the virus.



What else?

On Monday, Johnson tweeted, ""Last night, on the advice of my doctor, I went into hospital for some routine tests as I'm still experiencing coronavirus symptoms. I'm in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe.""

He added, ""I'd like to say thank you to all the brilliant NHS staff taking care of me and others in this difficult time. You are the best of Britain.

"UK psychotherapist: Using 'slurs' like 'nerd,' 'geek,' 'egghead' — and even 'smarty-pants' — against high-IQ people should be hate crimes","A United Kingdom psychology lecturer and psychotherapist said using ""slurs"" against those with high IQs — such as ""nerd"" or ""geek"" or ""egghead"" — should be called hate crimes, the Telegraph reported.

Sonja Falck has studied the impact of bullying on high-IQ children and the ""divisive and humiliating"" anti-IQ terms should be categorized the same as homophobic, racial, and religious slurs in the U.K. — and are hate crime's ""last taboo,"" the outlet added.





What are the details?

Falck has spent eight years researching discrimination against high-IQ people and interviewing high-ability adults about their experiences, the Telegraph said, adding she's recently discovered a common theme among them after conducting extensive interviews with 20 high-IQ people: the idea of belonging or not belonging.

""That was a really big one,"" she told the outlet. ""That's where being taunted with names like 'nerd' or 'egghead' or 'brainiac' comes in because the person is being set apart as being different to others and feeling like they're a misfit, and they don't belong.""

Falck also told the Telegraph that all her interviewees felt like that at some point in their lives.

'Extreme Intelligence'

Her recent research on the subject can be found in her new book, ""Extreme Intelligence"" — and at the book's launch Falck said the next government must take legislative action to force societal change, the outlet said.

""The N-word was common parlance in the U.K. until at least the 1960s. Other insulting slurs about age, disability, religion, and gender identity remained in widespread use until relatively recently. Society at the time turned a blind eye to their impact by passing them off as harmless banter. It is only with the benefit of hindsight and academic research that we realize how wrong we were. The same can be said about anti-IQ words like 'nerd,' 'brainbox,' 'geek,' 'egghead,' 'smart-arse,' 'dweeb,' and 'smarty-pants,'"" she said, according to the Telegraph. ""Slurs such as these will continue to be used unabated at the expense of the brightest members of society unless and until legislative action is taken.""

In England and Wales, any threatening or abusive communication directed toward a person regarding race, color, disability, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity is called a hate crime, the outlet said, adding that it's covered by a variety of statutes, including the Public Order Act 1986, and penalties can include imprisonment, fines, or both.

""The government says it is committed to creating an outward-looking, inclusive society yet continues to tolerate divisive, discriminatory language,"" Falck added, according to the Telegraph. ""In the short space of time since racial, homophobic and religious hate speech was banned, it is now seen by most as morally abhorrent. It would be progress for British society to come to feel the same way about hate-filled, prejudicial slurs against our high-IQ community.""

More from the outlet:

Falck went on to warn that such name-calling, especially as a child, can cause psychological damage that may last a lifetime and that extending legislation to include these slurs would help to stamp out the ""archaic"" victimization of more than one million Britons with a gifted IQ score of 132 or over.



Falck is herself a member of the international high-IQ society Mensa, which supports non-discrimination against those with very high IQs.

""Very high-IQ individuals often experience isolation or bullying from people around them because they are perceived as being different from the majority,"" Mensa CEO John Stevenage said, according to the Telegraph. ""Mensa as an organization gives people with very high IQ a community which is non-judgmental and inclusive of difference. Put simply, everybody is different, so no-one is.""

"UK restaurant's gender-neutral, colorless cocktails aim to ease 'stereotypical pressure' on patrons — and observers skewer the idea","A United Kingdom restaurant chain, Burger & Lobster, launched a gender-neutral, colorless line of cocktails in two of its London establishments recently ""in a bid to remove stereotypes surrounding drinks"" that influence patrons to avoid selections they see as traditionally geared to the opposite gender.

Burger & Lobster noted in a news release that the ""Mixed-ology"" cocktails came about after research and social experiments.

In its Soho restaurant, the new line's five cocktails were listed using numbers and ingredients rather than traditional names; at its Bread Street eatery, the traditional names were used. It was discovered that:

Just over 30 percent of male customers weren't keen on drinks like the Cosmopolitan or Pina Colada because of their ""feminine"" names.

And just over 10 percent of female customers were too embarrassed to order drinks considered more ""masculine"" like a Negroni or Old Fashioned.

At Bread Street, only 5 percent of men and women chose the White Negroni, while at the Soho restaurant — where it was simply called No. 1 – it was four times more popular, Metro UK reported.

Also, it was discovered that just over 20 percent of drink buyers aren't comfortable ordering items they see as geared toward the opposite gender. And 67 percent would avoid a drink if the glassware was too ""feminine"" or ""masculine,"" the outlet said.

UK school official suspended after questioning why parents weren't consulted about LGBTQ books,"A U.K. school official was suspended after questioning why parents weren't consulted about LGBTQ books becoming part of the school library's reading list, Christian Concern said.

Maureen Griffith, 74, has been a governor at Alperton Community School in Brent, North London, since the early 1990s, Christianity Today reported. She helped shape the school's curriculum, pioneered the school's health and safety policies, and introduced better disabled access, Christian Concern said.

What happened?

According to Christian Concern, Griffith received a booklet from the school's library noting its staff planned to introduce reading lists for LGBTQ+ Pride Month.

Then at the governors' meeting on May 1 of this year, Griffith told the outlet she ""said that parents had not been consulted [about the books] and that there would be parents with children from religious backgrounds who would object and not want their children to have this form of sex education. I urged them to consider those families and added that as a parent myself, I would not have wanted my sons to be reading LGBT books or to be involved in an LGBT Pride month.""

She told Christian Concern that immediately ""a member of staff stood up and left the room, and the clerk of the school began to rage at me saying: 'Look what you've gone and done, you've upset him.' She then told me that I should be accepting of what was happening as it is law.""

On May 21, the outlet said Griffith got a suspension letter from school clerk Jo Sattaur saying she ""breached the Governors Code of Conduct and made homophobic comments at a public meeting that were offensive to members of staff"" and that an investigation would commence.

But the former nurse told Christian Concern she's heard nothing since.

“My mother always taught me that things have to be done properly,"" Griffith noted to Christian Concern. “Therefore, whether as a nurse where I am responsible for patient safety or as a governor where I am responsible for a child's education and shaping the school environment, it is my job to notice things that others do not. In meetings where someone may want to push something through, I scrutinize, and this leads to discussion, debate, and finding consensus on the right way to move forward.""

She added to the outlet that “when they told me I had been 'homophobic' for scrutinizing the introduction of LGBT Pride month, I had to go home and look up what it meant. I couldn't believe it. It never occurred to me that I could be 'homophobic' or scared of something. These things don't come into my head. But now with this LGBT agenda — not just in schools, but across society — there is no debate, no questioning, and there is only a one-way democracy.""

Griffith also told Christian Concern that she's “at peace over the whole situation. I am not annoyed; I am only saddened that this is happening in this country. My faith in Jesus is very important to me in good and bad times — it is my be all and end all. I can do nothing without his help, and he makes my burden lighter. This is how my mum brought me up.""

What did the school have to say?

According to Christianity Today, Alperton Community School issued a statement saying it's ""unable to comment on specific details relating to members of the school community for confidentiality and data protection reasons. However, we confirm that the school adopts the National Governance Association Governors Code of Conduct and that where complaints are raised in respect of governors, the school would always consider whether an impartial and independent investigation is necessary. We further confirm that the school's policies and resources are regularly reviewed and are wholly appropriate for the school community.""

UK spies told to use gender-neutral words and pronouns,"As Europe watched the largest conventional military attack enacted in Ukraine since World War II, Great Britain is reportedly making sure that U.K. spies recognize their privilege and are encouraging them to use the proper pronouns.

The Daily Mail published leaked documents that British intelligence agencies are promoting inclusive language while doing away with verbiage that may ""reinforce dominant cultural patterns.""

The alleged toolkit is titled ""Mission Critical,"" and is intended for MI5 (the U.K's domestic intelligence agency), MI6 (the U.K.'s foreign intelligence agency known as the Secret Intelligence Service and SIS), and the Government Communications Headquarters (the U.K.'s intelligence, security, and cyber agency known as GCHQ).

The guidance for England's spies was reportedly approved by Sir Stephen Lovegrove, the U.K.'s national security adviser, who wrote, ""This toolkit is called 'Mission Critical' because a diverse and inclusive culture is critical to succeeding in our national security missions.""

The document, which was reportedly published internally on Dec. 6, urges Britain's spies to declare their pronouns and to add them to email signatures.

""Sharing your pronouns, if you are comfortable doing this, helps to create an environment in which this is normal,"" the document allegedly states.

In a section regarding inclusive language, the toolkit notes, ""In national security, look out for words and phrases, such as 'strong' or 'grip,' that reinforce the dominant cultural patterns.""

""Avoid jargon, hierarchy or gender biases,"" the internal document states, and recommends refraining from using the word ""manpower.""



""Use gender-neutral language to reflect people's diversity and reduce stereotypes and assumptions, for example about job roles and functions which need not be gender-defined,"" the document states.

""The toolkit says staff should 'understand your unconscious bias,' 'be aware of intersectionality [the idea that different forms of prejudice can overlap],' 'acknowledge your privilege,' and consider refusing to speak on all-male panels,"" the guidance says, according to the Daily Mail.

The toolkit purportedly encourages intelligence officers to read a list of books regarding equity, including those by leading critical race theory advocate Kimberlé Crenshaw.

Last April, the transgender flag was flown at the MI6 headquarters in London to mark the Transgender Day of Visibility.

Richard Moore — the chief of the Secret Intelligence Service — declared, ""We’re proud of our trans and non-binary colleagues and committed to providing an inclusive workplace where you can be your true self.

"Report: UK study shows large events without masks or social distancing just as safe as shopping, eating out","A widespread study being organized by the U.K. government has so far reportedly found that hosting large gatherings without masks or social distancing is no riskier to the public than opening restaurants or shopping centers.

""Holding mass events without masks and social distancing can be as safe as going to a restaurant or shopping centre, government trials suggest,"" The Times reported on Tuesday.

""Preliminary data from the [Events Research Programme] is understood to have found that with screening, improved ventilation and other mitigating factors the risk of virus transmission can be significantly reduced, reducing fears that sports matches and concerts could cause big outbreaks,"" the report said.

Since early last month, the U.K. government has been running large-scale testing through an initiative called the Events Research Programme, which aimed to ""examine the risk of transmission of Covid-19 from attendance at events and explore ways to enable people to attend a range of events safely.""

As a part of the initiative, government researchers selected several ""pilot events"" with a range of criteria, including differing audience capacities and outdoor and indoor venues, to test a number of mitigating factors in order to determine how to reopen large venues safely.

Such events included the Football Association Challenge Cup Semi-Final and Final at Wembley Stadium, the BRIT Awards in London, and World Snooker Championship at Sheffield Crucible Theatre.

Though the research program still has a few weeks to complete its round of trials, the group is reportedly set to forward the early positive results to government ministers in the coming days.

""We are still waiting for the final bits of data but the results so far have been very encouraging,"" a source reportedly told The Times. ""It will help make the case that these large events are not inherently more risky than other parts of the hospitality sector.

""It shows that there are things that you can do to make these settings as safe as other daily activities,"" the source said. ""It is true that they are not going to be 100% safe, but you can lower the risk to a reasonable level.""

During the run of testing, event attendees followed established guidelines, such as presenting proof of a recent negative test or vaccination, but were not required to wear a facial covering or remain at least three feet apart.

Attendees were also reportedly ""monitored by CCTV and wore devices that showed how many others they came into contact with, whether they shook hands or hugged, and how far apart they stood.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-spies-pronouns-privilege-gender-neutral,2021-05-19
"UK teen girl wanted to be male; got breasts removed, took testosterone. Now 23, she says doctors should have 'challenged' her decision — and is suing.","Keira Bell of the United Kingdom told BBC News she was a tomboy as a child — and the sense she needed to transition to a male occurred gradually as she read about it online.

Bell soon sought the assistance of medicine at age 16, went to a clinic, and after three appointments lasting an hour each she was prescribed puberty blockers, the outlet said.

A year later Bell told the BBC she was prescribed the male hormone testosterone, which developed male characteristics like facial hair and a deep voice — and three years ago, she got her breasts removed.

""Initially I felt very relieved and happy about things,"" Bell told the outlet. ""But I think as the years go on you start to feel less and less enthusiastic or even happy about things.""

In the end, she decided to stop taking cross-sex hormones last year. Now at 23, Bell noted to the BBC that she accepts her sex as a female — but she's also angry about what happened to her.

'I should have been challenged'

""I was allowed to run with this idea that I had, almost like a fantasy, as a teenager,"" Bell told the outlet, adding that ""it has affected me in the long run as an adult. I'm very young. I've only just stepped into adulthood, and I have to deal with this kind of burden or radical difference — in comparison to others at least.""

More than that, she told the BBC that others should have pushed back against her decision.

""I should have been challenged on the proposals or the claims that I was making for myself,"" Bell told the outlet. ""And I think that would have made a big difference as well. If I was just challenged on the things I was saying.""

See you in court

Now Bell is taking legal action against the National Health Service gender clinic, and a judge cleared the way for a full hearing of the case against the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, the BBC said.

Lawyers will argue that children cannot give informed consent to treatment delaying puberty or helping them to transition, the outlet added.

The clinic based in Hampstead, northwest London — which runs the UK's only gender-identity development service — told the BBC it welcomed an examination of the evidence. But former clinic staff at the clinic have said teens who want to change their genders are given puberty blockers without adequate assessment or psychological work, the outlet added.

Bell herself admitted to the BBC that when she went to clinic years ago, she would say ""it was saving me from suicidal ideation and depression in general and at the time I felt it relieved all those mental health issues I was feeling, alongside gender dysphoria.""

In addition, Bell told the outlet that if she had felt more accepted by society as a teen, she might not have wanted to change her gender — though she added she wouldn't have wanted to listen to challengers of her transgender desires.

""I feel I could say anything to my 16-year-old self, and I might not necessarily listen at that time,"" Bell added to the BBC. ""And that's the point of this case, when you are that young you don't really want to listen. So I think it's up to these institutions, like the Tavistock, to step in and make children reconsider what they are saying, because it is a life-altering path.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-study-large-events-without-masks,2020-03-11
"UK doctor sends away women with just antibiotics. Hours later, she's diagnosed with cancer.","One doctor's mistake or evidence that socialized medicine is not all it is cracked up to be?

That's the question to ponder after a British woman, who in ""agonizing pain"" was sent home by one doctor with mere antibiotics, only to be diagnosed with advanced cancer by another doctor hours later.

What happened?

According to the Daily Mail, 61-year-old Joy Vivien Lee was recently rushed to the hospital after experiencing ""agonizing abdominal pain."" After waiting hours in her local emergency room, Vivien's doctor sent her home with mere antibiotics because the ""doctor did not have the equipment needed to properly investigate her symptoms.""

Then, within just minutes of returning home, Vivien was again rushed to the hospital — this time to a different location to see a different doctor.

It was during Vivien's second stint that doctors gave a preliminary diagnosis of ovarian cancer, which doctors believe may have, unfortunately, already spread to Vivien's bones. Doctors also identified a dark area in her breast area, which may be another sign her cancer is in an aggravated stage.

Vivien's brother, Mark Oldham-Fox, told the Daily Mail that his sister has lost ""two stone"" since last October, the British equivalent of 28 pounds.

""She's had stomach and lower back pains, and bloating — she has said she looks nine months pregnant,"" he said.

The Daily Mail reported that Vivien has since been back to the hospital, so doctors can better understand her condition.

How long did it take to get a diagnosis?

In addition to her multiple hospital trips this month, Vivien reportedly saw a doctor just before Christmas, who informed her that her issue was ""gastrointestinal related and not serious.""

Still, her brother said doctors at the first hospital — which discharged her with a mere antibiotic prescription — did not really care to find a solution for his sister. He explained:

She couldn't sit up because the pain was so severe, she was just in the fetal position. That alone should have alarmed the doctors but she was left lying like that for hours.



To discharge someone who then arrives home and immediately calls an ambulance because they think they're dying is shocking. I have worked in healthcare for 30 years and I know the care she received was unsatisfactory. It was inhumane and tantamount to neglect.

""I just can't accept that's appropriate for 21st century health care,"" Oldham-Fox said.

According to the Daily Mail, health officials have initiated an investigation to determine how Vivien's cancer was so easily overlooked.

The incident comes after a doctor at the same hospital recently turned away a critically ill patient, only for that person to die at a different hospital soon after.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-teen-girl-wanted-to-be-male-got-breasts-removed-took-testosterone-now-23-she-says-doctors-should-have-challenged-her-decision--and-is-suing,2019-01-28
Ukraine and Russia are both using Chinese commercial drones for psychological warfare and spying,"We've officially entered the age of drone wars.

The Ukraine-Russia war started with the mobilization of Russian tanks, but now more than ever, the two countries are fighting, spying, and engaging in psychological warfare with the use of both military drones and commercial/residential ones, according to a new report by the Washington Post.

With massive amounts of money being sent to eastern Europe, Republicans have been asking for details regarding the weapons being provided, but the use of handheld drones was likely not on anyone's mind or at the very least has been severely underreported.



Currently, there are ""hundreds of reconnaissance and attack drones flying over Ukraine each day"" — all varying in type and size — in what appears to be an obvious result of, and solution to, attrition. Drones are being used in all integral militaristic phases on both sides, with radar jamming and air defense being carried out by large fleets.

Russia is reportedly using it's own six-foot drones, along with Iranian drones that are nearly twice the size. Ukraine is being provided the American Switchblade 300 ""suicide drone"" alongside its use of the gigantic Bayraktar TB2, a Turkish drone with a 12-meter wingspan.

However, both sides are using what's called the Mavic 3 drone — a small, easily obtainable product for home or commercial use that can be bought off the manufacturer's website or Amazon. It's use was recently called a ""true symbol of modern warfare"" by a retired Russian general earlier this year.

They are so widely prevalent that Ukrainian soldiers say they often ""don’t know if the drone they spot is friend or foe.""

The Chinese-made drone typically used for aerial photography or video has a vastly different purpose in this armed conflict than those of its larger cousins. Among its uses include dropping explosives fashioned out of recycled soda bottles, a strategy Ukrainian special forces claim they used in November 2022.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine, the aerial units are explicitly used as a method of psychological warfare by dropping small munitions on Russian bases.

Ukraine is publicly collecting funds to buy up swaths of drones around the world to add to its fleet. A charity run by a Ukrainian TV star openly boasts on its website about the number of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles it has provided the military:

""Drones, the eyes in the sky Strengthened Ukrainian army with 2984+ Drones,"" it reads.

Also mentioned are the captured/damaged enemy vehicles that have been repurposed:

""Repaired 2 T-72 tanks, 2 BMP-3, 1 APC, and BREM for the needs of Ukrainian defenders.""

The pursuit for even more drones is apparently endless; Ukraine's United24, the official crowd-funding arm of the country, has an initiative called the ""Army of Drones"" which seeks to by around 1,000 UAVs. Its fundraising achievements are posted proudly on the website.

""Total collected: $237,850,771 ... Current Balance: $36,724,286.""

The goal, according to the report, is 10,000 drones all across the front lines to broadcast the war ""without interruption.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-woman-cancer-socialized-medicine,2022-12-02
'False flag': Ukrainian kindergarten hit by military shells as US officials warn Russian invasion is 'imminent',"A kindergarten was struck by artillery shells in a town on the Ukrainian government-controlled side of the front line in eastern Ukraine Thursday, wounding three adult civilians, the Ukrainian military said.

In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian Joint Forces Operation accused ""Russian occupation troops"" of shelling the town of Stanytsia in the Luhansk region, referring to Russian-backed separatist troops that have been causing violence in the area for eight years. The separatists in turn accused the Ukrainian government of opening fire on the territory four times over the past 24 hours, according to Reuters.



A spokesman for the Kremlin did not comment directly on Ukraine's allegation, but said there is ""an ongoing exchange of strikes"" near the border between Ukraine and Russia and that ""the first strike came from the Ukrainian side,"" the New York Times reported.



The breach of a tenuous cease-fire agreement in the region was received by western leaders as a possible ""false flag"" operation by Russia to create a pretext to launch an invasion of Ukraine.

U.K Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters Thursday, ""the picture is continuing to be very grim.""

""A kindergarten was shelled in what we are taking to be, what we know was a false flag operation designed to discredit the Ukrainians, designed to create a pre-text, a spurious provocation for Russian action,"" Johnson said.

""We fear very much that that is a thing we will see more of over the next few days,"" he added.

American officials have likewise warned that ""evidence on the ground"" suggests a Russian invasion of Ukraine is ""imminent.""

""We have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in,"" President Biden told reporters on Thursday. ""Every indication we have is they are prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine.""

Moscow has repeatedly denied having plans to invade Ukraine and earlier this week claimed that troops deployed along the border had completed military exercises there and were returning to base.

But the United States and NATO allies have said there was no evidence to support Russia's claims. Satellite images reported by Axios show a military pontoon bridge has been established over the Pripyat River in Belarus, less than four miles from the Ukraine border. Moscow has actually increased troop presence on the border ""by as many as 7,000 troops,"" according to a senior administration official.



U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the reports of the shelling were ""troubling.""

“We’ve said for some time that the Russians might do something like this in order to justify a military conflict. So we’ll be watching this very closely,” he said, speaking from Brussels.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba blamed Russia for a ""severe violation"" of the cease-fire agreement and President Volodymyr Zelensky called it a ""provocative shelling.""

Russia turned the accusations around and blamed Ukraine for a ""further escalation of tensions.""

“We have warned many times that excessive concentration of Ukrainian forces near the contact line, together with possible provocations, can pose terrible danger,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-and-russia-drone-warfare,2022-02-17
Ukrainian lawmaker accuses Russian soldiers of raping a woman in front of her child,"A Ukrainian woman was raped by a Russian soldier in front of her child, according to a lawmaker who said Ukraine will ""not be silent"" about crimes committed during Russia's invasion of her country.



Member of Parliament Maria Mezentseva said in a TV interview that the alleged war crime took place in Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, the Guardian reported. She told the U.K.'s Sky News that the victim's husband was shot dead in his house before the alleged assault.

“There is one case which was very widely discussed recently because it’s been recorded and proceeded with [by] the prosecutor’s office, and we’re not going into details, but it’s quite a scary scene when a civilian was shot dead in his house in a small town next to Kyiv,"" Mezentseva said.

“His wife was – I’m sorry but I have to say it – raped several times in front of her underage child.”

According to the Guardian, the Russian soldier is believed to have threatened the child after the attack.

Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova has confirmed the alleged attack was reported to authorities and said Wednesday that an arrest warrant has been issued for the soldier.

Mezentseva, who serves as the head of Ukraine's permanent delegation to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, said that war crimes committed during the invasion must be recorded. ""Justice has to prevail,"" she said.

She added that sexual assault cases were being underreported.

“There are many more victims rather than just this one case which has been made public by the prosecutor general,” she said. “And of course, we are expecting many more of them, which will be public once victims will be ready to talk about that.

“That’s why you know, when we’ve been talking to Boris Johnson, when we will be talking to your Home Office, when we’ve been talking to MPs of UK, we’ve also raised this issue that this aftermath, which we are dealing with right now, the aftermath of war, has to be taken very cautiously, very seriously, and to take into account the UK experience and experience of other countries, which can help us in dealing with psychologists, and how to help these people to actually live over these cases, to keep going afterwards, to keep living.”

""We will definitely not be silent,"" she added.



There have been previous reports of sexual assaults committed by Russian soldiers, which is considered a war crime and violation of international humanitarian law.

Earlier in March, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba alleged there were ""numerous cases"" of Russian soldiers raping women in Ukraine. Another Ukrainian lawmaker, Lesia Vasylenko, said officials had reports of ""women being gang-raped,"" including ""senior citizens,"" and that ""most of these women have either been executed after the crime of rape or they have taken their own lives.""

While rape is common in times of war, sexual assaults are difficult to prove, and accusations of rape have been used as a powerful propaganda tool to rally opposition to the enemy.



The U.S. government determined last week that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine, after a ""careful review"" of public and intelligence sources transmitting news from the war.

“We’ve seen numerous credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians, as well as other atrocities. Russia’s forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-kindergarten-hit-by-military-shells-us-officials-warn-russian-invasion-imminent,2022-03-28
"Ukrainian plane carrying 176 crashes in Iran, killing all on board. Now Iran is reportedly refusing to hand over the black box.","A Ukraine International Airlines aircraft crashed on Wednesday morning in Iran, killing all 176 people on board.

The plane crashed just 10 minutes after taking off, appearing to burst into flames while in midair.

FlightRadar24 reported that the plane lost contact about two minutes after taking off.

What are the details?

The airliner, a Boeing 737-800 NG, was just three years old and had been recently tested. The last scheduled maintenance on the plane was just two days before the fateful flight, which left Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran and was bound for Kyiv, Ukraine.

The Ukrainian embassy in Tehran initially issued a statement dismissing the notion of terrorism, but deleted the statement. It later reissued a statement saying that the cause was unknown and the disaster was under investigation. Authorities have chalked the crash up to technical issues.

The region has experiencing a plethora of unrest over the last week, beginning with the U.S. airstrike on Gen. Qassem Soleimani, which ultimately resulted in Iran firing numerous missiles on military facilities housing U.S. troops in neighboring Iraq Tuesday night. However, authorities do not believe that the crash is related to the missile launches.

According to Reuters, Pirhossein Koulivand — head of Iran's emergency services — said that flames from the wreckage were ""so heavy"" that no rescue was possible. Rescue methods included 26 ambulances and a helicopter.

The New York Times reported that Qassem Biniaz at the Iranian Ministry of Roads and Urban Development said that one of the airliner's engines caught fire and that pilots lost control.

IRIB, the Iranian state broadcaster, said that one of the airliner's black boxes was discovered. Reuters also reported on Wednesday that Iran, however, is refusing to hand over the black box for investigation.

A spokesperson for Boeing issued a statement confirming the crash.

""We are aware of the media reports out of Iran and we are gathering more information,"" the statement said. ""This is a tragic event and our heartfelt thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families. We are in contact with our airline customer and stand by them in this difficult time. We are ready to assist in any way needed.""

What was the Ukraine reaction?

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's offered his ""sincere condolences to family and loved ones of all passengers and crew members.""

Ukraine International Airlines announced an indefinite suspension of flights to Tehran in the crash's wake.

""It was one of the best planes we had, with an amazing, reliable crew,"" Yevhen Dykhne, president of the Ukraine International Airlines, said during a news briefing on the incident.

NBC News reported that the majority of people on the airliner hailed from mainly areas in Iran and Canada.

The outlet reported that 82 people on board were Iranian, 63 were Canadian, and 11 people were Ukrainian, including the flight's nine crew members. Also, 10 people were from Sweden, four people were from Afghanistan, three people were from Germany, and three people were from the United Kingdom.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-lawmaker-accuses-russian-soldiers-of-raping-a-woman-in-front-of-her-child,2020-01-08
UK's top central banker warns cryptocurrency investors: Be 'prepared to lose all your money',"Cryptocurrency has been killing it lately.

As of Friday, the most famous digital currency, Bitcoin, was at $58,581, a jump of 2.6% from just a week ago. More impressively, it's up 96% from a year ago, according to Fortune.

But Bitcoin isn't alone. Ethereum is at $3,560, which is 28.5% higher than last week and a whopping 371% from this time last year.

Dogecoin, which was not meant to be a serious currency, is at $.61 — which doesn't seem like much until you realize that it's up 92.5% from a week ago and 12,718% year-to-date.

However, the most prominent central banker in the U.K. issued a warning to the world's investors in the digital money, urging them to beware: The ride will be coming to an abrupt end, he believes.

What did he say?

Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, said during a Thursday press conference that anyone invested in cryptocurrency should be ready to lose everything.

UAE news outlet the National reported that reporters asked Bailey whether his bank is concerned about ""wild price swings in the cryptocurrency markets."" He answered, ""I'm afraid they don't have intrinsic value.""

He added that, though he sees no intrinsic value, there is still value placed on them.

""Now that doesn't mean to say that people don't put value on them because they can have extrinsic value,"" Bailey told reporters. ""But they have no intrinsic value.""

Then he issued a very clear, very brusque warning that crypto investors should be ready to lose their shorts.

""So, I'm going to say this very bluntly again; buy them only if you're prepared to lose all your money,"" Bailey warned. ""I'm afraid currency and crypto are two words that don't go together for me.""

Fortune noted that this isn't the first time Bailey has cautioned about the future of cryptocurrency.

Back in January, Bailey told the World Economic Forum that today's cryptocurrencies would likely not survive as a form of payment long term — though he did admit that digital innovation in payments is here to stay. The problem, for him, is that existing digital currencies can't last in their current structure.

""Have we landed on what I would call the design, governance, and arrangements for what I might call a lasting digital currency?"" he said to the WEF panel. ""No, I don't think we're there yet, honestly. I don't think cryptocurrencies as originally formulated are it.""

Despite Bailey's objections, the Bank of England said in April that it would ""join forces with the U.K. Treasury to consider creating its own central bank digital currency,"" Fortune reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-plane-carrying-176-crashes-in-iran-killing-all-aboard,2021-05-07
Communist Chinese government flexes international 'clout' by defeating UN vote to debate China's genocide of the Uyghurs,"On Thursday, the United Nations' human rights council voted on an American-led motion to hold a debate about human rights abuses committed by communist China against Uyghurs in the nation's western region of Xinjiang. Of the council's 47 nation state members, 36 voted: 19 against and 17 for the motion. The result, said to be an ""abdication of responsibility and a betrayal of Uyghur victims"" by Human Rights Watch's China director, Sophie Richardson, is regarded as a win for the communist regime.

The motion proposed debate regarding the findings of a 48-page U.N. rights office report published on August 31 that detailed potential ""crimes against humanity"" in Xinjiang. While the U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and a number of other countries have already formally declared the Chinese communist party's (CCP) internment and ethnic cleansing of the country's Uyghur population a genocide, this debate would have invited greater international scrutiny.

The result of the vote also revealed China's growing international influence and leverage over third-world countries.



The vote

The following countries voted against the motion to debate whether the CCP's genocide constitutes a human rights concern: Bolivia; Cameroon; China; Cote d'Ivoire; Cuba; Eritrea; Gabon; Indonesia; Kazakhstan; Mauritania; Namibia; Nepal; Pakistan; Qatar; Senegal; Sudan; United Aram Emirates; Uzbekistan; and Venezuela.



A number of countries abstained from voting, including Brazil, India, Mexico and Ukraine.

In addition to the European powers, a handful of countries supported the American motion including the Republic of Korea, Japan and Somalia.

The response

Though not surprised by the result, Olaf Wientzek of the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation suggested that it damaged the credibility of the UN and ""shows China's diplomatic clout."" He emphasized that the motion did not propose a monitoring mechanism, but simply debate, but ""that was too much for many members.""

The U.K. ambassador in Geneva, Simon Manley, stated: ""China's attempts to stifle debate and hide the truth will not succeed.""

Marc Limon of the Universal Rights Group said, ""It's a serious blow for the credibility of the council and a clear victory for China ... Many developing countries will see it as an adjustment away from Western predominance in the UN human rights system.""

Zhang Meifang, consul general of China in Belfast, tweeted ""Justice prevails!""

A spokesman for the communist Chinese regime's ministry of foreign affairs stated, ""The issues related to Xinjiang are not about human rights. They are about countering violent terrorism, radicalization and separatism.""

Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of Amnesty International, said, ""Today's vote protects the perpetrators of human rights violations rather than the victims — a dismaying result that puts the U.N.’s main human rights body in the farcical position of ignoring the findings of the U.N.’s own human rights office.""

The report

The topic for the precluded debate was the Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner's report. This report countered the CCP's claims that its suppression, internment, and murder of Uyghurs were justifiable as part of a broader ""counter-extremism"" strategy.

Among the report's recommendations, it suggested that a thorough investigation be undertaken into ""allegations of torture, sexual violence, ill-treatment, forced medical treatment, as well as forced labour and reports of deaths in custody.""

Uyghurs who have escaped China have detailed forced late-term abortions, routine tortures, and forced labor in China's re-education camps (called ""Vocational Education and Training Centers"" by the CCP) where an estimated 1 million people have been confined in recent years.

Xinjiang itself has reportedly been transformed into an open air prison camp.

Uyghur neighborhoods are surrounded by militarized checkpoints. Those who want to leave are retinal-scanned. Each neighborhood is assigned a ""grid monitor"" who surveils their activities and ensures against their adherence to religious customs.

According to Nury Turkel, the chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Uyghurs outside the camps are subjected to ""a barrage of scans, tests and examinations ... [including] retinal scans and fingerprints ... blood or hair samples ... for DNA profiling.""

The New York Post reported that they must also ""read from a set text for forty-five minutes so their voices could be recorded and identified,"" enabling spies to determine who was talking in tapped and taped communications.

Cullen Hendrix, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote that Xinjiang, home to nearly 12 million Uyghurs, ""may be the most tightly controlled media environment on Earth, on part with North Korea.""

A 2020 report from the Washington-based Center for Global Policy indicated that under the pretenses of a ""poverty alleviation"" scheme, the CCP forces an estimated 570,000 Uyghurs to to pick cotton by hand for the CCP.

The UN high commissioner's report suggested that the CCP's actions may also ""constitute international crimes.""



Just as Christians who have fled China are hunted down internationally by the CCP, so too are Uyghurs. In fact, the recently exposed international network of communist Chinese police stations that operate in the U.S., Canada and Europe, reportedly help keep tabs on those who have escaped persecution in Xinjiang.

Safeguard Defenders, a European pan-Asian human rights NGO, issued a September report entitled ""110 Overseas: Chinese Transnational Policing Gone Wild,"" documenting these extralegal forward operating communist bases.

While touted as pseudo-embassies, the primary function of these forward operating bases is instead to compel persons to return to China whenever the regime has determined them to have broken Chinese law. Uyghurs who have fled China are regarded by the regime as lawbreakers.

In fact, many of the estimated 1,500 ethnic Muslim Uyghurs who were hunted down and detained in the Near East and North Africa have been extradited back to China.

According to a 2021 Freedom House report, ""China conducts the most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world."" The CCP ""targets many groups, including multiple ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, human rights activists, journalists, and former insiders accused of corruption.""

International implications

All of the nations that voted against the motion have been pulled into China's sphere of international influence.

China, which has been materially supporting Russia during its war on Ukraine, has expanded this influence, in part, through its Belt and Road Initiative. Through its BRI, the CCP helps poorer nations build ports, rail lines and telecommunications networks, as well as secure financing. Since this assistance is usually unaffordable by design, the BRI transforms countries into politically malleable debtors. The Economic Times characterized BRI as one of ""China's colonial advances wrapped in benign global treaties.""

The New York Times reported that extra to economic leverage, some in the U.S. suspect that BRI is enabling China to build ""a globe-spanning bloc of nations that will mostly buy Chinese goods and tilt toward China's authoritarian political model.""

Every one of the countries on the human rights council that voted with China are part of the BRI. Somalia was the outlier, which is part of BRI but nevertheless took a stand.

Liu Mingfu, a retired colonel in the Chinese communist military, wrote a book to which Chinese president Xi Jinping has referred, entitled ""The China Dream."" Liu, a proponent for communist Chinese global supremacy, characterized the competition between China and the U.S. not a ""shooting duel"" or ""boxing match,"" but as a ""track and field"" competition, or a marathon.

Michael Pillsbury, director of the Center on Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, indicated in the book ""The Hundred-Year Marathon"" that elements of the communist Chinese regime have long aspired to ""replace the United States as the economic, military, and political leader of the world by the year 2049 (the one hundredth anniversary of the Communist Revolution),"" in part to ""avenge or 'wipe clean' (xi xue) past foreign humiliations,"" such as the Chinese addiction to opium in the 19th century.

Pillsbury stated that the CCP's aim is ""a world without American global supremacy.""

Pillsbury detailed how Liu and other influential Chinese political thinkers believe China to have a responsibility ""to 'improve' all the nations and people of the world by 'harmonizing' them—spreading Chinese values, language, and culture so they can better fit into under heaven. This empire 'values order over freedom, ethics over law, and elite governance over democracy and human rights.'""

In addition to evidencing China's growing political clout, Thursday's UN vote hints at the nature and priorities of the world order the CCP seeks to establish.



'Cesspool of political bias'

The Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the council because of its inclusion of numerous human rights abusers such as China, Cuba, Pakistan and Venezuela. The U.S. was the first country in the council's 12-year history to drop out voluntarily.

Then-U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said, ""We take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights."" She added, ""the Human Rights Council has been a protector of human rights abusers, and a cesspool of political bias.""

University forced to cancel conference on prison reform after transgender activists issue threats,"Open University in Milton Keynes, England, canceled a prison reform conference after transgender activism lobby groups issued threats against the event.

What are the details?

The school and the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies co-organized the conference, which was set to take place in May.

More than 100 people had purchased tickets for the event, which was set to span two days.

According to the Telegraph, the school told attendees that the conference was called off in March after trans activist groups said that the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies was transphobic for its stance on segregating the housing of trans female prisoners and biologically female prisoners.

A source told the outlet, ""The Open University faced quite a significant pressure from transgender activists. They received a number of emails where some of the language was extraordinarily overheated.""

The source added, ""They were effectively being threatened with demonstrations and disruptive activity, possibly in the conference hall itself, and some kind of picket line or protest outside the conference.""

In a statement, the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies said, ""We are saddened to announce that the conference, Prison Abolition in the U.K., planned for 23 and 24 May, has been cancelled.""

""Unfortunately, one of our conference partners has, in recent weeks, been subjected to concerted pressure by those intent on disrupting the conference,"" the statement added. ""In the circumstances, they felt they had no option but to pull out.""

A spokesperson for the university said that the decision was made over concerns that the discussion ""was moving away from its main, originally intended, focus — to debate past, present, and future of prison abolition.""

What else?

In March, England's first transgender prison wing opened for men identifying as women after reports of vicious sexual assaults forced the government change policies for trans inmates.

""Prisoner safety is our biggest concern and any decisions we take will seek to best manage the risks posed by each offender,"" a statement from a British Ministry of Justice spokesperson said. ""The wider management of transgender offenders is a highly sensitive issue which poses unique and complex challenges and we are determined to get it right. That's why we are reviewing the way we manage all transgender offenders.""

The government handed down a suggested directive calling for a majority of trans inmates to be incarcerated in prisons according to their preferred gender identity in 2016 after a male inmate identifying as a female raped two fellow female prisoners while incarcerated.

"University erects statue of Greta Thunberg, outrages students who suggest misuse of funds","Greta Thunberg may be just a teenager, but she already has her own statue.

The University of Winchester, located in south England, erected a life-size bronze statue in Thunberg's honor on Tuesday, sparking backlash among students who believe university funds should have been more wisely spent.

In a press release, school officials said the statue represents the school's ""ongoing commitment to sustainability and social justice"" and its ""commitment to combat the climate and ecological emergency.""



The school's vice chancellor, Joy Carter, said:

Greta is a young woman who, in spite of difficulties in her life, has become a world leading environmental activist. As the University for sustainability and social justice we are proud to honour this inspirational woman in this way.



We know that many find her a controversial figure. As a University we welcome reasoned debate and critical conversations. We hope her statue will help to inspire our community, reminding us that no matter what life throws at us we can still change the world for the better. That is a message we want all our students and all young people to hear.

According to the BBC, the statue cost nearly £24,000, which is the equivalent of $33,000.

What did students say?

Megan Ball, president of the Winchester Student Union, said that Winchester students could not support the statue and called on university officials to replace the money they spent on it.

""We're in a COVID year, lots of students haven't really had access to campus, lots of them are trying to study online and are in dire need of support,"" she said, the BBC reported.

""We are calling on the university to match the statue cost by committing £23,760 in additional funding to student support services across campus,"" Ball added. ""We urge them to publicly face the critical issues which students are highlighting and provide a transparent breakdown of additional and existing financial support.""

Ultimately, the student union called the statue a ""vanity project.""

Did the school divert funds allocated for students?

Carter said that no funds meant for students were allocated to finance the statue.

""We are aware of some concerns raised about the financing of the statue. The statue was commissioned in 2019 as part of the West Downs project from funds which could only be spent on that building.

University of Michigan's Words Matter Task Force bans words,"The University of Michigan has a ""Words Matter Task Force,"" and the organization has declared that certain words such as ""picnic"" and ""brown bag"" are offensive.

The Words Matter Task Force has ""evaluated the terms and language conventions that may hinder effective communication, harm morale, and deliberately or inadvertently exclude people from feeling accepted to foment a healthy and inclusive culture."" The group, which is a part of Michigan's Information and Technology Services, advises that people should avoid using so-called problematic words such as ""privileged account,"" ""handicapped,"" ""blacklist,"" ""crazy,"" ""grandfathered,"" and ""dummy.""



The Information and Technology Services, a ""trusted enabler of technology for the U-M community,"" created the Words Matter Task Force. The group claims that by ""using inclusive language, ITS is able to design and build better tools and services to meet customers' needs.""

""Given the importance of communication and the ITS core value of inclusivity, the Words Matter Task Force was formed and charged with identifying terms used within ITS that are, or can be construed to be, racist, sexist, or non-inclusive,"" the Words Matter Task Force states in the 10-page document that was updated on Dec. 8.



Inclusive language means not using sayings such as ""long time no see,"" ""crack the whip,"" ""low man on the totem pole,"" ""off the reservation,"" and ""sold down the river.""

Despite the word ""picnic"" being labeled as offensive by the Words Matter Task Force, a Reuters fact-check article stated that the word ""picnic"" is ""not racist"" and ""does not originate from the lynchings of African Americans.""

""The word picnic derives from the 17th century French word 'pique-nique,' a term used to describe a social gathering in which attendees each contributed with a portion of food or another useful item,"" according to Dr David Pilgrim, author of several books on the history and cultural symbols of the Jim Crow era.

Despite being the ""Information and Technology Services,"" tech terms such as ""master"" and ""slave"" are prohibited. Technopedia defines ""master/slave"" as a ""model of communication for hardware devices where one device has a unidirectional control over one or more devices.""

The guidance also advises people to not use the term ""preferred pronouns"" and to simply call them ""pronouns.""

The Words Matter Task Force wants to ""create educational animations/short videos for ITS staff"" with three purposes:



To encourage empathy for how others may feel when words have negative connotations.

To spur curiosity about why words matter, and direct people to other educational resources.

To provide a non-threatening, quick resource that is easily shared/disseminated.

The ""educational"" short videos would use ""neutral characters"" such as ""stick figures.""

US accuses Zero Hedge of spreading Russian propaganda. Website fires back at 'hit piece.',"U.S. intelligence officials have accused the libertarian-leaning financial website Zero Hedge of spreading Russian propaganda, though the website vigorously denies the accusation.

Anonymous officials who spoke with the Associated Press on Tuesday alleged that Zero Hedge, which has 1.2 million readers, published articles created by Moscow-controlled media. The officials pointed to multiple articles that criticized U.S. warnings about a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Some of those articles were authored by people affiliated with the Strategic Culture Foundation, a group sanctioned by the Biden administration last year for allegedly participating in Russian interference in the 2020 U.S. election, according to the AP. The officials said the foundation's leadership takes direction from the SVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service.

Recent Zero Hedge articles cited by the AP include the headlines: “NATO Sliding Towards War Against Russia In Ukraine,” “Americans Need A Conspiracy Theory They Can All Agree On,” and “Theater Of Absurd... Pentagon Demands Russia Explain Troops On Russian Soil.”



In a written response published Tuesday, Zero Hedge called the AP article a ""hit piece"" and said it has ""been singled out for pursuing non-establishment groupthink.""

""Well, now we've done it — we've angered the CIA, and for what? For publishing views that challenge the conventional narrative,"" Zero Hedge wrote.

The post noted that there is ""no actual accusation that Zero Hedge works directly with anyone tied to Russia or its intelligence apparatus."" The officials quoted by the AP did not say whether they believed Zero Hedge knew of any alleged links to spy agencies and they did not allege a direct link between the website and Russia.



Zero Hedge told the AP it seeks to “publish a wide spectrum of views that cover both sides of a given story.”



""[T]his website has never worked, collaborated or cooperated with Russia, nor are there any links to spy (or any other) agencies,"" Zero Hedge emphasized in its response.

Zero Hedge said that the Strategic Culture Foundation ""periodically guest posts on its website along with hundreds of other sources of alternative information."" The website added that one of the main writers for the foundation, Alastair Crooke, is ""a former high ranking MI6 figure and UK diplomat, i.e., a former British spook.""



""Perhaps he is now a double agent working for Putin after spending decades spying for the UK?” Zero Hedge wrote.

Zero Hedge told the AP the Strategic Culture Foundation is ""one of our hundreds of contributors — unlike Mainstream Media, we try to publish a wide spectrum of views that cover both sides of a given story.""

The intelligence officials said three other websites have ties to the FSB, Russia's federal security service.

“These sites enable the Russian government to secure support among the Russian and Ukrainian populations,” one official said. “This is the primary vector for how the Russian government will bolster support domestically for an invasion into Ukraine.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/university-of-michigan-words-matter,2022-02-15
US administers its first COVID-19 vaccine on a New York ICU nurse,"The United States has administered the very first Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, according to various reporting.

What are the details?

The U.S. rollout began on Monday as Sandra Lindsay, a critical care nurse from Northwell Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens, New York, received the coronavirus vaccine at 9:23 ET on Monday, according to CNN.

The event was livestreamed with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).

""You didn't flinch,"" Cuomo quipped of Lindsay's vaccination.

Of the vaccine, Lindsay said, ""I'm feeling well. I would like to thank all of the frontline workers and all my colleagues ... doing their job during this pandemic all over the world. ... I feel hopeful today, relieved. I hope this marks the beginning of a the end of a very painful time.""

Cuomo added, ""In New York, we prioritized health care workers at the top of the list to receive the vaccine because we know that you are out there every day putting your lives in danger for the rest of us.""

""So this is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" he added. ""But it's a long tunnel and we need people to continue to be doing the right thing. And the smart thing, all through the holiday season. And hopefully, when we get to about June, they estimate the vaccine can hit critical mass, but the health care workers will get it first because we know that you're super stressed during this holiday season.""

What else?

According to reports, the University of Louisville Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, received its first delivery of the vaccine this morning, and other areas in New York, Connecticut, Iowa, Michigan, and Washington, D.C., are also expected to administer COVID-19 vaccines on Monday.

CNN reported, ""The first batch of the vaccine was shipped out from a Pfizer plant in Portage, Michigan, on Sunday headed for over 600 sites across all 50 states.""

Health officials first began administering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines last week in the United Kingdom. Following the injections, at least two people saw allergic reactions to the vaccine, prompting experts to announce that people with histories of significant allergic reaction avoid the vaccine.

Experts say the vaccine is given as two separate shots administered 21 days apart.

The US Navy is making it easier for its pilots to report UFOs,"The U.S. Navy is coming up with new guidelines that will make it easier for pilots and Navy personnel to report sightings of unidentified flying objects.

It's not really about aliens

While these new guidelines that encourage reporting of unidentified objects may excite believers in extraterrestrials, they have nothing to do with alien spacecraft sightings. Rather, the Navy is concerned about aircraft it doesn't know about entering U.S. military airspace.

In a statement to Politico, a spokesperson for the Navy explained, ""There have been a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated air space in recent years.""

This is especially problematic now that drones have become popular. In December, a drone entered the airspace of London's Gatwick airport, causing panic and delays.

Being able to analyze these sightings could help to better detect the presence of hostile aircraft and other ""hazards to aviation safety."" These UFO sightings happen often enough, Politico reported, that Navy leadership believes they can no longer be ignored. The Navy told Politico in a statement that it ""takes these reports very seriously and investigates each and every report.""

The U.S. Air Force, the statement said, treats these reports similarly.

What else?

The Navy also said that ""[f]or safety and security concerns,"" it was ""updating and formalizing the process by which reports of any such suspected incursions can be made to the cognizant authorities. A new message to the fleet that will detail the steps for reporting is in draft.""

An unnamed senior military official told CNN that some recent UFO sightings are actually classified military tests. This has been a common explanation for UFO sightings in the past, including the infamous 1947 crash at Roswell, New Mexico, which the U.S. government later confirmed was a high-altitude balloon.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-administers-its-first-covid-vaccine,2019-04-24
VIDEO: Desperate Afghani mothers throw their babies over barbed wire to allied troops in order to protect their children from Taliban,"Afghani mothers desperate to free their children from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan were seen throwing their babies over barbed wire in order to pass them off to British and U.S. troops at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, according to various reports.

What are the details?

Video footage has emerged showing Afghani parents throwing babies to British troops and begging them to save their children from the Taliban, the New York Post reported.

An unnamed Parachute Regiment officer told the Independent, ""The mothers were desperate, they were getting beaten by the Taliban. They shouted 'Save my baby!' and threw the babies at us. Some of the babies fell on the barbed wire.""

He added, ""It was awful what happened. By the end of the night, there wasn't one man among us who was not crying.""

According to the Post, a White House official on Wednesday said that about 1,800 people were evacuated from Afghanistan over the preceding 24 hours — a sum that fell short from the 5,000 to 9,000 people the Pentagon said could possibly be evacuated in a 24-hour period.

What else?

Another unnamed officer told Sky News' Stuart Ramsay that paratroopers had no choice but to block off the road with military vehicles and barbed wire fences.

""It was terrible,"" the officer recalled, echoing his fellow soldier's remarks. ""Women were throwing their babies over the razor wire, asking the soldiers to take them. Some got caught in the wire. I'm worried for my men, I'm counseling some, everyone cried last night.""

Ramsay, reporting from Afghanistan, wrote that the streets echo with the sounds of shouting — ""the noise of desperation"" — as British soldiers try to aid in a humanitarian mission that feels more like a war zone.



""Day and night families — often with tiny children — have risked their lives, ducking past gunfire at the gates of the civilian side of the airport, passing aggressive Taliban fighters who occasionally beat and harass them,"" Ramsay recalled of the previous week.

He concluded his reporting, ""I've reported on the Afghan war since it started. I've been on countless embeds with British and American soldiers, I've met with the Taliban, and I've seen pain and grief in Afghanistan for two decades. The Taliban has won. Watching on as soldiers carried babies towards the gates of the compound, I can't help but think what a waste this has been. And once again a small contingent of soldiers are dealing with the mess.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-navy-pilots-report-ufos,2021-08-19
Video: BBC crew claims Joe Biden had them booted from their pub table so he and Jill could take it,"A BBC editor and his producer say President Joe Biden decided to take their table at a hotel pub Thursday, and posted videos of the incident showing Biden standing at the table as the crew collected their belongings.

What are the details?

The New York Post reported on the encounter that began with BBC North American editor Jon Sopel documenting himself chatting up Biden when the commander-in-chief sat down at a table near him outdoors at the Treganna Castle in Cornwall.

""A first in my career,"" Sopel tweeted along with accompanying video. ""@POTUS comes and sits down at table in a bar next to me and orders a drink. Am trying to act nonchalant #G7.""

The Post reported, ""But the BBC team was soon forced to pack up their belongings to give up their table to POTUS and FLOTUS — even though they clearly had the pick of several other tables in the otherwise empty area.""

Sopel's producer, Morgan Gisholt Minard, then posted a clip showing her gathering her things to leave their table as Biden stood by, hands resting on one of the chairs, watching and waiting for her to skedaddle as they exchanged pleasantries.

Minard tweeted, ""There are few instances I'd feel compelled to give up my dinner table... I suppose this is an exception. Welcome to Cornwall @POTUS.""

Sopel then joked on Twitter that Minard ""has never, not once, stood up to make way for me.""

In a short BBC posting that same day titled, ""When the US president sits at your table in the bar,"" the outlet reported, ""You can bump into all sorts of characters at a hotel bar. Sometimes a VIP from the presidential suite shows up and wants your table.""

Sharing Minard's video, the British outlet added, ""That's what happened to the BBC's Jon Sopel and Morgan Gisholt Minard while they were covering the G7 summit in Cornwall, UK.

But the BBC crew continued their coverage from not too far away, with Sopel reporting shortly after their table-hopping, ""Hope I'm not revealing state secrets but @POTUS drank coke; @FLOTUS a glass of red. Not a beer or cider or pasty in sight #G7.""

What was the Twitter reaction?

According to The Daily Wire, ""while Twitterers mocked the BBC team for moving so quickly, others ripped them for their fawning response"" to the U.S. president.

Several people also made jokes about the incident, with one person telling Minard, ""Get out quick, before he touches you or sniffs your hair...""

Video captures the moment Beirut bridal shoot goes awry as massive explosion erupts in background,"A Lebanese bride is lucky to be alive after the deadly explosion in Beirut on Tuesday.

The bride, 29-year-old Israa Seblani, was taking part in a glamorous wedding photo shoot in a Beirut public square when the shockwave of the massive explosion nearly blew her off her feet.

The deadly explosion killed at least 135 people and injured more than 5,000.

What happened in the video?

In the video, Seblani — a Lebanese physician working in the United States — can be seen smiling for a videographer, turning her head to and fro to show off the beauty of her intricate white gown and veil.

The videographer begins to pan down the length of Seblani's white dress when a gentle sort of rumbling quickly turns into a deafening explosion.

Seblani's hand can be seen twitching as if looking for something to grab onto, and she is nearly knocked off her feet as the camera wildly swings to nearby building facades that are enveloped in dust and smoke.

What did she do next?

Seblani told Reuters that she immediately fled to check on the injured and then left the city center to seek safety.

""I have been preparing for my big day for two weeks and I was so happy like all the other girls,"" she recalled. ""'I am getting married.' My parents are going to be happy seeing me in a white dress, I will be looking like a princess.""



Seblani said that she feared for her life as the explosions rocked the port city.

""What happened during the explosion here — there is no word to explain,"" she admitted. ""I was shocked, I was wondering what happened, am I going to die? How am I going to die?""



Seblani added that she never heard such a sound before.

Officials blamed the blast on a large stockpile of highly explosive materials stored for years in a port building.

""I feel so sad about what happened to other people, about what happened to Lebanon,"" she added. ""When I woke up and saw the damage that happened to Beirut, the one thing I said was 'Thank God we are still alive.'""

Despite the blast, Seblani and her new husband carried out their long-planned nuptials.

""My husband told me to continue, we can't stop,"" the Lebanese doctor added. ""I was like, 'Okay, why not, we continue.' I was not living in the moment, actually, I was like, walking, my face was smiling, my lips were smiling, that's it. Not more. Then we went to have a dinner.""

Seblani said that while she joylessly went through the motions of her wedding, she is still grateful to be alive.

""There is a lot of damage, many people were killed and wounded,"" she said. ""But also if I want to look at us, myself, my husband, the photographer — how we escaped unharmed, I thank God for protecting us.""

She concluded, ""This alone makes me feel optimistic and to keep the joy of the occasion that I came here to celebrate.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-bbc-crew-claims-joe-biden-had-them-booted-from-their-pub-table-so-he-and-jill-could-take-it,2020-08-06
"VIDEO: Staffer stops father's funeral, orders sons to move away from grieving mom due to COVID rules","A staff member stopped a father's funeral at a crematorium in the United Kingdom last week and ordered his two sons to move away from their grieving mother due to COVID-19 rules — and it was all captured on video.

What are the details?

At the start of his father Alan Wright's service Friday at Crownhill Crematorium, the chairs were spread apart to conform to social distancing guidelines. Wright died from a heart attack in September, the Daily Mail reported.

But Craig Bicknell told BBC News he decided to close the distance between himself and his ""vulnerable"" mother as she was ""lost.""

""I made everyone aware that I [would] need to comfort my mum at some point,"" he added to the outlet. ""When I saw my mum break as she did, it just took over that I had to comfort her and put my arm around her.""

Seconds later, Bicknell's brother followed suit and moved his chair, and both sons were sitting next to their mother.

However, a crematorium staffer was seen on video walking in, raising his arms, walking behind the sons and their mother, interrupting the speaker, and telling Bicknell and his brother, ""you have to put them back, I'm afraid,"" BBC News said.

Image source: Daily Mail video screenshot

""You can't move the chairs, you were told,"" he added, according to the outlet.



The brothers complied.

What did the powers that be have to say?



Milton Keynes Council, which runs the building, told BBC News it regrets the incident.

""We are sorry to have upset this family,"" a Council spokesman told the outlet. ""We don't usually step in if a guest needs to be comforted by another family member, and in this instance [we] should have taken a more considered approach. We ask funeral directors to let us know whether any chairs should be grouped in advance, and from now on this includes guests who are in the same household or bubbles, as well as people who need extra support.""

BBC News said COVID-19 government guidelines allow up to 30 people to attend a funeral and require social distancing.

What else did Bicknell have to say?

Bicknell noted to the Daily Mail that he and his brother Paul were left devastated by the ""telling off,"" and he added to BBC News that the incident left him ""angry, upset; it was just an empty feeling.""

He also told BBC News that it ""totally ruined the day"" as he still had to deliver his eulogy after the confrontation.

""It was very hard to do,"" he said. ""I needed the service to carry on for my dad. It was a really scary feeling, I've never felt [it] before.""

Bicknell wrote on Facebook of the experience, ""I can sit in a restaurant, I can sit in a pub, I can live at her house, I can travel in a limousine to the crematorium with 6. But when I want to give my mum a cuddle at dads funeral, a man flies out mid service shouting stop the service and makes us split...A devastating day made even worse,"" the Daily Mail reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-beirut-bridal-shoot-explosion,2020-10-06
Video catches moment Shanghai airport erupts into chaos after hazmat-wearing staff force 'thousands' of people into basement for forced COVID-19 testing,"Chaos appeared to erupt at an airport in Shanghai, China, Sunday night after the hazmat-wearing staff forced what the Daily Mail reported was ultimately ""thousands"" of people into the facility's basement for COVID-19 testing.

The move came after two cargo workers reportedly tested positive for coronavirus.

What are the details?

Video of the incident shows the staff, wearing hazmat suits, pushing against a huge crowd of people inside Shanghai Pudong International Airport.

The outlet reported that thousands in the crowd were ""being forced into [a] basement area inside Shanghai's international airport"" for testing after at least one worker tested positive for the deadly virus.

Some members of the group reportedly tried in vain to escape in order to avoid a mandatory 14-day quarantine following the possible exposure, the outlet reported.

Citing the Xinhua news agency, the Daily Mail noted that ""[m]ore than 17,700 had been swabbed by Monday morning in the drive to test airport cargo staff.""



According to CNN, photos and videos circulating across Chinese social media platforms show ""hundreds of people packed closely together inside the garage — the opposite of social distancing — with a line of people in hazmat suits trying to hold back crowds pushing forward.""

CNN reported that the chaos seemed to abate by midnight.





The New York Post reported that more than 17,700 employees ""stationed in the cargo-handling terminals underwent testing for the virus,"" citing Zhou Junlong, who is vice president of the Shanghai Airport Authority.

Zhou added that none of the 11,544 people whose tests were returned have tested positive for COVID-19 at the time of this reporting.

The Post noted that the massive push for testing came following news that two cargo handlers, who had cleaned a container that had just arrived from North America, had tested positive for the virus.

Reuters reported that Sun Xiaodong, an official at Shanghai's disease control center, said the strain that infected the two unnamed cargo handlers was ""similar to that from North America,"" suggesting it could have originated in North America.

""Research at home and abroad has shown coronavirus could live in enclosed, damp environments,"" Sun said during a recent news conference.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-funeral-sons-mom-separated,2020-11-23
Dramatic video captures the precise moment that a US drone kills Iran's Qassem Soleimani,"Iraqi television network Ahad TV released a video on Friday that shows the precise moment that a U.S. military drone killed General Qassem Soleimani of Iran.

The 12-second black-and-white footage was obtained by the UK's Daily Mail and captured the bombing of Soleimani's convoy at Baghdad International Airport. A bright flash is seen in the closed circuit video followed by projectiles flying upward from one the vehicle targeted in the precision airstrike.

The MQ-9 Reaper drone was designed for 'highly accurate' targeting

The strike on Soleimani was executed by a US Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone. It is said to have a range of 1,150 miles and the ability to reach altitudes of 50,000 feet. The Air Force describes the Reaper as an ""armed, multi-mission, medium-altitude, long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft"" designed primarily for ""dynamic execution targets,"" as well as intelligence gathering.

The $64.2 million drone is 12.5 feet tall with a wingspan of 66 feet and 33 feet long, according to the Air Force.

""The MQ-9 can also employ four laser-guided , Air-to-Ground Missile (AGM)-114 Hellfire missiles, which provide highly accurate, low-collateral damage, anti-armor and anti-personnel engagement capabilities,"" a fact sheet reads that notes a crew based in the continental United States ""executes command and control of the remainder of the mission via beyond-line-of-sight links.""

Soleimani was a terrorist who killed many Americans

According to the U.S. Defense Department, Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans, and was said to have orchestrated recent attacks on coalition bases in Iraq, including one that killed an American defense contractor last week.



""At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization,"" the Defense Department said in a statement. Adding that the purpose of the strike was to deter future Iranian aggression. ""The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.""

In response, Iran has pledged to perpetrate a ""crushing revenge"" on the United States for the strike, prompting the State Department to instruct all Americans in Iraq to leave the country immediately.

Pennsylvania county responds after viral videos show poll workers filling out ballots,"Viral videos circulating on the internet purport to show poll workers in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, filling out blank ballots as the state continues to count votes critical to determining the winner of the presidential race between President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

But the county has provided an explanation for what is going, and Reuters, PolitiFact, and USA Today have all found the allegations of fraud to be false.

What are the details?

One video shows a male poll worker in a black shirt appearing to fill out ballots and stamp them while he is sitting across from a female worker who is wearing a grey sweater. Two other female workers can be seen sitting next to the pair at a nearby separate table.

A second video shows one of the women at the second table filling out ballots.

Delaware County responded in a press release, confirming that the footage was recorded on its official live stream while saying that the viral footage had been ""altered"" and that ""some residents"" are ""making false accusations"" about what the video shows. The county did not specify which video was allegedly altered, but it did point out:

The actual video shows the election worker at a table with other coworkers in a room full of people with bipartisan observers a few feet away at each end of the table, closely observing the worker from approximately 6 feet away. This arrangement was agreed upon between the Election Bureau and the former Republican Chairman of Delaware County Council, acting in his capacity as counsel for the Delaware County Republican Party.

The county shared a screenshot showing the same workers, and the observers monitoring the process.

Image source: Delaware County Pennsylvania government website

The county explains:



During the processing of ballots, a machine extractor opens the ballots. Some ballots were damaged by the extractor during this process in such a way that the ballots could not be scanned successfully. According to the scanner manufacturer, Hart, the best practice to deal with damaged ballots that cannot be scanned is to transcribe the votes on each ballot to a clean ballot and scan the clean ballot. In accordance with that guidance, the Chief Clerk of the Delaware County Bureau of Elections instructed elections staff to manually transcribe the damaged ballots. As ballots were being transcribed, the original damaged ballots were directly beside the new ballots and bipartisan observers witnessed the process at close range. Damaged ballots have been preserved.

A third video also taken from Delaware County's live stream shows an overhead view of a different female poll worker filling out ballots while sitting directly across from a male worker wearing a long-sleeved plaid shirt.

The woman can clearly be seen filling out several ballots and stamping them, as a man narrating (while viewing on a computer) can be heard saying, ""This lady is marking the ballots. I filmed her a half hour ago doing six, and she's still working at it.""

A uniformed law enforcement officer can be seen walking by at one point, and the narrator says, ""And there's a security guard right there who's watching her. The cops are in on it! Disgusting.""

But it does appear that the male poll worker in the video is reading off one (presumably damaged) ballot to the female worker who is filling out the blank ballots. TheBlaze has called and emailed Delaware County for further clarity on the process.

Democrats label voter ID laws evil and racist but ignore the fact that 46 of 47 European democracies have them,"Despite the assertion peddled by Democratic politicians and media pundits alike that voter photo identification laws are racist tools used only to accomplish voter suppression, such laws are the norm across nearly all western democracies as a commonsense means to ensure election integrity.

What are the details?

A recent survey conducted by the Crime Prevention Research Center found that election integrity measures such as voter photo ID requirements — which now are referred to as the ""new Jim Crow"" by progressives in America — are broadly accepted by democratic governments globally.

In fact, a whopping 46 of 47 European democracies require a government-issued photo ID in order to vote, and the one exception — the United Kingdom — is on its way to becoming the 47th, according to CPRC Director John R. Lott Jr., who summarized the organization's findings in an article for RealClearInvestigations on Tuesday.

Beyond that, 33 of 38 member nations of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development also require photo IDs to vote. Only the U.K., Japan, New Zealand, and Australia do not.

The U.K., which reportedly already requires voter IDs in Northern Ireland for all elections and in parts of England for local elections, is considering this year legislation that would make photo IDs a national mandate.



Criticisms of the U.K. legislation have been predictably similar to the criticisms of legislation recently introduced by states in the U.S., such as Georgia, Florida, and Texas. In essence, opponents argue that election reforms, and photo ID requirements in particular, disproportionately disenfranchise minority and low-income individuals.

What else?

Though it's strange that progressives in the U.S., who otherwise look to European countries for political inspiration, refuse to recognize what is obvious even to the liberal societies across the Atlantic — that voter photo ID requirements are prudent — it's not necessarily surprising.

It's just politics, argues Lott. The economist and former Trump administration official explained that the polemic launched by Democrats is just part of an effort ""to make permanent the extraordinary, pandemic-driven measures to relax voting rules during the 2020 elections.""

Under the For the People Act of 2021, recently passed by the House, state voter ID rules would be replaced by a national measure allowing voters to merely submit a signed statement, making ""permanent the pandemic's mail-in ballot voting,"" Lott suggested.

He warned: ""The mailing out of blank absentee ballots en masse would become a fixture of American elections.""

Anything else?

But for all of the misinformation spewed by Democratic figures, including President Joe Biden, the party has had a hard time convincing the public.

According to a new Rasmussen poll published in March, 75% of Americans support voter photo ID laws, up from 67% in 2018. And it wasn't only Republicans who reported support for such laws, but 77% of independents and 60% of Democrats ascribed favor for them, as well.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/viral-videos-show-pennsylvania-poll-workers-filling-out-ballots,2021-06-01
Walmart steps up 'knife control' in Britain,"The Walmart-owned British supermarket chain Asda is going to stop selling single kitchen knives following a spate of stabbings in the country.

Asda, one of the Big Four supermarket chains in the United Kingdom, said in a statement that ""the decision to stop selling these items comes in response to rising concerns about knife crime in the UK, particularly those involving children and young people.""

""We strongly believe that we have a responsibility to support the communities that we serve,"" senior vice president Nick Jones said. ""Whilst we have already taken steps to restrict the sale of knives to ensure that they do not fall into the wrong hands, we felt there was more we could be doing to support those looking at how to bring this issue under control.""

""Control"" is the issue, as stricter and stricter knife control has taken hold in the UK. It is already illegal to sell individual knives to anyone under 18. A discount retail variety chain in the UK, Poundlands, last year banned the sale of knives altogether in their own stores.

The ""Big Four"" grocery stores are Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys, and Morrisons. Asda is owned by American giant Walmart. As the Washington Free Beacon's Stephen Gutowski noted on Twitter, Walmart has also limited gun sales here in the United States.

Earlier this month, 17-year-old Jodie Chesney was fatally stabbed in a park in London in what police have characterized as a random attack. A man charged in the attack was in court on Tuesday this week. Following the incident there have been renewed cries for knife control in England and the UK at large.

Watch: Black GOP candidate wields AR-15 to defend home from Ku Klux Klan Democrats in viral ad: 'Make Rifles Great Again',"A Republican candidate in Arizona went viral Wednesday with a new campaign ad that shows him defending his home from the Ku Klux Klan.

Arizona Republican Jerone Davison in no uncertain terms tells voters exactly how he feels about the right to own an AR-15 rifle for self-defense in a video showing his home being approached by members of the KKK.



Davison, who is black, narrates the video which shows him at home enjoying coffee and praying as menacing figures dressed in Klan attire approach his residence with weapons.



""Democrats like to say that no one needs an AR-15 for self-defense. That no one could possibly need all 30 rounds,"" Davison says, as the Klan members approach.



The video then shows Davison stepping out of his home armed with a rifle, which scares the intruders away.



""But when this rifle is the only thing standing in between your family and a dozen angry Democrats in Klan hoods, you just might need that semi-automatic. And all 30 rounds,"" he says.

Davison posted the video to Twitter Wednesday morning, writing, ""Make Rifles Great Again.""



The 30-second ad is going viral and has been seen more than 500,000 times at the time of this article's publication.

The ad highlights the controversial history of the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist terrorist organization that used violence and intimidation against white and black Republican leaders to disenfranchise black Americans. The Klan sought to reestablish white supremacy in southern states and supported the Democratic Party against Reconstruction-era Republicans in the 1870s.

The KKK reemerged in the 1920s as a racist and nativist hate group that burned crosses and denounced immigrants, Catholics, Jews, African-Americans, and organized labor. It campaigned for pro-segregation Democrats in the South and opposed the Civil Rights Movement through the 1960s.

Prominent Democratic leaders have been affiliated with the Klan, including the late West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, a former organizer and member of the KKK. Byrd later renounced the KKK and said he regretted his membership in the organization. He died in 2010, after serving in Congress for more than 50 years, and was eulogized by then-Vice President Joe Biden.

Davison, a former NFL player, pastor, and speaker, is one of five GOP candidates running in the primary election for Arizona's 4th Congressional District. He was a running back for Arizona State University and later played for the Oakland Raiders from 1996 to 1997.

After leaving the NFL, Davison spent 10 years working in California as a liaison reuniting children with incarcerated parents, according to a profile by the Arizona Republic.

His issue focus is combating big tech, fighting for election integrity — including the ""ability to validate"" results — and embracing free market principles to deal with inflation.

Watch: Woman appears to dance obliviously as Myanmar military instigates coup in background,"A coup was staged in the Southeast Asian country of Myanmar Monday when the nation's military detained democratically-elected leaders including Nobel Peace Prize-winner state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi.

The BBC reports that military leaders are enforcing a night-time curfew in the country after declaring a one-year state of emergency as a pretext to seize power. U.S. President Joe Biden has condemned the coup and threatened new sanctions against the country.

In a video that's beginning to spread virally on social media, a woman filmed herself doing an aerobics workout, oblivious to a convoy of military vehicles headed to the parliament building to seize control behind her.

Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, was ruled under a military dictatorship for 26 years from 1962 until 1988 when the country's socialist military dictator was forced to step down amid nationwide protests. In the period following through the 1990s, Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of the nation's modern founder Aung San, became an advocate for democracy, with her party winning free elections in 1990. But the military refused to cede power at the time, placing Suu Kyi under house arrest and remaining in power for another 22 years until 2011.



Between 2011 and 2015, the country began to slowly transition to a democracy, adopting a constitution that was drafted in 2008 and holding elections in 2015, in which Suu Kyi's pro-democracy party was again victorious. The military never fully relinquished power, however, retaining a right to fill a quarter of the seats in the country's parliament under the 2008 constitution.

Monday's coup came on the day the country's new parliamentary session was about to begin following the Nov. 8, 2020, Myanmar elections. In this election, Suu Kyi's party won 396 out of 476 seats in parliament while the military's party only won 33 seats.

According to the Associated Press, an announcement read on military-owned Myawaddy TV said Commander-in-Chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing would be in charge of the country for one year. The announcement said the seizure was necessary because the government had not acted on the military's claims of fraud in November's elections.

In claiming the election was fraudulent, military leaders cited a law in the 2008 constitution that permits the military to seize power in times of national emergency. The Myanmar electoral commission said that the allegations of widespread fraud made by military leaders were not supported by evidence.

Suu Kyi, Myanmar President Win Myint and other leaders of their National League for Democracy (NLD) party were detained and the BBC reports it is unclear where they are being held.

So far no violence has been reported. After reports emerged that NLD leaders were detained, television, phone, and internet communications in the capital city of Naypyitaw were cut off. The military blocked roads in the city and passenger flights were grounded. Banks also said they were forced to close.

The coup has received international condemnation.

President Biden said the military's actions were ""a direct assault on the country's transition to democracy and the rule of law"" and promised restored sanctions against Myanmar.

""The United States will stand up for democracy wherever it is under attack,"" he said in a statement.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres also said the coup was a ""serious blow to democratic reforms"" and called for an emergency meeting of the U.S. security council.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the ""unlawful imprisonment"" of pro-democracy leaders.

""The vote of the people must be respected and civilian leaders released,"" he tweeted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-arizona-gop-candidate-wields-ar-15-to-defend-home-from-ku-klux-klan-democrats-in-viral-ad,2021-02-01

Western nations isolate Russia's economy by kicking them out of SWIFT,"In a drastic move to sanction Russia for invading Ukraine, the leadership of several Western nations agreed to exclude Russian banks from the SWIFT communication network.

In a joint statement, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States committed to removing specific Russian banks from the SWIFT network.

“We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia’s invasion,” the statement proclaimed, “Russia’s war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War, which we are committed to defending. We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

“As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities,” the statement continued, “We are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies. We will implement these measures within the coming days.”

The Western leaders committed to:

“Ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system.”

“Imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions.”

“Acting against the people and entities who facilitate the war in Ukraine” and to “limit the sale of citizenship … that let wealthy Russians connected to the government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems.”

“Launching this coming week a transatlantic task force that will ensure the effective implementation of our financial sanctions by identifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned individuals and companies that exist within our jurisdictions.”

The Western leaders made clear that it would work with governments across the globe to “detect and disrupt the movement of ill-gotten gains” and would “deny” prominent Russian figures the ability to launder their wealth abroad.

By preventing Russia from utilizing the SWIFT communication network, Western leaders will effectively isolate them and inhibit them from conducting trade with many of its largest trade partners. This move will also interfere with Russia’s ability to export natural gas and oil, which makes up more than half of the country’s GDP.

The statement ended with a declaration of solidarity with the Ukrainian people “in this dark hour” and affirmed that the West is prepared to launch stricter sanctions against Russia should it become necessary to do so.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-yet-another-trump-supporter-attacked-in-london-an-elderly-man-whos-shoved-to-the-ground-by-anti-trump-protesters,2022-02-26
Watch: White House boots media out of Oval Office without allowing U.S. journalists to ask questions,"As President Joe Biden met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday, White House aides abruptly kicked reporters out without allowing any American journalists to ask questions, prompting the editorial component of the U.S. press pool to lodge a complaint.

President Biden responded to questions from two reporters Johnson called on, and Johnson also made remarks after Biden's responses. But at one point, even as the British leader still seemed to be speaking, a clamor of voices pipes up.

Reporters were shooed out of the room, which did not sit well with American journalists.

Steve Herman of VOA tweeted: ""US @WhiteHouse press pool immediately protests Oval Office treatment. (This dispatch from radio pooler and @whca president @stevenportnoy.)""

Herman attached the dispatch, which he said was from White House Correspondents' Association President Steven Portnoy:

""The entire editorial component of the US pool went immediately into Jen Psaki's office to register a formal complaint that no American reporters were recognized for questions in the president's Oval Office, and that wranglers loudly shouted over the president as he seemed to give an answer to Ed O'Keefe's question about the situation at the Southern Border. Biden's answer could not be heard over the shouting. Psaki was unaware that the incident had occurred, and suggested that she was not in position to offer an immediate solution. Your pooler requested a press conference. Psaki suggested the president takes questions several times a week,"" the dispatch stated.

CBS News's Ed O'Keefe tweeted that he could not discern Biden's response to a question he asked as the media were being ushered out, but later noted that part of Biden's response had been determined.

""As we were leaving, I asked the president for his reaction to the situation on the southern border. Due to shouting by White House aides, the noise of everyone leaving, and the president wearing his mask, we could not make out his answer,"" CBS News's Ed O'Keefe tweeted. He later tweeted: ""UPDATE: We have played back the tape and part of the president's answer is decipherable. I asked for his response to the situation on the southern border and he says in part, ""Violence is not justified."" He is wearing a mask and there is shouting so nothing else is decipherable""

""A chaotic scene in the Oval Office today as Boris Johnson unexpectedly took questions from British reporters, and White House aides shouted over American reporters as we tried to ask Biden questions,"" tweeted Andrew Restuccia of the Wall Street Journal.

""UK PM Johnson called on 2 British reporters to ask questions during the Oval meeting today. Biden answered those Qs, but didn't call on any US reporters.

White protester nearly gets stomped during event. Black Lives Matter activist carries him to safety.,"A Black Lives Matter protester likely saved the life of a ""far-right protester"" during a recent demonstration in London.

What are the details?

Black Lives Matter activist Patrick Hutchinson shared a now-viral photo to his social media accounts, featuring him carrying a white man to safety following dangerous weekend protests in London.

In the photo, Hutchinson can be seen physically transporting a white man, who is clearly injured, in a fireman's carry away from a throng of demonstrators.

Hutchinson captioned the photo, ""We saved a life today.""

The BBC reported that Hutchinson was attending an anti-racism protest when he saw the man falling to the ground.



Hutchinson said that the situation was quickly deteriorating and he knew that it wouldn't ""end well"" for the man if he were swept off his feet. He moved quickly, ""scooped him up into a fireman's carry, and marched him out.""

He said that some demonstrators attempted to injure the white demonstrator on his way out of the crowd.

""I wasn't thinking,"" Hutchinson told the BBC. ""I was just thinking of a human being on the floor. I had no other thoughts in my mind apart from getting to safety.""

According to USA Today, the man — who remains unnamed at the time of this reporting — ""appears to have been part of a rival group of right-wing soccer hooligans who had congregated in Britain's capital."" The group was reportedly ""protecting historic statues in and around Parliament Square.""



Following the incident, Hutchinson took to social media, writing, ""It's not black v white it everyone v the racists! We had each other's back and protected those who needed us.""

Reuters also shared a snap of the viral chance encounter on Twitter, captioning it, ""A picture and its story: Black man carries suspected far-right protester to safety.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-boots-media-out-of-oval-office-without-allowing-u-s-journalists-ask-questions,2020-06-18
"As mutated COVID strains spread, WHO expert warns that this pandemic is 'not necessarily the big one'","Dr. Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization's emergencies program, said this week that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic — including two more easily transmissible strains of the deadly virus — is ""not necessarily the big one"" when considering possibly worse future pandemics.

The new variants are named B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 and, according to reports, could affect the current course of the pandemic.

What are the details?

According to Newsweek, Ryan said that the COVID-19 pandemic is just ""not necessarily the big one.""

While the COVID-19 pandemic is ""very severe,"" the worst may not yet have happened.

Ryan, who made the remarks during a Monday briefing, said, ""This pandemic has been very severe, has spread around the world extremely quickly, it has affected every corner of this planet. But this is not necessarily the big one.""

He added, ""This virus is very transmissible ... and it kills people and it has deprived so many people of loved ones. But its current case fatality is reasonably low in comparison to other emerging diseases. This is a wakeup call.""

Ryan pointed out that the planet is in a ""fragile"" state and the global society is becoming ""increasingly complex.""

""These threats will continue,"" he warned. ""If there's one thing we need to take from this pandemic with all of the tragedy and loss is that we need to get our act together, we need to get ready for something that may even be more severe in future. In this we must honor those we've lost by getting better at what we do every day.""

What else?

According to Newsweek, more than a dozen countries across the globe have reported COVID-19 cases caused by the new, concerning variants, including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

""Neither strain has been detected in the U.S., but last week the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the U.K. variant 'could already be in the United States without having been detected,'"" the outlet reported.

On Monday, Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, director of the Special Pathogens Unit at Boston Medical Center, told CNBC that the variant may only have been overlooked in the U.S. due to current testing capacity.

""To find that strain, what we need to do is to take a percentage of the samples that are diagnosed and do deep genetic analysis, and [in] the U.S., our capacity hasn't been spectacular,"" she explained, pointing to a CDC report from earlier in December.

""If the strain is here, we might just be missing it because the holes in our net are too wide,"" Bhadelia explained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-protester-black-lives-matter-activist,2020-12-29

The crowd applauded with some laughter peppered in.

Continuing on, a smiling Ferguson declared, ""I am not anti-white men; some of my favorite people — my dad's a white man!""

More laughter.

""But I do not want white men to exclusively dominate this or any other debate at this conference, and following on from my comrade in the chair this morning, I do wish to see the diversity of the hall reflected,"" he also said. ""I'm not putting anybody on the spot here, but if you want to speak do not be afraid to put your hand up. We want to hear from you; this is an inclusive conference.""

Woman sentenced to jail for false rape claims against 2 men,"Police in the U.K. launched 60 investigations into allegations that two men raped a British woman. However, now the woman who claimed to be a sexual assault victim is going to jail after the rape accusations turned out to be false, according to police.

Cathy Richardson, 35, filed criminal complaints against two men between January and May of last year. One of the men she accused of rape was arrested and underwent a forensic examination.

""One of the men even agreed to have a GPS tracking tag fitted to his ankle which would send an alarm to police if it was destroyed or taken off,"" the Essex Police Department stated. ""On a number of occasions, data from the tag was analyzed and showed he was not in the area when Richardson said the attack had taken place.""

Both men were able to provide evidence that they were not anywhere near the alleged crime scenes where Richardson claimed the sexual assaults took place.

Investigators analyzed surveillance camera video, mobile phone data, and information from automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras. Authorities came to the conclusion that the alleged assaults never occurred when and where Richardson claimed.

Richardson was arrested on May 28, 2021. She was charged with perverting the course of justice.

The Essex woman admitted to 10 counts of fabricating sexual assaults at Salisbury Crown Court on May 23, 2022.

Essex Police detective inspector James Holmes – who led the investigation – said, ""Whenever an allegation of rape or sexual assault comes to us, our starting point is to believe the person making that claim.""

""To begin with, Cathy Richardson’s claims were no different, and we carried out our inquiries with compassion and empathy,"" Holmes continued. ""However, it quickly became clear the allegations Richardson had made were not what they seemed. Her claims do a great disservice to victims of rape and sexual assault who need our help and support.""

Holmes noted that the rape allegations had a ""huge impact on the lives of the two men she had accused.""

“Her allegations led to a significant number of investigations which for our officers, taking up a huge number of time and resources which we would have preferred to have directed towards helping genuine victims who really do need us,"" he continued.

Holmes concluded that he hoped that the fake rape accusations do not hurt future sexual assault victims from coming forward to authorities.

""I want to reassure you that you will be believed, we will support you, and we will investigate what has happened,"" Holmes said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woke-uk-politician-white-men-dominate-event,2022-10-02
Woman falsely accuses taxi driver of rape. Now she’s serving 3 years in prison.,"A woman is serving a three-year prison sentence after wrongfully claiming that a taxi driver raped her.

What are the details?

Laura Hood, a 27-year-old British woman, said that a 29-year-old taxi driver raped her in the backseat of his cab during a 2017 incident after he purportedly took a detour during the ride.

After the alleged incident, Hood told her mother and police that taxi driver Haroon Yousaf sexually assaulted her. Police took the rape suspect into custody, and investigated Hood's claims. Yousaf willingly submitted a DNA sample to prove his innocence.

Officials found that Hood's story did not match up with the taxi cab's vehicle path data and that the driver took no detours while transporting Hood to her destination. Hood's description of the man's appearance also did not match.

Hood continued to insist that the driver raped her even after the case went to trial.

After Hood's claims were proven to be inaccurate, she wept and said she wished she could ""explain why something so clear in my head ... can't be true."" A court-appointed psychiatrist, however, said there was no viable reason why Hood would believe that she was raped.

A court found Hood guilty of perverting the course of justice in a June trial. She was sentenced on Aug. 1 to three years in prison.

Judge Julie Warburton said that Hood's patently false allegations ""strikes at the very heart of justice,"" according to the BBC.

""It has a tendency to damage the public perception of justice and can impact on the administration of justice in rape cases generally,"" Warburton added.

What did the taxi driver say?

Yousaf said that he is still suffering from the effects of the false accusation.

""It still affects me in my day-to-day life,"" he admitted. ""I don't know if I will ever come back fully from this. Before this incident, I was a strong person. However, I'm now negative and worry that things can go wrong. This is the most disgusting thing that anyone can be accused of. When I pick up single female passengers, I always worry that something could happen again.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-false-rape-claims-jail-crime,2019-08-07
Woman glues her breasts to the ground in one-woman protest against climate change,"A climate change activist glued her breasts to the street in front of London's Goldman Sachs on Fleet Street.

What are the details?

Climate change activists across London have been protesting going on two weeks, but one woman took her protest to the next level and glued her breasts to Fleet Street outside of Goldman Sachs.

The Sun reported that the woman — who was protesting with Extinction Rebellion — glued her top half to the road outside the global investment company Goldman Sachs.

Police arrived on the scene and surrounded the woman, removing her from the ground at one point. They erected screens to protect her modesty. Officers eventually led her away from the street.

What else?

The BBC reported that Extinction Rebellion's climate change protests have resulted in nearly 1,100 arrests.

The unnamed woman wasn't the only one gluing herself to curious places — authorities escorted seven people who'd glued themselves to one another and to a wall at the London Stock Exchange.

The protesters were wearing signs that complained of ""climate emergency"" and more.

One protester told the outlet that the demonstrators chose the London Stock Exchange because people inside are ""making millions, even billions, of pounds out of trading ecological destruction.""

In a statement, Extinction Rebellion said, ""We will leave the physical locations but a space for truth-telling has been opened up in the world. We know we have disrupted your lives. We do not do this lightly. We only do this because this is an emergency.""

Woman in danger of 'internal decapitation' fights for her life as her family rushes to raise money for her lifesaving surgery,"A British woman is trying to raise enough money to travel to the U.S. for what could very well be lifesaving treatment, the New York Post reported on Tuesday.

What are the details?

Rachel Pighillis, a 35-year-old woman from Worcestershire, was struck with a ceiling fan and ended up with a rare condition that doctors say could result in an internal decapitation.

Rachel and her family are now attempting to raise money to travel to a Long Island, New York, surgeon for a complicated procedure that will ideally stop that from happening.

The woman said that she suffered the injury while standing on her bed after moving into a new house in 2018.

The accident left Rachel with an atlantoaxial instability as well as a basilar invagination — a life-threatening condition, according to the report, in which her skull and brain have slipped into her spine. As a result, there is a bone protruding into her brain stem.

The Post added that Rachel can no longer turn her head at the wrong angle at a risk of her spine partially dislocating — an injury that could result in paralysis or internal decapitation.

Her husband, Guy, went into further detail of what happened after Rachel's accident on the family's GoFundMe page.

""In January 2020, Rachel underwent Occipital Spinal Fusion surgery in the UK,"" he wrote. ""Her skull was fixed to her spine with rods and screws, and a piece of bone from her skull and spine was removed to create more room for her brain.

""Sadly,"" Guy continued, ""this has not been the case, and we eventually learnt that Rachel’s surgery had failed.""

He pointed out that Rachel's brain stem function at this level could ""shut down completely at any time,"" which would lead to brain stem death.

""Rachel needs to undergo a combination of very complex brain and spinal surgeries in order to SAVE HER LIFE!"" he added. ""We have consulted many specialists worldwide, with no success until now, however Dr Paolo Bolognese, a specialist Neurosurgeon based in New York is willing and able to carry to out the necessary surgeries.""

"Woman stabs 'Baby Trump' blimp in the back during London protest, gets arrested","A woman stabbed a blimp made in the image of President Donald Trump as a baby with a sharp object that punctured the 20 ft. inflatable during a protest in London, England, as the president was visiting.

The attempted assassination of the blimp happened among the protest crowd behind the House of Commons.

A woman stabbed the baby in the back and she was immediately escorted away by police, according to ""babysitters,"" protesters who volunteered to guide and guard the blimp.

""A woman … punctured the mini Trump baby replica with a sharp object,"" said a spokesman for the Trump Baby group.

""It's not surprising that the far right would want to meet freedom of expression with violence,"" the statement claimed.

The woman was arrested for being in possession of a pointed or bladed article.

According to Mashable, the woman exclaimed, ""The president of the United States is the best president ever, shame on you!"" after stabbing the baby blimp.

""I think Donald Trump's balloon is not very well,"" she added later. ""I think it's going down rapidly for a reason.""

In scene reminiscent of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, the woman showed spectators her bloodied hands after the impudent act. She had nicked herself in the process of attacking the blimp.

Elsewhere during the protest a supporter of the president was hit with a milkshake as he argued and debated with anti-Trump protesters.

Woman who can smell Parkinson’s disease helps scientists develop test,"Scientists in the UK have developed a test to determine whether people have Parkinson’s disease — thanks to the help of a woman who can sniff out the disorder.

Joy Milne, a retired nurse from Scotland, knew her husband Les had Parkinson's over a decade before he was diagnosed when she identified a change in the way he smelled.

""He had this musty rather unpleasant smell especially round his shoulders and the back of his neck and his skin had definitely changed,"" Joy Milne said. ""I kept saying to him, you're not showering properly. And he became quite angry about it at first,"" she told Sky News.

Joy connected the smell to the disease after Les was diagnosed, and the couple met people at a Parkinson's support group who had the same smell, reports the BBC. According to the Daily Mail, she has been found to have hereditary hyperosmia – a heightened sensitivity to smells.

Now, academics at the University of Manchester — working with Joy — have made a breakthrough by developing a test that can identify people with Parkinson’s disease. The test uses a simple cotton swab run along the back of the neck. The researchers claim the test is 95% accurate under laboratory conditions.

By working with Joy, scientists found that sebum — an oily substance secreted from pores in the skin – contained ten compounds linked to Parkinson’s. They also discovered that the most accurate results came from sebum taken from the back of people’s necks and between their shoulder blades.

Dr. Perdita Barran, who led the research, said of Joy’s contribution, “If Joy didn’t exist, I don’t think any of this would have happened – not just because of her nose, but because of her persistence in thinking her ability could help people. I was skeptical at first, but she has been proven right.”

Dr. Barran believes the work done by her team could be transformative. ""At the moment we have developed it in a research lab and we are now working with colleagues in hospital analytical labs to transfer our test to them so that it can work within an NHS environment,"" Barran said. ""We are hoping within two years to be able to start to test people in the Manchester area.""

Les Milne, a retired doctor, died in 2015.

Joy said, “I promised my husband the night before he died that I would help with research on Parkinson’s until there is a test for this cruel disease. I feel lucky that I have this ability, to help people with early diagnosis.”

Currently, there is no cure and no definitive diagnostic test for Parkinson’s, considered the fastest-growing neurological condition in the world. Doctors diagnose patients by observing symptoms.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-stabs-trump-baby-blimp,2022-09-10
"Leftist woman who yelled 'Nazi scum!' at Trump supporter in London exits job, deletes social media accounts after backlash","A leftist woman who repeatedly screamed ""Nazi scum!"" at a supporter of President Donald Trump earlier this week amid protests over Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom bolted from a job connected to Great Britain's National Health Service and deleted all her social media accounts after backlash against her, the Daily Mail reported.

Tuesday's incident was caught on video and made big headlines.

At one point in the clip, the light-haired, completely livid female stood just inches from the man's face as she screamed ""Nazi scum!"" before someone in the surrounding mob lobbed a milkshake upon his head.

She seemed to enjoy his plight.

A longer video of the incident shows the Trump supporter debating with protesters while wearing a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat — the symbol of Trump's 2016 campaign that's become a lightning rodfor agrowing number of those on the left who say the MAGA hat is synonymous with racism, bigotry, and hatred.

That same video includes a brief interview with the woman in question who said she yelled at the Trump supporter because he's a ""f***ing Nazi"" and then refused further questioning because ""I don't need to hear from other white men, thank you very much.""

Content warning: Language

What else has been reported about the woman?

The Daily Mail identified the woman as 34-year-old Siobhan Prigent and said she apologized for her actions before deleting all her social media accounts.

""I am very sorry for my behavior today. I should have protested peacefully and I didn't, and I regret that,"" she posted on Twitter, the outlet said. ""I've let myself down and I do understand that fully. There are two sides to every story, but my actions were my own, and that's on me. Please leave my family and friends out of it.""

But the Daily Mail also reported that her apology came just hours after she tweeted an expletive-filled message about Trump supporters: ""The MAGA c**** get a police escort #NoThanksNazis #TogetherAgainstTrump #DumpTrump.""

The outlet said she couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday night but noted that she had described herself online as an ""intersectional feminist"" and a ""crazy cat lady"" with an interest in mental health.

The Daily Mail added that Prigent had a taxpayer-funded job providing clinical trial coordination at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust through her for-profit company VLEK Ltd.

But on Thursday, according to the outlet, a UCLH spokesman said Prigent ""has today informed us that she will no longer be working at UCLH because she does not want us or the NHS to suffer any more negative attention. She had been at UCLH for a week. As an NHS trust, we pride ourselves on treating our patients and colleagues with kindness and compassion in all that we do.""

A pair of petitions against Prigent attracted nearly 3,000 total signatures within a day, the Daily Mail said.

Anything else?

The outlet said the Trump supporter was led away by police for his own protection after the incident — but he later told the Daily Mail he was peacefully debating with ""moderate lefties"" and ""having a laugh with the majority of them"" before things got physical.

""We have to put forward how aggressive the left can be,"" the man, who didn't want to be identified, told the outlet in a video. ""It's not us. If they want to call me right wing because I'm supporting Trump, then I must be right wing, but I'm not a racist.""

He added that some of his family members and friends are people of color.

The Trump supporter also told the Daily Mail that protesters kicked him in the legs, attacked him with a banner, and went after his MAGA hat.

Woman with Down syndrome says she 'will keep on fighting' after losing case challenging UK abortion law,"Heidi Crowter, a 26-year-old woman with Down syndrome, and two other individuals were dealt a blow when judges in the U.K. dismissed their case challenging a law which permits abortion of children with Down syndrome up until birth.

Maire Lea-Wilson, who is a 33-year-old mother who has a child with Down syndrome, Crowter, and a child with Down syndrome took the Department of Health and Social Care to court, contending that a portion of the Abortion Act is discriminatory and breaches the European Convention on Human Rights, according to the Associated Press.



While abortions in England, Wales, and Scotland are permitted up until 24 weeks, the law provides that abortions are permitted until birth if there is ""substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped."" The BBC noted that this includes Down syndrome.

But despite the decision, Crowter is not giving up, and says she ""will keep on fighting.""

The BBC reported that Lea-Wilson said she will also appeal. She noted that she has two sons and believes the ruling ""effectively says that my two sons are not viewed as equals in the eyes of the law,"" according to the outlet.

""Equality should be for everyone regardless of the number of chromosomes they have,"" she said.

Lawyer Paul Conrathe, who is with the firm that is representing the the three claimants, described the decision as ""out of step with modern attitudes to disability,"" according to the AP.

""By allowing babies with (Down) syndrome to be aborted up to birth, unlike neurotypical babies, the law sends a powerful message that the lives of people with (Down) syndrome are of lesser value,"" he said, according to the AP.

Study claims working from home can lead to increase in racism and prejudice,"As the coronavirus spreads throughout the world and many have been forced to transition from working in offices to working from home, a new study claims that working from home actually can lead to an increase in racism and prejudice, BBC News reported.

What are the details?

The study — conducted by polling company Survation for the Woolf Institute, which researches interfaith relations — surveyed 11,701 people in England and Wales last year, the outlet said.

Institute founder Ed Kessler told BBC News that as more people work from home, they risk going ""back into isolated silos,"" and he added that offices and workplaces are ""vital"" for improving community relations.

The study suggests that of those who work in shared offices, three-quarters (76%) — regardless of ethnicity — were in an ethnically diverse setting, the outlet said, adding that unemployed people are 37% more likely to only have friends from their own ethnic group.

In addition, the study warns that without the establishment of alternative settings to offices, opportunities for social mixing between different religious and ethnic groups will be greatly reduced, BBC News said.

The study also examined opinions on diversity, the outlet said:

While nearly three-quarters of non-black or non-Asian respondents were comfortable with a close relative marrying a black or Asian person (74% and 70%), fewer than half (44%) said they were comfortable with the idea of a close relative marrying a Muslim person, BBC News noted.

The report also indicates a majority of Muslims were uncomfortable with a close relative marrying a Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish, or Sikh person — or someone of no religion. Around a third of Muslim respondents (38%) said they were uncomfortable with a close relative marrying a Christian person, the outlet said.

""Muslims were both the primary target for 'uncomfortable' responses, but also the primary source,"" the report said, BBC News noted. In other words, the study indicated Muslims are the most likely group to hold negative attitudes towards people of other religions as well as the most likely target of such attitudes, the outlet added.

Is there hope?

Hadiya Masieh, who is Muslim, became close friends with Samuel Rosengard, an Orthodox Jew, after working together, BBC News said.

Rosengard told the outlet that while he'd never held racist or Islamophobic views, he may have had ""misconceptions"" about Muslim communities.

""Meeting Hadiya has really helped clarify where my thinking can be askew,"" he noted to BBC News.

Masieh agreed, telling the outlet that for her ""it was more of a political thing about Israel and Palestine,""

But working together has led to a close friendship, BBC News noted.

""It was just a very natural relationship that we formed because we had the exact same agenda and passions,"" she told the outlet. ""We were both from very different backgrounds, and the idea of Israel and Palestine was a hot topic. But we were able to discuss that in a way that was understanding of each other.""

Rosengard added to BBC News, ""Before COVID we would have regular discussions about these kinds of issues. And also identifying common cultural traits between Jewish and Muslim communities and areas of agreement and disagreement. Hadiya and I would often start off conversations just bumping into each other in the open plan office and then head off for a coffee. But that just doesn't happen. So that is a loss.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-with-down-syndrome-uk-abortion-law,2020-11-18
'Wrongful conception': UK woman with spina bifida wins case against physician claiming she shouldn't have been born,"A United Kingdom woman who's been debilitated with spina bifida all her life won a case Wednesday against her mother's physician claiming ""wrongful conception"" — meaning she would not have been born had the doctor given her mother proper medical advice, the Sun reported.

What are the details?

Evie Toombes (20) took Dr. Philip Mitchell to court over his alleged failure to tell her mother to take folic acid prior to pregnancy to minimize the risk of a baby developing spina bifida, the paper said.

Toombes' mother Caroline, now 50, claimed that while Mitchell discussed folic acid during her February 2001 appointment, its importance in preventing spina bifida was not discussed, the Sun reported.

Caroline added that Mitchell instead told her to go home, have “lots of sex,” and added that folic acid supplements were ""not necessary. I was advised that if I had a good diet previously, I would not have to take folic acid,"" the paper said.

After her birth in November 2001, Evie Toombes was diagnosed with a lipomyelomeningocele, a neural tube defect of the spine leading to permanent disability, the Sun said.

The plaintiff's argument was that had the doctor informed Toombes' mother of the importance of taking folic acid, she would have delayed pregnancy until after taking a course of folic acid, and then she would have attempted to conceive, the paper said.

Attorney Susan Rodway argued that Toombes was a victim of a ""wrongful conception"" that resulted in her being ""born in a damaged state,"" the Sun said.

But a delay in the pregnancy of Toombes' mother would have resulted in a ""genetically different person"" from Evie Tombes, Rodway also argued, the paper reported.

With that, the judge awarded Toombes the right to receive monetary compensation, the Sun said, adding that Toombes' attorneys said it probably would be ""big"" since it would cover expenses related to care that she'll require throughout her life.

Toombes' mobility was said to be ""very limited,"" the paper said, adding that she suffers from bowel and bladder issues, and will depend more and more on a wheelchair as she grows older.

Still, Toombes also has an equestrian career in spite of her physical limitations, the Sun added.

Anything else?

Mitchell's attorney denied liability and argued that Toombes' mother may have been pregnant already while consulting with the doctor, the paper said, adding that his client insisted he gave ""reasonable advice"" about folic acid supplements — and that Mitchell's typical suggestion was that those wanting to become pregnant should take 400 micrograms of folic acid all through the first trimester.

The doctor also denied telling Toombes' mother to not take folic acid, the Sun said.

But in London's High Court, Judge Rosalind Coe ruled against the doctor, the paper said:

In the circumstances I find that Mrs. Toombes was not pregnant at the time of the consultation with Dr. Mitchell. She was not advised in accordance with the guidance to take folic acid prior to conception and for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. She was not advised about the relationship between folic acid supplementation and the prevention of spina bifida/neural tube defects. Had she been provided with the correct recommended advice, she would have delayed attempts to conceive. In the circumstances, there would have been a later conception, which would have resulted in a normal healthy child. I therefore find that the claimant’s claim succeeds on liability.

The Sun said the case will return to court to determine the full amount of Toombes' compensation unless the parties agree outside of court.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/working-from-home-racism-prejudice,2021-12-02
"YouTube and Netflix slash video quality in UK, EU amid coronavirus outbreak","YouTube and Netflix will temporarily reduce video quality in the United Kingdom and European Union amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

The move is said to prevent users from overwhelming the internet with streaming requests and will run for at least 30 days, according to Newsweek.

What are the details?

On Friday, YouTube — which is owned by Google — announced that the decision was made to ensure ""smooth functioning of the internet"" during a time of worldwide crisis.

The move will also free up internet bandwidth for employees telecommuting to their places of employment.

A spokesperson for the company told Newsweek, ""While we have seen only a few usage peaks, we have measures in place to automatically adjust our system to use less network capacity.""

""Following the meeting by Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, YouTube's CEO, Susan Wojcicki, and [E.U.] Commissioner [Theirry] Breton, we are making a commitment to temporarily default all traffic in the EU to Standard Definition,"" the spokesperson added. ""We will continue working with member state governments and network operators to minimize stress on the system, while also delivering a good user experience.""

Netflix issued similar directives in the area on Thursday.

In a statement, the company said, ""We estimate this will reduce Netflix traffic on European networks by around 25 percent while also ensuring a good quality service for our members.""

What else?

Breton hailed the move in a statement.

""Millions of Europeans are adapting to social distancing measures thanks to digital platforms, helping them to telework, e-learn, and entertain themselves,"" he said. ""I warmly welcome the initiative that Google has taken to preserve the smooth functioning of the internet during the COVID-19 crisis by having YouTube switch all E.U. traffic to Standard Definition by default. ...

YouTube censors DeSantis COVID-19 roundtable challenging lockdown consensus,"YouTube has removed a video of a public health roundtable hosted by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) with a panel of scientists and researchers who challenged the effectiveness of COVID-19 lockdowns and masks, claiming the discussion violated its Community Guidelines.

The roundtable, which took place at the state Capitol on March 18 and was streamed and posted to YouTube by WTSP-TV, featured former Trump White House coronavirus adviser Dr. Scott Atlas, epidemiologist Professor Sunetra Gupta, and researchers Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and Dr. Martin Kulldorff.

The scientists and researchers discussed how public policy measures adopted during the pandemic to mitigate spread of the virus, including quarantining healthy people, shutting businesses down, and mandating mask-wearing, were inspired in part by fear rather than by scientific evidence.

Dr. Bhattacharya called lockdowns ""the single biggest public health mistake in history"" and argued they failed to protect vulnerable populations like senior citizens from contracting COVID-19. The panel discussed evidence that contradicted some studies that suggest lockdowns may have saved millions of lives globally.

The experts also disputed the effectiveness of mask-wearing, offering various opinions that differed from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for preventing spread of COVID-19.

Jeffrey A. Tucker, writing for the American Institute for Economic Research, was the first to notice that YouTube had removed the video.

""With no warning, no announcement, and no explanation, YouTube on April 7, 2021, suddenly deleted the entire video from its platform,"" Tucker wrote Wednesday. ""Once hosted by WTSP Tampa Bay, an NBC affiliate, it originally appeared as embedded in a story on WTSP.com.""

""AIER embedded that same video on our story about the event, along with the first and still the only full transcript of the event. In the late afternoon, the video appeared completely blanked out,"" he reported.

Tucker harshly criticized YouTube's actions.

""When the CDC and WHO began to contradict themselves on many issues, among which included immunities and their source, YouTube took a different direction, curating the 'science' themselves and deleting any video that its employees didn't like,"" he wrote.

""This policy has now run afoul of the basic needs of public health messaging, science, and sound policy decision making, even to the point of removing a serious forum of a popular government along with his scientific advisors from Harvard, Stanford, and Oxford universities.""

YouTube's Community Guidelines state the platform ""doesn't allow content about COVID-19 that poses a serious risk of egregious harm.""

The website bans ""content that spreads medical misinformation that contradicts local health authorities' or the World Health Organization's (WHO) medical information about COVID-19."" Such content may be related to treatment, prevention, diagnosis, transmission, social distancing and quarantine guidelines, or the existence of COVID-19.

Reached for comment, YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez said the video was removed ""because it included content that contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities regarding the efficacy of masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.""

""We allow videos that otherwise violate our policies to remain on the platform if they contain sufficient educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic context. Our policies apply to everyone, and focus on content regardless of the speaker or channel,"" Hernandez added.

YouTube cited examples from the video that violated its Community Guidelines, including comments from Drs. Kulldorff, Bhattacharya, and Atlas about how children do not need to wear masks in school.

""I think it is developmentally inappropriate and it just doesn't help on the disease spread,"" said Dr. Bhattacharya. ""I think it's absolutely not the right thing to do ... I think is a little bit clearer because we've had a year of experience. If we went back a year, a lot of the experts would say that wearing masks for the general public is not evidence-based.""

Dr. Atlas added later, ""There's no scientific rationale or logic to have children wear masks in schools.""

The YouTube spokesperson did not clarify if other videos of the March 18 roundtable, such as this one posted by NBC 6 South Florida, will also be removed.



TheBlaze also reached out to WTSP-TV and Governor Ron DeSantis' office with requests for comment.

Former Iranian state TV anchor: ‘Forgive me for the last 13 years I told you lies’,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can sign up for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.



On Monday, The Guardian reported that multiple Iranian state TV news anchors have quit in the fallout of the downing of the Ukrainian jet. Another, Gelare Jabbari, quit earlier but took to Instagram to apologize for telling lies.

The Guardian wrote:

At least two presenters working for the Iranian state broadcaster IRIB have announced they have quit their jobs, with a third saying she quit some time ago after having told lies on behalf of the state for 13 years.



Gelare Jabbari apologised in an Instagram post, writing: ""It was very hard for me to believe that our people have been killed. Forgive me that I got to know this late. And forgive me for the 13 years I told you lies.""

The American media continue to blame President Trump for Iran's shooting down of the Ukrainian jetliner that killed 176 people, on the day Iran retaliated for the United States' killing of terrorist mastermind Qassem Soleimani. Given their logic, will they also give him credit for the door opening to freedom for the Iranian people?

Since the downing of the airliner, Iranian students have taken to the streets, TV anchors have resigned, and support for the exiled crown prince of Iran has been heard, among other things. It's almost as if the appeasement of the Obama administration doused the flames of freedom.

Perhaps this action by Iranian state TV anchors could result in American media types engaging in self-reflection and apologizing for the lies they've consistently told for years. Don't hold your breath.

WTF MSM!? YouTube demonetizes Crowder's channel as the NY Times casually compares him to neo-Nazis,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can signup for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

This is by design …

On Wednesday morning, YouTube announced, according to the New York Times, that it will ""remove thousands of videos and channels that advocate for neo-Nazism, white supremacy and other bigoted ideologies."" Rather than sticking to the straight news of the announcement, the NY Times went and lumped BlazeTV host Steven Crowder in with the neo-Nazi promoters of hate.



On Wednesday afternoon, YouTube went ahead and demonetized Crowder's entire channel, saying a ""pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community."" This is a reference to a February 2018 blog post on YouTube's creator blog. The ""harm"" Crowder seems to have done is having a different opinion than people like Vox writer Carlos Maza, who asked YouTube to investigate him.



This is what the New York Times and Vox wanted: To sideline Crowder and to destroy his life and livelihood. This is what the media is.



Here's the Times' take and background on Maza's activism.

The tension was evident on Tuesday, when YouTube said that a prominent right-wing creator who used racial language and homophobic slurs to harass a journalist in videos on YouTube did not violate its policies. The decision set off a firestorm online, including accusations that YouTube was giving a free pass to some of its popular creators.



In the videos, that creator, Steven Crowder, a conservative commentator with nearly four million YouTube subscribers, repeatedly insulted Carlos Maza, a journalist from Vox. Mr. Crowder used slurs about Mr. Maza's Cuban-American ethnicity and sexual orientation. Mr. Crowder said that his comments were harmless, and YouTube determined they did not break its rules.

The Times, Vox, and other leftists actually think that Crowder's comedy content is the equivalent to rhetoric spewed by violent, repugnant neo-Nazis, and they unashamedly make the false equivalency. In August 2017, Crowder talked about people, like those at the Times, who equate people they don't like with Nazis. Here's his video, ""The Little Boy Who Cried 'Nazi'!"" Now Crowder is warning that while his channel may be the first to lose monetization, it won't be the last.



The Times, Vox, and other leftists wade into dangerous waters with comparisons like this. When you paint your opponents as repugnant people, some guy may be reading, watching, or listening, and he might just drive to a baseball field to exact revenge.



Steven Crowder hosts ""Louder with Crowder"" on BlazeTV, which is owned by Blaze Media.

The truth is …

On Tuesday, Florida officials announced the arrest of Scot Peterson, the deputy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who failed to confront the gunman at the school in February 2018. He faces 11 criminal charges stemming from his inaction. New York Magazine writer Yashar Ali noticed an old tweet from CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza that ""didn't age well.""

The tweet was a share of Cillizza's story titled, ""Here's definitive proof that a good guy with a gun doesn't always stop a bad guy with a gun."" Cillizza used the article to argue that because Peterson did not act that day, that disproves that more good people with guns won't stop tragedy. His original version of the story erroneously claimed that Peterson was inside the school when shots were fired and ran outside. That was not the case.

Ali is correct in noting that after the arrest, Cillizza's tweet looks even worse. Someone who neglected to do his duty is not a ""good guy"" with a gun. He's someone who, according to Florida prosecutors, acted criminally.

But it's not just old tweets from CNN staffers that should be in question. On Tuesday night, CNN's Chris Cuomo, in his nightly segment with Don Lemon, said ""only in America do you respond to something like this this way."" He added that it ""messes with my head from a policy perspective"" that Peterson is facing charges.

As Twitchy notes, the other way we dealt with the shooting is that the shooter has been apprehended and arrested by other law enforcement officers who did not neglect their duties.

CNN has been pushing its agenda since the shooting. Its town hall prominently featured disgraced Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, who has subsequently been removed from office for his actions surrounding the shooting.

To CNN it's all about pushing a leftist narrative, never simply reporting on the news.

WTF MSM!? Daily Beast doxxes a President Trump supporter over viral Nancy Pelosi video,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can signup for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

Get him ...

On Saturday, the Daily Beast reported that it found the guy who had the temerity to upload a video of Nancy Pelosi to Facebook. The outlet then proceeded to doxx him by giving the President Donald Trump supporter's name, occupation, town, and criminal record for all the world to see. This is just the latest attempt by the media to intimidate Trump supporters by doxxing them.

The Daily Beast claims the man uploaded two videos. One was clipped, and the other was allegedly slowed down. It is the slowed-down video that the Daily Beast and others in the media relied on to justify the article.

The Daily Beast's editor-in-chief, Noah Shachtman, appeared on CNN media critic/cheerleader Brian Stelter's ""Reliable Sources"" program. Stelter fed him softball after softball and agreed with his arguments. At one point, Stelter tried to say that, because the man got about $1,000 in ad revenue from Facebook, there was a ""monetary motivation."" Shachtman said that no, the man actually likes Trump.

Big League Politics writes that the reporter who did the doxxing spent five years in jail and is a convicted felon. That didn't stop Facebook from working with him on this doxxing, according to the Daily Beast.

This whole affair is reminiscent of the time CNN sent a reporter to a elderly woman's house to put her on television for having the temerity to share a post about Trump on Facebook. This time, however, the target of the media's derision plans to sue.

There were some lefties who were also taken aback by this story. But for the majority of the left, you will toe its line or you will be outed for all the world to see.

Wild mischaracterization …

Another ""controversy"" raising its head over the weekend is over audio of Trump saying, ""No, I didn't know that she [Meghan Markle] was nasty."" And then Trump ""denying"" that he called Markle ""nasty."" As TheBlaze's Caleb Howe pointed out on Sunday, when you see the full context of the quote, it is obvious that Trump was saying Markle's comments toward him were ""nasty.""

But that didn't stop the media from full-bore attacking the president. And, of course, CNN was the worst offender in its mischaracterizations, selectively editing the clip.

This fit nicely into Stelter's obsession with Trump. Stelter noted in his Sunday email he wouldn't have mentioned it on his TV show ""until Trump tried gaslighting everyone."" He even said it was shades of George Orwell. The only people acting like George Orwell in this whole kerfuffle are CNN and other media outlets.

Not that great? …

Perfectly sums up the leftist viewpoint …

On the anniversary of the day the Continental Congress finally voted to sever ties with King George, the New York Times Opinion folks published a video downplaying American Exceptionalism. In the video, the narrator seeks to prove that far from being the ""greatest nation on Earth,"" it is just another borderline nation with dumb kids, fat adults, high poverty, and more. It's like a video essay version of lefty Twitter.

The sad part isn't that the Times published this video. The sad part is that a significant portion of the American public actually buys into these narratives. Sure, the narrator gives lip service to the things that make America great, but he focuses harshly on our negatives.

Case in point: He brings up freedom and focuses on people not exercising their freedom to vote. The left often thinks that everyone should vote. But in fact, our freedom to vote is also a freedom to not vote. This is especially interesting as he focuses on Australians exercising their ""freedom to vote"" at an 80 percent rate. Spoiler alert: It is against the law not to vote in Australia. That's not freedom; that's compulsion. The Aussies even call it ""compulsory voting.""

Also not focused on is America's freedom of speech because, of course, the left is trying its hardest to curtail it at every point. Some of the countries that the narrator cheers have horrible records on free speech, like the U.K., where you can go to jail for a social media post.

Does America have her problems? Yes. But every country does. Cherry-picking statistics to denigrate your nation on the anniversary of its birth is a very leftist thing to do.

The New York Times shows once again that it is a cesspool of America-denouncing leftist thought. Sorry, but America is the greatest country on Earth. That's why millions of people try to get here every year.

CNN host says Trump is right about asylum fraud …

CNN's Fareed Zakaria, no admirer of President Donald Trump, threw a truth grenade into the left-wing thought bubble over the weekend. He agreed with Trump and others that America's asylum system is broken and being abused.

The Washington Examiner reported that Zakaria said:

Given President Trump's mean-spirited and often bigoted attitudes on immigration, it pains me to say this, but he is right that the United States faces a crisis with its asylum system. Democrats might hope that the out of control situation at the southern border undermines Trump's image among his base as a tough guy who can tackle immigration. But they should be careful. It could actually work to the president's advantage.

Zakaria continued, ""The criteria for asylum need to be rewritten and substantially tightened. The number of courts and officials dealing with asylum must be massively expanded. People should not be able to use asylum claims as a way to work in America.""

That's not my colleague Daniel Horowitz speaking, surprising as it seems; that's a CNN host bravely telling the truth about the crisis at the southern border.

"Why everyone should root for the Buffalo Bills this Thanksgiving, the real ‘America’s Team’","The Dallas Cowboys, famously dubbed ""America's Team,"" have hosted a Thanksgiving Day game in Dallas every year since 1966, but this is the first time that they have hosted the Buffalo Bills.

As Americans all over the country loosen their belt buckles to aid digestion and relax from their feasting in front of the TV – instead of fawning over the Cowboys as is tradition on Turkey Day – they should consider rooting for a team that more accurately represents them: the Buffalo Bills.

Of course, I am aware that many reading this may know nothing more about the Bills than the fact that they famously lost four straight Super Bowls in the early 1990s, and I am also aware that in writing for a news organization based out of Dallas, this article may incite some displeasure.

But as a native of Buffalo, New York, allow me to properly introduce the Bills to you.

The Buffalo Bills are the real 'America's Team'

A now mostly downtrodden city filled with rundown and (usually) snow-covered factories, the Rust Belt city of Buffalo is in many ways a remnant of a bygone America.

But Buffalo was once a bustling town, the chosen endpoint of the famous Erie Canal opened in 1825 and a center for trade and commerce. In 1900, Buffalo was the eighth most populous city in the country and had more millionaires per capita than any other U.S. city.

Buffalo's shimmer has certainly faded since its heyday.

The Bills have a similar story.

Entering the American Football League in 1960, the Bills won back-to-back championships in 1964 and 1965. But, the success did not last. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, the Bills have failed to win a single league championship.

As mentioned above, what most sports fans, whether avid or casual, know about the Bills is their tragic four straight Super Bowl losses from 1990-1993.

But, the even more heartbreaking statistic for those growing up after the Super Bowl years (like me) is that since 1999 the Bills managed to reach the playoffs only once. During that span, they set a league record by missing the playoffs in 17 consecutive years.

Yet somehow, despite the Bills' lack of success and the league moving toward larger markets and broader audiences – Los Angeles recently adopting two teams and games being scheduled in Mexico and the UK – the team managed to remain in small market Buffalo.

In many ways, the Bills feel out of place in the modern NFL. The team – devoid of large contracts or any big-name players, and located in a small, often-forgotten Western New York town – could be considered a remnant of a bygone NFL.

A blue-collar representation of American hope and perseverance

Yet, lately, things have begun to change for the city and for the team.

Just as Buffalo, the city, is now enjoying a revival-of-sorts – rated America's Favorite City by Traveler + Leisure in 2016 – so is the football team.

In 2017, the Bills broke their 17-year playoff drought, removing the monkey from their back and shedding some of the league-wide ridicule.

Now, as the Bills head into Thanksgiving Day in 2019, they lay hold of the third-best record in the AFC at 8-3 and are poised to enter the postseason once again, led by quarterback Josh Allen, who has been overlooked and derided by NFL elites.

In light of all of this, the Buffalo Bills represent what is true of many Americans, who had nothing given to them but had to work hard and persevere to achieve their goals. The Bills are a blue-collar team in a blue-collar town that has persevered through heartbreak and trial time and time again.

The Bills don't get near the national recognition constantly heaped on the Dallas Cowboys. In fact, they are the only team scheduled with zero primetime games this year, compared to the Cowboys' tied-for-league-best 5 scheduled primetime games and traditionally league-topping overall media exposure.

Yet the lack of attention and the years of heartbreak have not defeated the Bills or their fans; they enjoy it.

It's this hardworking, never-quit, don't-need-to-be-loved, attitude that endears them to fans and makes them the real ""America's team.""

The greatest fans in the world

And did I mention that Buffalo Bills fans are the greatest in the world? Of course, this is a completely unscientific statement.

But it is true that one would be hard-pressed to find a fanbase that travels better than Bills fans, and it is also true that there is at least one Bills Backer Bar in nearly every major metropolitan area in the country.

""Bills Mafia"" as they are called, are known for their wild tailgating practices like getting drunk and jumping on burning tables and their passionate, even puzzling, commitment to the hometown team. Barstool Sports even made a documentary about them.

But that's just it. The puzzling commitment to the Bills is what's most impressive. Bills fans remain loyal despite the team rarely giving fans anything to be excited about.

In places like Boston and Dallas, fanhood might be considered somewhat conditional: more winning = more fans. In Buffalo, fanhood is unconditional. There are (quite literally) no fair weather fans and no bandwagon fans, just extremely loyal fans.

This, too, is redolent of many Americans, who are loyal to their country even when it is not especially loyal to them. They are thankful for their country, remembering the joys being an American affords.

Many Americans often demonstrate a resilient and undying hope, always believing the future is bright. Bills fans, in a much smaller way, steadfastly believe this about their football team.

""This is the year,"" Bills fans always say as the preseason begins.

Every year. Every heartbreaking year: ""This is the year.""

Oh, also, the Bills colors: red, white, and blue.

So, if you're looking for a team to root for while you watch football and digest this Thursday afternoon, root for the real ""America's Team,"" the Buffalo Bills.

Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. ET.",https://www.theblaze.com/newsletter_writeups/wtf-msm-new-york-times-celebrates-independence-day-by-taking-a-swipe-at-american-exceptionalism,2019-11-28

Click here for part 3 of this series: Cash, COVID, and cover-up, part 3: 'You will have tasks today that must be done'

In the classic short story ""The Adventure of Silver Blaze,"" Sir Arthur Conan Doyle once famously had Sherlock Holmes solve a case based on what might be called the absence of a key piece of evidence. And while Holmes' solution of the case might have been a bit of an unwarranted leap, sometimes the absence of evidence can be quite compelling, especially when it appears that evidence was likely destroyed. If a woman is found dead, and the next day her husband vanishes, leaving behind a house that has been scrubbed floor-to-ceiling with bleach, well ... it doesn't prove he murdered her, but pretty much everyone will have justified suspicions to that effect unless some compelling evidence surfaces to the contrary.

In examining whether the lab-leak theory is true or not, it is difficult to come to a hard and fast conclusion based on scientific evidence; however, that's not because the science is in some way necessarily unclear. That's because the Chinese government has gone to extraordinary lengths to destroy evidence and hamper any investigation into what happened at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China.

That transparently obvious effort to cover up the truth is, in and of itself, a compelling piece of evidence.

++++++++++

Many years ago, the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) was created as a collaboration between the National Institutes of Health's GenBank, the European Nucleotide Archive, and the DNA Databank of Japan. Information on the INSDC is available to the public as one of its foundational principles, which means that any person with access to the internet can find information about genetic sequences that have been uploaded to those databanks. In theory, this means virtually all genetic manipulations that have been the subject of any research project that has been published, since most scientific publications require genetic sequences to be deposited in the INSDC prior to publication.

The INSDC exists for several reasons, but one of the most important reasons is that if, say, an infectious disease pandemic breaks out somewhere in the world, scientists are supposed to be able to compare its genetic sequence to other known genetic sequences in order to quickly pinpoint the potential source of the virus; this information can help develop early treatments.

When the COVID-19 outbreak began, biologists began a similar search and did not find any likely candidates — until, that is, Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Institute of Virology conveniently uploaded the sequence of a virus she called RaTG13 into GenBank on Jan. 23, 2020, shortly after the pandemic entered the public consciousness. RaTG13, as the story went, was collected from a cave in Yunnan province in 2013, and its genetic sequence matched the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 by 96.3% — making it the first plausible natural ancestor to SARS-CoV-2.

The public opponents of the lab-leak theory latched on to RaTG13 as a savior. Here, at last, was a virus that had been found in the wild that was really quite close to SARS-CoV-2. The fact that it was miraculously unearthed just as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was gaining widespread global public attention in a laboratory that coincidentally was housed in the city where the pandemic began was apparently not a source of concern to these scientists. It was, for example, prominently referenced in what would become the seminal scientific article arguing for a natural origin of the pandemic, ""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2.""

The immediate question that arises, given this sequence of events, is why, if RaTG13 was collected in May 2013 (as Shi claims), was it not uploaded to GenBank until after a pandemic caused by a virus that was so closely related to it began? Well, that is because China does not participate in the INSDC. The WIV, China's first biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facility, decided to keep genetic sequences discovered and/or created in their lab in its own proprietary database.

Implausibly, the United States government appears to have been OK with this arrangement and even approved taxpayer funding of research conducted in China that contained no guarantee that the United States would be provided with the results of that research, including the genetic sequences of viruses being studied.

Allow that to sink in for a moment: Your tax dollars were used to conduct research in a foreign country, with the express understanding that the foreign country was not obligated to even share the results of that research with the United States government, much less its public.

Well, you might be thinking, what's so bad about allowing the Chinese government to maintain control over its own data? Surely we can just go to the WIV's database and perform an additional search there?

As you may have already guessed, we cannot. The reason: The Wuhan Institute of Virology took its entire database offline.

When, you might ask, did this event occur? In what is surely merely a spectacular coincidence, the WIV databases were pulled down on Sept. 12, 2019, which is probably a pretty good approximation of the actual date the first human was infected with SARS-CoV-2.

The Chinese government's official story is that the WIV databases were pulled down because they were under attack by hackers. This might have been a plausible story, had the databases been pulled down after the pandemic became public knowledge and internet sleuths began aggressively investigating the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It is not a plausible story for why the databases had to be pulled down in September 2019, before anyone in the world had even heard of COVID-19 and before there was virtually any internet interest in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

In a separate article published by researchers at the WIV, the WIV further claimed, perhaps by way of explanation as to why the genetic sequence of RaTG13 was unknown to the scientific community prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, that its scientists had never fully sequenced the virus before and only did so after the pandemic began, when they discovered that a ""short region of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13) — which was previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province — showed high sequence identity to 2019-nCoV."" According to the authors of this paper, who again worked at the WIV, at this point they finally ""carried out full-length sequencing on this RNA sample,"" whereupon it was uploaded to GenBank, thus showing that ""the close phylogenetic relationship to RaTG13 provides evidence that 2019-nCoV may have originated in bats.""

Normal people, possessed of even a moderately healthy sense of skepticism, would have looked at this chain of events and concluded that the Chinese government obviously had something to hide. EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak, on the other hand, who would repeatedly lambaste proponents of the lab-leak theory as crackpots and conspiracy theorists, apparently found nothing untoward in what was happening. In a London Times interview, he uncritically repeated Shi's assertion that RaTG13 had been discovered while Chinese researchers were exploring a cave where six miners had died in a now-abandoned mine in Tongguan, whereupon they threw it in a freezer and forgot about it until 2020.

The ""crackpots"" and ""conspiracy theorists"" would soon be vindicated in their suspicions about the miraculous and entirely-too-convenient ""discovery"" of the supposedly thrown-in-a-freezer-and-forgotten RaTG13.

In the first place, DRASTIC sleuths began to notice that the genetic sequence to RaTG13 shared a curious affinity — a 100% affinity, in fact — with a partially revealed genetic sequence from a virus that was then called BtCOV/4991. DRASTIC members noted that not only were the two viruses genetically identical in the brief strip of BtCOV/4991 that had been published, but also the purported collection details of the virus were exactly the same. Faced with a growing paper trail, Shi would finally publicly admit in July 2020 that they were the same virus.

This admission made the entire purported origin story of RaTG13 a lie.

BtCOV/4991 was not collected and then thrown in a freezer and forgotten. It was, in fact, studied extensively by researchers in China, and its discovery and study was discussed in a 2016 paper published by Shi and her colleagues. It was mentioned again in a separate 2019 paper published by Shi and colleagues. Further, during the course of her admission that BtCOV/4991 and RaTG13 were the same virus, Shi made another startling admission: RaTG13 had, in fact, been fully sequenced in 2018, which indicates clearly that a) not only was RaTG13 not thrown in a freezer and forgotten, it was still being actively researched by the Wuhan Institute of Virology five years after its discovery, and b) it was not, as Shi's colleagues had claimed, only fully sequenced after the pandemic began.

The official story of RaTG13 — that it was discovered in 2013 and then thrown in a freezer and forgotten until someone finally bothered to sequence it after the outbreak of COVID-19 — had now been exposed thoroughly as a lie, even by the concession of the people who originally made the claim. No one has yet been able to extract an answer from Shi or her colleagues as to why they falsely pretended that the full genetic sequence of RaTG13 was only discovered after the pandemic began, or why they pretended (by omission), for several months, that RaTG13 was a different virus from the BtCOV/4991 virus they had already extensively studied and written about.

Internet sleuths were quick to discover that many of the other claims made by Shi about RaTG13 were, at best, highly suspect. Recall that the specific event that precipitated the search of the Tongguan cave was that six miners who worked in the mine had died of a respiratory illness of uncertain etiology. Shi claimed in a March interview with Scientific American that the Tongguan miners had actually died due to a fungal infection they caught in the mine and that it was mere coincidence that during the exploration of the cave, they found RaTG13 — a clear attempt to downplay the lethality of RaTG13. However, DRASTIC member TheSeeker268 unearthed a master's thesis by Chinese doctor Dr. Li Xu of Kunming Medical University, which clearly stated that the miner deaths were ""caused by SARS-like CoV or bat SARS-like coronavirus that has been isolated from the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat."" The symptoms the miners died of were noted to be ""identical to what we now call Covid-19.""

Furthermore, TheSeeker268 unearthed a 2016 thesis ""written by Huang Canping, a student of Gao Fu, the current director of China CDC ... In addition to what was already known, this document clearly states that WIV had tested the four miners (two had died by then); and all four of them had tested positive for SARS-like antibodies.""

Which raises the obvious question: Why would Shi lie and say that miners who died in the cave where the closest natural ancestor to SARS-CoV-2 was discovered actually died of a fungal infection?

+++++++++++

In addition to scrubbing the record of all genetic sequences researched at the WIV, and in addition to the demonstrably false statements from WIV researchers about their discovery of RaTG13, the Chinese government was working overtime in the early days of the pandemic to ruthlessly suppress any information about the pandemic from reaching the general public.

Dr. Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist who first brought the attention of public awareness to the emerging pandemic, was pressured and threatened by Chinese authorities to recant his statement that the new coronavirus even existed and was infecting people. Li eventually allegedly caught COVID-19 himself and allegedly died from it in a Chinese hospital, despite his young age (34).

The Chinese government also engaged in a breathtaking campaign of internet and social media censorship designed to squash any internal debate — or even discussion — of the pandemic in China. The government campaign even reached into popular chatting app WeChat and livestreaming platform YY and included a shockingly broad list of terms, including, notably, a number of phrases that referenced the ""Wuhan lab.""

These efforts were wrapped into China's well-documented effort to censor and suppress negative coverage of its response to the pandemic as well — efforts that included the expulsion of American journalists and the disappearing of one of China's most prominent citizens.

The importance of the disappearance of Ren Zhiqiang cannot be overstated in this story. While most Americans have likely never heard of him, he was, before his untimely disappearance, one of China's most prominent private citizens, and he was involved in a very public criticism of China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Imagine if, say, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban suddenly vanished from the face of the earth without a trace during the middle of a Twitter spat with then-President Donald Trump in March 2020, and no government agency seemed particularly interested in finding him, and no one who mattered even asked pointed questions of government officials as to whether they were involved in his departure.

Almost no one believes that Ren is not either dead or imprisoned at the hands of the communist Chinese government at this point, and the Chinese government does not seem particularly interested in combating that perception publicly. Imagine the impression such an event would make upon the average Chinese citizen — or, for that matter, any researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who might feel tempted to contradict the government line about what happened in that laboratory.

++++++++++++

If the censorship campaign the Chinese government conducted against its own citizens was thorough, it was nothing compared to what the Chinese government would do to the international community. From the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, China lied, hid information, and stonewalled World Health Organization researchers as they attempted to learn about the virus.

Publicly, both sides acted as if everyone was getting along. Chinese authorities told WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a Jan. 25, 2020 letter they would welcome international experts to China to help ""strengthen epidemic prevention and control."" Tedros met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Jan. 28 and praised the Chinese for their openness and transparency. In reality, as the Associated Press would report, China frustrated WHO officials by delaying the release of information, and Tedros and others were only lauding China in public ""because they wanted to coax more information out of the government.""



In early January, three different Chinese labs had fully decoded the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, but instead of sharing that information with the world, China sat on it. The virus was first decoded on Jan. 2, but it wasn't until after the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese scientists had discovered a new coronavirus on Jan. 8, a week later, that Chinese state media announced the discovery of the new coronavirus. China did not include any information about its genome, diagnostic tests, or detailed patient data that would have given scientists a clue about how infectious the disease was.

There was also a two-week period when Chinese officials censored reports of new infections in Wuhan. Operating under the belief that infections weren't spreading, Chinese researchers, unaware of the censorship, told WHO officials that the virus didn't transmit easily between humans. This led the WHO on Jan. 5 to announce that based on preliminary data from China, there was no evidence of significant transmission between humans and no need for travelers to take precautions. Of course, once the genetic sequence of the virus was made public and it turned out the virus was highly contagious, the WHO was made to look ""doubly, incredibly stupid"" for downplaying the virus, in the words of Dr. Tom Grein, chief of the WHO's acute events management team.

Meanwhile, people began getting sick with COVID-19 throughout the region. When one woman fell ill in Thailand on Jan. 8, researchers attempted to match the virus to illnesses that had been reported in China, but the Chinese authorities hadn't yet published the viral sequences. China's obfuscation of data about COVID-19 prevented countries from taking steps to mitigate spread early in the pandemic, resulting in people getting sick and dying.

The SARS-CoV-2 sequence wasn't published until Jan. 11, when a team led by Chinese virologist Zhang Yongzhen angered Chinese authorities by uploading the virus to virological.org. The next day, Zhang's lab was temporarily shut down. But now that the viral sequence was out there, the Chinese CDC, Wuhan Institute of Virology, and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences each published their viral sequences for SARS-CoV-2 to GISAID, a platform for scientists to share data on viruses. The WHO's first investigative team arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 14. One of the team's tasks was to visit the Huanan Seafood Market, where scientists believed the virus' first major outbreak took place, but from the beginning there was uncertainty about where Chinese authorities would allow the researchers to go and who they would be permitted to talk to. China had strongly opposed an independent investigation that it could not fully control, and before the terms of the investigation were agreed to, the WHO complained that China was taking too long to finalize arrangements for the investigators.

But after senior WHO delegation met with Chinese officials in Beijing on Jan. 28, Tedros made no public mention of China's obstruction in the hope that the Chinese would be more forthcoming in the future. On Jan. 30, the WHO declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of global concern. In the following months, WHO researchers continued to work with Chinese and on March 11, 2020 WHO declared COVID-19 could be characterized as a pandemic.

In May, the 73rd World Health Assembly charged WHO Director-General Tedros to form an international investigative team ""to identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population."" But even the vote on this resolution was delayed as Chinese officials ""were negotiating over every comma,"" as one former U.S. official described to the Wall Street Journal.

Chinese officials continued to play hardball with the WHO until in July 2020 an agreement was reached for a ""terms and references"" document that stated the goals of the investigation, was silent on the lab-leak theory, and gave China veto power over who would be on the WHO team.

The WHO investigative commission that eventually formed was fatally flawed by the prominent inclusion of one Peter Daszak in its ranks.

Daszak, by way of reminder, had been literally the global and public ringleader of the group of scientists who had been publicly ridiculing lab-leak theory proponents and attempting to quash public discussion of their theory for over a year. He was also the president of an organization that had for years funneled significant amounts of money to the lab he was purporting to investigate and that had widely publicized its frequent collaboration with that lab — meaning that if the lab-leak theory were true, he would be one of the first people in the public hot seat.

Sending Daszak as part of the team was grossly inappropriate not only because of the obvious conflicts of interest he was subject to, but also because, even in the absence of those conflicts of interests, Daszak had publicly and loudly made up his mind about the subject of the investigation before it even began.

Daszak was, in fact, the only scientist from the United States who was part of the WHO's investigative team.

However, that did not stop the Chinese from stonewalling anyway. On Jan. 5 2021, some members of the Team began their journey to China, only for Chinese officials to deny the WHO team entry into the country for several days until Jan. 14.

After two weeks of quarantine, the WHO investigation proceeded under severe restrictions. According to the Wall Street Journal, the team was restricted to one part of their hotel by quarantine rules, forced to eat separately from their Chinese partners, and had limited contact with anyone outside the team. They proceeded to take a propaganda tour visiting the hospital where Beijing claims the first COVID-19 case was officially reported, another hospital where they visited an exhibition commemorating President Xi's leadership, and cold-storage facilities at the Huanan market where Chinese officials claim the virus entered China from abroad.

Accounts from team members reported by the Journal indicate Chinese authorities refused to share raw data with the investigators, instead handing over their own data analysis. Even the team's visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology was limited to only three hours.

Nevertheless, the WHO released a report in February 2021 that determined it was ""extremely unlikely"" that COVID-19 leaked from a lab, determining instead that the most likely origin of the virus was a zoonotic event — a bat virus transmitting to another animal carrier and then leaping to humans sometime toward the end of 2019. Part of the investigation included inspecting the Wuhan Institute of Virology's lab, under Chinese supervision, and WHO team leader Peter Ben Embarek said that the safety protocols at the lab led them to conclude ""it was very unlikely that anything could escape from such a place.""

But the WHO investigation has since been highly criticized. On March 2, 2021, two dozen experts, including virologists, signed an open letter that called for a new international investigation on the origins of COVID-19. They said that the WHO did not have the independence or access ""to carry out a full and unrestricted investigation"" into the lab-leak theory. During a ""60 Minutes"" interview in March, Jamie Metzl, an advisory board member for WHO and one of the letter's signatories, said the WHO team ""didn't demand access to the records and samples and key personnel"" while they visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He blamed China for denying the investigators access to those materials. Metzl further said that the WHO agreed to let China do the ""primary investigation"" into the origins of the virus and then share its findings with the team.

Daszak's inclusion on the team, in particular, led to entirely predictable results.

Speaking to ""60 Minutes,"" Daszak more or less confirmed that the WHO team's investigative process, when it came to the Wuhan lab, was to just ask the lab staff questions and take their answers at face value.

""We met with them,"" Daszak told Lesley Stahl. ""We said, 'Do you audit the lab?' And they said, 'Annually.' 'Did it you audit it after the outbreak?' 'Yes.' 'Was anything found?' 'No.' 'Do you test your staff?' 'Yes.' No one was —""

""But you're just taking their word for it,"" interjected Stahl.

""Well, what else can we do?"" Daszak replied.

Incredibly, he argued that the answers the WHO team received from China were ""correct and convincing,"" even though Chinese authorities had demonstrably worked to suppress information about the virus.

When Stahl pointed out how China had ""engaged in a cover-up,"" Daszak was dismissive.

""Well, that wasn't our task to find out if China had covered up the origin issue,"" he said.

That jaw-dropping assertion was certainly a surprise to the rest of the world, which was told by the WHO that that was exactly what the purpose of their investigation was, and to Daszak's fellow investigators, who were charged with going to China to ""better understand the origins of the virus,"" according to the terms of the report they prepared.

Only someone as thoroughly dedicated to the proposition that there was no chance China could have been in any way dishonest as Daszak could have concluded from such a charge that actually checking out any of the statements made by Chinese scientists was not part of the scope of work. It was as if, seeking to investigate the disappearances of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, the WHO had sent a spokesperson for O.J. Simpson as their lead investigator and was surprised to learn that he didn't feel like it was his job to question O.J.'s denials.

Governments weren't happy either. In a joint statement, the United States and 13 other countries raised concerns that China had refused to provide investigators with ""complete, original data and samples. Additionally, in apparent contradiction of his own organization's findings, WHO Director-General Tedros acknowledged on March 30 that ""all hypotheses remain on the table,"" as to the origins of the virus.

In remarks to WHO member states, Tedros said, ""Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions."" He called on China to be more forthcoming with data in the future.

China reacted by denying that it hid data from WHO investigators. It accused the West of politicizing the report. At the same time, the Chinese government has shared disinformation and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 being engineered as a bioweapon in the U.S. and brought to China by the U.S. military.

In July 2021, China rejected WHO requests for a renewed investigation in China, asserting that such investigations should be conducted elsewhere. Chinese authorities have also deflected responsibility for COVID-19 by claiming the virus was brought to China via frozen food packaging.

On July 22, Vice Health Minister of the National Health Commission Zeng Yixin slammed the door shut on a second investigation by denouncing the WHO's request as ""arrogant"" and ""shocking.""

""In some aspects, the WHO's plan for next phase of investigation of the coronavirus origin doesn't respect common sense, and it's against science. It's impossible for us to accept such a plan,"" said Yixin.

With official investigations now thoroughly blocked by China, independent investigations have proceeded but with extremely limited success. The medical journal The Lancet established an international task force to investigate the origins and spread of COVID-19 in November 2020. But the task force was led by Daszak, who in June 2021 was forced to recuse himself after his connections to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and potential conflicts of interest became widespread knowledge.

In June 2021, an American scientist discovered evidence that Chinese researchers deleted SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences from the National Institutes of Health's Sequence Read Archive (SRA). NIH later confirmed that after Chinese scientists submitted the data in March 2020, they were ""requested to be withdrawn"" three months later in June. On July 5, 2021, the missing viral sequences reappeared in a database controlled by Chinese authorities. Chinese authorities claimed that the viral sequences were removed and later reuploaded elsewhere to correct a copy-editing error.

The Chinese researchers have not explained why they didn't mention the copy-editing error when they requested that the NIH take down their sequences, nor why they waited for a year before uploading them to another database. The bottom line, as this episode demonstrated, is that any investigation into COVID-19's origins remains at the mercy of China's willingness to be open and transparent — which they are not.

+++++++

What, then, are we to make of the actual scientific evidence about what the virus looks like?

In the absence of being able to access honest records at the WIV, which will likely never happen, or thoroughly examine its lab personnel, which will also likely never happen, the honest answer is: not much.

Scientific opponents of the lab-leak theory have expended a tremendous amount of energy arguing that the genetic features of the virus are consistent with natural evolutionary mutations and that there are no sequences that evince evidence of being an obvious man-made creation. We cannot cast doubt on the veracity of those conclusions, but they are, essentially an argument against a straw man. Very few people have suggested that the virus was specifically engineered as a bioweapon, and even if it was engineered as a bioweapon, surely the Chinese would have taken care to make it look natural.

It ignores, furthermore, two facts that are central to the discussion of this issue.

First, the work undertaken at the WIV (that we know about) specifically involved the creation of chimeric viruses that were intended to mimic possible evolutionary processes. Recall what the ostensible purpose of gain-of-function research is, which is to develop treatments and/or vaccines for viruses that might occur naturally.

Members of the media, who relied on the group of scientists who confidently declared the lab-leak theory a baseless conspiracy theory (most of whom have now backtracked) have assumed that scientists are somehow able to determine that a virus is engineered merely by looking at its genetic structure, as if the process of creating a chimeric virus leaves behind some irrefutable fingerprint, and that in the absence of such a fingerprint, a virus is obviously naturally occurring. That is not how it works.

Although it would certainly be possible to engineer a virus that has characteristics that would be obviously artificial, It is also entirely possible — in fact, it is what people like Ralph Baric have spent the entirety of their professional lives learning to do — to artificially engineer a virus that looks for all the world like a virus that might have evolved naturally. Recall that a central purpose of the gain-of-function research community is to develop vaccines and/or treatments for diseases that don't yet exist but have a reasonable probability of someday existing in the future. One does not accomplish such a goal by generating viruses that could not possibly be produced by natural evolution.

Every virus created by Shi or Baric in a lab is one that, if you didn't have access to a research paper telling you they created it, you would look at and say, ""Well, this looks like a virus that might have arisen through natural evolutionary processes."" That is the entire point of what these researchers were doing. So pointing out that the viruses don't look obviously artificial, as has repeatedly been done, is no answer at all, and anyone who confidently tells you that they can tell a virus wasn't engineered just by looking at it is selling something. We have no way of knowing, as just one example, that RaTG13 itself was not engineered, except to take Shi's word for it about where she found it. We can't even verify that it hasn't been substantially modified since she found it, since the genetic records have been intentionally erased.

One thing that would help us definitively rule out the possibility of a lab leak would be the discovery of an intermediate host, either animal or human, but no such host has yet come forward. These hosts have been found with other respiratory outbreaks, but none have yet come forth for SARS-CoV-2, in spite of the fact that Chinese researchers have, as previously noted, been assiduously collecting and cataloguing samples from bats for years.

The initial prime suspect for intermediate host was the poor pangolin, a kind of anteater that is found in China, based upon the fact that the receptor binding motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV-2 bears striking similarities to SARS strains that have been found in pangolins. Additionally, pangolins were found to be infected with other coronaviruses that were reasonably similar to SARS-CoV-2; however, no pangolins have yet been found to be infected with a virus that could plausibly serve as the actual ancestor to SARS-CoV-2, even though early papers touting a natural origin for the virus heavily promoted the theory that pangolins had served as an intermediate host for the virus between bats and humans.

It also might have helped shed light on the situation if researchers had been permitted to investigate laboratory staff early on in the pandemic, but the Chinese government refused.

The fact of the matter is, as an international group of respected scientists recently wrote in The Lancet, ""There is so far no scientifically validated evidence that directly supports a natural origin.""

These scientists challenged the arguments put forward in the ""Proximal Origins"" letter and elsewhere that ruled out the possibility of the lab-leak theory by showing how proponents of the natural origins explanation fell for a logical fallacy (edited for readability):

The question of the proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2—ie, the final virus and host before passage to humans—was expressly addressed in only one highly cited opinion piece, which supports the natural origin hypothesis, but suffers from a logical fallacy: it opposes two hypotheses—laboratory engineering versus zoonosis—wrongly implying that there are no other possible scenarios.



The article then provides arguments against the laboratory engineering hypothesis, which are not conclusive for the following reasons. First, it assumes that the optimisation of the receptor binding domain for human ACE2 requires prior knowledge of the adaptive mutations, whereas selection in cell culture or animal models would lead to the same effect. Second, the absence of traces of reverse-engineering systems does not preclude genome editing, which is performed with so-called seamless techniques.



Finally, the absence of a previously known backbone is not a proof, since researchers can work for several years on viruses before publishing their full genome (this was the case for RaTG13, the closest known virus, which was collected in 2013 and published in 2020).



Based on these indirect and questionable arguments, the authors conclude in favour of a natural proximal origin. In the last part of the article, they briefly evoke selection during passage (ie, experiments aiming to test the capacity of a virus to infect cell cultures or model animals) and acknowledge the documented cases of laboratory escapes of SARS-CoV, but they dismiss this scenario, based on the argument that the strong similarity between receptor binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins provides a more parsimonious explanation of the specific mutations. However, the pangolin hypothesis has since been abandoned so the whole reasoning should be re-evaluated.

The main point they advance in their letter is that both the lab-leak and natural origins hypotheses remain viable, because we don't have all the evidence, and both should be encouraged as a matter of open and honest public debate.

All that having been said, there are features of SARS-CoV-2 that are, in fact, similar to chimeric viruses that have been created in a lab. DRASTIC member Yuri Deigin catalogued some of those similarities at great length in a fascinating Medium post in April 2020. Specifically, Deigin noted that the virus looked like a virus that was ""based on the ancestral bat strain RaTG13, in which the receptor binding motif (RBM) in its spike protein is replaced by the RBM from a pangolin strain, and in addition, a small but very special stretch of 4 amino acids is inserted, which creates a furin cleavage site that, as virologists have previously established, significantly expands the ""repertoire"" of the virus in terms of whose cells it can penetrate.""

Deigin, whose work is worth reading in full, was careful to emphasize that such a chimeric mutation could have occurred in nature. However, creating just such a kind of virus was also consistent with the exact sort of work Shi, with the help of Baric, had performed in the past:

Indeed, virologists, including the leader of coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Shi Zhengli, have done many similar things in the past — both replacing the RBM in one type of virus by an RBM from another, or adding a new furin site that can provide a species-specific coronavirus with an ability to start using the same receptor (e.g. ACE2) in other species. In fact, Shi Zhengli's group was creating chimeric constructs as far back as 2007 and as recently as 2017, when they created a whole of 8 new chimeric coronaviruses with various RBMs. In 2019 such work was in full swing, as WIV was part of a $3.7 million NIH grant titled Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence. Under its auspices, Shi Zhengli co-authored a 2019 paper that called for continued research into synthetic viruses and testing them in vitro and in vivo.

Further information that has come to light since Deigin's work has further solidified the fact that Shi, with the help of Daszak, Baric, and others, were seeking funding for the creation of a chimeric bat coronavirus that would behave in ways eerily similar to SARS-CoV-2. As we have reported previously, in 2018, Daszak's EcoHealth Alliance sought $14 million in funding from DARPA for a collaborative project between Baric, Shi, and others that would ""synthesize spike glycoproteins which bind to human cell receptors and insert them into SARSr-CoV backbones to assess whether they can cause SARS-like disease.""

Even more specifically, the project's goal stated that it intended to release ""enhanced airborne coronaviruses"" into Chinese bat populations in order to inoculate them against diseases that could spread to humans. Although DARPA ultimately refused to fund the proposed Daszak project, deeming it too risky, neither Daszak nor Baric returned a request for comment as to whether the research continued with alternate funding. Certainly, there is no way to determine whether Shi and her fellow WIV researchers undertook the project on their own and simply used funding from the Chinese government to do so. If they had, the end result of such a project would have looked a lot like SARS-CoV-2.

At the end of the day, it may now be impossible to scientifically prove the truth or falsity of the lab-leak theory. But that isn't by accident: It's because the Chinese government undertook an extensive, obvious, and thorough effort to destroy and restrict access to evidence that was necessary to conduct a full and thorough investigation. The conclusion you draw from that is, of course, up to you.

And if it is impossible to tell with any certainty now that the virus didn't escape from the WIV, it was definitely impossible to rule the possibility out with certainty in the early months of 2020.

Which raises the somewhat important question: Why did scientists like Peter Daszak, et al., pretend that it was?

"Commentary: Tommy Robinson wasn't 'convicted of journalism' — he was convicted of illegal immigration, assaulting a cop, and fraud. He is no hero.","Editorial note and apology: During the discussion below about Robinson's first arrest, the article correctly noted that Robinson was arrested and convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault with intent to resist arrest. The article stated, without sufficient factual backing, that the domestic argument that occasioned the police officer's intervention escalated to the point of being physical. A representative for Mr. Robinson reached out to TheBlaze and disputed this characterization, stating that the argument with his girlfriend was merely verbal, while it is admitted that Mr. Robinson struck an off-duty police officer who attempted to intervene. In the absence of any specific evidence to the contrary, it should not have been stated that Robinson struck his girlfriend. While researching this story, we focused on original source documents where available and contemporary reports when they were not. During the initial controversy over Robinson's previous incarceration for contempt, the British government refused to comment on Robinson's case, which erroneously led media reports to conclude that he had not in fact actually been transferred. It turns out that he was. It is true, however, that his team did wildly exaggerate the Muslim population in HMP Onley. We apologize for the error.



In England in October 2018, a 15-year-old Syrian refugee was attacked by his classmates. The boy — who was wearing a cast because, according to him, his wrist had been broken in a previous bullying incident — was dragged down to the ground by his neck while his attacker said, ""I'll drown you,"" and then attempted to waterboard him with a water bottle.

Previously, this same Syrian refugee's sister had attempted to commit suicide at school because of anti-Muslim taunting and assaults she received. The perpetrators in both cases were revealed to be avid fans of a man who has found himself in the news in the United States recently — a man named Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, whom you might know as Tommy Robinson.

Robinson quickly sprang to the defense of his 16-year-old fan who was accused of assaulting the boy. He interviewed the attacker, who claimed that the reason for the attack was that the Syrian refugee — who was Muslim — had bullied two non-Muslim schoolgirls and that the school authorities had refused to do anything about it.

Stop me when this begins to sound familiar.

Robinson even said he had proof: He provided a screenshot from a text conversation with another student's mother who claimed that her daughter had been bullied by the Syrian refugee. He also posted a photo that he claimed was from the school that purportedly showed that gangs of Muslim youth were beating up white children in England.

There was only one problem: The proof was all fake. The mother who was supposed to have texted Robinson about her daughter learned about the allegation and protested that she never made such statements to Robinson. Furthermore, the photo that purportedly showed gang violence at the school was actually ripped from a completely unrelated news article about a teenage cancer patient in Britain. Eventually, Robinson confessed that the image was fake and that the text message was not genuine, and then issued a bizarre, flippant apology in which he blamed the entire incident on having been faked out by liberals.

Convicted of journalism?

Robinson was sentenced to jail Thursday for contempt of court. His crime dates back to May 25, 2018, when he recorded a video of himself outside Leeds Crown Court, confronting defendants in a trial who had been accused of grooming underage girls for rape and trafficking in sexual slavery. The legal proceedings against him have been complex and convoluted, but the bottom line is that he now faces a prison sentence for contempt of court as a result of having violated a court order that prohibited his livestream.

Robinson is in the news now because he made his way onto the Alex Jones show to plead for asylum in the United States, and has received sympathetic coverage in some conservative circles after Donald Trump Jr. tweeted his support for Robinson's plea. Trump Jr.'s tweet at least suggests that the president is taking the plea seriously, or might soon.

Back to the video that started this whole incident. In the video, Robinson claimed that no one was taking these crimes seriously. The British government and the courts were conspiring to provide leniency to Muslim offenders to avoid seeming discriminatory, he said. Yet, the jury was about to resume deliberations about the fate of these Muslim men — who were eventually convicted of their crimes.

On the surface, Robinson's complaint might have seemed odd. After all, the event that attracted Robinson's attention was ... a criminal trial featuring these men, which means that police had arrested them, prosecutors had prosecuted them, and a jury was about to decide on lengthy prison sentences for them. Indeed, the trials Robinson protested would result in 16 men being sentenced to a combined total of 220 years. The story became a national news item in Britain because of the reporting of outlets like the BBC and Examiner Live, which publicized the story well before Robinson latched onto it as a cause celebre.



Additionally, Robinson's behavior was puzzling for another reason — he had been here before. He was found in contempt for doing this exact same thing in May 2017 (when he was again ""exposing"" a story that had been reported in the media) and he surely knew that what he was about to do will get him sent to prison.

The crimes being tried during the 2018 trial were first reported in March of 2017, with reports appearing in both the BBC and Examiner Live. According to Examiner Live, the West Yorkshire Police initially arrested 27 men on rape, trafficking, and child sex charges for offenses that occurred between 2004 and 2011 against victims as young as 11. Two women were charged with child neglect.

So, by the time Robinson was berating the defendants outside the Leeds Crown Court, the crimes of the so-called Huddersfield Grooming Gang had been public knowledge for more than a year — including extensive reporting by the BBC, which is literally funded by the British government.

If the British government was really trying to cover up these crimes, as Robinson has claimed to a credulous United States audience, then they might have made a smarter play than having their government-funded press organ repeatedly cover them.

Robinson's first contempt conviction was a result of a similar action on May 8, 2017, during which Robinson recorded video outside the Canterbury Crown Court during a trial for four rape suspects. The four men were convicted of gang-raping a 16-year-old girl who had come by their restaurant intoxicated.

Robinson was there to expose pedophiles, he claimed, and police were trying to stop him by ... enforcing clearly posted rules that attempting to record or photograph at the court may result in an arrest for contempt. During his sentencing, the judge reminded him that security had warned him of the potential violation.

The identities of the suspects had been published in various mainstream media outlets, such as the Daily Mail, in the days before Robinson's appearance at the courthouse, with the exception of a teenage suspect who, at the time, was believed to be a minor.

In both cases, according to families of the victims, local media reported on these crimes before Robinson ever got involved. They didn't need exposing. They were already in the news and on trial.

The U.K.'s strict contempt of court laws are not for the purpose of covering up crimes; they exist to preserve fair trials and prevent the outside influences from reaching juries. They are there, in other words, to make sure that criminals get punished rather than being let off after their lawyers argue that one of the jurors saw Robinson's inflammatory videos during deliberations.

Since Robinson has been banned from the major social media platforms, it's unclear when he began talking about these cases initially. However, it is clear that whatever Robinson was doing at Canterbury Crown Court and Leeds Crown Court on the days he committed contempt of court, he was not exposing any hidden crimes.

So what is he doing? And, why is he doing it?

To understand that, you have to understand where Tommy Robinson comes from.

Who is Tommy Robinson?

Before he was Tommy Robinson, he was Stephen Yaxley-Lennon of Luton, Bedfordshire. His biological father left the family when he was 2 years old, and his hyphenated last name stands as a symbol that he was raised by his mother and her second husband.

From a young age, Robinson had issues with Muslims. He has openly talked about getting into fights with Muslim gangs while in school and recalled wider conflicts between white students and Muslim students. The Muslim men at the school ""always seemed to be waiting for trouble,"" Robinson told the Telegraph.

Luton, an industrial town, had attracted a significant Muslim population from places such as Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Even after his school days, Robinson found himself clashing with Muslims at Luton Town Football Club matches, because the stadium was located in a Muslim part of town. It was during those fights, Robinson has said, that he learned ""you either back down or get your head kicked in.""

After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S. turned a bright spotlight on radical Islamic terror, Robinson founded a group called ""Ban the Luton Taliban"" after allegedly seeing Muslims recruit men to fight for the Taliban in Afghanistan.

In 2004, Robinson spent a year or so as a member of the overtly racist, anti-immigration, anti-Muslim British National Party. The party's constitution dictated that only whites could join, until 2010 when it was forced by legal pressure to amend its constitution to, at least in word, allow non-white members.

Some of the stated goals in the party's 2005 election manifesto included ""abolishing multiculturalism"" and a claim that ""multi-racialism"" is a ""recipe for disaster."" The party was especially preoccupied with reversing the ""Islamification"" of Britain.



Robinson has said he left the party due to its opposition to him having black friends. Still, even having left that party, Robinson didn't stray far from the driving belief that the No. 1 enemy of his country is Islam.

In 2009, when a Muslim group called Al Muhajiroun protested a homecoming parade for British soldiers who were returning from Afghanistan in Luton, Robinson led protests against them that resulted in the formation of the English Defense League, a rowdy, often violent anti-Muslim group that gained national attention.

It was at this point that the man who would become famous as Tommy Robinson — even though that was not his name and he had used numerous other aliases in the past — gained national attention. After years of conflict with Muslims and growing anti-Muslim perceptions, when Yaxley-Lennon took the mantle as de facto leader of the EDL, he adopted the pseudonym Tommy Robinson after the name of a local soccer hooligan firm. His battle against Islam made him a nationally — and eventually internationally — known figure.

Robinson quit the EDL in 2013, saying he was put off by the fact that neo-Nazis were growing in influence within the group, and because Robinson was internally questioning the effectiveness of combating radical Islam without the help of moderate Muslims.

During an interview with the Telegraph in 2013, while discussing his exit from the EDL, Robinson took an EDL wristband off his arm, tossed it to the reporter, and said, ""I don't want anyone else to represent me. I want to be representing myself.""

Robinson's long and repeated criminal history



Throughout his Luton upbringing and into adulthood, Robinson has had some serious run-ins with the law. In 2005, during a drunken argument with his girlfriend, Robinson used kicked an off-duty police officer attempted to intervene in the head.

The activist was ultimately convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault with intent to resist arrest against the, for which he received his first prison sentence. That conviction derailed what looked to be a promising potential career as an aircraft engineer.

If one is inclined to forgive Robinson for assaulting a cop during a domestic dispute with his girlfriend — a crime for which conservatives typically have little or no tolerance — the remainder of Robinson's rap sheet should be enough to convince even the casual observer that this incident was not merely a drunken mistake, but rather part of a pattern with a man who is repeatedly and flagrantly criminal — and in particular, a fraudster.

Some of Robinson's criminal activity can at least plausibly be excused by his allies as part of his, shall we say, vigorous activism. For instance, in 2010, Robinson was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer during clashes at a poppy burning protest. In 2011, he was again arrested and charged with assault for head-butting a man who verbally confronted him during the protest. Later in 2011, he was convicted of leading a riotous mob of soccer fans into a fight with fans of the rival team.

But quite apart from a criminal history that clearly suggests a man who is not in very good control of his temper, Robinson also has the criminal history of a man who is well-practiced — if perhaps not particularly skillful — at concocting elaborate frauds for his own enrichment.

For example, in 2013, Robinson was arrested and charged with using fraudulent documents to travel to the United States. In a bizarre incident, Robinson was literally jailed for having been an illegal immigrant to the United States after using a passport with the name ""Andrew McMaster"" to board a plane to the United States. Because of his lengthy criminal history, Robinson had been denied a visa, so he ""borrowed"" McMaster's to travel here.

Once he arrived at JFK airport in New York City, customs officials took his fingerprints and realized that they did not belong to Mr. McMaster. As they attempted to find him and conduct an interview about this discrepancy, Robinson somehow eluded ICE officials, left the airport, and entered the U.S. illegally. The following day, he returned to England using a passport with the name ""Paul Harris,"" one of several aliases Robinson has used.

If you are struggling to keep up with what you are supposed to call Tommy Robinson, you are not alone. As the judge at his trial remarked:

I am going to sentence you under the name of Stephen Lennon, although I suspect that is not actually your true name, in the sense that it is not the name that appears on your passport.



You knew perfectly well that you were not welcome in the United States. ... You knew that because you tried before and you had not got in, and you knew the reason for that — because, rightly or wrongly, the US authorities do not welcome people in their country who have convictions of the kind that you have.

The judge went on: ""What you did went absolutely to the heart of the immigration controls that the United States are entitled to have. It's not in any sense trivial.""

Robinson was ultimately sentenced to 10 months in prison.

If at this point you are still inclined to be sympathetic to Tommy Robinson, consider the level of sympathy that you would have for a person who had been charged and convicted with multiple assaults in Mexico and deliberately circumvented U.S. immigration law by using a fraudulent passport to enter the United States. Then ask yourself why anyone should feel differently about an illegal immigrant from the United Kingdom.

Almost immediately after his release, Robinson was back in court again, to once again plead guilty to criminal fraud. This time, there was no possible political motive for his fraud; rather, he merely attempted to hoodwink a bank into giving him a mortgage under fraudulent pretenses. In this case, Robinson admitted to conspiring with fraudulent mortgage broker Deborah Rothschild, who used fake pay slips and income statements in order to fraudulently obtain a £160,000 loan from a British bank.

All of which is to say, maybe the word of a person who is known to have used at least four different aliases and has multiple fraud convictions on his record perhaps should not have his word taken at face value.

Is he really a journalism martyr, or just self-profiting criminal?

All of which brings us to the reason that Robinson has become a cause celebre in the United States over the last week or so: his alleged work bringing to light certain instances of admittedly heinous sexual assaults in Britain.



These assaults, in some cases, actually happened. And if Robinson really is responsible for helping bring his perpetrators to justice, then he perhaps deserves credit for that in spite of his unsavory past. Robinson has been leaning on this angle for all he is worth, particularly with an audience in the U.S. that is blissfully ignorant of most of his colorful history and knows only that he is described by the media as ""far right."" In fact, during protests about his contempt conviction and sentencing, Robinson wore a T-shirt that was emblazoned ""Convicted of Journalism"" to drive the point home — and some figures on the American right have picked up his claim and repeated it.

But as with all things pertaining to Robinson, we must ask: Is he telling the truth? Is he actually responsible for shedding light on this situation? Have his efforts helped in this regard — or have they hurt?

It is again important to note here that Robinson was not breaking news about these horrible crimes. He was not the driving force behind these criminals being brought to justice. The crimes and charges had been reported, were being prosecuted, and Robinson's content served more to grow his personal anti-Muslim brand than they did to aid in justice.

By confronting the then-suspects outside of the courthouse to berate them on camera so that he could post the video on his own or his employer's website and social media pages, Robinson was simultaneously profiting himself while potentially jeopardizing the legal proceedings themselves.

Robinson's efforts during the course of the filming incident that landed him in contempt were not calculated to ensure that the heinous criminals in the Huddersfield Grooming Gang received justice. Tommy Robinson is a well known person in Great Britain. A live video stream hosted by Robinson was sure to be seen by tens of thousands of people, as the one that landed him in jail actually was.



At least one of those tens of thousands — perhaps hundreds of thousands — of people might be one of the jurors deciding on the fate of the men at trial.

And if one of those happened to see Robinson filming, spewing invective at the defendants as they entered and left the courtroom, the judge would have had no choice but to grant a mistrial. And all the hard work put in by the police, detectives, and prosecutors — you know, the people who were actually trying to get justice for the victims of the Huddersfield Grooming Gang — would have been thrown out the window.

And that is the reason that Tommy Robinson faces jail time today. Not because he was heroically trying to obtain justice for heinous acts of rape, but because he idiotically and recklessly almost stopped the government from obtaining justice for the victims in the interests of his own self-promotion. The idea that the government was or is trying to sweep the Huddersfield Gang's crimes under the carpet, when they actively prosecuted the offenders (and continued to do so in additional other trials after the one at issue concluded) simply beggars the imagination.

Why should he get asylum in the U.S.?

One final ludicrous claim of Robinson's does bear examination. Robinson claims that he needs asylum in the United States because if he goes to prison, he will be killed by gangs inside the prison. Somewhat more sensationally (and ludicrously), he claims that the actual government of the United Kingdom is trying to kill him.

If you've read this far into what is an admittedly lengthy piece, you will no doubt not be surprised to learn that when he says this, Robinson is full of crap. The truth is that the British government has actually taken absolutely extraordinary measures to protect his safety throughout the course of his numerous incarcerations. During the time he served his sentences for his immigration fraud and mortgage fraud convictions, he spent the entire sentence in protective custody because of the perceived danger to his life as a controversial public figure in Britain. The judge who sentenced him in the mortgage fraud case even specifically mentioned the expense of providing for Robinson's protection as a reason for not giving him a longer sentence.

It should be noted that Robinson and his camp have been caught flat out lying about the conditions of his imprisonment before. During the course of his prior incarceration for contempt, Robinson claimed through his representatives that he had been moved from a prison that was ""2 per cent Muslim"" to a prison that was ""71 per cent Muslim."" These claims were repeated uncritically by Alex Jones, the same conspiracy theorist to whom Robinson ran with his plea for asylum in the United States.

However, they were at best wild exaggerations. The prison he was transferred to (and ultimately, safely released from) had a Muslim population of 14 percent, which is substantially different from 71 per cent. In fact, no prison in the UK has anything close to a 71 percent Muslim population.

The facts are clear

Robinson is not being jailed for the crime of journalism, as he claims.

He is being jailed because he almost allowed men who committed heinous crimes to go free.

Furthermore, he is no hero, as he claims. He is a repeat criminal and a repeat fraud whose main interest throughout the course of his career has been his own self-aggrandizement by feeding off the fear and ignorance of others.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/cash-covid-and-coverup-part-4-the-virus-that-didn-t-bark,2019-07-12
Don't these false or misleading reports lack 'authoritative reporting'? Where's Twitter's ban-hammer?,"On Wednesday, the New York Post published an explosive report on emails the Post claims were obtained from a computer belonging to Hunter Biden. The emails appear to provide more details on Hunter Biden's ties to Ukrainian energy company Burisma and contradict claims from Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden that he never discussed his son's foreign business dealings.

Critical questions have been raised about the Bidens' ties to Ukraine and whether the Democratic candidate previously used his position as vice president to benefit his son financially.

The New York Post story quickly became controversial with many journalists disputing the details of the story and questioning the Post's sources. But outrage was triggered when social media platforms stepped in to prevent users from reading the story and drawing their own conclusions about the Post's reporting.



Facebook acted first, questioning the veracity of the Post's report and announcing that distribution of the story on its platform would be limited until an independent fact-checker finished reviewing the Post's work. Twitter acted next, initially giving some users a warning label stating ""headlines don't tell the full story.""

Then Twitter went further. Engaging in what the New York Post called ""extraordinary censorship measures,"" Twitter banned users from tweeting the story, from retweeting it, and even from sharing it in direct messages. The New York Post's Twitter account was locked and subsequently other prominent Twitter accounts that shared the story were locked as well, including the Donald Trump presidential campaign. Twitter also banned a follow-up report from the Post on emails relating to ""lucrative"" deals with China.

The explanations offered by Facebook and Twitter for their censorship claim that the platforms' policies are intended to prevent the spread of misleading or inaccurate information. Twitter in particular made the determination that the Post is not a source of ""authoritative reporting.""



""Given the lack of authoritative reporting on the origins of the materials included in the article, we're taking action to limit the spread of this information,"" a Twitter spokesperson told the Washington Examiner Wednesday.

In a statement published by Twitter, the company changed its story and said the ban was put in place because ""images contained in the articles include personal and private information — like email addresses and phone numbers — which violate our rules."" The images of emails published by the post contain unredacted email addresses. Additionally, Twitter views the emails reported by the post as ""violations of our Hacked Materials Policy.""

""Commentary on or discussion about hacked materials, such as articles that cover them but do not include or link to the materials themselves, aren't a violation of this policy,"" Twitter said. ""Our policy only covers links to or images of hacked material themselves."" The company explained that this policy, created in 2018, ""prohibits the use of our service to distribute content obtained without authorization.""

This public statement made no reference to Twitter's original rationale for suppressing the New York Post story: That it lacked ""authoritative reporting.""

How does Twitter determine what constitutes ""authoritative reporting?"" The standard clearly isn't suppressing misleading or inaccurate information. If that were the case, why were the following stories were never censored by Twitter?

A February 2017 story from the New York Times alleging that the Trump campaign had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence was riddled with ""misleading and inaccurate"" information, FBI notes revealed. The story was based on unsubstantiated claims from anonymous sources and was never updated to reflect how it became discredited.

CNN claimed in June 2017 that then-FBI Director James Comey would, in congressional testimony under oath, dispute a claim made by President Trump that the FBI director had assured the president he wasn't under investigation. Comey did not dispute the president in his testimony and CNN was forced to issue a correction to its story.

The New York Daily News in 2018 published a report claiming the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter was ""trained by the NRA."" In reality, the National Rifle Association had absolutely nothing to do with the shooting.

After the Parkland shooting, CNN misleadingly claimed in a graphic posted on Twitter that 22 ""school shootings"" had already occurred that year. The inaccurate number was inflated by including accidental discharges of firearms on school campuses, gang violence, domestic violence, and university shootings and incidents that did not even include pupils.

Remember the massive Cambridge Analytica scandal covered in-depth in by CNN and others in 2018? The UK investigation into digital marketing firm found that allegations of colluding with Russia to influence the results of the Brexit referendum and break U.S. campaign laws were unfounded.

The New York Post's Sohrab Ahmari highlights how the Mueller Report's release in April 2019 debunked several media narratives that were shared on social media without censorship, including reports that Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort met with WikiLeaks' Julian Assange at Ecuador's embassy in London; that Jeff Sessions lied when he said he didn't meet the Russian ambassador as a Trump surrogate; that Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to meet with Kremlin officials; that Trump ordered Cohen to lie to Congress; and, of course, the salacious and allegations from the Steele Dossier. All inaccurate or false stories.

In 2019, CNN, the Washington Post, and other outlets pushed a false narrative that high school student Nicholas Sandmann had provoked an encounter with Native American activist Nathan Phillips in Washington, D.C., near the Lincoln Memorial. The media claimed that Sandmann and others taunted Phillips, claims which viral video showed were false. The Post and CNN went on to settle million-dollar defamation lawsuits brought by Sandmann.

In September 2019, the New York Times published a smear of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The Times wrote about a previously unreported sexual misconduct allegation against Kavanaugh from his undergraduate days at Yale, but failed to mention that the supposed victim did not recall the alleged incident.

In January this year, MSNBC host Al Sharpton repeated claims from a discredited study suggesting that there was an increase in hate crimes in counties that held Trump rallies.

In April 2020, Politico issued a lengthy correction and apology for falsely claiming that President Trump owed ""tens of millions"" to the Bank of China. Tweets propagating the original false story remain undeleted.

In September 2020, The Atlantic published claims from four anonymous sources that President Trump referred to a cemetery for fallen WWI soldiers as ""filled with losers."" Over 20 witnesses went on-the-record to dispute the Atlantic's account.

From these examples, which can still be shared on Twitter's platform, it's clear that ""authoritative reporting"" does not mean accurate or well-sourced material.

Horowitz: 10 places that show the COVID shots have failed miserably,"At some point the COVID fascists and the injection addicts need to own the failure of their own policies. For better or for worse, they have been successful in defeating and censoring any opposition, so it is their policies that are the ones in place — not ours. They must therefore own the panic from the growing spread in many states and countries.

The reality is that anyone who has not had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is ""unvaccinated."" There is no vaccine for this virus, and the therapeutic that is fraudulently being marketed as such has clearly made the virus worse than last year, even though most adults have taken it and despite half the population already having had the virus.

As bad as the results from the so-called vaccine are, just remember the efficacy is even worse than you think. When outcomes (cases, hospitalizations, deaths) are subject to reporting delays but vaccination rates are not, the inevitable result is an overstating of vaccine efficacy. What this means is that much of what we think of as waning efficacy may actually just be poor efficacy from the get-go.



While there are dozens of examples of vaccine failure across the globe – with cases spreading quicker than they ever did before the vaccination – here are 10 of the most jarring examples:

1. U.K.

There is nowhere to run or hide from the negative effects of the shots in the U.K. After accomplishing one of the quickest and most universal vaccination drives, the U.K. now has more cases than it did during last winter's wave when nobody was vaccinated.

The U.K. Health Security Agency also puts out the most consistent granular data on cases by vaccination status each week. Indeed, in all age groups above 30, there is now a negative efficacy to the shots, and in some age groups, the vaccinated are twice as likely to get COVID as those without the shots.

Plugging in the percentage vaccinated by each age cohort, you get a rough efficacy against symptomatic infection as follows:

Houston, we've got a problem. The only reason the numbers for children are so high aside from the fact that most were vaccinated recently is because they are mass-tested in schools.

According to the UKSHA data, roughly 82% of the deaths the past three weeks have been among the fully vaccinated.

2. Iceland

Few countries in the Western world did better than Iceland … before the mass vaccination. Although the country still isn't experiencing too many deaths, as the population appears to be somewhat immune all along, Icelanders have now experienced two larger waves than before 92% of adults chose to get the shots.

3. Singapore

Singapore blows up the myth of the shots perhaps more than any other country. It is one of those Far East countries that, based on a year of data, appeared to be somewhat immune to the virus, especiall to critical illness. Yet, precisely after nearly every adult in the country was vaccinated, Singapore is now experiencing a wave that blows out any prior wave – to the point where the population is now incurring what is the equivalent of 800 deaths per day in the U.S.

Although the U.S. has obviously experienced more than 800 deaths a day, that is a very high number for a country that enjoys much better health and lower obesity rates than Americans. There is nowhere to run or hide and nobody else to blame. Clearly, the shots have made the virus worse.

4. Netherlands

The Dutch mistakenly thought that a seasonal low in cases was really due to the vaccines. Well, after achieving an 84% vaccination rate among adults, they have now suffered a 680% increase in cases in the virus in just a month and a half. They set a record in cases per day as well as a 19.2% positivity rate.

Rather than suspending this dangerous shot and pushing early treatment and monoclonal antibodies, they are headed back to lockdown.



5. Belgium

If there is any country that you'd think would be done with this virus, it's Belgium. The Belgians already had a massive wave last fall and have suffered one of the highest death rates in the world. Yet despite (or perhaps because of) a similar vaccination rate to the Netherlands, they are now experiencing another large wave, several months after vaccinating most adults. Which province has the highest case rate? You guessed it – the most vaccinated one! According to the Brussels Times, West Flanders, where 60 out of 64 municipalities are above 80 percent vaccination (nearly universal among adults), is ""experiencing an incidence of 1,363 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the last 14 days, it is by far the province where the virus is circulating the most, and where the increase remains the strongest (+67 percent in one week).""

6. Cayman Islands

In case you think the surge is an anomaly in Europe, the Cayman Islands are now experiencing their worst surge in cases to date. With just 65,000 people, this island nation had very little COVID for the past year and a half. According to Reuters, the country has administered at least 116,507 doses of COVID vaccines so far, which would essentially be enough to give nearly every adult two shots. So, they avoided COVID altogether, right? Nope, they have one of the highest case rates per capita in the world precisely after they achieved universal vaccination.

7. New Mexico

In the United States, we supposedly have states that did it right and states that did not. New Mexico has had strict lockdowns, strict mask-wearing, and one of the stronger vaccine coercion regimes. New Mexico ranks 14 among the 50 states in terms of vaccination rate. It now has a higher case rate than neighboring states experiencing the same seasonal wave among the Western Mountain states. Hospitals are now at 150% capacity.

8. Maine

After vaccinating, at least partially, nearly 100% of those over 65, Maine now has as many hospitalizations and more cases as last winter, and it's only mid-November.

Remember, Maine not only has a vaccine mandate on workers, but it does not accept religious exemptions. Points for ""effort"" are not awarded by this virus to faulty vaccines.

9. Seychelles

Nearly every African country has done pretty well with COVID, but this tiny island country in the Indian Ocean has more deaths than almost any country in Africa, even though it has, by far, the highest vaccination rate in the continent. In fact, the country barely had a single death before the mass vaccination! By my count, all but 14 of its 122 deaths occurred after 60% of the country and most adults were vaccinated.

10. Gibraltar

And now for the one that takes the cake. Despite having the seventh highest per capita COVID death rate and fifth highest case rate since the beginning of the pandemic, this tiny country is now on its second Delta wave. This, despite 100% of the adult population having had the Pfizer shots and 40% having had the boosters! You can't beat a tiny country that is 100% vaxxed and was ""being careful"" the entire time, right? Well, the Gibraltar government has just advised people to cancel Christmas plans. Its current case rate is over 160 per hundred thousand, nearly double the rate in the U.S. during its winter peak.

The media keeps asserting that a leaky vaccine is somehow better than no vaccine. But we know that a 2015 study on a leaky chicken vaccine concluded the opposite. ""Our data show that anti-disease vaccines that do not prevent transmission can create conditions that promote the emergence of pathogen strains that cause more severe disease,"" warned the U.S. and U.K researchers on the failed Marek's disease vaccine. Given the reality of what we see before our eyes, why is this not a concern regarding the leaky vaccines for humans?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/dont-these-false-or-misleading-reports-lack-authoritative-reporting-wheres-twitters-ban-hammer,2021-11-16
Horowitz: 6 important COVID data points that destroy the prevailing narrative,"“When you get vaccinated, you not only protect your own health, that of the family, but also you contribute to the community health by preventing the spread of the virus throughout the community. And in other words, you become a dead end to the virus.” ~Dr. Fauci, Face the Nation, May 16, 2021



“Negative efficacy.” Get used to that term, because every day more data suggests we are already in the vaccination twilight zone of all pain and no gain – just as with the lockdowns.

It is tearing humanity apart. COVID fascism is the most serious human rights threat we’ve faced in our lifetimes, and the latest science and data demonstrate that it’s all built upon a false premise. While people tuned out the news over the holiday week, many have missed the growing incontrovertible evidence that not only is there risk and zero benefit to taking any of the COVID shots, but there is actually negative efficacy against the virus. In other words, not only does it put you on the hook for known and unknown short-term and long-term injury without stopping COVID, it now actually makes you more vulnerable to COVID.

As you read these latest points, just remember that this is the injection for which police in Europe are now using dogs and batons against those protesting it. All these human rights abuses for a shot that, especially with the new variant, has become moot.

1) 96% of all Omicron cases in Germany among vaccinated: The respected Robert Koch Institute reported last week that among the 4,206 Germans infected with Omicron for whom their vaccination status was known, 95.58% were fully vaccinated. More than a quarter of them had booster shots. Given that the overall background rate for vaccination in Germany is 70%, this means that the shots now have a -87% effectiveness rate against Omicron.

2) Omicron among vaccinated outpacing unvaccinated by 28% in Ontario: The government in Ontario posts continuous data on case rates by vaccination status. The fact that the vaccinated have rapidly overtaken the unvaccinated in new infections demonstrates a clear negative effect of the shots against Omicron.

3) In Denmark, 89.7% of all Omicron cases were among fully vaccinated: As of Dec. 31, just 8.5% of all cases in Denmark were unvaccinated, according to the Statens Serum Institut. Overall, 77.9% of Denmark is fully vaccinated, and Omicron seems to hit younger people for whom there is a greater unvaccinated pool, which indicates clear negative efficacy. Even for non-Omicron variants, the un-injected composed only 23.7% of the cases.

4) Just 25% of the Omicron hospitalizations in the U.K. are unvaccinated: Not only are the vaccinated more likely to contract Omicron, but they are likely more at risk to be hospitalized. While American hospitals put out unverifiable information about “nearly everyone seriously ill with COVID being unvaccinated,” the U.K. continues to put out quality continuous data that shows the opposite. According to the U.K.’s Health Security Agency’s latest “Omicron daily overview,” just 25% of those in the hospital with suspected Omicron cases are unvaccinated.





Although that is roughly in line with the percentage of unvaccinated overall in the U.K., we know that Omicron cases are overwhelmingly among younger people who have a greater share of the unvaccinated. Dr. Abdi Mahamud, the WHO’s incident manager for COVID, said last week that Omicron has not hit most of the elderly yet.

According to the latest U.K. vaccine surveillance report (p. 21), between 32% and 40% of the age groups under 40 are unvaccinated. Which means that, with a 25% hospitalization rate, the unvaccinated are very possibly underrepresented in the Omicron hospitalized population, which again indicates negative efficacy to the shots.

5) 33 of 34 hospitalizations in Delhi hospital were vaccinated: The Indian Express reported that 33 of the 34 people hospitalized for Omicron in Delhi’s Lok Nayak hospital were fully vaccinated. Two of them received the booster shot. While some of them were international travelers, it’s important to remember that India has a much lower vaccination rate than the West. This is another small indication that not only might one be more likely to get Omicron after having gotten the shots, but possibly could be more vulnerable to hospitalizations, very likely due to some form of antibody dependent disease enhancement (ADE).

6) Vaccinated exponentially more likely to get re-infected with COVID: A new preprint study from Bangladesh found that among 404 people re-infected with COVID, having been vaccinated made someone 2.45 times more likely to get re-infected with a mild infection, 16.1 times more likely to get a moderate infection, and 3.9 times more likely to be re-infected severely, relative to someone with prior infection who was not vaccinated. Although overall re-infections were rare, vaccination was a greater risk factor of re-infection that co-morbidities!





Hence, the findings of this first-in-its-kind study harmonize with what a Public Health England survey found in October; namely, that the vaccines seem to erase a degree of N (nucleocapsid) antibodies generated by prior infection in favor of narrower S (spike) antibodies. ""Recent observations from UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) surveillance data that N antibody levels appear to be lower in individuals who acquire infection following 2 doses of vaccination,” stated the week 42 report from the U.K. (p. 23).

This finding also correlates with what researchers from Mount Sinai in New York and Hospital La Paz in Madrid found last year – that the second dose of the vaccine “determines a contraction of the spike-specific T cell response."" In that report, researchers already observed that other research has shown ""the second vaccination dose appears to exert a detrimental effect in the overall magnitude of the spike-specific humoral response in COVID-19 recovered individuals.""

At this point, how is there any benefit, much less a net benefit, from the shots? There are currently 21,000 deaths reported to VAERS, along with 110,000 hospitalizations and over 1 million total adverse events. Most deaths and injuries are never reported to VAERS. Now that the efficacy is, at best, a wash and at worst negative, why are we not discussing the short-term and long-term liabilities of the shots?

Remember, the VAERS numbers don’t even begin to quantify the long-term concerns, such as cancer and auto-immune diseases. A heavily redacted analysis of the Pfizer shot (p. 16) from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Agency (TGA) flatly conceded, “Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed.”



Consider the fact that the CEO of Indiana-based life insurance company OneAmerica, which has been around since 1877, revealed last week that the death rate among 18- to 64-year-old Hoosiers is up 40% from pre-pandemic levels. That is four times above what risk assessors consider catastrophic. Yes, some of this has been due to the virus, but given the age group, OneAmerica CEO Scott Davidson said that most of the claims for deaths being filed are not classified as COVID-19 deaths. Brian Tabor, the president of the Indiana Hospital Association, who spoke at the same news conference as Davidson, said that Indiana hospitals are flooded with patients “with many different conditions.” Any wonder what those ailments are if not COVID itself?

Indeed, those who say the injections are a “medical miracle” are correct, just not in the way they meant it.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-10-places-that-show-the-covid-shots-have-failed-miserably,2022-01-03
Horowitz: Attack on Colleyville synagogue: The next FBI memory-holed terrorist attack,"In the eyes of the FBI, the only potential terrorists in this country are those who disagree with the political views of the left – not actual terrorists with ties to foreign terror groups. Which is why any true terrorist attack immediately gets memory-holed by the FBI and the media. The Islamic attack on a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, is just the latest example.

On Saturday afternoon, 44-year-old British national Malik Faisal Akram allegedly barged into services at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville and took four people hostage for about 10 hours. Late Saturday night, the hostages were freed and the suspect was shot dead by the SWAT team, which stormed the building when some of the hostages ran out with the suspect in pursuit. The Associated Press reported that the suspect had demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist imprisoned on charges of trying to kill American service members in Afghanistan.

Following the resolution of the hostage crisis, the FBI agent in charge immediately stated that the suspect was “singularly focused on one issue” that was not “specifically related to the Jewish community.” Sure, it just happens to be that the man decides to pick the one Jewish synagogue in an area with few Jews. Remember, this is the same FBI that still has no motive for the Vegas shooting, the Nashville Christmas bombing, the April 2021 Capitol attack, and more recently a case of a black nationalist mowing down six people at a Waukesha parade two days after the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict.

Joe Biden chimed in with an awkward and bizarre statement too: ""I don't think there is sufficient information to know why he targeted that synagogue, why he insisted on the release of someone who's been in prison for over 10 years ... why he was using anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli comments,"" said the president on Sunday.

According to British authorities, the suspect was a national of the U.K. He hailed from Blackburn, a city which has radical mosques with ties to Islamists.

Akram apparently arrived in the U.S. just five weeks ago, which makes the concern of ties to international terror even more alarming, especially since police in Manchester, England, arrested two teenagers in connection with Akram.

After these details were disclosed and the British media began reporting on it, then the FBI had to concede the obvious:

Who is Aafia Siddiqui, the person allegedly at the center of the hostage-taker’s demands? An American-educated Pakistani neuroscientist, Siddiqui was captured in Afghanistan in 2008 and put on trial in 2010 for attacking soldiers. She was accused of grabbing a rifle and firing on soldiers during an interrogation, injuring an FBI agent and a U.S. Army officer. She was sentenced to 86 years in prison after the jury found that ""Siddiqui attempted to murder Americans serving in Afghanistan, as well as their Afghan colleagues."" She is residing in a Texas prison. Known as “Lady Al-Qaeda,” Siddiqui demanded during the trial that Jews be excluded from the jury, claiming the entire prosecution had been orchestrated by unnamed ""Jews.""

Just two months ago, the Council on American Islamic Relations, which is the American branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, demanded that she be released. So here we have a Texas synagogue attacked by a supporter of an international terrorist who has support from an organization that works together with the DHS and the subject of the matter was a known Jew-hater, yet the FBI can’t connect any dots?

In a Facebook post on November 15, CAIR of DFW wrote, “We’ll be meeting with Congressional offices to educate them about Dr Aafia and call for her release. Special thanks to CAIR for being a pillar and letting utilize the office, which is walking distance from Congress, as our primary staging and organizing area.” Will those congressmen be forced to denounce their supporters the same way allied congressmen of some of the Jan. 6 protesters are being subpoenaed by a special congressional committee? Prominent mosques in America have recently held rallies to free Lady Al-Qaeda. Do you think any of the resources of the DHS and FBI will be focused on those people?

Instead, the entire purview of the FBI is now focused on conservative political groups whom they refer to as white supremacists. Last week, an FBI official told the U.S. Senate that “anti-government extremists,” meaning detractors of the Biden regime, are the nation’s top security threat. In other words, the newly created anti-domestic terrorism unit within the FBI will not be focused on groups with ties to Siddiqui sympathizers, but political opponents of the regime. ""We have seen a growing threat from those who are motivated by racial animus, as well as those who ascribe to extremist anti-government and anti-authority ideologies,"" stated Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. You better believe he doesn’t mean Islamic terrorist sympathizers; he means grandmothers with MAGA hats.



The U.K. Daily Mail is reporting that Akram was given a rare Exclusion Order at Blackburn's magistrates' court in the U.K. for his rantings about 9/11. How was a man like this able to fly to the U.S.? Well, evidently our homeland security and counterterrorism agencies are more focused on fighting domestic political opponents than foreign terrorists.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-6-important-covid-data-points-that-destroy-the-prevailing-narrative,2022-01-17
Horowitz: The same organization that brought us lockdown now scaremongering over 'reinfection',"The same Imperial College of London that wrongly scared the world into lockdown by exponentially overstating the projected casualties of COVID-19 during the first few months is now scaremongering about a supposed lack of immunity to the virus. The problem is its own research demonstrates why most people are already partially immune, even prior to infection, and will certainly not be worse off in terms of long-term immunity after getting the virus.

It has now become clear that the virus is ""gonna virus,"" regardless of what countries do in terms of non-pharmaceutical interventions. The virus will spread to every part of the world until a majority of people are exposed to it in some way. Now that people are increasingly coming to peace with this fact, the Imperial College of London is warning that immunity cannot be achieved and implying that people can get reinfected in a clinically meaningful way in large numbers. And the media are running with it. ""COVID-19 herd immunity theory dealt blow by U.K. research,"" read an emphatically panicked headline from the Financial Times on Tuesday.

There is simply no evidence to support this hypothesis and no reason to believe that the multi-layered immune response to SARS-CoV-2 should be different from that of any other respiratory virus. Moreover, to the extent the pro-lockdown crowd is correct about immunity, then we are all doomed anyway because there is no logical reason why a vaccine for a flu-like virus, which has never worked for any coronavirus to begin with, would somehow work against a virus that does not induce immunity through natural infection.

This week, the Imperial College published a pre-print study showing that antibodies disappeared in 26.5% of those who originally tested positive. The study observed a pool of 365,000 people between June 20 and Sept. 28 and found that over a quarter of those who originally tested positive through home-use finger-prick tests became seronegative by the end of September.

Of course, the implication they are pushing is obvious. ""These data suggest the possibility of decreasing population immunity and increasing risk of reinfection as detectable antibodies decline in the population,"" concluded the authors.

Never mind the fact that lack of presence of detectable antibodies is not uncommon in other viruses and doesn't mean that the body no longer remembers the ""recipe"" for defeating the virus. What most media articles that have promoted this study as pretext for panic have failed to discuss is that their own findings demonstrate that most people already have inherent immunity without antibodies because antibodies are not the immune system's primary defense for this virus.

The authors observed, ""Antibody positivity was greater in those who reported a positive PCR and lower in older people and those with asymptomatic infection."" In other words, a number of people who didn't have antibodies either never really had the virus or had it asymptomatically. Numerous studies have already shown that the weaker someone had the infection the more likely the antibodies will wane or will be nonexistent from the get-go. In fact, all my friends who had the virus last month when it hit my zip code in Baltimore County in early fall wound up testing negative for antibodies even just weeks after testing positive for the virus. And that actually indicates good news, not bad news.

The reality is that most people get this virus like a cold. The body doesn't need to produce antibodies for a cold. It doesn't need to waste energy and space keeping your blood full of every antibody you've ever needed to fight every flu and cold.

The likely reason why this virus is presenting itself so mildly in so many people is because most people have robust T cell immunity, primarily from other coronaviruses, an aspect of the immune system the Imperial College authors admitted they did not study. A comprehensive study from Singapore showed that people who never had COVID-19 but recovered from SARS-1 had cross-reactive T cells to SARS-CoV-2 17 years later! This was true of every blood sample the researchers tested. Numerous other studies have shown similar results. It's therefore very unlikely that someone who gets infected with SARS-CoV-2 itself will somehow gain less immunity against future infection than someone who had another coronavirus.

And the same reason why those people were immune to serious illness the first time will undoubtedly protect them the second time to the extent that some might be exposed again and test positive for a trace of the virus. As one comprehensive T cell study from Sweden found, ""SARS-CoV-2 induces robust memory T cell responses in antibody-seronegative and antibody-seropositive individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19."" The study showed that ""SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust memory T cell responses akin to those observed in the context of successful vaccines, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19 also in seronegative individuals.""

Another study from over a dozen researchers around the world found that 93% of ""exposed asymptomatic"" individuals in their study group produced a T cell response to SARS-CoV-2, even though antibodies were not detected in 40% of them.

There is a very strong possibility that this is why countries like Singapore and other Pacific Rim countries, that found a lot of people who tested positive for the virus, barely had anyone get clinically ill from it. They likely had more built-up memory T cell immunity from existing coronaviruses. Now that a significant portion of Western countries have gotten this novel form of coronavirus, the worst-case scenario is that some might test positive again for a trace of the virus, but the results of a hypothetical second round in the West shouldn't be worse than the first round in a country like Taiwan, where just seven people have died.

The long-term immunity even from other viruses was observed in a brand-new study by Israeli researchers. They found that ""individuals with diagnoses for common cold symptoms, including acute sinusitis, bronchitis, or pharyngitis in the preceding year"" had a 26.3% lower risk of even testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, much less developing strong symptoms.



According to a recent U.K. study, roughly 86% of those infected in the study sample did not report any symptoms. The majority of the remaining cases are usually sub-clinical and often very mild. This is a phenomenon we've observed in the U.S. from entire confined populations that were infected, such as prisoners and meatpacking workers. It's not those people we need to worry about, because they clearly already had partial immunity, even without ever having confronted this particular coronavirus. What we obviously don't want is those who got it seriously to then be reinfected again. But there is no evidence that those people lose their antibody immunity in large numbers, much less T cell immunity. We never test for any virus millions of times each and every day. If we did this for other viruses, we would undoubtedly find a small but noticeable number of people who are technically reinfected, but how many are going to get serious symptoms twice?

Between antibodies and T and long-term B cells, there is no more likelihood of that occurring with this virus more than any other virus for all but those whose immune systems are completely destroyed. And if those cells cannot be marshalled to stimulate an immune response to block reinfection from invading the body, then there is no logical reason a vaccine would ever work.

How ironic that the media is turning to the same institution that induced the unprecedented first wave of panic as a source to create long-term panic. Let's not forget that using the Imperial College model, there should have been ""at least 96,000 deaths"" in Sweden by July 1. Well, it's the end of October, and Sweden has fewer than 6,000 deaths, even with a very liberal method of counting.

While there is no evidence of lack of immunity to this virus, it's quite evident that the media will never be immune to a reinfection of false panic. God doesn't provide us with these wonderous T cells to ward off that misinformation. He simply gave us brain cells.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-attack-on-colleyville-synagogue-the-next-fbi-memory-holed-terrorist-attack,2020-10-28
Horowitz: Data from India continues to blow up the ‘Delta’ fear narrative,"Rather than proving the need to sow more panic, fear, and control over people, the story from India — the source of the ""Delta"" variant — continues to refute every current premise of COVID fascism.

The prevailing narrative from Fauci, Walensky, and company is that Delta is more serious than anything before, and even though vaccines are even less effective against it, its spread proves the need to vaccinate even more people. Unless we do that, we must return to the very effective lockdowns and masks. In reality, India's experience proves the opposite true; namely:

Delta is largely an attenuated version, with a much lower fatality rate, that for most people is akin to a cold. Masks failed to stop the spread there. The country has come close to the herd immunity threshold with just 3% vaccinated. Most people are now getting cold-like symptoms from Delta, but to the extent countries hit by Delta suffered some deaths and serious illness, they could have been avoided not with vaccines and masks, but with early and preventive treatment like ivermectin.

In other words, our government is learning all the wrong lessons from India, and now Israel and the U.K. Let's unpack what we know occurred in India and now in some of the other countries experiencing a surge in cases of the Indian ""Delta"" variant.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recently conducted a fourth nationwide serological test and found that 67.6% of those over 6 years old in June and July had antibodies, including 85% of health care workers. This is a sharp increase from the 24.1% level detected during the December-January study. What we can conclude definitively is that strict mask-wearing (especially among health care workers) failed to stop the spread one bit. Yet now they have achieved herd immunity and burned out the virus with just 3% vaccination (now up to 6%) with roughly one-sixth the death rate of the U.S. and the U.K. and less than one-half that of Israel.

Immediately, naysayers will suggest that somehow India is vastly undercounting the deaths because it is a shabby third-world country. However, if we are to suggest that, it would mean that so much of the data from so many other countries we use for studies must be ignored. Also, it's true that India is poor in some areas, but it is highly developed and has a very strong bureaucracy and administrative state throughout. There might be undercounting, but the notion that it can account for that wide a gap between India and the U.S./U.K. was always unlikely.



However, now that the Delta has spread to other countries like Israel and the U.K., we need not speculate who is right about India's death rate. The fact that Israel and the U.K. have so many Delta cases yet so few deaths relative to the winter spread of the original strain demonstrates that Delta is likely much weaker and India's numbers are probably close to accurate. Remember, most of India's spread, unlike in the West, occurred with Delta, long after the ancestral strain that hit the West was gone. If it really was the bloodbath some are suggesting (a tenfold undercount of deaths, in their estimation), why is the data from the U.K. showing just the opposite?

The latest data from the U.K. show that the case fatality rate for the Delta is just 0.2%, much less than the others. And we need not speculate with generalized studies. The raw data shows that since May 1, there have been approximately 1,300 deaths in the U.K. out of roughly 1.1 million confirmed cases. But those are confirmed cases. The likely infection fatality rate is much lower because now more than ever, people are avoiding testing, and the U.K. media has been reporting for weeks that the symptoms of the Delta for most people appear more like a cold.

The Guardian reports that based on data from the app-based Zoe COVID symptom study, the symptoms being reported are mainly headaches and runny nose. ""People might think they've just got some sort of seasonal cold, and they still go out to parties … we think this is fueling a lot of the problem,"" said Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, who is leading the work on the reporting app.

The U.K. media are trying to panic people about spreading a cold, but in fact, they are reporting good news! This virus has attenuated for most people to the point that they can't even distinguish it from a cold, much less a flu. Thus, the fact that India achieved most of its immunity throughout the spread of the Delta variant actually lends a lot of credence to the fatality rate of one-sixth of that of the U.S. and the U.K., which experienced most of its deaths from the ancestral strain.

If you look at any chart from Scotland, which is now mainly over the curve, there is a complete decoupling of deaths from cases.

The same thing is being observed in Israel, which is slightly behind the curve. The country has had just 20 deaths so far in July, but again, 15 of them were of vaccinated individuals.



However, to the extent that there are cases, and the relatively rare serious cases, the vaccines have proven to be a bust in preventing them. The Western countries are relying on an exponentially higher vaccination rate than India with a much lower seroprevalence rate from infection. It's simply not working. According to Israel's Ministry of Health, the Pfizer vaccine efficacy against infection dropped 42% since the start of the inoculation drive in Israel, and efficacy against severe illness has dropped 60% among those vaccinated early on. Ditto for the United Kingdom.

In fact, in Israel, the case rates track almost perfectly with the percentage of those vaccinated stratified by age range.

Thus, the experience from India and the Delta variant teaches us the exact opposite of what the panic-mongers are pushing. Natural immunity, not vaccination, is king. Which explains the dichotomy between India and countries like Gibraltar. In Gibraltar, nearly every adult in the tiny country has been vaccinated, yet it has the third-highest per capita rate of infection in the world.









The same trend appears to be playing out in Cyprus:

In general, there is zero correlation between vaccination rates and better outcomes, and in fact, many Latin American countries with the highest vaccination rates have recently had high infection rates, and many eastern European countries with lower vaccination rates had many fewer cases than their vaccine-obsessed western European counterparts. Here in the U.S., San Francisco, which had a low infection rate until recently, has seen an explosion in cases, despite a 70% vaccination rate.

At the same time, as I chronicled last month in great detail, even within India, the states that used ivermectin to treat COVID experienced a much sharper and quicker drop in cases in May. Imagine if the Western world used ivermectin and many other treatment options pre-emptively and prescribed them at every testing station. That is how you flatten a curve.



The lesson is clear: The only way out of this is for most people to get it, and the best way to do that safely is to make sure early treatments with drugs like ivermectin are made available and to be used even preventively for vulnerable populations. If this is really about saving lives, rather than doubling down on all of the things that have failed and distorting data and history to comport with pseudo-science, they would try the one thing they have shunned until now – actually treating the virus before people have trouble breathing.

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky is correct when she says, ""Nearly every death, especially among adults, due to Covid-19 is at this point entirely preventable."" But the data and learned experience show that it's not because of a lack of vaccines, but a lack of treatment.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-coronavirus-scaremongering-reinfection,2021-07-22
Horowitz: The energy crisis is worse than you think — and it’s by design,"We can’t wait until after the election to deal with a looming winter electricity crisis. Republicans must make demands on energy production in the continuing budget resolution to promote nuclear and coal power plants, terminate all of the onerous regulations that have stifled their productivity, and turbocharge our natural gas delivery capabilities. Anything short of an immediate deregulation plan will place Americans in the same predicament as Europe, where they are discussing group showers, eating bugs, and drinking sewage, as they face a $2 trillion surge in electricity prices.

Thanks to the controlled demolition of coal and nuclear power, there is record demand on natural gas for electricity. And although our production and exports of natural gas are at record levels, they are not as high as they should be given the regulations and the stifling of pipelines, and they are not sufficient to compensate for the sudden embargo of all Russian gas supplies. This is why inventories in underground storage are operating well below baseline levels of the pre-COVID years.

As such, the Energy Information Administration is predicting a 7.5% increase in electricity rates over 2021, and that is before the next man-made or manipulated global crisis. However, in parts of the Northeast, rates have already more than doubled because of a lack of sufficient pipeline systems in place, with many proposals on the table having been blocked for years. New England gets almost no electricity from coal any more and relies heavily on natural gas. But these same states have banned fracking and gas pipelines as well! So absent robust infrastructure to transport and store natural gas, which the Northeast lacks, the people have failed to reap the benefits of increased natural gas production. Rather than piping the gas in straight from the Marcellus basin, New England was importing gas from Russia!

Our existing level of natural gas production would have been sufficient had our government not purposely set fire to our coal industry for a decade and then decided to engage in a thoughtless war with Russia without a contingency plan. In the U.S., coal once composed roughly half of our electricity source just 15 years ago, but has dropped precipitously because of destructive eco policies. Now it only accounts for 21% of our electricity source, so shocks to the system are going to harm American consumers. Yet thanks to the reduced inventories, we are struggling to even supply a smaller percentage of our grid with affordable rates. The price of thermal coal is now at an all-time high of $439 per metric ton.

Our electricity generation from coal power plants is down by nearly two-thirds since 2008. Thanks to numerous regulations during the Obama administration, 250 coal plants closed between 2010 and 2017, leaving us with just 240, less than a quarter of China’s inventory. Thus, while our recoverable coal assets are enormous – 60% greater than China’s reserves – our coal electric power inventory is running between 85 and 90 million tons, down over 30% since 2020 and more than 50% since 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

As you can see, our production is at a record low, as are our inventories:

It would be one thing if our government planned ahead in its destruction of coal by ramping up natural gas pipelines and building more nuclear power plants. After all, if clean energy is the goal, those two are great candidates for clean and effective sources of energy. But clearly that is not the goal. Scarcity is the goal. Thanks to endless regulations by the same people who claim to want clean energy, no new nuclear reactors have come online in decades, while numerous others have been retired. At the end of 2021, there were 93 active reactors, down from 104 a decade ago. Our monthly nuclear utility generation is down 5% compared to 2019.

The only forms of energy that have been increasing, at a painful cost to taxpayers, are solar, wind, and electric vehicles. However, they are impotent during our time of need, and the obsessive push for electric vehicles to reduce gasoline consumption further exacerbates the strain on electricity, which is even scarcer, and further drains the already low utility of green energy that relies on batteries (now in great shortage) to run.

During the California heat wave, one would think Californians would have enough solar energy to power the entire state, given how much they invested in it and how strongly the sun was shining, particularly during those hot days. But as the Washington Post reports, so much of it went to waste because the batteries and transmission lines needed to feed solar power are too expensive, especially with the scarcity of batteries (in itself due to mining regulations as well as the contrived demand for electric cars).

At some point, it becomes clear this is being done on purpose. Government regulators are cutting off all the useful sources of energy and jamming the feeble renewable energy grid with further demand precisely at a time when they are cutting off all Russian energy. To top it off, Biden has drained nearly 40 years of Strategic Petroleum Reserve inventories headed into the winter. This can’t all be an accident. To quote Diederik Samsom, chief of staff for Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s executive vice president, “The two basic needs of life – food and energy – we have paid way too little for in the past 40 years.” In other words, this is being done on purpose.

So where are Republicans in all of this? Why are they not holding up the budget bill in the Senate until the “Inflation Reduction Act,” which raised numerous taxes and royalties on oil and gas exploration, is repealed? One of the provisions institutes a “methane fee,” which some estimate will single-handedly increase consumer natural gas bills by 17%. The tax will not only apply to the production of oil but also the transmission, storage, and exporting of natural gas, which is the worst thing you can do at a time of record high natural gas prices.

Moreover, the bill created all sorts of new incentives to promote electric vehicles, which will not only fail to ease the energy crisis, but will exacerbate it. It’s become clear that the electricity crisis is an even bigger deal than the spike in gasoline prices. Electric vehicles will create a tsunami of new demand on the electric grid at a time of record high prices, after people are already forced to pay a fortune for the vehicles. We are already witnessing this dynamic – of one green fascist policy running into the headwinds of another – playing out in California, where grid operators advised people not to charge their vehicles during the heat wave.



At a time when polls show more Americans than ever aren’t buying the global warming narrative, Republicans continue to agree to its premise and even pass new pernicious anti-consumer policies based on their agreement with the pseudo-science, just as they did with the response to COVID.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-data-from-india-continues-to-blow-up-the-delta-fear-narrative,2022-09-23
Horowitz: War on energy is the new COVID fascism,"As the British crown tightened its grip on the colonies, Samuel Adams warned in favor of an aggressive response by noting that “if we are voluntarily silent as the conspirators would have us to be, it will be considered as an approbation of the change.” Well, here we are, two years after the worst tyranny ever – not just a handful of small taxes but a complete lockdown of our lives and biomedical control of our bodies – and there has been no impetus to formally strip governments of their ill-gotten powers. It is therefore not surprising that the lockdown mindset is now being used to help promote and “solve” an energy crisis at the same time.

In preparation for Europe’s self-imposed energy crisis, Ravi Gurumurthy, chief executive of Nesta and former director of strategy at the U.K.’s Department of Energy and Climate Change, called on the U.K. government to impose “COVID-style” rationing of use of energy this coming winter.

“The scale of the crisis now requires a Covid-style response. In months, the government created the infrastructure to roll out vaccines nationwide. We need a similar national campaign to help every household cut their gas use by 20%,” warned Gurumurthy in a statement being echoed by all the green fascists. “The government must provide further support to households to reduce the impact of the rising price cap and bills. But the problem is getting worse and not going away. Subsidies are vital but with a series of difficult winters ahead, hand-to-mouth policies are not enough.”

In case you think this is just European-style totalitarianism, the trend is already beginning in California – except in this case it’s in preparation for a heat wave. California’s grid operator said it may have to ""issue a series of emergency notifications and “expects to call on Californians for voluntary conservation via Flex alerts over the long weekend."" In a statement issued Tuesday, the California Independent System Operator called on people to “set thermostats to 78 degrees or higher, avoid using large appliances and charging electric vehicles, and turn off unnecessary lights.” For now, these ideas might take the form of recommendations, but not for long. If people were willing to wear diapers on their faces in the heat to obtain basic services and shut down their way of life for months, it doesn’t even require a leap of the imagination to envision energy-related shutdowns.

The rich irony of this statement is that they are calling on people to stop charging their electrical vehicles just a week after California announced a ban on all gas-powered cars by 2035! Thus, this is not even just about cronyism and steering people toward one car vs. another; it’s about ending cars altogether and making “COVID” a permanent new normal, as was established by the “Great Reset.”

To fully appreciate what is happening here, one must study the origins of this latest crisis. Europe and the U.S. goaded the Ukrainian government into fighting Putin’s demands in a way they knew would never be sustainable, while concurrently cutting off all Russian energy without a commitment to ramp up their own fossil fuel production. This had the effect of inducing the worst supply chain shortage and inflation in energy of our lifetime. Clearly, this had nothing to do with protecting the Ukrainian people. The harm to the energy supply chain was not a bug of their plan, but a feature. After all, Diederik Samsom, chief of staff for Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s executive vice president, recently said, “The two basic needs of life – food and energy – we have paid way too little for in the past 40 years.”

Just as with COVID, where the virus was likely created through gain-of-function research and then the medical establishment blocked all early treatment for it to steer you toward the “solution” of total control and vaccine mandates, the Great Reset plan for energy (and likely food as well) is no different. The Great Resetters created an arbitrary crisis, then blocked the solution (oil, gas, nuclear, coal, etc. is the early treatment), and then turned to the people and say you must be willing to “sacrifice” in order to save humanity from the shortage, just like you had to lock down and get experimental shots in order to save Grandma. This is why Ukraine became the “next current thing” after COVID and why the Ukrainian flag replaced the mask and needles in the social media profile pics. It had nothing to do with regard for the Ukrainian people.

What sort of sacrifices do they have in mind? There is no limit to their transhuman agenda. James Bevan, chief of the U.K.’s Environment Agency, suggested that increased droughts will require people to drink more reprocessed sewage. “Part of the solution will be to reprocess the water that results from sewage treatment and turn it back into drinking water – perfectly safe and healthy, but not something many people fancy,” wrote the lead eco guru in the Sunday Times. Although he admitted it was unpopular, he stressed the need to serve the gods of scarcity. “We need to remember where it comes from: when we turn on the tap, what comes out started in a river, lake or aquifer. The more we take, the more we drain those sources and put stress on nature and wildlife.”

So, it will be sewage for water, along with bugs for protein, while using bicycles for cars when we are allowed out of our homes.

This all comes as the FDA, for the first time ever, approved an Omicron booster shot based on results from eight mice. We are now the lab rats. That’s why it’s so easy for them to “COVID” us on energy policy. We allowed gain of function to create draconian lockdowns, so now they are ensuring self-imposed energy scarcity will lead to rationing. Chief executive of Shell Ben van Beurden is now warning of “years” of rationing, not just one winter.

And of course, as the West wallows in scarcity and experiments in transhumanism, China is always looking to grow. In August, China’s coal-fired power generation reached a record 120 billion kilowatts per hour. The country is planning to expand up to 150 gigawatts of new coal-fired power capacity from 2022 to 2025.

America is the Saudi Arabia of coal. We should be able to flood the market with coal. Sadly, thanks to the war on coal production, intensified through climate mysticism, we have no hand to play as our government shuts off exports from Russia. Given that coal accounts for 35% of global electricity use and Europe gets 70% of its coal from Russia, the coal crisis is now worse than the oil crisis.

Rather than ramping up production, the U.K. plans to decommission all its coal power plants by October 2024. In the U.S., coal production has been declining steadily since 2007, and if the eco-fascists have their way, it will be extinct by the end of the decade. And no, it’s not because we don’t have God-given resources. Our coal reserves are estimated at 254 trillion tons, much greater than the reserves of China and Russia.

In other words, the legacy of COVID lives on. What COVID taught us is that governments were willing to block effective treatments in order to trap us into a false choice between dying from the virus or getting the shots. Likewise, with energy, they will dismantle our energy production to trap us into a false dichotomy of starving or freezing to death in the winter or living in their transhuman dystopia. They understand that you cannot control a people when food and energy are cheap and abundant, just like they understood that with medical care. Thus, in order to obtain complete control as they did during lockdowns, they need to tap the gods of scarcity.



The solution is to uproot all of the ill-gotten power our government grabbed during COVID and fully investigate the malfeasance behind the creation of the virus and its ensuing policies so that this same playbook cannot be used again. As founding father George Clinton, the very first governor of New York and fourth vice president of the United States, warned at the New York ratification convention in July 1788, “History does not furnish a single instance of a government once established, voluntarily yielding up its powers to secure the rights and liberties of the people.”",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-energy-crisis-design,2022-09-01
Horowitz: Governors and legislatures must declare war on the CDC,"All Republican governors claim they support limited government and will stand up to the tyrannical feds. Well, now is their time to shine.

The CDC announced a return to the failed masking recommendations after the shots it continues to push apparently didn't do the job. Most shockingly, it announced a recommendation that all children – whether they got the shots or not – should wear a mask indefinitely all day in school.

This is a watershed moment in American history. The CDC is now recommending an illogical, inhumane, immoral, and illegal policy that in any other era would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act and would be considered child abuse. The response of the states should be an emphatic ""Hell no!""

The CDC is using the ""scariant"" Delta as an excuse to give people the impression that suddenly children are at risk for the virus. Well, the U.K. has just gotten over the curve of the Delta wave, so its data is likely to be very instructive as to what we should expect in the next few weeks. As U.K. Dr. Alasdair Munro, a pediatric infectious disease researcher, observed, children 2-11 actually experienced the lowest case rate during the Delta wave as compared to young adults who were eligible for the vaccine. Obviously, almost all those remaining cases were very mild.

Perhaps most ironic is that the U.K.'s case count peaked on July 19, ""Freedom Day,"" when all restrictions and mask mandates ended. Cases have dropped precipitously every day since then and are now down 50% in one week. As we have witnessed in every corner of the world since the beginning of the pandemic — Delta being no different — nothing has worked to stop the inexorable six- to eight-week waves, and nothing works to restart the spread when its seasonal spread is done in a given area. It's 100% natural. But now, even the establishment can no longer deny it. As professor Oliver Johnson of Bristol University observed in the U.K. Spectator, ""For the first time in 18 months, there's been a fall in cases that can't be easily explained by a national lockdown.""

Of course, here in the United States we have seen this trend for months, especially this past spring, when cases in the South plummeted for weeks after they ditched the mask mandates but rose quickly in the Northeast and Michigan with impervious mask mandates.

As much as masks don't work to stop the spread of COVID (especially an even more transmissible form), to force children to bear the brunt of the mandate by wearing the sacred cloth all day in school is unconscionable. Just how big a waste were the quarantines of children last year? According to a recent Oxford study, out of the millions of children who were forced to isolate because a child tested positive for a virus milder to them than the flu, 98.4% of U.K. children never went on to develop COVID. All of that child abuse was for nothing.



Now the CDC is seeking to reinstate its child abuse without performing any randomized controlled trials on the efficacy or safety of masks, after it rejected the findings of the only studies that actually looked at those questions and raised serious concerns.

Will red states allow the CDC to continue this child abuse for another year? Well, it's in their power to say no. Several governors, including from Florida, Texas, South Dakota, South Carolina, Nebraska, and Iowa, have already said this mandate is a non-starter in their states, but given the prominence of the CDC, I fear more emphatic and broader actions are required. State legislatures should immediately convene and pass the following:



A law barring the implementation of the CDC's mask mandate in any public or private setting. Private institutions are forced to abide by OSHA, ADA, and anti-discrimination, as well as health privacy laws in every other context. Why should they be exempt the one time such mandates are clearly being driven by the government and not the free market?

A law designating forced masking of children as reckless child endangerment, subject to any civil or criminal penalties pursuant to their respective state statutes.

Guidance for their respective departments of health to reject every policy of HHS that is built upon the faulty science of masking, the existing shots, test and trace, and the use of ineffective treatments such as remdesivir. All state COVID funding should be eliminated from enforcing, marketing, or advertising any policy the legislature deems unlawful or unscientific.

Guidance to administer ivermectin to those in need or to make it available over the counter.

It's for this very moment that our founders believed our federalist system would help deter a national tyranny. In Federalist 46, Madison envisioned state interposition against federal tyranny:

The disquietude of the people; their repugnance and, perhaps, refusal to co-operate with the officers of the Union; the frowns of the executive magistracy of the State; the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any State, difficulties not to be despised; would form, in a large State, very serious impediments; and where the sentiments of several adjoining States happened to be in unison, would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter.

Even Hamilton, a strong proponent of a strong federal government, wrote in Federalist 26 that the state legislatures will lead the charge against federal tyranny:

The State legislatures, who will always be not only vigilant but suspicious and jealous guardians of the rights of the citizens against encroachments from the federal government, will constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national rulers, and will be ready enough, if any thing improper appears, to sound the alarm to the people, and not only to be the VOICE, but, if necessary, the ARM of their discontent.

Now is the time for all these red-state Republicans to stand up and be counted. Will they stand for human life, the Constitution, and the health and dignity of our children? Or will they stand for a double-speaking, power-hungry, attention-seeking fool who has articulated less scientific acumen than a toddler?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-energy-new-covid-fascism,2021-07-28
Horowitz: Hopkins analysis showing COVID-19 has 'relatively no effect on deaths' in US retracted from publication. Why?,"If data analysis is insensitive or appears to ""trivialize"" a pandemic, does it make the research false? The arguments of the lockdown and mask totalitarians are so fickle that they must resort to unprecedented censorship in order to win the day. Their views cannot coexist with any trace of dissent on the internet, which is why Johns Hopkins University, which has become a lead advocate for lockdowns, is evidently now censoring its own faculty in academic research.



Last week, the Johns Hopkins News-Letter, a student newspaper, posted an article by Yanni Gu titled, ""A closer look at U.S. deaths due to COVID-19."" It was based on an analysis conducted by Dr. Genevieve Briand, an economics teacher at Hopkins. I originally saw the article on Thanksgiving morning and quickly saw this very catchy conclusion. ""These data analyses suggest that in contrast to most people's assumptions, the number of deaths by COVID-19 is not alarming. In fact, it has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States.""

When I clicked on it Thursday night, the link was dead. Then I saw that the Twitter account for the Hopkins News-Letter announced that it had been deleted:

Thankfully, the internet is eternal and you can still see an archived version here.



Isn't it interesting how any analysis that seems to cast doubt on the prevailing panicked narrative of the virus must immediately be deleted or censored? When was the last time you saw one of the numerous inaccurate papers overstating the threat of the virus taken down from the web or labeled as inaccurate on social media?

How many people really died earlier in 2020?

The article originally posted by Gu seeks to answer the following question: Are there really anywhere near 260,000 excess deaths this year of people who died early due to COVID-19? Gu, the student who wrote the article, notes that based on Briand's use of CDC's excess death data, there have actually been relatively few excess deaths this year. More shocking still is that her analysis shows a commensurate drop in deaths among other typical leading causes of fatality this year. ""Briand believes that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be recategorized as being due to COVID-19.""

So how are the deaths being recategorized?

""The CDC classified all deaths that are related to COVID-19 simply as COVID-19 deaths. Even patients dying from other underlying diseases but are infected with COVID-19 count as COVID-19 deaths. This is likely the main explanation as to why COVID-19 deaths drastically increased while deaths by all other diseases experienced a significant decrease …

If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn't give us a choice but to point to some misclassification,"" Briand replied.

What professor Briand also found peculiar is that the percentage of deaths among those in the 65+ bracket appear to be relatively similar to those in younger brackets and has remained pretty constant even after the epidemic began.

To be clear, the data she is using is just from April. A lot of additional people have allegedly died from COVID-19 since then. However, April is when we experienced the strongest wave, which would have netted the most deaths of any month.

On Friday, following much social media buzz about the publication's retraction notice on Twitter, the News-Letter posted an editor's note explaining why the article was removed but did provide a link to it in a pdf. Just two of the paragraphs even attempt to entertain the points made in the original analysis. The editors claim the article ""has been used to support dangerous inaccuracies that minimize the impact of the pandemic."" Next, they move on to the typical ""credentials"" insult by noting, ""As assistant director for the Master's in Applied Economics program at Hopkins, Briand is neither a medical professional nor a disease researcher.""

The main point the editors' retraction notice makes is that the CDC has said there have been 300,000 excess deaths. However, we already know that many of them have been due to lockdown and that many the CDC considers excess deaths would have died from other conditions during the same calendar year, which is the main point of Briand's analysis. And with conflicting data, who is to say the CDC is correct about that? This is why this needs further study to harmonize and validate all the data, as Briand herself said.

Next, the editors' retraction notes,""Briand presented data of total U.S. deaths in comparison to COVID-19-related deaths as a proportion percentage, which trivializes the repercussions of the pandemic"" and further ""does not disprove the severity of COVID-19."" So now an academic institution is writing an emotional screed about ""severity."" We all understand that people have died from the virus. If this virus killed people a few months early within the same year, we can have a debate over language sensitivity, but it doesn't disprove the point that the excess deaths for a given year are not what they are being portrayed as. While we can debate the language the student used in the original article stating the deaths were ""not alarming,"" the retraction doesn't disprove, and in indeed tacitly agrees, with Briand's main research point – that the distribution of deaths seems to be fairly constant across all age groups.

Hence, one could take issue with some of the language used by the student to portray Briand's research, but the broader findings are intriguing and should be discussed and debated. This retraction is a political decision, not an academic one.

This is not the first analysis to ""downplay"" the human toll of COVID-19

While this analysis, which can be viewed in an hour-long video, needs further study, it's not like the point is entirely novel. The retraction notice notes, ""Briand's study should not be used exclusively in understanding the impact of COVID-19, but should be taken in context with the countless other data published by Hopkins, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).""

Exactly! None of us are using the Briand analysis in a vacuum as an end-all. We want to embark on debate; the censors want to shut it down. This is part of broader evidence that this virus is not killing massive numbers of people well before their natural time to die.

Professor Neil Ferguson, the father of lockdown policies, suggested earlier this year that two-thirds of the people who would ultimately die in the U.K. would have died within the year anyway. Punctuating this point is a brand-new retrospective study published over the weekend by scientists at Rutgers University showing that 89% of those who died of COVID in two New Jersey hospitals had prior ""do not resuscitate"" orders. Thus, these are not exactly new excess deaths who died tragically early. The findings harmonize very well with any analysis showing limited excess deaths caused by the virus this year.

Also, much as with masks, some of the evidence we are now seeing on excess deaths tracks very closely with the original consensus – before the virus became a political issue and a tool for social control. On March 26, Dr. Anthony Fauci, along with National Institutes of Health deputy director of clinical research Clifford Lane and CDC Director Robert Redfield, published an article in the New England Journal of Medicine making exactly this point. They predicted that once the true number of asymptomatic and subclinical cases was factored in, ""the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.""

Well, given that the flu has all but disappeared since COVID-19 has become the predominant respiratory virus in circulation, that would mean there would not be a large number of excess deaths, given that this virus is replacing, not augmenting, the flu deaths. Last year, for week 46 of the CDC's Influenza Surveillance Report (ending Nov. 16), there were 1,786 confirmed flu cases. This year, there were just 41. That is a 97.7% decline! Which tells you that for this year, COVID-19 is the Angel of Death's respiratory fatality tool of choice, to the exclusion of the other typical tools.

The only other criticism the editors' retraction notice had of Briand is that her contention that other deaths were reclassified as COVID deaths is wrong because ""COVID-19 disproportionately affects those with preexisting conditions, so those with those underlying conditions are statistically more likely to be severely affected and die from the virus."" Again, she is discussing excess deaths – meaning people who would otherwise not have died this year. So her point is not just that some deaths have been mislabeled (e.g. motorcycle accidents turning into COVID deaths), but even among those who legitimately did die from the virus, many of them, as the editors' retraction notice is clearly conceding, would have died fairly soon from those other diseases. They are clearly granting the point that, by and large, these people would not have died of heart attacks or the flu 10 years later. These are people who largely would have died within the year. And let's not forget that, thanks to the lockdown policies, many of these people are also dying a few months early because of isolation.

Yes, the CDC's excess death data can be unreliable, and yes, we need more recent months of data to make a better assessment. But rather than engaging in censorship, why are we not debating the merits of both sides? Why does any shred of good news about the virus have to be stifled rather than rebutted or debated?

American media and scientific journals have strong bias against good news



This problem seems to be unique to the U.S., at least to the extreme lengths that the censorship is taken. A brand new working paper published for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that ""ninety-one percent of stories by U.S. major media outlets are negative in tone versus fifty four percent for non-U.S. major sources and sixty-five percent for scientific journals."" This was found to be true even when logic would dictate there should be more positive stories or studies in circulation.

""The negativity of the U.S. major media is notable even in areas with positive scientific developments including school re-openings and vaccine trials,"" observed Sacerdote et al. in the working paper. ""Media negativity is unresponsive to changing trends in new COVID-19 cases or the political leanings of the audience. U.S. major media readers strongly prefer negative stories about COVID-19, and negative stories in general.""

Thus, whenever any study, analysis, or news story surfaces showing that deaths might not be as bad as reported, it is immediately censored. Given that deliberate bias against good news, how are we to fairly evaluate the merits of the data and science? In that sense, the danger to the public is likely more in what is not being published than what is affirmatively being disseminated with pomp and flair across the dark annals of the web.

Nobody made this point better than Kamran Abbasi, executive editor of the British Medical Journal, in a recent editorial in which he accuses scientists and politicians of ""suppressing science"" for political gain.

""Politicians often claim to follow the science, but that is a misleading oversimplification,"" charged Abbasi. ""Science is rarely absolute. It rarely applies to every setting or every population. It doesn't make sense to slavishly follow science or evidence. A better approach is for politicians, the publicly appointed decision makers, to be informed and guided by science when they decide policy for their public. But even that approach retains public and professional trust only if science is available for scrutiny and free of political interference, and if the system is transparent and not compromised by conflicts of interest.""

In other words, ""shut up and mask up"" is not science and certainly does not exude transparency that will give the public confidence in the decision-making process. And as Abassi warns, ""When good science is suppressed, people die.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-governors-and-legislatures-must-declare-war-on-the-cdc,2020-11-30
Horowitz: Irish county with 99.7% vaccination rate has highest COVID case rate,"With 99.7% of adults in the Irish county of Waterford having received the COVID shots, they have the highest per-capita case rate of COVID anywhere in the country. Are they now going to suggest it's the fault of the 0.3%?!

The Irish Times reported last week that with one Waterford city district at a 14-day incidence rate of 1,486 cases per 100,000 of the population, Waterford has the highest incidence rate of anywhere in Ireland. The COVID case rate is three times the national average, which in itself has been increasing steadily in recent weeks, despite 91% of Irish adults being vaccinated. However, Waterford takes the cake.

""Waterford has the highest rate of vaccination in the country with 99.7 per cent of adults over the age of 18 (as registered in the last census) fully vaccinated,"" reports the Irish Times. ""The county has gone from having one of the lowest rates of Covid-19 infection in Ireland to one of the highest.""

How can a vaccine that is this leaky, and apparently even counterproductive, continue to be pushed on a population even if it had zero side effects? How many more examples of this do we need to see?

According to Our World in Data, most Irish began to get vaccinated in April/May, which is exactly when we saw a reversal of fortunes, with more cases than we've seen in months.

What else have we seen rise at the same time? You got it. COVID cases.

And no, it's not just mild cases. Ireland has the highest number of people in the hospital with COVID since March, and the trajectory is getting worse. This is with the highest vaccination rate in the EU – over 90% of those over 16 – and it's particularly bad in the most vaccinated county of Ireland. The state's chief medical officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, said he was ""increasingly worried about the rising incidence of the disease nationwide"" and that the primary focus ""must be to protect the most vulnerable from Covid-19."" He then proceeded to blame the unvaccinated! Gee, if just 9% of those over 16 in the country are unvaccinated and just 0.3% in the worst area, what percentage of the vulnerable do you think are not vaccinated?! And wasn't the vaccine designed to protect ""the most vulnerable?""

At some point, there is nowhere to run or hide from the botched vaccine that not only fails to stop transmission, but causes viral immune escape and makes more virulent variants. A recent analysis of the emergent A.30 strain published in Nature shows that ""the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variant A.30 is heavily mutated and evades vaccine-induced antibodies with high efficiency."" This is what happens when you ""shoot at the king and miss,"" so to speak, by fighting a virus with weak, narrow-spectrum, and waning antibodies. We've gone backward. U.K. data already shows that the vaccinated are infected at a greater rate per capita – in some cohorts twice the rate – for every age group over 30.

It's becoming clear that not only does this vaccine create greater transmission, but it also fails to protect against critical illness, especially for those who need the protection the most. Even the studies that continue to rely on old data – before the vaccines fully waned – show that the protection against critical illness doesn't really work for the immunocompromised.

A new study from Sweden published as a preprint in the Lancet claims that the vaccine efficacy against serious illness is still holding up. There's just one catch. ""The effectiveness against severe illness seems to remain high through 9 months, although not for men, older frail individuals, and individuals with comorbidities,"" conclude the authors. Well, isn't that why we needed a vaccine in the first place? Even the Swedish study shows that after 210 days, there is zero efficacy against symptomatic infection, after which there seems to be negative efficacy. Researchers found just 52% efficacy against severe illness in all men after six months, which means you can no longer count on it for protection.

It's also important to remember that many people in Sweden – more than most other countries – already had the infection, possibly asymptomatically. So, it's possible that the efficacy of the shots is being overstated because some of those people benefited from natural immunity.

Thus, where are we nine to 12 months after the shot? Negative efficacy against symptomatic infection for all, as witnessed by the hard data in places like the U.K. and Ireland, and very low and spotty efficacy for serious illness, going down to zero for those who need it the most. But this is not cost-free. Who is to say that the effectiveness against severe illness won't go negative as well, following some sort of pattern of antibody dependent disease enhancement? Moreover, who's to say more mass vaccination of children and boosters for adults won't create even more viral immune escape that will strengthen the virus and subject people to the risks of the shots without even protecting them for another month against these new self-perpetuated mutations?



This week, the Irish parliament was issued a ""stark"" warning from health officials about the growing threat of the virus. During sane times, policy leaders would reject the definition of insanity by engaging in introspection and changing course from existing failed policies. Yet in their warped minds, no matter how much the vaccines make the virus worse, you can always vaccinate more! So long as there is a single human being who didn't receive the latest number shot, there's always a way to project the viral enhancement on those who didn't create it.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-hopkins-analysis-showing-covid-19-has-relatively-no-effect-on-deaths-in-us-retracted,2021-10-28
Horowitz: Is Europe getting crushed by variant completely immune to COVID shots?,"With a 62.7% vaccination rate, Austria not only has a higher rate than the U.S., but most of the population has been vaccinated relatively recently, which should give those people better protection. Yet the country is experiencing its most prolific outbreak ever, as we are seeing across the globe, with a near-perfect inverse relationship between vaccination rates and COVID case rates. Now, Austria and other European countries are staring down the barrel of a completely new mutation, which German researchers believe might be completely immune to the vaccine-mediated antibodies.

According to Our World in Data, the Central European countries and the Baltic states currently have the highest case rates per capita in the world.

Most of them have higher case rates per million people than the U.S. ever had, but nearly all of them have recently been vaccinated. Slovenia now has over 1,300 cases per million, more than six times the rate in the U.S. Its vaccination rate is comparable to ours, except that most people were more recently vaccinated, which, if anything, should give them more immunity. Other Central and Eastern European states getting hammered have lower vaccination rates, but the Baltic states have higher rates. Then, of course, there is Ireland, with the highest vaccination rate in the EU, yet cases are surging, particularly in the parts of the country that have near 100% vaccination among adults.

We already know from the U.K. data, the most granular and continuous of all world data, that the vaccine has negative efficacy against cases and increasingly low efficacy against critical illness, as over 82% of all deaths are among the vaccinated, according to the most recent weekly report from the U.K. Health Security Agency data. Now, according to a new study, Europe is likely experiencing a wave of a new variant that is completely immune to all the shots, a wave that will make anyone in the U.S. who has not experienced prior infection and does not have a plan for early treatment susceptible to serious illness.

Trial Site News is reporting on a study from German and Czech researchers who conducted genomic analysis from samples in the border region between Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. They found that the predominant strain is no longer Delta. It is, in fact, a sublineage of the U.K.'s Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant, known as B.1.1.7, and is likely responsible for the rapid surge throughout Europe. They believe it is the predominant strain in the Czech Republic, Austria, and Slovakiaand that this mutant is ""3.2 fold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies as compared to other B.1.1.7 variants tested, indicating potential for immune evasion.""

The research was funded by the German Ministry of Health, and the lead researcher was Buqing Yi, Ph.D., of the Institute of Medical Microbiology and Virology, Carl Gustav Carus Hospital.

Ironically, Austria's Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg threatened the unvaccinated with a lockdown if cases continue to rise, even though they are likely rising because the vaccine created viral immune escape. Like the prophets of Baal in the Bible, the more these countries vaccinate and face an even more virulent virus, the more they cry out to the same failed gods and blame everyone else for their failures. In reality, as top vaccinologists like Geert Vanden Bossche and Luc Montagnier warned, mass vaccination with a narrow-spectrum vaccine that produces suboptimal antibodies is an obvious candidate for vaccine-mediated viral immune escape.

Denmark, with nearly all adults vaccinated, many of them more recently, is experiencing a surge and is now seeking to reinstate vaccine passports. When will these people ever take responsibility for their own failures rather than instigating a blood libel against those who clearly have nothing to do with the spread?

Just consider the fact that the case rates are much higher in every age group over 30 in the U.K. among the vaccinated. In the case of 40- to 49-year-olds, the case rate is 2.3 times higher among the vaccinated!

In Singapore, they are now saying that the government will not cover the cost of medical care for those without the shots, even though nearly all adults in the country are vaccinated. Yet despite that fact, they now have the worst surge ever, averaging what would be the equivalent of 800 deaths a day in the U.S. And that is high for Singapore, given the population's excellent health status and low obesity rates. The fact that this is much worse than ever before – following universal vaccination – is a clear indictment of the vaccine, yet that is what happens in a global blood libel.

The scary implication of this reality of record cases post-vaccination and new mutants completely immune to vaccine antibodies is that we are now forcing a dangerous vaccine that only has risk and almost zero benefit. Take Austria, for example, where the vaccines clearly are not working. According to Fact Sheet Austria, which downloaded excess death data straight from the government's sources, there has been a 33% increase in excess deaths through week 40 of this year for 15- to 24-year-old males and a 21% increase in deaths for 25- to 34-year-olds. It makes no sense to blame those deaths on the virus, because the number of COVID deaths in those age cohorts accounted for just a handful of people. Also, excess deaths among females in that age cohort were down.



Clearly this is another disturbing signal about possible cardiovascular issues among younger males who get the shots. Which would also explain why so many young male athletes are suddenly dropping like flies.

If we continue to follow the path of a failed vaccine-only strategy to this pandemic, we will wind up with a ton of excess deaths and no treatment for COVID when the shots fail. The question now is which will be the first state to change course from Pfi$er's greedy and selfish strategy that succeeds in nothing but lining its own pockets.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-irish-county-with-99-7-vaccination-rate-has-highest-covid-case-rate,2021-11-10
Horowitz: Is it time for unvaccinated passports?,"If a suspicion that vaccine-free people are spreading a virus would necessitate and justify vaccine passports, then shouldn’t the reality of vaccinated people spreading the virus at higher rates necessitate and justify “unvaccinated passports”? After all, if the shots really work so amazingly against serious illness — a premise undermined by Scottish data — the vaccinated by definition cannot be harmed by the unvaccinated. On the other hand, if the vaccinated are really unnaturally spreading the virus at a higher rate, there is the potential for worse outcomes with some form of vaccine-mediated viral enhancement, as was observed with the unvaccinated chickens devastated by the chickens vaccinated with the leaky Marek’s disease shot.

While none of us support such apartheid in either direction, if this is really about “following the science,” the continuous granular data from the U.K. would justify “unvaccinated passport” requirements to live a functional life. This chart made by my friend Don Wolt from data culled from the U.K’s latest weekly vaccine surveillance report is worth a million shots:

The negative efficacy for the double-vaxxed was so appalling that the U.K. has jettisoned that data point and now only compares the rates of infection for the unvaxxed to the triple-vaxxed. But even the boosters have evidently already gone into negative efficacy territory. As you can see, for the first time, the rate of infection among the triple-vaxxed, even for the 18- to 29-year-old cohort, is now higher than that of the unvaccinated. The degree of negative efficacy for all the older groups continues to increase in each weekly report, demonstrating a troubling trend of the vaccine making people more vulnerable to infection even quicker than we saw with the double-vaxxed last year. Unlike with all the vaccine-free adult cohorts, the infection rate actually got worse in this week’s report in several age cohorts among the vaccinated.

The latest numbers measure the infection rate from the last week in December through the first three weeks of January.

Here is the raw data from table 13 showing the negative efficacy even of the triple-vaxxed relative to the unvaccinated in the adult cohorts:

How are none of the public health officials concerned about this trend? They tried to claim that the two shots really needed a third dose in order to work. However, we are seeing the booster go negative on an even shorter timetable than the original doses. How can someone look at these numbers and not conclude that the shots are problematic? Why is there no concern that a shot that seems to make someone more likely to get the virus is also causing vaccine-mediated enhancement in the form of either antibody dependent disease enhancement (ADE) or original antigenic sin?

Consider the fact that CDC Director Rochelle Walensky was evidently shocked to find out, half a year after the shots were released, that they did not stop transmission. In an interview with the New York Times, Walensky describes the moment she realized the injection didn’t stop transmission as a “heart sink.” How could she not have known this was a non-sterilizing vaccine from the beginning? And if she didn’t know it failed to stop transmission, and now we see it goes negative over time – even after a booster – then how can we be sure she understands the concept of ADE and vaccine-mediated viral enhancement? With vaccines, a half a loaf is not better than no loaf; it’s often a poisonous loaf.

Moreover, notice how quick the CDC was to terminate the monoclonal antibodies based on the premise that they don’t work for Omicron, but somehow the vaccine-induced antibodies, which were even more outdated, would still work, even as the triple-vaxxed rack up greater infection rates.



As such, what will it take to finally start investigating the correlation between the shots and some form of viral enhancement? Everyone knows that the testing ground for the vaccines is Israel. Ninety percent of the people there are double-vaxxed, 80% are triple-vaxxed, and unlike in any other country, 500,000 people are quadruple-vaxxed. So how are they doing? Israel now has more recorded cases so far in January than all of 2021 combined. Even if the country ramped up its testing rates, we should not be seeing such results. The Israelis now have the highest per capita infection rate in the world. The country with the most vaccines is the country with the most cases. Compare theses results to low-vaccinated South Africa:

Israel does test at a high rate, but so does India, which has a much lower vaccination rate:

What is particularly disturbing is that Israel also has a pretty high rate of ICU admissions for something as mild as Omicron. Israel’s COVID ICU admission rate per 1 million people is now higher than during the winter 2021 peak, which was during a more virulent strain and with very few people vaccinated. Here is a comparison to the U.K. and Denmark, two countries that experienced a prolific Omicron wave this month:

No wonder Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla admitted to CNBC that the shots seem “to produce not very durable immune protection so it’s going to be coming again and again.” But what we are seeing from the canary in the coal mine country is not just a lack of durability, but a clear warning of negative efficacy. Why is nobody demanding a suspension of all the shots until a full investigation is made to see if this is causing ADE, as Fauci himself cautioned Mark Zuckerberg during a March 2020 interview?

Now consider the fact that after everything we know about the safety and efficacy of these shots, and clearly everything we know Fauci himself understands about imperfect vaccines, he is nonetheless pushing this shot on babies and toddlers – three doses’ worth!

Two years into this circuitous cycle of failure, it’s time for the very people complaining about the failure to stop wagging their fingers, ascribing blame, and dictating the next failed course of action. It’s time for them to look in the mirror.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-is-europe-getting-crushed-by-variant-completely-immune-to-covid-shots,2022-01-31
Horowitz: E-MASK-ulation: How we have been lied to so dramatically about masks,"If you are looking for the scientific rationale behind universal mask-wearing, you certainly won't find it now that the issue has become as political as guns, abortion, and taxes. We are now at a point where Canada's chief public health officer is calling on people to wear masks when engaging in sexual activities and 19-month-old babies are being forced to wear them on airplanes. There is no rational thought in a political cult. But what did the governmental and scientific literature say on the issue before it became political?

On April 3, already several weeks into the unprecedented lockdown over coronavirus, but before the big media push for universal masking, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued guidance for respiratory protection for workers exposed to people with the virus. It stated clearly what governments had said all along about other forms of airborne contamination, such as smoke inhalation — ""Surgical masks and eye protection (e.g., face shields, goggles) were provided as an interim measure to protect against splashes and large droplets (note: surgical masks are not respirators and do not provide protection against aerosol-generating procedures).""

In other words, they knew that because the virions of coronavirus are roughly 100 nanometers, 1/100,000 the width of a hair and 1/30 the size of surgical mask filtrations (about 3.0 microns or 3,000 nanometers), surgical masks (not to mention cloth ones) do not help. This would explain why experience has shown that all of the places with universal mask orders in place for months, such as Japan, Hong Kong, Israel, France, Peru, Philippines, Hawaii, California, and Miami, failed to stave off the spread of the infection. Surgical masks could possibly stop large droplets from those coughing with very evident symptoms, but would not stop the flow of aerosolized airborne particles, certainly not from asymptomatic individuals.

This is why the CDC, as late as May, was citing the 10 randomized controlled trials that showed ""no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks."" The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford also summarized six international studies which ""showed that masks alone have no significant effect in interrupting the spread of ILI or influenza in the general population, nor in healthcare workers.""

When Dr. Fauci spoke so assertively against universal mask-wearing early on in the epidemic, it was clearly based on this knowledge. ""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask,"" infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told ""60 Minutes"" on March 8. He went on to explain that masks can only block large droplets, they give a false sense of security, and they cause people to get more germs on their hands by fiddling with it. Those facts don't change with time.

Several weeks later, Surgeon General Jerome Adams punctuated this point about the counterproductivity of wearing masks in public. Appearing on ""Fox & Friends"" on March 31, Adams said that based on a study that shows medical students who wear masks touch their faces 23 times more often, one has to assume that ""wearing a mask improperly can actually increase your risk of getting disease.""

Ever since then, we have all seen how people leave masks in their pockets or cars for days and continuously put it on and off as needed without washing their hands. It's inconceivable that this is not serving as a bacteria trap, if not downright helping spread the virus on our hands.

A 2015 randomized clinical trial from the University of South Wales testing the effectiveness of cloth masks among health care workers in Hanoi found that the poor filtration becomes a conduit for moisture retention. Researchers found a high rate of infection among those workers presumably because ""their reuse and poor filtration may explain the increased risk of infection."" Can you imagine how much worse this is in a non-health-care setting where reuse and cross-contamination are rampant?

This is why before mask-wearing became a cult in Canada, Quebec's public health director Horacio Arruda told the Montreal Gazette that masks are counterproductive. Arruda's guidance as given in the article states that masks ""get saturated with moisture from the mouth and nose after about 20 minutes. Once they're wet, they no longer form a barrier against viruses trying to come through or exit."" This renders the daylong mask wearing in businesses, stores, and schools, as opposed to the short onetime use in clinical settings, a complete hazard to spread of bacteria and pathogens.

Nothing about the biology of the virus or our discovery of it has changed in the past few months that would lead us to believe that masks are somehow more effective against it than they are against the spread of other respiratory viruses. What has changed is the politics. Governments could no longer control our lives through wholesale lockdowns, because it was logistically untenable, so they created the mask mandate as a way of permanently controlling our movement. They wisely did this on the heels of the full-scale lockdown when people were grateful just to be back in business under any conditions and were desperately willing to do anything to stave off a shutdown.

Dr. Jeffery Klausner, an infectious disease doctor at UCLA, described mask-wearing in early February as all psychological, not physiological. He told the Los Angeles Times that ""fear spreads a lot faster than the virus"" and that a mask only ""makes you feel better."" What is so dangerous about this is that, as Fauci and others originally warned when they were actually speaking from a modicum of scientific grounding, is that many immunocompromised people will go to dangerous places thinking the mask protects them. I've seen countless friends and neighbors who are concerned about their heart conditions and diabetes blissfully walk around indoors thinking the mask is their shield.



This is why Swedish epidemiologist Anders Tegnell warned that because scientific evidence for mask-wearing to prevent COVID-19 is ""astonishingly weak,"" it is ""very dangerous"" to believe that face masks on their own could control the spread of the disease rather than hand washing or, in the case of those who are seriously ill, staying away from indoor gatherings. He would know, because his country barely has any cases left, and almost nobody in Sweden wears a mask.

The Dutch government made the prudent decision of only requiring masks on public transit when people are really close to each other for a limited period of time. With such scant evidence of the effectiveness of mask-wearing, how can we disrupt lives of children in school, businessmen in offices, and even people walking outdoors in some countries and states? ""From a medical point of view, there is no evidence of a medical effect of wearing face masks, so we decided not to impose a national obligation,"" said Netherlands Medical Care Minister Tamara van Ark in August.

The Danish supposedly commissioned a randomized clinical trial to study mask effectiveness specifically as it relates to protecting against SARS-CoV-2, but despite promises of imminent release weeks ago, the study has not been published. Henning Bundgaard, chief physician at Denmark's Rigshospitale, noted, ""All these countries recommending face masks haven't made their decisions based on new studies."" It doesn't appear that anyone else is interested in finding out the truth.

Even in England, where there is more mask-wearing than in some of the other northern European countries, Public Health England concluded, ""There is weak evidence from epidemiological and modelling studies that mask wearing in the community may contribute to reducing the spread of COVID-19 and that early intervention may result in a lower peak infection rate.""

Our own U.S. government has failed to produce new evidence that counters years' worth of evidence that masks don't work in stopping respiratory viruses and is still producing evidence to the contrary. In June, HHS' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality funded a systemic review of all relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of mask-wearing in stopping respiratory infections and published the findings in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The conclusion was as clear as it is jarring to the current cult-like devotion to mask-wearing. ""Review of RCTs indicates that N95 respirators and surgical masks are probably associated with similar risk for influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed viral infections in high- and low-risk settings."" The study noted that only one trial did show ""a small decrease in risk"" for infection when doctors wore N95s in high-risk settings, but even that evidence was scant.

The study looked at eight trials with 6,510 participants that ""evaluated use of surgical masks within households with an influenza or influenza-like illness index case (child or adult). Compared with no masks, surgical masks were not associated with decreased risk for clinical respiratory illness, influenza-like illness, or laboratory-confirmed viral illness in household contacts when masks were worn by household contacts, index cases, or both."" Remember, Dr. Deborah Birx, the Coronavirus Task Force coordinator, is now saying people should wear masks even at home?

How have we gone from public officials universally warning about the lack of effectiveness plus the potential to spread germs from masks to mandating that young children who are germ factories wear them all day in school – without even a legislative debate or public hearings?

The answer is that we have become emasculated as a society. We have become a people who are willing to surrender every morsel of our liberty at the ever-changing and capricious whims of ""public health officials,"" even when they are appallingly contradictory and without any evidence justifying the 180-degree U-turn.

During times of panic, opportunistic politicians in positions of power will always latch on to desperate and regressive ideas to infringe upon liberty, while packaging them as some sort of enlightened advancement in technology or understanding. In reality, these same desperate measures were tried in 1918, and even then, it was understood that they didn't work. A November 16, 1918, headline of the Santa Barbara Daily News read, ""Average Person Doesn't Know How to Take Care of Mask and It Becomes Veritable Bacteria Incubator.""

Many principles in life are inviolable and do not change with time. We used to understand that mask-wearing was a novelty of Halloween. Now, our passivity has allowed our entire country to become a Halloween nightmare masquerade every day, with no end in sight.

Horowitz: Lockdowns and vaccines have failed nursing home residents. Proactive treatment is the answer.,"The entire purpose of the stunningly rushed shots was to protect the frail, elderly, and immunocompromised. Yet they are precisely the ones for whom the vaccine has failed – to the point that the CDC is now pushing a fourth shot of the same failed concoction even as the virus has already changed. Nineteen months into this pandemic, we are still locking down nursing home patients, inducing atrophy, aggravating dementia and heartbreak, depleting their vitamin D levels, and offering them no real solutions to the virus either.

Watch carefully and you will see that, for the most part, nursing home residents have disappeared from the news cycle. It's not because they are no longer dying of the virus. In fact, they are dying from the virus and likely from the lockdowns and the shots as well. It's now clear that the shots are only causing harm and are not saving these residents, as evidenced by the fact that lockdowns still continue.

Wisconsin media is reporting that nursing home deaths have doubled this month in the state despite near-universal vaccination rates. They, of course, blame the staff for not having quite as high a vaccination rate, but their deflection misses the point. If the vaccines work, then it shouldn't matter who else gets them. They are now pushing the Pfizer boosters, even though all the Wisconsin nursing home residents initially got the Moderna vaccine because, you know, ""mix and match"" is just so ""sciencey.""

Nationwide, nursing home deaths have increased more than six-fold from July through September, according to the AAPR's dashboard. Although the numbers are still nowhere near where they were at the beginning of the pandemic, that is likely because a large percentage of them already got the virus and acquired more robust natural immunity, which the injection worshipers dogmatically deny. But among those who have not acquired immunity, they face a likely harrowing winter wave.

What's the solution from the medical establishment? Continued endless boosters that come at a great risk to seniors, while still locking them down. The CDC is now recommending a fourth shot for anyone above 18 if they are ""moderately to severely immunocompromised"" and regardless of whether they initially got the vaccine series from Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson.

This raises the following questions:

If the vaccines are not working for those who need them the most, why are we continuing them, especially as the virus keeps changing, possibly because of the immune pressure placed on them by suboptimal antibodies from the shots?

Why is there no concern that these individuals will die even quicker from the atrophy, lockdown, and heartbreak (even after getting the shots)?

Why is there no concern that the shots themselves are killing frail seniors? We all assume that the shots are definitely worth the risk given the high risk of COVID for that population, but if they are not working anyway, isn't it time we investigate how many of them are dying from the shots? One study conducted by the Norwegian Medicines Agency, which examined the first 100 nursing home patients to subsequently die after having gotten the Pfizer shots, found a causal link between the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and death to be ""likely"" in 10 of the 100 cases, ""possible"" in 26 cases, and ""unlikely"" in in only 59 of the cases. CMS Medicare data points to a much greater death toll among seniors than is being reported to the CDC's VAERS. And remember, a large percentage likely have natural immunity. Why are they not being tested for antibodies or T cells before they take the risky and quite ineffective jab?

Why is there no concern that these residents will die during the immediate aftermath of the shot, when people are actually the most vulnerable to COVID because the shots suppress your immune system for a few weeks before ramping up the antibodies?

The absurdity of our nursing home strategy is borne out in a letter obtained by TheBlaze from a nursing home in northern Indiana. A staff email announced that 20 of the 22 residents and staff who tested positive last week were vaccinated (and likely all the residents). So, what's the solution? Rather than announcing a plan to get all the elderly on a preventive regimen of vitamins, supplements, and ivermectin, they say they ""will be keeping residents in their rooms as much as we possibly can"" and promote an aggressive campaign for boosters of an outdated concoction that no longer works!

Imagine if we simply give these residents the fast-acting active form of vitamin D known as calcifediol, which can boost their D levels from close to zero to over 50 within hours. Studies have shown that one is 14 times more likely to die from COVID with vitamin D deficiency and almost never dies with a level over 50 ng/ml. Imagine if we simply have them use preventive ivermectin twice a week. Studies show most wouldn't even get the virus, and if they do it would be mild. By now, there should have been COVID doctors in every nursing home to immediately treat anyone with symptoms on day one.



Just using fluvoxamine alone reduced hospitalizations by 66% and deaths by 91% in a recent study. Patriot doctors have been using several cheap therapeutics like this for a year and a half and could have saved hundreds of thousands of people had their success been embraced rather than censored. A forthcoming study by Dr. Thomas Borody, regarded by many in the gastroenterology field as one of the world's leading GI doctors, will show that a 10-day regiment of ivermectin 24mg/day, doxycycline 100mg BID, and zinc 50mg per day reduced hospitalizations by 92% and deaths by 100%.

At some point, these questions need to be answered. We can't take people who often only have one to three years left to their lives and essentially kill them with atrophy and heartbreak from lockdowns and inject them with risky shots that likely kill some of them and accelerate their deaths without providing more than a few months of benefit – if that. A handful of pills per week could solve the issue. But perhaps we are trying to solve a very different issue than the medical establishment is.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-lied-to-dramatically-about-masks,2021-10-29
Horowitz: Man with prior infection denied kidney transplant for refusing to get COVID shot,"Someone with prior COVID infection can play in the NCAA without getting a shot, but someone who recovered from the virus and needs a kidney cannot get a transplant in many parts of the country. Hospitals are now requiring all patients to get a shot that has proven to barely stimulate immunity for immunocompromised people with failing organs, even if they have more robust natural immunity. The latest case of UVA Health denying a kidney to Shamgar Connors is as immoral as it is illogical and anti-science.

Shamgar Connors told Newsmax’s Grant Stinchfield last week that he was dropped from the active kidney transplant waiting list at UVA Health in Charlottesville, Virginia, for refusing to get the COVID shots. ""I have natural immunity now,” said Shamgar, who is in stage V kidney failure and on dialysis every day. “It's like, why would I get a vaccine now for something I'm immune to, that's like saying I need a vaccine for chicken pox after I had it.""

This is the point Connors made to Dr. Karen Warburton, the nephrologist at UVA Health, who informed him that he would be dropped from the donor list without the shots. Connors recorded the phone conversation with Warburton, in which she clearly was unaware of any of the academic papers regarding the efficacy of the shots vs. natural immunity, particularly for those who are immunocompromised.

UVA denying me a kidney transplant because i refuse to get the vaxx www.youtube.com

When Connors told her he already had COVID, Warburton said, “You may have had Delta, and that may not protect you against the Omicron variant, which is what we’re seeing now.”

The problem with that statement is that although it’s true that one can get Omicron despite prior infection, the vaccines appear to work even less than prior infection! Moreover, even before Omicron, there was no evidence that the shots protected organ transplant patients with robust immunity, and quite the contrary, one study clearly showed that prior infection provided much better immunity against serious illness in solid organ transplant patients than the shots.

While the notion that someone concerned with the risk of the shots would be denied a transplant is shocking, the only rationale one could conceive is that they don’t want to “waste” a kidney on someone they believe might die from COVID. But if that is the rationale, then the shots themselves offer very little protection, not nearly as much as natural infection. Moreover, it shows that not only are nephrologists who engage in this discrimination against science, they are also derelict in their duty of treating organ transplant patients with known therapeutics that work as opposed to relying upon failed shots.

Researchers at Toronto's University Health Network (UHN) Transplant Centre studied the T cell responses in organ transplant patients who had prior infection without the shots vs. those who had the shots without prior infection. The science shows the exact opposite of what Dr. Warburton told this man in dire need of a transplant.

""Vaccinated SOTRs mounted significantly lower proportions of S-specific polyfunctional CD4 + T-cells after two doses, relative to unvaccinated SOTRs with prior COVID-19,"" concluded the authors of the study, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases last month. ""Together, these results suggest that SOTR generate robust T-cell responses following natural infection that correlate with disease severity but generate comparatively lower T-cell responses following mRNA vaccination.""

In other words, even immunocompromised people will likely mount a strong enough T cell response to ensure that even if they get reinfected, they will not get seriously ill. Yet, those without prior infection but with the shots showed very little T cell response even 4-6 weeks after the shots – the sweet spot of the vaccine’s efficacy. And again, that was against the previous variants, not Omicron, which clearly does not respond to the shots.

It was known from early on that the shots had very limited efficacy for organ transplant patients. In April 2021, Mayo Clinic researchers published their findings in the American Journal of Transplantation that solid organ transplant patients enjoy limited antibody responses from the shots. “We report seven SOTs with undetectable or low titer antispike antibodies who developed COVID-19 infection after receiving one or two doses of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine,” wrote the authors in a letter to the journal. “The clinical presentation and course of these patients were comparable to those of SOTs who had COVID-19 infection and have not been vaccinated.”

A Hopkins study published as a letter in JAMA last March found that only 17% of a sample of 436 organ transplant patients had detectable antibodies from the Moderna shots. “Our study shows that [immunity] is unlikely for most transplant patients, and one could guess that our findings could also apply to other immunosuppressed patients, such as those with autoimmune conditions,” Johns Hopkins University surgeon Dorry Segev wrote in Medpage Today.

In other words, rather than lying to these patients and giving them false hope in the shots, they should be working on treatments. This past month I have referred two kidney transplant patients to doctors willing to treat them for COVID after their nephrologists offered them nothing when their COVID shots failed to stimulate immunity. They both responded well to treatments, which included prednisone, ivermectin, nebulized budesonide, and several other treatments that didn’t interact with the medications they were on.

One of those doctors aggressively treating COVID in vulnerable patients among friends of mine was Dr. Richard Amerling, a board-certified internist and nephrologist. “Once transplanted, organ recipients respond poorly to vaccination,” said Amerling. “Early treatment is their best option. Dosages of various immunosuppressive drugs may need adjustment, with close monitoring of serum levels. Monoclonal antibody treatment is probably safe and effective, but should also be studied. Based on known nephrotoxicity, remedesivir should not be used.”



Amerling notes that “a randomized controlled trial in patients with advanced kidney failure is needed before recommending, let alone requiring, vaccination. Adverse events in the highly vulnerable population could be considerable.” He warns that “the denial of organ transplantation based on unvaccinated status is anti-scientific, anti-Hippocratic, and highly unethical. It is an extreme example of ‘one-size-fits-all’ protocol/guideline-based medicine.

Yet, without any evidence, doctors are denying transplants. “The science is pretty clear on the vaccine,” said Dr. Warburton to Mr. Connors. Well, indeed it’s clear that transplant patients could never count on the shots for their lives, which is why most of them are still locked in their homes. The science is also pretty clear that the vaccine does not work against Omicron, and if anything, seems to stimulate the virus more than the unvaccinated.

The hospital rate among the vaccinated is now higher than the unvaccinated in Scotland, and the case rates are even higher. According to an Israeli study, even four shots don’t work against Omicron. The only thing that clearly works is early treatment. For doctors to deny early treatment to all patients, and now kidney transplants to those without shots that neither affect other people nor stimulate robust immunity for themselves, is reminiscent of very dark times in history.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-lockdowns-and-vaccines-have-failed-nursing-home-residents-proactive-treatment-is-the-answer,2022-01-18
Horowitz: Moderna pushing high-dose shot for babies who are in no danger from COVID,"Would red-state governors tolerate a federally funded program to distribute abortifacients in their states? Well, these same governors need to make it clear that Pfizer and Moderna are the new Planned Parenthood and are not welcome to distribute their poison shots in their states, especially for babies.

The pandemic has basically been declared over, babies and toddlers were never in danger, the shots no longer work, and they have been proven devastating in adverse events, even with the amount of long-term consequences we see. Yet both Pfizer and Moderna are in the process of senselessly and cruelly targeting the youngest children for the COVID shots. However, there is something particularly concerning about Moderna’s shot, in that the company is proposing to use a 25-milligram dose on babies 6 months to 2 years old, more than eight times the dose of Pfizer’s baby shot!

We are talking about kids weighing 15-25 pounds, and they are giving a dose that is almost as big as Pfizer’s adult dose. It’s one-fourth the dosage of Moderna’s adult dose, but that is still a much greater concentration for an average 6-month baby than it is for an adult of 160 pounds. How could anyone think this is safe?

Here’s what is really going on. All of the Pfizer and Moderna studies even for older children have shown zero serious COVID cases in the respective placebo groups. So in order to show efficacy, they created arbitrary benchmarks for presence of specific antibody levels generated by the shots. Putting aside the fact that high antibody levels without the proper T cell responses are actually not a good thing, fail to provide sterilizing immunity, and potentially cause autoimmune problems, the drug companies are caught in a catch-22 with dosage. Pfizer rightly tested those under 5 years old with a 3-milligram dose. But then it failed to stimulate a proper antibody response, which is why the company had to temporarily withdraw its application for EUA.

Moderna, on the other hand, figured they’d solve the problem by giving babies and toddlers a whopping 25-milligram dose. Even then, they misleadingly tethered their study of 2- to 4-year-olds to 5- and 6-year-olds in order to even register this illusory efficacy. However, any sane person on the FDA advisory committee should automatically nix this shot on account of its dangerous concentration for babies who, at just 6 months, average (for girls) as light as 16 pounds. Thus, while a 20-year-old adult weighing 180 pounds could be getting 0.55 micrograms per pound with the 100-microgram dose, a 6-month-old baby could be getting more than 1.5 micrograms per pound, roughly three times as potent. And we already know how problematic the adult concentration of Moderna was for many young adults, especially related to cardiac issues.

Then again, the entire premise of approving this shot at any dose for babies is taking a chapter out of Josef Mengele’s book of human experiments. By definition, there is zero emergency now, and even at the peak of the pandemic, there was no emergency for young children. There was, by definition, zero efficacy against serious illness, and they claim 37%-43% efficacy against infection for the various age groups. However, what are the consequences of getting an infection if it’s not serious? They report 17% of the kids got fever from the shots! So you are giving them fever and something that can induce several thousand ailments and maladies long-term (with no long-term safety data) for the 40% chance of … avoiding fever from the virus!

Also, the FDA plainly stated (p. 10) that “a point estimate for a placebo controlled efficacy trial of at least 50%” must be demonstrated in the trial in order to receive emergency use authorization. Moderna’s own untransparent data demonstrates the shot has not met the threshold for consideration

But that’s assuming you believe the 40% efficacy the way you believed the 90%+ efficacy against the original strain in the first adult studies. Now, if you believe there is still even a 40% VE rate against Omicron, especially against infection, after every single country-based analysis of real-world data showed negative efficacy since the beginning of Omicron (and U.K. data showed it even in Delta), I have a biolab to sell you in Wuhan. According to the U.K. Health Security Agency’s most recent report, efficacy against infection for some age groups is now lower than -300%.



But let’s play Charlie Brown in the football game with Lucy for a moment and assume that this time, they are telling the truth about 37%-43% efficacy against infection. Even the most conservative estimates of the adverse events from thousands of maladies detailed in Pfizer’s own document now released via FOIA demonstrate how it is immoral to market this to any child. Moderna has failed to disclose the number and types of adverse events. What it did divulge, however, is concerning. “The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate and were more frequently reported after dose two,” read the press release. The majority were mild or moderate, which means that a good number of them could have been significant. It also means that a minority but still measurable number of the adverse events were severe. How many and what type? They don’t say.

Remember how a number of countries banned Moderna’s shot for those under 30 because it caused exponentially more myocarditis than even Pfizer , presumably because of the higher dose? Iceland completely banned it . And this is when the shot was alleged to be more effective and for older strains of the virus. Now, they are using an expired shot for babies at a massive dose – much greater per pound – knowing the cardiac issues. Moreover, Moderna has been even less transparent than Pfizer, so we don’t even have its list of known adverse events the company is undoubtedly quietly monitoring. This is no longer malpractice but downright Third Reich-level malfeasance.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-man-with-prior-infection-denied-kidney-transplant-for-refusing-to-get-covid-shot,2022-03-28
Horowitz: More than money: GDP loss from lockdowns will cost millions of life years,"In 1957, America was faced with a flu-like virus that had a similar fatality rate to COVID-19 and was even more disruptive in some ways. Yet, Americans understood that these viruses cannot be stopped, and they slogged along without shutting down their economy and infringing upon liberties. Which, as I mentioned before, is why almost nobody living at the time remembers it. Contrast that to 2020 when we have compounded inevitable viral deaths with avoidable man-made deaths from lockdown – no matter how much these policies fail to deliver.

On July 30, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released the GDP numbers for second quarter and revealed that the economy had contracted by an unfathomable 32.9%. This number shocks the conciseness and blows out the worst quarter of the Great Depression, yet the announcement barely stayed in the news cycle beyond a few hours. But behind that loss of money is a loss of life that few are trying to quantify and balance against the policies that have induced this misery.

In May, four professors with backgrounds ranging from medicine to economics attempted to quantify the number of lives lost from the devastation of the lockdown itself – something our government failed to simulate when it embarked on this novel policy. They used a formula based on government data assuming one life lost from suicide, alcohol or drug abuse, or stress-induced illnesses per $17 million of economy productivity lost. Now that we have hard data of GDP losses, I wanted to revisit those numbers.

According to BEA, the current‑dollar GDP decreased by $2.15 trillion in the second quarter and by $186.3 billion in the first quarter, primarily in the final days of March. The total loss of $2.3 trillion in GDP is roughly in line with what Scott Atlas of Stanford University's Hoover Institution, John Birge of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Ralph Keeney of Duke University, and Alexander Lipton of the Jerusalem Business School of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem predicted in their May article in The Hill.com.

Using their formula of one life lost per $17 million in decreased economic productivity, that would equal roughly 137,000 lives lost just from the drop in economic activity through June. Those numbers have likely grown by tens of thousands over the past five weeks, and based on the trajectory of our existing problems, will continue for months on end. In other words, the death toll just from the economic stress alone (not to mention the delayed health care) will be more than the eventual excess deaths from COVID-19.

But it's worse than that. Most people who die from the virus are at or above the age of life expectancy. Even Neil Ferguson of the Imperial College of London, the primary advocate for lockdown policies, predicted that two-thirds of the fatalities would be among people who would have died within the year. Contrast that to a younger generation of adults and even children who are now committing suicide and overdosing on drugs due to the disproportionate anxiety and social isolation being imposed upon their lives thanks to the national masochism and panic. This will result in millions of years of live lost.

Just take drug deaths in Davidson County (Nashville), Tennessee, for example. Even with our liberal counting, there have only been 205 coronavirus deaths. At the same time, from March through July 25, there have been 354 fatal drug overdoses. Drug overdose deaths are up 47% this year in Davidson County. That alone accounts for a good chunk of the excess deaths. The deaths will likely skyrocket in the future because so many more are getting hooked on the drugs now, as indicated by the non-fatal ER visits in recent months that will likely translate into fatalities later on because of intractable addiction. Here is a look at the rate of increase in drug-related ER visits, according to the Davidson County Health Department:

And most of these deaths are among young adults who have many years left to their lives.

This is just a snapshot of the real-life consequences of treating every virus case as if it's stage 4 pancreatic cancer. It winds up taking priority over every other social, medical, and economic consideration. The tragic irony is that none of these policies have even helped reduce the fatalities from the virus itself, even with this myopic and paranoid focus of our government and society.

A new research paper published in JAMA Network reveals that the mean weekly number of new cancers diagnosed plummeted by 46.4% for six forms of cancer: breast, colorectal, lung, gastric, pancreatic, and esophageal. No, the virus is not that novel – it doesn't cure cancer. It means that in our paranoid obsession over coronavirus, treating it as if it is worse than cancer, has ensured that so many would-be stage 3 diagnoses will not be caught until stage 4. What ever happened to the trope – “if we can only save one life….""?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-moderna-pushing-high-dose-shot-for-babies-who-are-in-no-danger-from-covid,2020-08-06
Horowitz: New study shows 17 years of potential T cell immunity in SARS-infected patients,"God has a way of prepping the human body for potentially deadly viruses to somewhat mitigate the amount of death we'd otherwise suffer every year from all sorts of microbiological threats. COVID-19 is not different.

The latest research on T cells, white blood cells produced by the immune system to ward off infections through memory of past pathogens, show that even those patients who never develop antibodies or have lost them over time will retain T cell immunity that remembers to fight off coronaviruses in the future. Moreover, the study provides new evidence for the theory that herd immunity could be achieved at an approximately 20% infection rate for most cities, thanks to T cell cross-immunity from other coronaviruses.

The latest version of panic porn being propagated by the media is that many people don't produce antibodies and that even more of those infected will lose them over time, potentially opening them up to reinfection.

Why we automatically assume the worst of this virus and base our response on the idea of this virus defying all known patterns remains a mystery, but this study from Singapore should place the onus on naysayers to show why this form of coronavirus would be different from others.

Researchers in Singapore conducted a study, first out in preprint in May and now peer-reviewed and published at Nature, of 23 patients who recovered from SARS in 2003 and found that all 23 retained memory T cells induced by that original pathogen still in their systems. That in itself is terrific news to find this immunity after 17 years. Then they studied 36 convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patients and found that they had also produced similar T cells. While SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus and distinct from SARS-CoV-1, there is strong reason to believe that T cell memory produced by the body to protect from future relapses of this virus would not be weaker or more short-lived than T cell memory from SARS-1.

If the implications of this research turn out to be true, it would mean that all those infected with SARS-Cov-2 will retain at least partial immunity to the virus. This doesn't necessarily mean they will be fully immune. This would likely mean, for many previously infected patients, that they could theoretically test positive again with a PCR test, but the T cells would ward off the symptoms and reduce their infective capabilities to transmit to others.

But there's more good news, not just for those who have already gotten the virus but for many who may get it. Very few people in America have been exposed to SARS and would therefore not have that immunity. However, researchers have long suspected that there is cross-immunity from other coronaviruses – four of which are forms of the common cold that could account for anywhere between 15% and 30% of colds on a given year. The cross-immunity theory has been proven across other pathogens and was established during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 when many people appeared to be immune, presumably, to similar prior outbreaks of seasonal H1N1 flues.

Cross-immunity with other coronaviruses was at least partially confirmed when the researchers in the Singapore study found the samples of T cells from convalescent SARS-1 patients to have cross-reactive potential against SARS-CoV-2 during lab simulations. To test this out further on more common forms of coronavirus – OC43, HKU1, NL63, and 229E – they took samples from 37 random blood donors who had no history of SARS, COVID-19, or contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients. They found that 19 of the 37 had T cells that were reactive to SARS-CoV-2, even though they had no known exposure to this virus.

How can that be? A large portion of the population likely has at least partial cross-immunity through T cell memory cells induced by contracting one of those four common cold coronaviruses. This would explain why so many places seem to experience a burnout of the virus after it reaches only 15%-20% prevalence, according to serology tests. Yes, only 15%-20% have antibodies, but many more likely have cross-immunity through T cells, as Nobel laureate Michael Levitt, Oxford epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta, and Stanford Professor John Ioannidis predicted.

This harmonizes with a previous study from the La Joya Institute of Immunology in California that showed such cross-reactive responses in 40%-60% of random blood donors

This might also explain why so many people are found to be asymptomatic and possibly many more have had the virus asymptomatically but never tested positive for antibodies. Studies have found as many as 40% of asymptomatic patients lose antibodies after the early convalescent period. Thus, just because you find an antibody serology test implying only 5%-15% of the population has antibodies doesn't mean that an even greater portion has not already been exposed to the virus but only produced T cells to ward it off, and a certain greater percentage never even became infected with the virus because they had full immunity. A study of 200 blood donors in Sweden found twice as many samples with T cells as samples with antibodies.

Also, the same reason why someone initially got the virus asymptomatically, likely because of T cell memory produced by cross-immunity, is the same reason they will continue to be free of symptoms in the future, even if they don't possesses antibodies.

The number of people who have this cross-immunity is likely different throughout the world. One recent preprint study analyzing T cell immunity in blood donors in Germany detected ""Cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes revealed preexisting T-cell responses in 81% of unexposed individuals."" Accordingly, many people might stop making the antibodies after a few months or years, especially following a mild infection, but their immune system produces the cells that remember the recipe for defeating the virus if it returns.

While we are still learning more about this virus and the human immune system response to it every day, these findings should make us optimistic in the long run, unless the media has made us immune to any good news.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-more-than-money-gdp-loss-from-lockdowns-will-cost-millions-of-life-years,2020-07-16
Horowitz: New study shows more effective immunity from prior infection than in vaccinated among organ transplant recipients,"Few people are as immunocompromised and vulnerable to COVID as solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). Those are the people whom the medical establishment suggests should get shots and boosters early and often — even if they have to ""mix and match"" different variations of the shots. However, given the fact that these people are also the most vulnerable to complications from the pathogenic spike protein of the shots, why are doctors not first making sure they don't have natural immunity? A new study demonstrates that it is criminal to assume the risks of vaccination for SOTRs with prior infection.

We already have at least 122 studies attesting to the durability of immunity from prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, many of which clearly show that immunity to be much stronger and longer-lasting than vaccine-mediated immunity. However, a new study from researchers at Ajmera Transplant Centre, University Health Network, in Toronto, Canada, demonstrates that even organ transplant patients have robust T cell immunity from prior infection, much greater than those who are vaccinated.

""Vaccinated SOTRs mounted significantly lower proportions of S-specific polyfunctional CD4 + T-cells after two doses, relative to unvaccinated SOTRs with prior COVID-19,"" concluded the authors of the study, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. ""Together, these results suggest that SOTR generate robust T-cell responses following natural infection that correlate with disease severity but generate comparatively lower T-cell responses following mRNA vaccination.""

Rather than studying the less meaningful antibody responses, the researchers studied T cell responses in three cohorts at Toronto's University Health Network (UHN) Transplant Centre: SOTRs who had prior infection but were not subsequently vaccinated, SOTRs who were vaccinated 4-6 weeks prior to the study but never had the virus, and a control group of regular non-SOTRs with prior COVID. While the non-immunocompromised naturally immune cohort obviously mounted the greatest T cell response, the study still found that SOTRs with prior immunity had robust antigen-specific helper (CD4) and killer (CD8) T cells. Overall, the researchers found a detectable antigen-specific T-cell response in SOTRs with prior immunity at a 41.4% greater frequency than in the vaccine-only group. Also, most of those in the vaccine cohort received the Moderna shot, which is believed to be more potent than the Pfizer shot.

The findings of this study are a bombshell, because they suggest, at least in the short run, that even the most immunocompromised people with prior infection mount a serious antigen-specific T cell response that, unlike the vaccines, targets the nucleocapsid and membrane of the virus, not just the spike protein. While there is no long-term follow up in this study of SOTRs, it is important to remember that there are endless studies showing long-term and likely lifetime immunity from prior infection in the general healthy population. At the same time, we already have numerous studies and the reality of the current hard data from fully vaccinated countries hit hard with a new spread that the vaccine-mediated immunity completely wears off even for healthy people after six months.



Moreover, studies have already shown that the immunity conveyed by the shots might be particularly short-lived for the immunocompromised. For example, a study from Puerto Rico's Department of Health recently found the shots to be 0% effective in those 85 years and older after 150-200 days after vaccination. A massive Swedish study of half the country's population showed ""notable waning among men, older frail individuals, and individuals with comorbidities"" after about six months.

The results of the SOTR study raise some serious questions:

How can our government continue to ignore the power of natural immunity if it is this potent even in organ transplant recipients? How can we continue denying organ transplants to those who don't get the shot when some of them already had the virus and the shot itself doesn't work much? What is our solution to the immunocompromised? The shots barely work and will likely not work at all with the new variants, yet they are most dangerous to those people. They have never even been tested in people with kidney failure, much less an organ transplant. Are they supposed to live in their homes forever and atrophy with no safe and effective solution? Why is the government not studying the idea of using preventives like ivermectin, nitazoxanide, or monoclonal antibodies? A recent study of the general population showed that Regeneron given pre-emptively could work for at least eight months of protection without any of the severe risks that are associated with the failed shots. Our government won't even advise these people to use Betadine nasal spray after being around people.

Just how vociferously is our government working to deny natural immunity? At the other end of the health spectrum from elderly transplant patients are healthy children. As scandalous as it is to risk the shot on healthy kids, it's unfathomable to push the shot on kids who also had prior infection. Already in March, the government estimated that 42% of children 5-17 had prior infection, and that was long before the ""Delta wave,"" which was more transmissible and seemed to infect kids more than the ancestral strain. We all assumed that a solid majority would have been infected by now and were waiting for new data to be published. But finally the CDC has updated its numbers, and you will never guess the new data. Immunity magically slid backward!

Although they don't have new numbers isolated for 5- to 17-year-olds (excluding really young kids and babies who were generally more isolated), their numbers for the 0-17 cohort have slid backward from 36.7% through May to just 29.9% through September ... after Delta! This makes no sense because the media and our government were panicking about this wave hitting the schools much harder. For those with children in schools, we can attest to that fact that last year barely any kids got the virus, whereas this year more seemed to get it (although still mildly) and, unlike before, even spread it in the classrooms to some degree. There is simply no way that a majority of children are not already immune.

This is yet another example of the government retracting a talking point, data point, or study once our side begins using it.

Horowitz: Now we know why the establishment has always opposed early treatment,"The shots don’t work for many people, particularly the elderly. The establishment is blocking every other treatment option available. At this point, with so many people recovering even from late-stage COVID by taking ivermectin, which is infinitely safer than the shots, how could anyone ascribe anything other than very sinister motivations to those declaring war on its use?

The shills for Big Pharma and the “Great Reset” who don’t want to see people survive this virus claim they don’t have enough data on ivermectin, despite dozens of studies and simple reality showing that it works better than anything they have suggested. They demand massive randomized controlled trials, but then refuse to fund any such expensive study. They refuse to follow up on positive signals with off-patent therapeutics the same way they blithely ignore negative signals from the vaccines and refuse to follow up with investigative studies. Well, Brazilian researchers just published something better than a randomized controlled trial. They did a study of reality.

Everyone in the entire southern Brazilian city of Itajai was invited to participate in a preventive study of ivermectin for efficacy against severe COVID-19 symptoms. 133,051 (60.3%) volunteered to take ivermectin for two days every 15-day period between July and December 2020 at a low dose of 0.2mg per kilogram of body weight. 87,466 (39.7%) chose to enroll their information as the control group without taking the treatment. So no complaints can be made about a small sample size. The results? The hospitalization and mortality rate of the trial group was nearly half that of the control group!

However, the results are much more impressive than the top-line numbers suggest. One of the complaints about studies like this that are not randomized is that it’s possible for the healthier, more treatment-conscience individuals to sign up for the trial group, thereby confounding the conclusion of the trial results. But in this case, the opposite is true. The ivermectin group had nearly twice as many people over age 50 enrolled, which also included many more people with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and pulmonary issues. Thus, the relative risk reduction in mortality rate among those high-risk people taking ivermectin was actually much higher – 71% among those with type 2 diabetes and 67% among those with hypertension. The absolute risk reduction was also even greater among older people who are most at risk.

The overall effect on the city’s population was remarkable. The COVID-19 hospitalization rate decreased from 6.8% before the program with preventive use of ivermectin, to just 1.8% after its beginning (73% reduction). The mortality rate also dropped by 59%, from 3.4% to 1.4%. Most astounding is where the city of Itajai ranked relative to others in the state of Santa Catarina:

“When compared to all other major cities in the State of Santa Catarina, where Itajaí is located, differences in COVID-19 mortality rate between before July 7, 2020 and between July 7, 2020 and December 21, 2020, Itajaí is ranked number one, and far from the second place,” observed the Brazilian researchers in the study manuscript. “These results indicate that medical based optional prescription, citywide covered ivermectin can have a positive impact in the healthcare system.”

In many respects, this is more illuminating than a standard randomized controlled clinical trial. If we actually want to project what the world would look like if everyone would take ivermectin, this is a perfect case study of an entire city and its effect on the hospitals. Contrast these results to the vaccines, where we are seeing no correlation between outcomes and vaccination rates by geography, even though their randomized controlled trials purported to show an unmistakable benefit of 95% reduction in mortality.

Also, another key issue is dosage. FLCCC recommends 0.4-0.6mgs per kilogram of weight, which is 2-3 times the dose used in the trial. Obviously, this was a preventive trial only used for two straight days, but then rather than taking it every week, there was a 15-day gap before the next dose. One has to wonder what the results would be if each one in the trial group ramped up the dosage to 0.4mg every day for five days once they contracted the virus, or at least took the 0.2mg preventive dose twice every week.



Even the most effective drugs need a minimum dose. Ivermectin has demonstrated a strong dose-response relationship in terms of viral clearance; higher doses have not only been required, but have demonstrated clinical efficacy. While critics claim the dose is too high, cancer trials had patients taking ivermectin at a much higher dose for months without any problems.

Moreover, like any other virus, treatment requires a multi-drug approach because the virus has multiple avenues to infect cells. Imagine if every primary doctor treated patients with a mix of ivermectin and several other drugs, along with the appropriate anti-coagulants and steroids in the right patients at the early stage of disease. Imagine if they’d be directed to use Betadine nasal rinse, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and several other proven therapeutics from day one. Imagine if our government had placed as much money, marketing, and logistical facilitation into the monoclonal antibodies as it did the unsafe and ineffective shots.

Well, we already see from doctors in the U.S. who have applied this approach, and their reduction in mortality is near 100%. And all the drugs they use range from safer than over-the-counter medications (in the case of ivermectin) to much safer than anything being administered by the hospital systems, such as remdesivir, baricitinib and tofacitinib.

One thing is certain: Ivermectin is much safer than anything the medical establishment is using, and there definitely is a degree of efficacy. So why would it face such visceral opposition? Had the medical establishment merely talked down its efficacy to a degree, I would probably believe it. But now that they are treating this Nobel Prize-winning drug as if it’s heroin, it actually would appear that it’s super effective. During a pandemic, the FDA is now using resources to collaborate with the post office to hold packages of ivermectin from being delivered.

Last week, the World Tribune published an article revealing information that indicates the WHO likely knew ivermectin was effective for months, but blocked its use, all for Big Pharma. Dr. Andrew Hill, a senior visiting research fellow in pharmacology at Liverpool University, adviser to the Gates Foundation, and researcher for the WHO, was tasked with conducting an ivermectin trial for the WHO. Based on his preliminary findings, Hill testified enthusiastically about the use of ivermectin before the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel on Jan. 6, 2021. But then he suddenly changed course and published a study dinging the drug’s efficacy against COVID.

According to the Tribune, Dr. Tess Lawrie, director of the Evidence-based Medicine Consultancy in Bath, England, who was also involved in the ivermectin research, recorded a Zoom call she had with Hill and revealed a remarkable exchange between the two of them.

In a remarkable exchange, Hill admitted his manipulated study would likely delay the uptake of ivermectin in the UK and United States, but said he hoped his doing so would only set the lifesaving drug’s acceptance back by about “six weeks,” after which he was willing to give his support for its use. […]



Four days before publication, Hill’s sponsor Unitaid gave the University of Liverpool, Hill’s employer $40 million. Unitaid, it turns out, was also an author of the conclusions of Hill’s study.



In the call, Lawrie berated Hill’s study as “flawed,” “rushed,” “not properly put together,” and “bad research . . . bad research,” which Hill appears not to have denied.



Instead, when pressed he admitted his sponsor, Unitaid, was an unacknowledged author of conclusions.



“Unitaid has a say in the conclusions of the paper. Yeah,” he told Lawrie.

The exact exchange on the Zoom call, according to the Tribune, went as follows:

Lawrie: I really, really wish, and you’ve explained quite clearly to me, in both what you’ve been saying and in your body language that you’re not entirely comfortable with your conclusions, and that you’re in a tricky position because of whatever influence people are having on you, and including the people who have paid you and who have basically written that conclusion for you.



Hill: You’ve just got to understand I’m in a difficult position. I’m trying to steer a middle ground and it’s extremely hard.

Now, imagine the difficult position that millions of people found themselves in when they were denied access to this treatment early, and many more, even on a ventilator. Imagine how many other promising treatments we know about (and possibly ones we don’t) because research was squelched in order to deny the public a cheap and effective way around the false choice the establishment has created – either confront the bio-weapon virus without treatment or take their bio-weapon injection as the panacea?

It’s not too late for red-state governors and legislatures to correct this mistake by barring all punitive actions taken against doctors for prescribing FDA-approved drugs off label and prohibiting pharmacists from denying those prescriptions. Hospitals must also allow patients to bring in doctors to administer the drug when they are unwilling to save lives themselves.

Horowitz: NYT is ‘surprised’ by obvious lack of viral spread in schools that opened,"In March, schools in nearly every state did the unthinkable: They shut their doors for months, thereby destroying the social lives and education of a generation of children — all for a virus that poses no statistical threat to them. Now, weeks (and in some places, even months) after certain schools have reopened, the entire fear of kids as super-spreaders turned out to be a fabrication. While some of us knew this from day one and could have saved a generation of children months of despair, the New York Times finds it ""surprising.""

On Monday, the NYT reported that despite fears that New York's 1,800 public schools would serve as death traps, ""nearly three weeks into the in-person school year, early data from the city's first effort at targeted testing has shown the opposite: a surprisingly small number of positive cases."" The city received the results of 16,298 random tests throughout the public schools and found just 20 staff members who tested positive. How many students? Just eight — in all of New York City! And there's no evidence of serious illness among them.

It's not as if the virus is not spreading in the community. The schools reopened just as a resurgence of the virus became apparent in Brooklyn and Queens, yet there were just four positives out of over 3,300 tests in those two boroughs.

Rather than focusing on balancing nursing home safety and family visitation through mass testing, Gov. Cuomo is wasting testing resources by randomly testing 10%-20% of the public school's population every month, all for a virus that clearly does not spread much among children and certainly does not pose a greater risk to them than the typical pathogens they pick up every year in school.

""The emerging scientific consensus is that younger children do not spread the virus as easily as older children and adults,"" wrote the Times in an article titled, ""Surprising Results in Initial Virus Testing in N.Y.C. Schools.""

Well, no kidding. We could have told you that in the spring and saved months of lost education for kids and work hours for parents. Among over a dozen studies and data analysis from different countries showing that young children do not spread the virus (they get it from their parents at home), Icelandic researchers sequenced all the genomes from samples of every positive case in the country and failed to find a single instance of a child infecting parents.

The fact that so few children are infected in schools is truly astounding given the widespread outbreak of cases in communities in the majority of states this month. Emily Oster, an economics professor at Brown University, created a dashboard of 300 schools offering in-person classes. She found just 10 cases per 100,000 among students, and that rate has held steady into October despite the growing community spread.

What's become obvious from the body of data on schools and day cares is that even the low numbers of cases in schools aren't being spread in schools, but from home. If children were spreading to each other at the same rate adults do, we would find entire classes infected.

A recent survey of over 57,000 day care providers in the U.S. published in the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics found no association between exposure to child care and a diagnosis of COVID-19.

Given that the jury is in and the verdict is rendered, how are there still so many schools closed indefinitely? The teachers' union in Fairfax County, Virginia, wants schools closed for the remainder of this school year. According to Professor Oster's database, there were just six student infections per 100,000 in Virginia during the first two weeks of October.

Moreover, why are children being abused with social isolation and mask-wearing for hours on end? Supporters of these measures might suggest that these regulatory rituals are the key to keeping the numbers low. But the reality is that we are not seeing the mask-wearing work among adults in any other setting. The number of infections among schoolchildren remains low, even as the numbers in the communities skyrocket, despite universal mask-wearing.

According to Pew Research, as of August, 80%-90% of residents of most regions reported regularly wearing masks. Those numbers have only grown as the mandates and the social norms and pressures have intensified over time.



Joe Biden said at the first debate that if we had universal mask-wearing, then deaths could be cut in half. But we have already had these mandates in place for months, and almost everyone is complying. So why are kids not spreading it while everyone else is? If anything, kids would be less likely to maintain proper hygiene and protocol while wearing masks than adults.

Furthermore, if you look at any data among schools that have reopened, you will find that the rate of infection is much higher among the staff, who are wearing masks just as religiously (and likely, more properly) as children. According to Professor Oster's dashboard, the infection rate for staff is 2.5 times higher than for children. And whereas the rate among children is flat, the rate among staff is going up with the community spread.

Finally, in a similar vein, we are seeing exponential spreading among college kids, despite very strict mask and social distancing mandates. Now, obviously, it's nothing but a casedemic – with nearly no hospitalizations and zero deaths – but the fact that it's spreading prolifically among school staff and among college students who wear masks, but not among younger children, demonstrates that there is a natural phenomenon playing out here, not human input.

Clearly, children do not spread the virus, but merely get the virus from their community, whereas adults in school spread the virus commensurate to the level of community spread.

This point is starkly evident in the data from Wisconsin. The Badger State saw the biggest spread in the nation coinciding with the opening of schools. The result? Yes, the infection rate among Wisconsin's schoolchildren did increase from 14 per 100,000 to 18 from mid-September to early October. But among the staff, it increased from 29 to 84! That demonstrates that school openings play no role in the spread and that the numbers are a reflection of the community spread, which mainly affects adults. The relatively few kids who get the virus would have gotten it from their parents or community regardless of whether they were in school, not from other students.

So, what is it going to take to restore the lives of our children? Certainly not data and science, because the shutdown and masking of young children was never driven by science to begin with.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-now-we-know-why-the-establishment-has-always-opposed-early-treatment,2020-10-20
Horowitz: Record infections in super-vaxxed UK seniors as double-vaxxed show negative efficacy against COVID death,"Just because Volodymyr Zelenskyy is the new Fauci, it doesn’t mean COVID is over. In fact, cases are surging in many European countries, and U.K. seniors are now experiencing record numbers. “Covid infections surge to record high for over-70s in UK” was the title of a Financial Times article from Friday. But how can there be record infections precisely after nearly every senior was vaccinated and 90% were boosted, even though many already have had prior infection? Or are the record infections because of the shots, not despite them, and does this mean that they are preventing people from achieving immunity?

Ireland is one of the most vaccinated countries in the European Union, yet hospitalizations are rising.

There are now more people in Irish hospitals than at any point in 12 months. Nearly 95% of all adults are fully vaccinated, and nearly 100% of seniors are vaccinated and boosted.

The number of COVID cases has nearly tripled in the U.K. since the nadir of the post-winter drop four weeks ago. Moreover, deaths are still hovering around 125 a day, whereas after the 2021 winter wave (with a much lower prior infection rate), deaths were nearly reduced to zero. Furthermore, Scotland, which has the highest vaccination rate of anywhere in the U.K. and is the only region with mask mandates, seems to be worse off than ever before. “Scotland recorded its highest infection rates of the pandemic so far, with one in every 14 people infected with the virus in the week to mid-March, up from one in 18 a week earlier,” reported the Financial Times.

Roughly 90% of all people over age 12 in Scotland have two shots, and 73% have boosters. Among seniors, boosters are nearly universal. Thus, there is nowhere to run or hide from the vaccine failures. The negative efficacy is out of control. What about protection against death? Well, we can’t exactly see where the deaths are coming from because Scotland conveniently stopped providing that data, but the U.K. government will still offer the weekly reports for a few more weeks.

According to the latest U.K. health surveillance report, roughly 95% of those over 70 are double-vaccinated and about 90%-93% of the age cohorts over 70 are boosted. Just 1.6% of the senior cases between weeks 7 and 10 of this year were among the unvaccinated, which is below the 5% share of the population pie they compose. The triple-boosted are 90% of the cases.

Although the shots do offer some protection for some people against critical illness for a certain period of time, numerous data points have shown that the protection not only wanes but goes negative. The U.K. data now shows that the double-vaccinated have negative protection and the triple-vaxxed are headed in that direction.

Table 12b shows COVID deaths within 60 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during weeks 7 through week 10 of this year.

As you can see, 15% of all the deaths were among the double- (but not triple-) jabbed, whereas only about 4% of this population falls into that category. That is straight-up negative efficacy even against death. Thus, they placed people into a position forcing them to get boosters; otherwise they would be worse off than with nothing! But what does that portend for the triple-jabbed? Remember how early on, it looked like the boosters accorded broad protection against death, even though cases skyrocketed among them? Well, now, 77% of all deaths among those over 70 are triple-jabbed! That is still somewhat below their share of the population, but not by much, and the gap is closing with every subsequent weekly report.

When it comes to case rates, the U.K. is now reporting that in some age cohorts, the triple-jabbed are more than four times as likely to test positive, which would net an efficacy rate of -300%!

Hence, they needed Ukraine to distract from the narrative, because clearly there is something unsettling going on with these shots. One would think that by now there would be enough built-up immunity from prior infection to preclude waves like this. Yet the data raises the question: Are the shots sliding back people’s natural immunity and creating some form of original antigenic sin and antibody dependent disease enhancement, in which the shots wipe out their T cells and innate immunity, thereby preventing them from enjoying durable immunity from prior infection? In other words, can this keep going forever in a vicious cycle of more cases inducing more vaccine campaigns, which in turn create more infections?

A recent study from Stanford published in Cell might shed light on this phenomenon. Researchers observed a decreased immune response to new variants among those vaccinated for the original strain because the shots are teaching the body to respond improperly. “We find that prior vaccination with Wuhan-Hu-1-like antigens followed by infection with Alpha or Delta variants gives rise to plasma antibody responses with apparent Wuhan-Hu-1-specific imprinting manifesting as relatively decreased responses to the variant virus epitopes, compared with unvaccinated patients infected with those variant viruses,” observed the Stanford pathologists. They note that the extent to which this causes original antigenic sin “will be an important topic of ongoing study.”

Contrast the week 11 report to the week 5 report from just six weeks ago. You will see that in most age groups, the case rates among the triple-vaxxed were between 1.5 and 2 times greater, not between 3 and 4 times greater as they are today.

One would think that with so much infection for so many months among this group, at some point it would exhaust the pool of eligible people and perhaps revert back to the unvaccinated having a higher case rate. But in fact, the opposite is true; it’s getting worse every week for the triple-jabbed, especially among seniors.

And we already know from an Israeli study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that the fourth shot won’t make things better. ""We observed low vaccine efficacy against infections in health care workers, as well as relatively high viral loads suggesting that those who were infected were infectious,” concluded the authors of the study comparing quadruple-jabbed Israeli health care workers to those with fewer shots.

It’s also important to remember that any degree of vaccine efficacy gleaned from any hard data or studies is factoring in the first 14 days post-vaccinated as “unvaccinated” and the first 14 days of the booster as double-vaccinated. It is already proven that this is a period of immunosuppression on the front end of the efficacy curve. Some have estimated that if you factor in those 14 days with elevated risk, there is negative efficacy for these shots out of the gate.



At the end of the day, we are 11 billion doses into this unparalleled global mass injection regime, and yet more than 72% of 6.1 million confirmed COVID-19 deaths have occurred since vaccine rollout. Half the deaths have occurred since mid-April, after all of the vulnerable population had ample time to get fully vaccine.

Perhaps this is why the U.K. Health Security Agency announced in this week’s report (p. 37) that “from early April onwards this section of the report will not be updated.” That’s the section with case and death rates by vaccination status.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-nyt-surprised-coronavirus-schoolchildren,2022-03-22
Horowitz: Remdesivir is the greatest scandal of the pandemic,"Is there anything produced or approved by our government for COVID that isn't ineffective, doesn't have terrible side effects, and doesn't actually make the virus worse? The lockdowns, masks, and shots not only failed to work, but caused terrible collateral damage, failed to stop the virus, and, in fact, likely made the virus become more virulent. Now there are reports that remdesivir, which we already know doesn't work and causes renal and liver failure, might also be making the virus itself worse.

Antiviral agents, whether vaccine or therapeutic, must be perfect. If they fail to fully work, they can create viral immune escape, whereby the virus learns how to mutate around them. It's sort of like the principle of shooting at the king and missing, a principle we are often concerned with regarding the overuse or misuse of antibiotics.

Researchers from the Yale School of Medicine posted a preprint study in which they discovered a mutated version of SARS-CoV-2 that appears to have redeveloped in a previously infected immunocompromised woman who was treated with remdesivir. Researchers were able to sequence the genome in a way that made it clear it was related to the remdesivir use in the patient. The patient was later cured by monoclonal antibodies. ""This case illustrates the importance of monitoring for remdesivir resistance and the potential benefit of combinatorial therapies in immunocompromised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" the study's authors wrote.

Obviously, this mutation appears to be a rare find, but why would we run the risk of spending $3,000 a person on a therapeutic that doesn't work anyway if it may create immune escape?

Which raises the question: Why are we not treating everyone early with therapeutics like Regeneron, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, and other proven safe, cheap, and effective drugs that don't case renal failure like remdesivir and don't run the risk of inducing mutations? This is particularly important for those who are immunocompromised. The last thing people who already have fragile organs should be taking is remdesivir.

In many respects the fact that remdesivir was ever approved and is still the only standard of care, as it kills patients and lines the pockets of both hospitals and the maker, Gilead, is possibly the worst scandal of this entire ordeal. On Feb. 5, Reuters reported that none other than the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the China Academy of Sciences sought a patent on Gilead's remdesivir, a failed drug repurposed from treatment of Ebola, based on the alleged improvement of a single individual COVID patient reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. Incidentally, the only drug ever approved for COVID was developed by Dr. Ralph Baric's lab at UNC Chapel Hill, the same lab that applied for the coronavirus spike protein gain-of-function research and is suspected by many to be behind the creation of this virus.

Gee, is it surprising that the drug developed and pushed early by the same two labs likely behind the virus is not only a dud but dangerous?

But it gets worse. On Dec. 12, 2019, less than five months before Fauci and the FDA pushed approval of remdesivir without consulting with an outside panel of experts, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study on remdesivir use in Ebola that should have gotten the drug permanently banned for any use. Over the preceding year, the researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial of four therapeutics for use against Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo: remdesivir and three types of monoclonal antibodies, including Regeneron. What were the results in Table 2 of the study?

Of the four drugs, remdesivir had the worst outcome with a 53.1% death rate, which is higher than the death rate from the virus. In fact, both remdesivir and ZMapp (death rate of 49.7%) were deemed to be so dangerous that they were pulled from the study on Aug. 9, 2019. Incidentally, Regeneron, which had the lowest death rate, is the monoclonal antibody therapy that seems to work well for COVID. Why would Fauci first pick remdesivir over Regeneron?

On April 29, Fauci announced that remdesivir would become the standard of care, and another study he cited was Gilead's own March 2020 study (eventually published in the NEJM in June) of 53 coronavirus patients in the U.S. Canada, Europe, and Japan who used remdesivir for 10 days. Sixty percent reported adverse events and 23% reported serious adverse events, the most common being ""multiple-organ-dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, acute kidney injury, and hypotension."" Furthermore, ""Four patients (8%) discontinued remdesivir treatment prematurely: one because of worsening of preexisting renal failure, one because of multiple organ failure, and two because of elevated aminotransferases, including one patient with a maculopapular rash.""

This is why the NIH to this day warns about renal failure and liver toxicity from the use of this drug that is bankrupting us and killing people in the hospitals. The WHO recommends against using it. The WHO's Solidarity trial, which was conducted on 2,750 patients in 405 hospitals across 30 countries, found ""little or no effect of remdesivir on mortality,"" even though ""the proportion of lower-risk patients happened to be appreciably greater in the remdesivir group than in the placebo group.""

Last year, in France's Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, researchers studied outcomes in the first five COVID ICU patients who were administered remdesivir. Researchers observed, ""Remdesivir was interrupted before the initially planned duration in four patients, two because of alanine aminotransferase elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of renal failure requiring renal replacement."" Elevated alanine aminotransferase is usually an indication of liver toxicity, one of the warnings the NIH has given about the use of remdesivir.

To control for the confounding factor that perhaps the kidney failure associated with remdesivir is in fact a symptom of the virus, researchers at the Department of Nephrology-Dialysis-Transplantation at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice, France, compared the reported incidence of renal failure in COVID patients using remdesivir to those using other drugs. A search of the international pharmacovigilance postmarketing databases (VigiBase) of the World Health Organization (WHO) showed that the reporting odds ratio of acute renal failure for COVID patients on remdesivir ""was 20-fold"" that of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and lopinavir/ritonavir.



Well over a year after it has become abundantly clear that this drug only causes harm and does not save a single life, not a single hospital has stopped using it. These same hospitals are firing talented doctors either for not getting the failed shots or for using ivermectin. They will even go to court to prevent a dying patient with no other options from being administered ivermectin by an outside doctor. Yet they will use remdesivir to the gates of hell.

For those who simply cannot believe all of the safety concerns and signals about the vaccines, just remember that what we already know from existing data and see right in front of our eyes with remdesivir is perhaps even more scandalous that what is being alleged about the vaccines.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-record-infections-in-super-vaxxed-uk-seniors-as-double-vaxxed-show-negative-efficacy-against-covid-death,2021-11-15
Horowitz: Data on child care and camps shows remarkably low risk among children,"Amid the debate over reopening schools without draconian restrictions, some of the best case studies from which to draw conclusions are child-care settings that have already been open during the pandemic. A number of child-care facilities for young children never shut down, and a goodly number of camps wound up opening later in the summer for children of all ages. New data show remarkably few cases and no reported clinical problems from those cases.

Emily Oster, an economics professor at Brown University, and Galit Alter, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, created a database of COVID-19 cases from selectively reporting child-care facilities and summer camps at their website, Covid Explained. As you can see from the data of camps, schools, and child-care facilities that are open, the cases are remarkably low:

Obviously, this is not a scientific study because the facilities voluntarily participated in this tracking program and they are not randomly sampled. But the size is large enough to get a sense that there really is not a lot of disruption going on, and if not for the panic and mass testing, they probably would never even have known about these few cases. In terms of passing around bugs, this is nothing more or less than we typically see from children's institutions.

My child came back from a backyard camp with a 10-day cold, and my wife and I, as well as many other parents, got that cold. None of us had typical COVID-19 symptoms. One parent decided to get tested, and of course the result was negative. Children pass around colds and flus all the time, and the symptoms are actually more severe than COVID-19 symptoms for almost all children. I could barely get out of bed for two days over the weekend.

We can't allow the discovery of a handful of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases that are far from ever being clinical to shut down a generation of children's education and activities.

On any given day or week, there are a number of kids with colds or even fevers. For the most part, that is actually a good thing and is partially responsible for building up their innate immune systems against more serious threats, such as an acute case of COVID-19. If we created a testing system and ascribed a scientifically scary-sounding name to each ailment, we'd live in a state of paralysis every year.

But this is what we will face in the coming year with mass testing, mass hysteria, and the treatment of every subclinical COVID case as if it's stage 4 cancer. The University of Kentucky has already tested well over 7,000 students, and 0.6% of them (41 students) tested positive. Absent any testing, we probably would not know about a single case, because none of them rose to the level of anything more acute than typical bugs that are passed around.

Last week, one media outlet in New Hampshire published an entire article about a staff member or student of a preschool who tested negative! The Keene, New Hampshire, school closed after two members of the community believed they had exhibited some symptoms of COVID-19. It turns out one of them had strep throat, and the other tested negative for COVID but is still waiting for a second negative test. So now just the onset of a cold that might prompt someone to test is newsworthy and will sow panic as if there is the spread of Ebola in a school. Strep throat is as common as spitballs in school settings and can actually cause serious side effects, but it's something we've always lived with. Why should coronavirus be any different?

What are we going to do with the flu season when even a cough or a sneeze is now a pretext for panic? What's next? A count of papercuts and playground bruises?

Inevitably, the media always focuses on the one exception to the rule, which, when studied properly, is not much of an exception. As the data from Professor Oster shows, even during peak transmission in hot spots, the reporting camp and day care facilities had low numbers of cases. The exception is one camp in north Georgia that the CDC reported on in a published paper, which was frantically touted by the media as a harbinger of doom for school reopening. They found that hundreds of kids and counselors tested positive, which resulted in the closure of the camp a few days after it opened.

But have you read anything in the media about a single one being hospitalized or this outbreak setting off another cluster elsewhere? The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which later identified the camp as ""Camp High Harbor"" in Rabun County, reported that ""state health officials said they were not aware of any hospitalizations or fatalities stemming from the outbreak."" All you will read about are asymptomatic cases, sore throats, and mild fevers. These happen in schools across the country all the time, especially in flu season. But in a country of 330 million, you will find cases like this even in the summer.

Also, based on the information provided in the CDC paper, it's impossible to know who passed COVID to whom. Thus, without evidence to the contrary, we would have to assume that this follows the pattern of every other study indicating children get the virus from adults. We therefore must presume that the counselors passed COVID to the kids and not the other way around or that outbreak this originated from outside the camp.

The counselors were at the facility for four days of training beginning on June 17 before the campers arrived and likely spread it before the campers came, because the camp was shut down shortly afterwards. Campers didn't arrive until June 21, the first symptoms were recognized on June 23, and the camp started closing the very next day through June 27. It's hard to see how the spread occurred among the younger kids and not the older staff.

It's not as if we found any camp in the country that was opened throughout the past six weeks where there was a sudden outbreak that could be traced from child to child. In fact, because we have not found such a case well into August, it's quite clear this outbreak of a camp that was opened for just two days in June was baked into the cake before the kids arrived.

Also, they counted anyone who tested positive 14 days after the closures of the camp. That is from June 27 through July 10. That was during the peak transmission in Georgia, as its daily case count reached its highest levels on July 6. How many of them got it after the camp was already closed – from their parents at home?

As the CDC concedes, ""Given the increasing incidence of COVID-19 in Georgia in June and July, some cases might have resulted from transmission occurring before or after camp attendance.""

It's truly shocking how the CDC failed to investigate the ages of those first caught with symptoms, which would likely explain why the youngest cohort of campers had the highest attack rate, which as they noted, was quite surprising. It's likely that the counselor that first spread it was the one in charge of the children 6-10.

As for the symptoms, aside from the asymptomatic, a big portion of the other kids had suggestive symptoms. Anyone who has questioned their kids about wellness knows they are extremely suggestive to disease.

""How do you feel, Johnny?""

""I feel good.""

""So, no headache or sore throat?""

""Oh, actually yes my head hurts a little.""

According to the CDC, out of the 260 who tested positive, 136 cases had available documented symptom data. Among them 26% reported no symptoms, while 74% did report symptoms but ""those most commonly reported were subjective or documented fever (65%), headache (61%), and sore throat (46%).""

Since this case was an anomaly, without other available information, one has to question whether there were other anomalous circumstances. We know kids often get other viruses, plus many of the tests produce false positives. In this case, it doesn't appear that other viruses were tested for. For example, it's currently enterovirus season, which affects millions of kids with cold or mild flu-like symptoms every year. How many kids were really asymptomatic, but were co-infected with other mildly symptomatic respiratory viruses that are also contagious and more transmissible from child to child than COVID-19?

This is not a far-fetched assumption. Keep in mind that kids have had their immune systems shielded for several months due to isolation, as I experienced with my children's summer camp and the spread of this wicked cold to my household (as my podcast listeners can attest, with my gutted radio voice). Perhaps those with measurable symptoms of fever (assuming it was measured accurately) were co-infected with the spread of other respiratory viruses that overlapped with COVID-19?

Either way, we live in an era of panic first, ask questions never.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-remdesivir-is-the-greatest-scandal-of-the-pandemic,2020-08-11
Horowitz: Study of 100 UK schools shows ‘very little evidence that the virus is transmitted in schools’,"Imagine state governments announcing they plan to shut down schools until there is a cure for breast cancer. That is essentially the logic they are employing to shut schools because of a virus that does not affect children in any statistical or clinical way.

It has already been proven that children have a much higher risk of dying in a lightning strike or a car accident than from COVID-19. Also, almost all children who get the virus are either asymptomatic or are less sick then they are from the flu, and we never close school for the flu and cold season. The only defense left for the side that wants to continue the child abuse and close schools is that somehow opening schools will help them transmit the virus and kill Granny. Not so, according to a new study of 100 schools in the U.K., the largest one conducted to date.

The Public Health England research is slated to be published later this year, but researchers have already confirmed from monitoring 20,000 students and teachers in around 100 schools across England during the partially reopened summer term that there is very little evidence of school spread. The study will find there is ""very little evidence that the virus is transmitted in schools,"" according to Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health and a member of the government emergency advisory group Sage.

""This is the some of the largest data you will find on schools anywhere,"" added Professor Viner. ""Britain has done very well in terms of thinking of collecting data in schools.""

Viner also told the media over the weekend that a separate review by the group of 35 studies across the globe will show schools play only a ""minor role"" in spreading the virus. That review is due out next month, after most schools typically start for the fall semester.

""It is absolutely essential for schools to reopen in September. The risks to children from Covid are very low and the risks of school closures we know are very serious,"" he said. ""Britain as a nation should stand up and say: our children are essential. Reopening schools is essential.""

A recent contact tracing analysis published by the Swiss office of public health showed that schools accounted for just 0.3% of the community transmission. Of course, the largest share came … from home! This is why a recent analysis in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases found, ""School closure carried out in Japan did not show any mitigating effect on the transmission of novel coronavirus infection.""

It's not that children can't get the virus, it's just that there is no evidence that they are major vectors of transmission to others, nor is there evidence they contract the virus more from attending school than from being home with their parents.

As a Johns Hopkins analysis of mass quarantine in 2006, which was co-authored by famed smallpox eradicator D.A. Henderson, noted, ""When schools closed for a winter holiday during the 1918 pandemic in Chicago, 'more influenza cases developed among pupils . . . than when schools were in session.'""

And remember, with pandemic flus, unlike with SARS-CoV-2, children are often the primary vector of transmission. Yet, still, as Henderson observed in another paper on the 1957 Asian flu, ""the Nassau County Health Commissioner in New York stated that 'public schools should stay open even in an epidemic' and that 'children would get sick just as easily out of school.'""

How much more so when it comes to this epidemic, where children have already proven to be very rare vectors of the virus to begin with. One has to assume that children who do wind up contracting COVID-19 most likely got it from adults, not the other way around. Studies from countries including the U.K., Australia, Switzerland, Canada, Netherlands, France, Ireland, Taiwan, and Iceland have all failed to find child-to-adult transmission.

Sweden is the biggest test of the effectiveness of school closures, because unlike in most countries, Sweden never closed its primary schools from the beginning of the epidemic. Nonetheless, the Public Health Agency of Sweden found no measurable difference of outcomes in children between Sweden and Finland, even though Finland closed its schools. ""Closure or not of schools had no measurable direct impact on the number of laboratory confirmed cases in school-aged children in Finland or Sweden,"" concluded the report.

The head of Norway's Institute of Public Health, rather than taking a swipe at her neighboring country for leaving schools opened, actually believes the neighbor country did it right and that Norway should never have shut down even the high schools.

There is no reason their absence of older teachers, pending the end of this epidemic, should impede the opening of schools. Likewise, given that almost all of the few children who did die from COVID-19 had serious underlying conditions, there is no reason why those children can't be accommodated without shutting down the entire education of a generation of children.

Finally, let's not forget that teen suicide is the second-leading cause of death of that age group. Has anyone studied the effects of social isolation on teens' mental health compared to their extraordinary low risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19? A University of Wisconsin research survey found ""significant mental health, anxiety, and depression issues in the high school-aged population"" within the state, with 65% reporting anxiety symptoms. It's hard to imagine more children won't die from the lockdown than from the virus.

As for their physical health, given that they are likely partially immune to COVID-19 precisely because we have allowed them to share germs and contract coronavirus colds over the years, what does such social isolation do to weaken that immunological ecosystem that has protected them until now? How does the bubble effect fare in the long run?

Nobody in politics is interested in answering these questions. One thing is clear, though. There is not a shred of health or science involved in the decisions to close schools. It's all about politics.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-risk-low-among-children,2020-08-10
Horowitz: The censorship of ivermectin is the biggest story of COVID,"Last week, Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister launched a $1 million grant to convince ""hesitant"" communities to get themselves vaccinated with one of the experimental shots on the market. But if people are hesitant about an experimental gene therapy that has already racked up a record number of serious adverse events on the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), why not spend the money persuading people to get ivermectin, a safe and effective early and prophylactic COVID treatment that has been approved by the FDA and the WHO for other uses for years?

In a recent video clip from one of his forums, Pallister was asked by a caller about another kind of hesitancy – not hesitancy to vaccinate, but ""hesitancy to talk about ivermectin"" and other early treatments. The caller cited the evidence about this drug, which ""does no harm"" and causes no risk to try it. The female caller completed her thought by asking him, ""Are we doing anything with that, and if not, why not?""

As if to illustrate the caller's point, Pallister responded to her question about hesitancy to talk about ivermectin by ... refusing to talk about ivermectin! Like a programmed robot, Pallister blinked his eyes during her question, then proceeded to answer by discussing more about the vaccine! ""We're pursuing domestic research that we hope can lead to better vaccine availability in the future, perhaps not during this wave, but when we need boosters in coming years,"" answered the Manitoban premier. He then quickly finished the discussion, put on his mask (even though he is vaccinated), and concluded the session.



This video embodies the criminal behavior of the political class in censoring lifesaving, cheap treatments like ivermectin. Even in vaccine-crazed Israel, they found in a small study of 30 patients that all of them recovered with the use of ivermectin, 29 of them within 3-5 days. In India, which was a hot spot until recently, much of the country began using ivermectin. Delhi saw a 99% decline in cases after beginning universal use of ivermectin. While cases were going down everywhere after reaching some level of immunity, a 99% reduction from April 24 to June 7 is remarkable and much steeper than anywhere else in the world following a big wave.

A similar dynamic played out in the state of Uttar Pradesh, which is now 98% off its peak of COVID cases in late April. India's overall reduction since its peak five weeks ago was 76%, more in line with what we saw in the U.S. and Europe, once the peak wave passed and a modicum of herd immunity kicked in.

Despite Fauci warning about the Indian ""Delta"" variant being more deadly and continuing to push vaccines as the only solution, in reality, India's death rate from COVID — even after achieving what appears to be herd immunity — is just one-seventh of our COVID death rate and that of other European countries! India's death rate is even lower than Israel's and fairly close to that of Finland, which largely escaped the worst of the virus so far.

And no, the secret sauce is not the vaccine, because fewer than 15% of Indians have received at least one dose, while over 50% of Americans and 60% of British citizens have already had one shot.

The secret sauce is natural immunity, which is much stronger than the vaccine, along with arming people with early, cheap treatments to obtain that natural immunity as risk-free as possible.



In a remarkable contrast from the legal establishment in the U.S., the Indian Bar Association served Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, an Indian pediatrician who is the chief scientist at the World Health Organization (WHO), with a legal notice for spreading disinformation about ivermectin. Dr. Swaminathan recently tweeted that the WHO advises against use of ivermectin outside clinical trials:

Some Indian states have taken this guidance to heart. In the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the newly elected governor, M.K. Stalin, excluded ivermectin from the treatment protocol and opted instead for the expensive and ineffective remdesivir. The result? Just the opposite of Delhi. The virus continued to peak for an extra month and only recently began to recede at a much slower rate.

The state of Goa, which is also in the south, began offering ivermectin to all adults on May 11. The 87% drop in four weeks is remarkable.

Ditto for Karnataka, another southern state neighboring Tamil Nadu, that sanctioned the use of ivermectin.

In Uttarakhand, another ivermectin state in the north, cases dropped by 95% since the peak.

The point is that, while herd immunity seems to be the major factor, the states that used ivermectin seemed to experience an earlier peak and a steeper decline in cases than those that shunned ivermectin. The troubling question is what these curves would have looked like had the WHO recommended ivermectin before the virus began to spread and if it had used at the first sign of trouble with the same religious fervor as vaccines, remdesivir, and masks. We will never know, but we can surmise that the curves would have been milder based on the results we are seeing from those countries that used it once they were in a world of trouble.



Mexico experienced a sharp increase in cases during the winter, but enjoyed much success in the regions that used ivermectin. Last month, Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum held a press conference where she claimed a study showed ivermectin decreased the likelihood of hospitalization in her large metropolis by between 52% and 76%.

The question everyone needs to answer is this: With all of the adverse reporting from the experimental vaccines, why do the global authorities continue to push them like candy without further study, when they refuse to greenlight ivermectin, with 29 randomized controlled trials vouching for its efficacy with no side effects and 4 billion doses dispensed over decades?

Following the money trail will be very instructive in answering this question. Why would GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, pay for Google AdWords to warn against ivermectin? Why are Big Pharma and Big Government censoring EVERY alternative treatment, including the ironclad research behind preemptively bulking up one's vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc levels? Those questions provide the answer to the censorship of ivermectin. According to GAVI's website, the ""Gates Foundation pledged US$ 750 million to set up Gavi in 1999"" and ""the Foundation is a key Gavi partner in vaccine market shaping.""



Well, boxing out all alternative treatments is one way to engage in ""vaccine market shaping."" There's nothing quite like a market with just one show in town.

Indeed, the Wuhan lab is not the biggest story of COVID. It's the global genocide that is taking place at the hands of those who claim to care most about COVID, yet ensure that any effective treatment is not made available to the public.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-study-of-100-uk-schools-shows-very-little-evidence-that-the-virus-is-transmitted-in-schools,2021-06-09
Horowitz: The country with the best data shows infection rates higher among the vaccinated,"The idea of mandating the vaccine to protect other people is built upon a complete lie.

Whatever side of the vaccine debate you may find yourself on, it is clear that none of us predicted cases would grow exponentially a year later, when most adults are vaccinated and there is so much more built-up immunity. The evidence that cases are growing among the vaccinated is too compelling to ignore and makes the entire push for vaccination, and certainly for mandated shots, completely unmoored from reality. Isn't it about time we start asking questions about the consequences of a leaky vaccine?

It's time to stop calling infections among the vaccinated ""breakthrough"" cases. In fact, The U.K., which posts the most comprehensive granular weekly data every Thursday, shows that COVID cases per capita are more common among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated in most age groups.

The data is from table 2 on page 14 of this past week's surveillance report. The above chart was distilled from this data on Twitter by a friend of mine.

As you can see, the vaccinated have more cases per capita in nearly all age groups except for those under 30. The only logical explanation is that the youngest cohorts were vaccinated most recently, when there might still be some degree of efficacy from the vaccine. Which is why, even among the young cohorts, the cases among the vaccinated are higher among those vaccinated earlier. What this clearly means is that its protection wears off after a few months, especially for those who need it the most. According to the Public Health England data, for the 60s age cohort, the infection rates are now 63% higher among the vaccinated than unvaccinated, up from 53% in last week's report.

Thus, any discussion of vaccine passports and mandates is completely contrary to reality. Not only do the vaccinated spread the virus, they might be doing so at greater levels. Whether the shots offer some protection against severe illness for a few extra months is still unclear, given that hospitalization rates are skyrocketing among the vaccinated, but either way, that is a personal decision whether one wants to assume the risks to achieve some lighter symptoms. The notion that unvaccinated health care workers with stronger immunity from prior infection are a greater threat to patients than those without prior immunity who are vaccinated is absurd. This point is underscored by a recent outbreak of the virus in an Israeli hospital where 39 of the 42 patients, staff, and family members infected were fully vaccinated.

At this point, it is impossible to overlook the absolute failure of this vaccine to achieve its stated goal. There were dramatically more deaths this August than last August, something that makes zero sense given the high vaccination rates. The few unvaccinated people can't be responsible for a worse outcome than when nobody was vaccinated.

We are seeing these examples all over the world, not just here and in Israel.

With 92% of adults vaccinated, Wales is experiencing the worst outcome ever:

Data show that 63% of the COVID deaths over the past 7.5 months in England were among those vaccinated:

And here is ground zero for COVID fascism: Australia:

How come nobody wants to inquire why things are worse now than ever and whether, perhaps, the leaky vaccine itself is the culprit?

For those unfamiliar with leaky vaccine syndrome, read this important 2015 PBS article about the leaky chicken vaccine for Marek's disease. The article explains how a leaky chicken vaccine was able to make this devastating virus among chickens both more transmissible and more virulent, bucking the micro-evolutionary phenomenon that forces the two factors to work inversely.

In a second experiment, unvaccinated and vaccinated chickens were infected with one of the five Marek's disease strains, and then put into a second arena with a second set of unimmunized birds, known as sentinels. In particular, the team was interested in a middle-of-the-road strain called ""595"" and whether it would become hotter.



It did. The virus spread to sentinel birds nine days faster if it came from a vaccinated chicken versus an unvaccinated one. In addition, sentinels died faster when exposed to vaccinated chickens versus unvaccinated chickens.

The article explains how a leaky vaccine that only ameliorates symptoms for the vaccinated chickens allows the virus to become more virulent and spread more widely in live hosts. In the case of the Marek's disease vaccine, it devastated all of the unvaccinated chickens. This is exactly what we saw in the American South around July, about six months into the vaccination program, the time when Israeli studies have shown the COVID vaccine (at least Pfizer) begins to leak. Then, as time progressed, even the protection from serious illness among the vaccinated began to wear off, which is why Big Pharma and the media are now pushing the boosters. But why is nobody asking the obvious question: Will endless boosters will continue to perpetuate a cycle of viral immune escape, as great vaccinologists like Geert Vanden Bossche warned about earlier this year?

In the 2015 PBS article, the author ominously warns that if we ever were concerned that such a leaky vaccine phenomenon would occur in human vaccines, the following question would be the first indicator: ""Does the vaccine merely reduce symptoms, or does it also keep patients from getting infected and transmitting the virus?""

Well, that is exactly the way they are now selling the vaccine – that it only helps against some symptoms – and not coincidentally, the spread is worse than ever before! Take Florida, for example: With a very high senior vaccination rate, especially in places like Miami, it had a 94% increase in deaths this August over last August.

What we have been experiencing since July is exactly the nightmare of the leaky chicken vaccine for Marek's disease. And that is one of the many reasons why we have never successfully developed a coronavirus vaccine. A 2003 experimental observation of SARS vaccine development presciently advised, ""Application of a SARS vaccine is perhaps best limited to a minimal number of targeted individuals who can be monitored, as some vaccinated persons might, if infected by SARS coronavirus, become asymptomatic excretors of virus, thereby posing a risk to non-vaccinated people.""

Well, here we are today with a mass coronavirus vaccine campaign nobody in a previous generation could have imagined, and we have worse spread from the vaccinated than before the vaccination campaign. We are experiencing the exact opposite of the false premise used by pro-mandate politicians; namely, it's the vaccinated endangering others.

Why is nobody asking the two most salient questions: 1) If the vaccine is leaking this much on transmission, why is there no concern that it is also the culprit for making the virus more virulent? 2) If it leaks this much on transmission, who is to say any degree of efficacy against serious illness, which is already waning, won't diminish completely?



As they push booster shots, and in Israel are mandating them, this is the subtle reason for why Big Pharma and the media are now pushing their magical expensive therapeutics. Pfizer is touting a drug in development, and Merck is already requesting emergency use authorization for molnupiravir, a drug with no safety profile.

Pfizer has been advertising a ""need"" for a therapeutic while Twitter promotes it as a paid ad, despite the massive conflict of interest.

Over the weekend, former FDA administrator and chief spokesman for Big Pharma Scott Gottlieb said on CNBC, ""Once we start vaccinating our children, and once we have an anti-viral in hand I think society and psychology around this disease will change."" Notice he added in the anti-viral to the equation? Remember, Gottlieb is on the board of directors of Pfizer, an appalling conflict of interest none of the networks are concerned about. They are clearly signaling the demise of their own idolatry and are ready to move onto the next scam.

But why would we need therapeutics if the vaccines are not only working but are so unassailable that they must be mandated? And if they lied to us about the efficacy and safety of the vaccines and remdesivir, why would we trust them with their new therapeutics over other long-standing effective and safe off-patent drugs?

Horowitz: The Delta deception: New COVID variant might be less deadly,"""This COVID variant will be the one to really get us. No, it's this one. Well, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma weren't a problem, but I promise you 'the Delta' spells the end of civilization.""

That is essentially the panic porn dressed up as science that we have been treated to ever since the virus declined in January following the winter spread, which appears to have given us a great deal of herd immunity. Despite the advent of the British and South African variants, cases, not to mention fatalities, have continued to plummet in all of the places where those variants were supposedly common. Which is why they are now repeating the same mantra about the ""Delta"" variant from India.

The headlines are screaming with panic over the impending doom of the Delta variant hitting the U.S.:

""WHO says delta is the fastest and fittest Covid variant and will 'pick off' most vulnerable"" (CNBC)

""Highly contagious Delta variant could cause next COVID-19 wave: 'This virus will still find you'"" (CBS)

""Delta Variant Gains Steam in Undervaccinated U.S. Counties"" (Bloomberg)

""The Delta variant might pose the biggest threat yet to vaccinated people"" (Business Insider)

And of course, no list would be complete without the headline from Dr. Fauci yesterday, stating that the ""Delta variant is the greatest threat in the US.""

The implication from these headlines is that somehow this variant is truly more transmissible and deadly (as the previous variants were falsely portrayed to be), they escape natural immunity and possibly the vaccine — and therefore, paradoxically, you must get vaccinated and continue doing all the things that failed to work for the other variants!

After each city and country began getting ascribed its own ""variant,"" I think the panic merchants realized that the masses would catch on to the variant scam, so they decided to rename them Alpha (British), Beta (South African), Gamma (Brazilian), and Delta (Indian), which sounds more like a hierarchy of progression and severity rather than each region simply getting hit when it's in season until the area reaches herd immunity.

However, if people would actually look at the data, they'd realize that the Delta variant is actually less deadly. These headlines are able to gain momentum only because of the absurd public perception that somehow India got hit worse than the rest of the world. In reality, India has one-seventh the death rate per capita of the U.S.; it's just that India got the major winter wave later, when the Western countries were largely done with it, thereby giving the illusion that India somehow suffered worse. Now, the public health Nazis are transferring their first big lie about what happened in India back to the Western world.



Fortunately, the U.K. government has already exposed these headlines as a lie, for those willing to take notice. On June 18, Public Health England published its 16th report on ""SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants under investigation in England,"" this time grouping the variants by Greek letters.

As you can see, the Delta variant has a 0.1% case fatality rate (CFR) out of 31,132 Delta sequence infections confirmed by investigators. That is the same rate as the flu and is much lower than the CFR for the ancestral strain or any of the other variants. And as we know, the CFR is always higher than the infection fatality rate (IFR), because many of the mildest and asymptomatic infections go undocumented, while the confirmed cases tend to have a bias toward those who are more evidently symptomatic.



In other words, Delta is literally the flu with a CFR identical to it. This is exactly what every respiratory pandemic has done through history: morphed into more transmissible and less virulent form that forces the other mutations out since you get that one. Nothing about masks, lockdowns, or experimental shots did this. To the extent this really is more transmissible, it's going to be less deadly, as is the case with the common cold. To the extent that there are areas below the herd immunity threshold (for example, in Scotland and the northwestern parts of the U.K.) they will likely get the Delta variant (until something else supplants it), but fatalities will continue to go down.

According to the above-mentioned report, the Delta variant represented more than 75% of all cases in the U.K. since mid-May. If it really was that deadly, it should have been wreaking havoc over the past few weeks.

You can see almost a perfect inverse relationship between hospitalization rates throughout April and May plummeting as the Delta variant became the dominant strain of the virus in England. Some areas might see a slight oscillation from time to time as herd immunity fills in, regardless of which variant is floating around. However, the death burden is well below that of a flu season and is no longer an epidemic.



As for vaccines, there is no evidence that somehow they provide better protection than prior infection from any other strain of the virus, nor does the Delta variant justify further use of these experimental shots. If anything, the U.K. data show that, to the extent there were deaths due to the Delta variant, there were more fatalities among those already vaccinated relative to the number of confirmed cases by vaccination status.

Again, the numbers are low across the board and there is no evidence the Delta variant is anything but less deadly for anyone. But there is certainly no evidence that somehow the vaccine is a greater imperative because of this variant. India itself appears to have achieved herd immunity – with the WHO estimating infection rates between 60% and 75% in most places – with one-seventh the death rate of England, but with one-fourth the percentage of people who have receive one dose of the vaccine.



Thus, the good news is that now that most countries have reached a large degree of herd immunity, there is zero threat of hospitals being overrun by any seasonal increase in various areas, no matter the variant. The bad news is that after Delta, there are Epsilon and 19 other letters of the Greek alphabet, which will enable the circuitous cycle of misinformation, fear, panic, and control to continue. And remember, as there is already a "" Delta+ ,"" the options are endless until our society finally achieves immunity to COVID panic porn.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-country-with-the-best-data-shows-infection-rates-higher-among-the-vaccinated,2021-06-23
Horowitz: The failure of the mRNA shots is on display for all with open eyes,"“Based on the RCTs with the longest possible follow-up, mRNA vaccines had no effect on overall mortality despite protecting against fatal COVID-19.”

This bizarre, yet revealing conclusion of a recent preprint Danish study in the prestigious Lancet should be international news, yet only a few Americans are aware of it. A first-of-its-kind long-term follow-up of over 74,000 adult participants in the Moderna and Pfizer trials found absolutely no all-cause mortality benefit from the two mRNA shots, despite the pandemic of a lifetime. As of Jan. 2022, there were a total of 31 all-cause deaths among those in either the Pfizer or Moderna trial groups and 30 in the placebo groups. A study of Curevac, a third mRNA vaccine created by a German biopharmaceutical company, recorded eight deaths in the trial group and six in the placebo.

Now, consider the fact that people are being denied treatment, kidney transplants, entry into mental health facilities, and the ability to earn a livelihood for not getting the shots.

This study, which was funded by the Danish government, sought to contrast the results of all-cause mortality among those in the mRNA trials compared to those in the adenovirus-vector vaccine trials (J&J and AstraZeneca). While the real-world results don’t seem to show any benefit from any of the COVID shots, this study claims an all-cause mortality benefit from the two non-MRNAs. But remember, nearly everyone in America has gotten at least one dose of an mRNA shot, as J&J is not even recommended as the first choice by the CDC and the AstraZeneca shot is not available.

So how is it that mRNAs had no effect on all-cause mortality but protect against fatal COVID? Well, either they don’t really protect against COVID, or the nominal benefit is washed away by the mortality from adverse events. For example, among the Pfizer trials, there were two deaths in the control group and one in the trial group. Typically, we wouldn’t draw conclusions from such low numbers to suggest the shots work against fatal COVID. On the other hand, researchers found nine cardiovascular deaths among the trial group but only six among the placebo group and 14 “non accident, non-covid deaths” among the trial group but only 11 among the placebo group.

“As COVID-19 mortality comes under better control due to herd immunity and increasing vaccination coverage, the impact on non-COVID-19 mortality becomes particularly important from a public health perspective,” concluded the authors. Gee, you think? The authors concede that the clinical trials were mainly conducted on healthy adults. They surmise that for sicker adults, the mRNAs might have induced a better mortality result, but that is pure speculation. What is clear, however, is that the mRNA vaccine makers understood that there was no mortality benefit for healthy people and pushed the shots on them anyway, even though they came with substantial non-COVID risk of adverse events.

As for the efficacy of any of these shots against COVID itself, it’s sure hard to find any geographical-based epidemiological analysis that supports such a hypothesis. New Zealand is a perfect case study, because the country had hardly any COVID deaths for the first two years of the pandemic. As an island state, it clearly kept out most of the virus well through 2021, once every vulnerable adult had a chance to be vaccinated. According to the NZ ministry of health, every age bracket has achieved higher than a 90% vaccination rate except for those ages 5-11. Also, more than half of all adults, especially those in vulnerable categories, have boosters.

Thus, New Zealand lived out the COVID bio-state dream. The population fully locked down until three doses were available. Thus, they should be experiencing no COVID, and certainly no COVID deaths, right? Well, in fact, New Zealand experienced nearly all of its deaths precisely after all of this was accomplished in March 2022! And with the mildest of variants!

And roughly 98% of all confirmed cases in New Zealand occurred after February 2022.

Consider the fact that as late in the pandemic as Nov. 4, 2021, New Zealand recorded just 29 COVID deaths. Now the country has 469. Something is not right. Remember, Omicron barely replicates in human lungs and is fundamentally an upper respiratory infection. If there’s any country that achieved the goal of “lock down until everyone is vaccinated,” it’s New Zealand. If the shots are as successful against critical illness from COVID as they say it is, we should not be seeing these numbers.

As the Daily Skeptic observes based on vaccination data, the double-vaxxed seem to be responsible for the greatest proportion of the cases, likely because the negative efficacy occurred earlier than in the boosted, but that trend, as we saw in the U.K. data, is now trending toward the triple-vaxxed. Overall, only 3% of the unvaccinated have been infected, while 10% of the triple-vaxxed and 18% of the double-vaxxed have been infected. But the trend is even more concerning:

The fall from peak cases to the most recent data point is also interesting. Case rates in the unvaccinated, single dosed and the double dosed have all fallen approximately 45% since their respective peaks, however, case rates in the triple vaccinated have only fallen approximately 20% since their peak. This is rather concerning, as it suggests that we might find that the boosted population maintain a viral reservoir for Covid, ensuring that case rates take much longer to fall to trivial levels and hindering attempts to get society back to a post-Covid normal.

Thus, until now, the “fact-checkers” kept suggesting that the reason why most of the cases are among the vaccinated is because the pure-bloods were careless rubes who all already had COVID last year. Putting aside that such a premise lays waste to their mandates on those with previous infection, New Zealand lays waste to this hypothesis because very few people there got COVID, and we see that even now the injection-free people have low case rates so far.

To cap it off, the Daily Skeptic notes that there is a disturbing trend of excess deaths in New Zealand correlating with the take-up of the vaccine, not COVID cases. In many other countries, people want to blame the excess deaths in 2021 on Delta, not the vaccine. However, in New Zealand there is nowhere to escape the obvious fact that there were basically no COVID deaths until 2022. Yet New Zealand experienced excess deaths in the latter half of 2021.

Keep in mind that nearly everyone in New Zealand is jabbed with Pfizer’s mRNA shot, which lends credence to the findings of the Danish study that the mRNAs don’t seem to protect against all-cause mortality and seem to be associated with a higher risk of non-COVID deaths.

Now contrast New Zealand with Nigeria, a country that has over 200 million people and barely experienced any deaths, despite (or perhaps because of) a 4% vaccination rate and no boosters in sight.

Both countries, until recently, fared equally well. However, they started diverging with the mass vaccination and boosting. And no, this is not because the virus has not come to Nigeria yet. A recent WHO study found that true infections were 97 times greater in Africa than officially confirmed, which means that 65% of the entire continent has already been infected. The authors estimate that the infection rate reached 76% in West Africa. And that was as of the end of the third quarter of 2021, before Omicron.

Over the course of the pandemic, New Zealand suffered 94 COVID deaths per million compared to 15 in Nigeria. But the bad news for the lockdown capital of the world is that, unlike Nigeria, New Zealand still has a long way to go to achieve herd immunity, and that’s assuming one can still achieve natural immunity following the mRNA shots.

Perforce, prior infection is clearly the active ingredient, not the vaccines, because Nigeria (and other African countries) could not possibly diverge more from the experience of New Zealand. Yes, to a certain extent it’s possible that death rates could be somewhat underestimated, but there is no evidence of excess mortality in these countries or anecdotes of bodies piling up.



Perhaps, more than any other time in history, we see that the Western world, which has run off the cliff of post-enlightenment, is now behind the primitive and developing countries in aspects of health. And it was all man-made.

Horowitz: The very concerning data from Scotland,"“The vaccines are incredibly safe. They protect us against Omicron; they protect us against Delta; they protect us against COVID."" Those were the words of fully vaccinated CDC Director Rochelle Walensky while testifying before the Senate Health Committee with two masks on her face on Jan. 11.

Scottish data shows that the COVID-19 age-standardized case rate is highest among the two-dose vaccinated and lowest among unvaccinated! It further shows this trend of negative efficacy for the double-vaccinated persisting for hospitalizations and deaths. Something is very wrong here, and together with other data points, it raises concerning questions about the negative effect of waning antibodies, constant boosting, and the consequences of a leaky vaccine with narrow-spectrum suboptimal antibodies against an ever-evolving virus.

Every Wednesday, Public Health Scotland (PHS) has been publishing a weekly report on COVID data juxtaposed to vaccination rates. Table 14 of this week’s “Public Health Scotland COVID-19 & Winter Statistical Report” lays bare in plain English (and math) a rate of negative efficacy for the vaccine:

As you can see, while the overall Omicron wave seems to be receding in Scotland, age-standardized case rates per 100,000 people were the lowest in the unvaccinated cohort every week for the past four weeks. Thus, it’s not just the fact that the unvaccinated accounted for only 11.5% of cases the past two weeks, but even adjusted for age-stratified vaccination rates (PHS already does the math for you) the unvaccinated had the lowest infection rate out of the four cohorts – especially during the peak of Omicron. Furthermore, we see that even the triple-vaccinated clearly have no efficacy against infection, although they have some degree less negative efficacy than the double-vaccinated.

Here is a linear presentation of the depth of the Omicron wave by vaccination status, where you can see that the unvaccinated had the shallowest wave:

This also coincides with the latest data from the U.K. Health Security Agency of the entire United Kingdom. This data now shows higher rates of infection among the triple-vaccinated in all but the youngest people.

Full stop right here. Any public policy measure – from vaccine passports to discrimination – cannot be justified under the science, even if one’s conscience is OK with apartheid. In fact, clearly this shows that, especially with Omicron, the vaccinated are the super-spreaders. Before we get to hospitalizations and deaths, the notion that the unvaccinated are somehow responsible for the continued spread of this virus is completely contradicted by the data. Some might suggest without evidence that the unvaccinated possibly have a higher rate of prior infection; however, Omicron seems to attack even those who already had previous versions of SARS-CoV-2.

Now onto hospitalizations and deaths. While the vaccines clearly provided some degree of protection for some people for several months against severe illness (while possibly causing even more spread), the Scottish data paints a concerning picture of the long-term consequences of the mass vaccination. People like Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche have been warning that if you mass-vaccinate with a leaky, narrow-spectrum (only recognizes spike protein) vaccine in middle of a raging pandemic, the virus would get more virulent over time.

This concern manifests itself at two time periods when the antibodies are “sub-optimal.” There is a period of a few weeks after the jab when the antibodies are strong enough to bind but not strong enough to neutralize, and then at the back end (estimated at four to six months for the original shot, but likely much shorter for the booster), a period when they wane. The media and public health tyrants like to focus your attention on a snapshot of time, but ignore the totality of circumstances that the shots are creating negative efficacy before and after, while using accounting gimmicks to mask the problem.

Remember how the lockdowns were hailed as a success for a number of countries that initially did well, while Sweden now has the lowest rate of excess mortality in Europe in 2021?

Just as with lockdowns, the mass vaccination needs to be judged after all nine innings of the ballgame.

With that said, let’s take a look at tables 15 and 16 – the acute COVID hospitalization and death rates, respectively:

What is clearly evident both from the hospitalizations and deaths is that the double-vaccinated are now worse off per capita even against critical illness, and that pattern appears to be accelerating. Again, this evidently shows a pattern of negative efficacy even against critical illness over time as the shots wear off, increasingly quickly with Omicron. Why is there no desire to study the source of this negative efficacy and whether the fact that the vaccine is non-sterilizing, wanes quickly with sub-optimal antibodies, is narrow-spectrum, and is increasingly out of synch with the changing virus is going to make the pandemic worse in the long run?

Some will look at the chart and conclude that the boosters are amazing. But first it’s important to recognize that even the boosters don’t stop transmission at all even in the short run, and then, based on the latest hospitalization data, appear to wane just like the original shots. Relatedly, you will notice a pattern: the unvaccinated and two-dose cohorts always appear worse and the one-shot and three-shot cohorts always appear better. This is where the most important part of the data set comes into play.

You see, all cases during the first 21 days after the first shot are counted in the “unvaccinated” cohort, while the first 14 days after one receives the 3rd shot is counted among the two-dose cohort. See the definitions from Appendix 6 of the report.

We know from numerous studies (see here and here) that people are actually the most vulnerable to COVID during the first few weeks on the upswing of the antibodies, when T cells are likely suppressed. This is why the health departments smartly count them in the unvaccinated pile. Hence, for all these months, all the cases and deaths from those made more vulnerable from the first shot – which is caused by the mass vaccination, not the unvaccinated – are counted against the unvaccinated. Over time, as the shots waned on the back end, the truth became evident. Now they are starting the cycle all over again by making the two-dose group look even worse than they are by dumping all of the cases caused by the initial take-up from the third dose into the cohort of double-vaccinated.

It’s the ultimate pandemic Ponzi scheme. Just wait another two months and see what the fourth-shot group looks like relative to the triple-dosers, as the immediate vaccination causes an even greater spike in cases. In other words, you have to look in totality where we are headed rather than manipulating a snapshot of time.

What this report shows is that just 18.5% of the hospitalizations in Scotland were unvaccinated, but even that number includes numerous people within 21 days of the first shot, which is clearly a very vulnerable time. It’s akin to telling someone in a foxhole to run across the field of fire to get to a bunker that might be safer, but he runs an even higher risk of getting cut down before reaching the bunker. Then, after a few hours, the bunker will get overrun by the enemy and you have to run through a new field of fire to get to the next bunker.

Likewise, when a therapeutic lowers symptom severity through immune suppression, it’s a flash in the pan. Eventually, that mechanism of action will come back to bite you in the proverbial arm. And this is even before we get to the long-term concern that multiple shots will create permanent immune suppression by creating original antigenic sin, a position now articulated by the European Medicines Agency and top Israeli immunologists.



Just how prominent is the infection rate within the first 14-21 days of getting the shot, thereby completely distorting the epidemiological data and ultimate perception of efficacy of the shots? Although we don’t have data from the U.K. or U.S. on the timing of infection relative to vaccination period, Alberta, Canada evidently publishes some of that data. According to U.K. researcher Joel Smalley, who screenshotted the chart from the Alberta government’s website before it was taken down, roughly 40% of cases, 47.6% of hospitalizations, and 56% of deaths among the vaccinated occurred within 14 days of vaccination ! Here is the graphical presentation that was on the website, according to Smalley. The top chart represents cases, the middle is hospitalizations, and the bottom is deaths:

Alberta, like many governments, counts the first 14 days as unvaccinated. In Scotland, they are counting the first 21 days after the first dose as unvaccinated and 14 days following subsequent doses in the cohort of the previous numbered dose. Obviously, we can’t mix the Alberta time-based data with the overall Scottish data, but common sense dictates that a bunch of cases from the immune suppression period of the initial vaccination are being blamed on the unvaccinated, and the perception of the booster shots is also likely being ameliorated at the expense of the double-jabbed cohort. For example, in Alberta, it appears that roughly 60% of the hospitalizations in the vaxxed cohort got COVID within 21 days of the shot, which in Scotland, would all be counted as unvaccinated cases. Thus, they deliberately chose the cutoff date for designation of vax status after the inflection point where they see the most COVID cases post-vax!

This deep dive into the data from Scotland should serve as a Rosetta stone for the macro observations we have seen from day one. We are seeing the most vaccinated nations and states being hammered with more cases than ever in a way that defies anything we should expect to see from a safe and effective vaccine. Here are just a few of the many examples:

Dr. Fauci recently told Bloomberg news that “there are some inherent ‘non-believers’ that no matter what you say, they give you a real problem.” He’s right. It takes a true religious level of adherence – like a believer – to continue supporting his narrative, despite the plain facts before our every eyes.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-failure-of-the-mrna-shots-is-on-display-for-all-with-open-eyes,2022-01-21
Horowitz: UK report raises concerns about suboptimal vaccine antibodies erasing natural immunity,"In many areas of life, half a loaf is better than no loaf at all. But when it comes to vaccines, the opposite is true. Half-baked antibodies injected throughout the entire population can make the virus even stronger and negate people's natural immunity. Thus, all the defenses of the leaky vaccine suggesting that it at least conveys ""some"" protection are actually extremely concerning, a point driven home by a nugget in the most recent surveillance report from Public Health England (PHE).

On page 23 of PHE's ""COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report Week 42,"" British health officials report a shocking finding. They believe their serology tests are underestimating the number of people with prior infection due to ""recent observations from UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) surveillance data that N antibody levels appear to be lower in individuals who acquire infection following 2 doses of vaccination."" In other words, the vaccine might be reducing the all-important N antibodies that one generates from natural infection. Kudos to former NYT reporter Alex Berenson for discovering this important point.

Until now, we've been operating under the assumption that those with prior infection don't need the vaccine to boost immunity and taking the shots would only expose them to the growing risk of side effects. However, what if the shots are actually sliding back the natural immunity generated in those with previous infection? What if that is related to the macro concern that a narrow-spectrum vaccine with suboptimal antibodies that only recognize the ""S"" (spike) protein of the virus but not the ""N"" (nucleocapsid) of the virus will cause B cells in those with the vaccine to learn to produce only S antibodies, which are slower-acting and less sterilizing (don't stop transmission) than N antibodies, which are faster-acting and are more effective in their protection against the virus?

It's not like we weren't confronted with some other warning signs that the vaccine could perhaps negate some of the immunity acquired from prior infection. In March, researchers from Mount Sinai in New York and Hospital La Paz in Madrid posted a preprint study indicating that at least the second Pfizer shot might weaken T cell immunity. In a shocking discovery after monitoring a group of vaccinated people both with and without prior infection, they found ""in individuals with a pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2, the second vaccine dose not only fail to boost humoral immunity but determines a contraction of the spike-specific T cell response."" They also note that other research has shown ""the second vaccination dose appears to exert a detrimental effect in the overall magnitude of the spike-specific humoral response in COVID-19 recovered individuals.""

Thus, mass vaccinating with leaky suboptimal antibody production could serve as a Trojan horse and make people more susceptible to an ever-enhanced virus. It's not like we had no warning about the possibility of viral enhancement through waning and suboptimal vaccine-mediated antibodies. On page 52 of Pfizer's ""Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for an Unapproved Product Review Memorandum,"" it is admitted that antibody dependent disease enhancement was a possibility in the long run with waning efficacy.

""However, risk of vaccine-enhanced disease over time, potentially associated with waning immunity, remains unknown and needs to be evaluated further in ongoing clinical trials and in observational studies that could be conducted following authorization and/or licensure,"" write the FDA regulators in the memo. In the April 9, 2021, follow-up memorandum (p. 40), the FDA follows up with the same concern.



Well, here we are today, and we now know this vaccine wanes so badly that they are pushing boosters for everyone, as transmission rates among the vaccinated begin to overtake the unvaccinated. At the time of the April FDA memorandum, it was claimed that the vaccines were not waning. But several months later, they leaked so much that now the CDC is not even ruling out the possibility of deeming those without booster shots ""unvaccinated,"" just like in Israel. So, if the vaccine-mediated antibodies wane beyond what anyone could have imagined, and we are seeing with our own eyes that the virus is getting worse instead of better, how is the concern of viral enhancement not even entertained?

According to PHE data, 86% of all U.K. residents over age 12 have received at least one shot, including nearly everyone in a vulnerable age bracket. Yet the summer and early fall curve, as presented by Worldometer, has blown out the magnitude of the case curve last year when nobody was vaccinated, and the daily numbers are reaching close to their winter peak.

The case rates per capita are now higher among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated in every age cohort over 30.

According to the PHE data (p.16), among those who died within 60 days of testing positive for COVID over the past three weeks in the U.K., 83% of them were fully vaccinated. Some of those deaths were obviously incidental, and among the most vulnerable groups, the vaccination rate is over 90%, but still, something is not right. This is not what we would expect from any minimally effective vaccine.

Consider the fact that they are now taking young children who are not vulnerable to this virus at all and who will produce impervious lifelong natural immunity, and aside from injecting them with numerous side effects, perhaps their natural immunity will also be mitigated by the suboptimal antibodies. Why on earth would anyone with a shred of intellectual honesty make these shots available (much less mandate them) to young children?

Behold the power of a leaky vaccine. When it comes to vaccines, half a loaf is not better than no loaf; it's a poisonous loaf.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-very-concerning-data-from-scotland,2021-10-25
"Horowitz: Walgreens recorded who tested positive for COVID, and the results might surprise you","Imagine a pharmacy obsessively promoting availability of a vaccine over every inch of its store, while its own data shows there are more infections among those with the jabs. The data is in plain sight for all to see, yet there is no self-awareness from Walgreens because money and power trump reason, compassion, and regard for health outcomes. The company’s latest data actually shows that the more they make money on vaccines, the more they make money on selling you tests, because after being jabbed, you sure will need them!

At the risk of causing one more set of data to disappear from the internet, I draw attention to the Walgreens COVID-19 Index, which posts the weekly number of tests administered, percentage of positives broken down by vaccination status, and age brackets of each permutation. You know, the sort of useful information countries like the U.K. published but that our own CDC artfully avoided showing the American people. Here is the bar chart worth more than 560 million vaccine doses!

As you can see, even though the boosted represent just 30% of the population, they accounted for 53.5% of the positives among the sample of over 60,000 tests administered by Walgreens stores nationwide during the week beginning April 5. The unjabbed accounted for just 17% of the positives, lower than their share of the population.

Also of note is that the unvaccinated had, by far, the lowest positivity rate of all of the cohorts.

Until now, the pharma-paid “fact-checkers” suggested that somehow the reason we are seeing a higher percentage of cases among the jabbed is because they have a culture to test more often than the careless unvaccinated rubes. But this data shows that the unvaccinated actually test more than anyone else, presumably because of workplace testing mandates on those without the shots. This means that there is no undercurrent of uncounted cases among the unvaxxed relative to the jabbed.

The real appalling data is among kids. For those ages 5-11, just 39% of the cases were among the unjabbed, even though they account for 65% of this age cohort.

What is also evident from this data is that the shots seem to go negative as time progressives, as both in the double-jabbed and triple-jabbed cohorts, there was a greater proportion of cases among those who were five months out from their last shot. The data seem to indicate a cumulative effect of negative efficacy that gets worse with each jab, after a short period of slight gains. This works harmoniously with numerous data points we’ve seen from other countries and other studies.

Yes, we understand this is not a well-designed triple-blinded randomized controlled trial, but in the absence of any other data, it sure seems that all of the data we do have paints the same picture. The shots rapidly wane and then go negative. Boosters might temporarily staunch the bleeding, but then you are fighting against rapidly intensifying immune suppression, which engenders an even greater need for more boosters, almost like with a heroin addict.

Even vaccine cheerleader Dr. Paul Offit conceded in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine that there is a real concern of the shots inducing a form of immune suppression known as original antigenic sin. In arguing for a more focused approach to boosters, the pediatrician and immunologist admitted that “boosters are not risk-free” and that “we need to clarify which groups most benefit.”

For example, boys and men between 16 and 29 years of age are at increased risk for myocarditis caused by mRNA vaccines. And all age groups are at risk for the theoretical problem of an “original antigenic sin” — a decreased ability to respond to a new immunogen because the immune system has locked onto the original immunogen. An example of this phenomenon can be found in a study of nonhuman primates showing that boosting with an omicron-specific variant did not result in higher titers of omicron-specific neutralizing antibodies than did boosting with the ancestral strain. This potential problem could limit our ability to respond to a new variant.

In Feb., NIH researchers published a paper in which they admitted original antigenic sin is a real possibility with these shots. “The observation that boosting with either mRNA-1273 or mRNA-Omicron resulted in the expansion of a similarly high frequency of cross-reactive B cells likely stems from the principle of original antigenic sin, otherwise termed antigenic imprinting, whereby prior immune memory is recalled by a related antigenic encounter,” observed the authors.

There is strong evidence from countries in the Pacific Rim, such as New Zealand, that those with more shots are being hammered by the new variants more than the unvaccinated. Original antigenic sin would be a very logical culprit, given that we keep vaccinating for a version of the virus that is obsolete, thereby training the body to respond improperly to the new variants. Pfizer promised an Omicron version of the shot by March, but now suggests it will come out in the fall, even though we are already on to newer variants!

Recently, Stanford researchers found that “prior vaccination with Wuhan-Hu-1-like antigens followed by infection with Alpha or Delta variants gives rise to plasma antibody responses with apparent Wuhan-Hu-1-specific imprinting manifesting as relatively decreased responses to the variant virus epitopes compared with unvaccinated patients infected with those variant viruses.” They note that “the extent to which vaccine boosting or infection with different variants will” induce original antigenic sin “will be an important topic of ongoing study.""

Important indeed. But if I remember correctly, we typically study a potential problem with a therapeutic before mass marketing and even mandating it on the public. After all, it’s only the immune systems of an entire world of people on the line.

Editor's note: The percentage of positive tests has been corrected to 53.5% from 61.6%.

Horowitz: We have been lied to: 6 facts that change everything we know about SARS-CoV-2,"James Madison once said, ""A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both."" The coronavirus fascists have succeeded in cementing their illogical, immoral, and illegal policies through the prism of false information about the timing of the virus, the specific nature and severity of the overall fatality rate, the number of actual deaths, and the utility (or perhaps harm) of lockdown policies in actually mitigating deaths – all the while obfuscating the much higher collateral deaths and damage caused by the lockdown itself.

Every day we learn new information demonstrating the lies driving lockdown. Here are some of the most important ones from over the weekend.

1) The shocking inflation of COVID-19 death numbers: From day one, we were warned that states are ascribing every single death of anyone who happens to test positive for the coronavirus — even if they are asymptomatic — to the virus rather than the clear cause of death. Now, thanks to a lawsuit in Colorado, the state was forced to revise its death count down by 23 % over the weekend — from 1,150 to 878. The state is now publishing numbers of deaths ""with"" COVID-19 separate from deaths ""from"" COVID-19. As I reported on Thursday, county officials started accusing the state's department of health of reclassifying deaths of those who tested positive for the virus but died of things like alcohol poisoning as COVID-19 deaths just to insidiously inflate the numbers. This revision in Colorado is a bombshell story that, of course, will remain unknown to most Americans. Every state needs to do this, and if they did, we would find an across-the-board drop in numbers by at least 25%, the same %age by which Dr. Birx reportedly believes the count is being inflated, according to the Washington Post. For example, in Minnesota, state officials are now admitting that every single person who dies in a nursing home after testing positive is now deemed to have died from the virus, never mind the fact that 25% of all natural deaths in a given week occur in nursing homes and that most cases of COVID-19 are asymptomatic, which means more often than not, they died exclusively of other causes.

2) States with longer lockdowns had worse results: Kyle Lamb posted a solid analysis on Twitter, grouping states by how long they implemented a lockdown and averaging out the deaths per 100,000 people by each grouping. The results are stounding, as there is a perfectly inverse relationship between how long a state implemented a lockdown and how successful it was in keeping the deaths down. I independently cross-checked these numbers, and they appear to be accurate.

While this doesn't necessarily prove that lockdowns cause more COVID-19 deaths (although they definitely cause other deaths), it's nearly impossible to assert the other way around – that lockdowns prevent deaths – if we see zero correlation in the data. This is especially true given that Florida is the third most populous state and has the highest concentration of seniors, yet deaths and hospitalizations are way down since the state reopened on May 4. Florida is more densely populated than Michigan and Pennsylvania, yet has one-sixth and one-fourth of the deaths per capita, respectively. The same holds true for Georgia, which is a fairly densely populated state. Infections are down over 40% and deaths are down 31% since reopening. As Secretary of Health Alex Azar said yesterday, ""We are seeing that in places that are opening, we're not seeing this spike in cases. We still see spikes in some areas that are, in fact, closed.""

3) Outside nursing homes, the fatality rate never warranted such action, even if it would work: Every day we find more hard data showing that the overwhelming majority of cases are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and outside nursing homes, the chance of dying is very low and very limited to a population we can more efficiently shield. For those who are younger and healthier, deaths are almost nonexistent. Spain was one of the hardest-hit countries and has a higher overall fatality rate than others, yet its age-stratified fatality rates mirror what we have seen in the Netherlands, Denmark, France, and elsewhere. One Twitter commentator has broken down the age-based fatality rates of the comprehensive Spanish antibody study, and the results are similar to what we've seen elsewhere:

He used public information to calculate the case data and the population age data, and I have spot-checked some data points and they all seem on target. It's identical to what the Netherlands found.

Remember, Spain was one of the hardest-hit countries, but even there, 57% of all deaths and the overwhelming majority of deaths of those above age 80 were in senior care facilities. When you take them out of the equation, the death rates are shockingly low. Yet the same politicians who focused on locking up an entire country failed to care for those in nursing homes. This demographic COVID-19 death chart from Massachusetts speaks volumes about the targeted scope of the danger.

It's essentially the same story in every state.

4) Outside New York, this is barely worse than bad flu seasons: While Europe is opening its schools, almost every U.S. state continues to keep schools shut. Yet according to the CDC's latest weekly report, ""For children (0-17 years), COVID-19 hospitalization rates are much lower than influenza hospitalization rates at comparable time points during recent influenza seasons."" Even the World Health Organization's top scientist just admitted that children ""seem less capable of spreading the virus."" As for everyone else, if you look at the bump in overall deaths for most states (outside the tristate area), they are either at, slightly below, or slight above the 2018 flu season. But at this point, everything is way below a typical flu season in the winter, yet you wouldn't know it from listening to the media. According to the CDC, hospitalizations and deaths have been declining in all 10 designated regions for the past 3-7 weeks. Still, we are now being more fascist that even Italy in violating civil rights.

5) Excess deaths are from the lockdowns, not the virus: While there is zero evidence that lockdowns saved any lives of coronavirus patients, there is clear evidence they cost other lives. It has been observed in a number of states that there are excess deaths being detected, primarily from people dying at home. The CDC is predicting 21,462-40,097 excess deaths NOT due to COVID-19, likely from those too scared to come to the ER because of the exaggerated risk being associated with COVID-19. Also, a recent analysis of excess deaths in England shows that they are seeing thousands of people dying at home from other symptoms because of the lockdown.

6) Social distancing was invented by a high-school kid and politicians, not scientists: Jeffrey Tucker of the American Institute for Economic research reports that the origin of this cult of ""social distancing"" being used for totalitarian lockdowns was the brainchild of a high schooler's sociology paper in 2006, promoted by the Bush administration during the avian flu. It was widely mocked by the epidemiological community, including by Johns Hopkins, for ""causing the potential for a 'serious adverse outcome,'"" thereby ensuring that ""a manageable epidemic could move toward catastrophe.""

How have we allowed such an illogical approach to crush our liberties, economy, hospitals, education, and criminal justice? How have we lost our freedoms?

The answer is that the public is not getting the right information. This is why the political class is doing everything in its power to censor anyone who dares question the idolatry of this lockdown cult. YouTube has censored the videos of Knut Wittkowski, who was a top epidemiologist in Germany and then served as the head of biostatistics, epidemiology, and research design at Rockefeller University. One would think we'd want to hear his opinion, but there is only one view that is allowed to gain traction. Why is it that only one side is scared of the information of the other side?

As James Madison warned, ""Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-walgreens-recorded-who-tested-positive-for-covid-and-the-results-might-surprise-you,2020-05-18
Horowitz: What did Pfizer know and when? 3 important findings from recent document releases,"It’s no longer January 2021, when we all thought we lived in a world of normal vaccines. It’s no longer OK for elected officials to mindlessly repeat the bromide “safe and effective” without any reflection about the mass injury we’ve witnessed, along with the waning and the negative efficacy, in itself, engendering calls for endless boosters. We have so much information that raises serious questions, not the least of which is from Pfizer’s own documents, now ordered released by a federal judge, thanks to Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency, and FOIA requests from groups like the Informed Consent Action Network.

Here are just three of the most recent revelations from these documents that expose the government/pharma narrative to be a lie at its core:

1) Pfizer needed massive staff to process adverse event reports

Several months ago, the FDA released a Pfizer document on adverse events revealing that there were 42,086 adverse events voluntarily reported to the company, of which 1,223 were fatalities, just as of Feb. 28, 2021. A new unredacted copy of that document, which details nine pages of several thousand known categories of adverse effects, reveals the massive scope of injuries that were being reported to Pfizer and raises questions about what company personnel knew, when they knew it, and what they observed in the ensuing months.

In the document, Pfizer reveals that “due to the large numbers of spontaneous adverse event reports,” staff were forced to prioritize “the processing of serious adverse events” and the company had to hire large numbers of staff. “To date, Pfizer has onboarded approximately 600 additional fulltime employees (FTEs),” reveals Pfizer on page six of the confidential document. “More are joining each month with an expected total of more than 1,800 additional resources by the end of June 2021.”

Read this paragraph and ask yourself how many people would have taken the shot had they known this and how the failure to disclose this information is in line with the Nuremberg Code. Also, what is the epilogue of the story? What did Pfizer discover in the ensuing months – to this very day – that it is not disclosing to the public?

2) Rate of myocarditis

When it became apparent to the public earlier in 2021 that myocarditis was a known side effect of the shots, the government and the media immediately claimed the incidence rate was exceedingly low. Numerous “studies” tried to downplay the risks. One paper from Kaiser Permanente in JAMA suggested the rate was just 6.6 per million. Another JAMA study from last June found a 1 in 50,000 rate among the military (which we now know was woefully underreported). Well, thanks to ICAN’s FOIA, we now have the Pfizer informed consent document (p. 5) that shows the company recognized the risk can be as high as 1 in 1,000.

So, all of these stories suggesting that young males were more at risk for myocarditis from the virus than from the shots were bogus, and Pfizer knew it. And again, if this is the degree the company is willing to concede, imagine what the true incidence rate is.

Also, what is the degree of subclinical myocarditis? If we know about this many cases shortly after the injection, who’s to say there isn’t another cohort of people with heart damage that has remained subclinical so far but could come to fruition several months later? Remember, with many fewer vaccines administered in 2022, the rate of myocarditis reports to VAERS is averaging 245% higher than last year.

Is this the glimpse into the long-term effects of those who originally had subclinical myocarditis last year, and is this one of the reasons why so many athletes continue to drop?

The FDA has made it clear that it is flying blind on subclinical myocarditis and long-term heart damage. In the Pharmacovigilance Plan Review Addendum for Comirnaty, the FDA conceded (p. 3-4), “Incidence of subclinical myocarditis and potential long-term sequelae following COMIRNATY are unknown.” However, they did note that a previous study on a smallpox vaccine “suggested an incidence of possible subclinical myocarditis (based on cardiac troponin T elevations) 60-times higher than the incidence rate of overt clinical myocarditis.” That would bring down the 1 in 1,000 rate among young males to as low as 1 in 17 for subclinical ticking time bombs!

Why has the government not studied troponin levels of those who got the shot? Why has it not conducted cardiac MRIs to check for scarring? Why are we flying blind over a year into the known myocarditis problems?

The FDA reviewers flatly stated, “Based on review of available data, there are known risks for myocarditis and pericarditis and an unexpected serious risk for subclinical myocarditis, which warrant PMR safety studies to assess these serious risks.” They called on Comirnaty (PfizerBionTech) to conduct studies, but noted that the sponsor rebuffed them. Seven and a half months after their full approval, we still have no studies, and they are due to be complete July 2023!

3) Pfizer knew about natural immunity

Pfizer never studied the efficacy of the shots exclusively among those with prior infection. Bizarrely, a new document reveals researchers studied them together; however, they break down the results in a way that reveals no need for the shots among those with prior infection. Here is the money quote from p. 12 of Pfizer’s “request for priority review” in May 2021:

Among participants without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during the vaccination regimen (evaluable efficacy population), the estimated VE against FDA-defined severe COVID-19 (protocol definition) occurring at least 7 days after Dose 2 was 95.3% (2-sided 95% CI: 71.0%, 99.9%), with 1 and 21 cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, respectively. Similarly, the estimated VE was also 95.3% (2-sided 95% CI: 70.9%, 99.9%) among participants with or without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, also with 1 and 21 cases in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, respectively.

Pfizer claims efficacy against severe illness among those who took the shot vs. the placebo group among those without prior infection. Researchers report one case in the trial group and 21 in the placebo group. Then they mix together results of those with and without prior infection, and yet the numbers remain the same at 1 and 21 respectively! That means that among those with prior infection, there were zero cases of serious reinfection in both the trial and placebo groups. They might call that 100% effective, but we can also call that 0% effective. Thus, they knew people didn’t need the shot if they already had prior infection, but they promoted it anyway and still got approval.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. In the coming days, more information will come out about what Pfizer knew and when. The question is will any policies change as a result.



On a final note: At least Pfizer is being forced to release some documents. How come we don’t have a single document from Moderna, which is an even stronger dose?

Horowitz: Why did Scotland experience a spike in infant deaths?,"One of the most durable public health trajectories over the past 50 years has been the consistent decline in infant mortality in countries with first-world health care. Yet in September, Scotland experienced such a spike at least in neonatal deaths that it rivaled levels not seen since the 1980s. What on earth would cause such a sudden bizarre spike? Nobody seems to have the answer — nor do they want to study all of the potential culprits.

In September, Public Health Scotland announced that 21 newborns had died that month, triggering an investigation because the numbers rose above an upper control limit for the first time in four years. According to the Herald Scotland, “the figure for September - at 4.9 per 1000 live births - is on a par with levels that were last typically seen in the late 1980s.”

As you can see from the Public Health Scotland (PHS) data, the upper control limit was breached in September, which PHS believes ""indicates there is a higher likelihood that there are factors beyond random variation that may have contributed to the number of deaths that occurred."" After all, the five-year average appears to be about 2.2 per 1,000 live births, so September’s numbers are more than double the average.

Although the incidents of neonatal death tend to fluctuate every other month, the levels appear to be elevated, on average, without the usual intermittent dips below the baseline throughout the entire year of 2021. This is astounding given how much the general trend of infant mortality has declined since the 1980s.

Based on media reports, it appears that the entirety of the public health investigation revolved around whether COVID itself was the culprit of the unusual number of neonatal deaths. The problem is that we didn’t see any of this death in the first year of the pandemic. Also, it was only infants who seemed to experience a sharp increase in death, the least likely cohort to be affected by the pandemic.

In December, PHS announced that based on preliminary findings, it has no evidence that COVID was the culprit. ""There is no information at this stage to suggest that any of the neonatal deaths in September 2021 were due to Covid-19 infection of the baby,” said PHS, according to the BBC. ""Likewise, preliminary review does not indicate that maternal Covid-19 infection played a role in these events.”

Well, that’s pretty obvious, but what is the culprit for such an unusual trend?

""Preliminary information on prematurity suggests that the number of babies born at less than 32 weeks gestation in September 2021 was at the upper end of monthly numbers seen in 2021 to date. This may contribute to the neonatal mortality rate, as prematurity is associated with an increased risk of neonatal death.""

But why would that cause neonatal deaths not seen since the 1980s, and why would there be more prematurely born babies?

With so many other vaccine safety signals being seen, there is no desire to even look at the possibility that an experimental shot that was not studied in pregnant women – yet was widely distributed to them – had something to do with it. We have no idea what caused this spike, but here’s why any logical person would commence an inquiry around the shots.

The shots were not studied in pregnant women, and it’s not like we haven’t seen other problems. There are over 21,000 deaths in VAERS and over 1 million adverse events, including tens of thousands of reproductive-related incidents.

A biodistribution report in Pfizer's pharmacokinetic pre-clinical animal study submitted to the Japanese government found the lipid nanoparticles of the vaccine were accumulating in the ovaries in significant numbers – more than in any other place but the spleen.

We know that this shot has caused menstrual irregularities like we’ve never seen before. A University of Chicago survey sought to recruit 500 women with menstrual irregularities in order to study the cause and effect, and instead, researchers got 140,000 submissions. One study found that 42% of women experienced heavier bleeding, while only 44% reported no changes to their menstrual cycles. A whopping 66% of post-menopausal women experienced breakthrough bleeding. This all goes to show how the 20,000 menstrual irregularities reported in VAERS are a joke because the system only captures a fraction of the adverse events.

As of Dec. 31, there were 3,511 miscarriages reported to VAERS. Remember, this is something that is extremely hard to pin on the vaccine, so the fact that so many felt they could report it demonstrates there is likely a woeful underreporting rate. Here is the presentation from Open VAERS, which shows the number of reported miscarriages peaking around August/September in the United States.

Does any of this mean we can conclusively say the shots are causing reproductive issues? No. But there certainly are a lot of safety signals that should be followed up on rather than dismissed. I asked Dr. James Thorp, a Florida-based OB/GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist with over 42 years of experience, if he was concerned about these signals. “To the extent of a broad statement that menstrual irregularities are usually minor issues is a true statement,” he said. “However, in the context of the massive increase in menstrual irregularities associated with the vaccine, there are very serious potential implications. It supports the cumulative evidence that the jabs’ lipid nanoparticles concentrate in the ovaries and affect/infect/expose ALL ovum to the LNP and cargo mRNA [and] is extremely serious.”

Thorp notes that the LNPs can be inflammatory and they likely penetrate every area of the body and, by extension, the fetus. “The lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) easily pass through all the natural barriers that God created in the human body. LNPs are extremely small spherical particles with an outer lipophilic (fat-soluble) membrane containing the mRNA cargo. There may be billions of LNPs in the COVID-19 jab that do not remain in the deltoid muscle; they are readily dispersed throughout ALL bodily tissues, easily pass through the maternal blood-brain barrier, the placental barrier, and the fetal blood-brain barrier.”

Thorp observes that whereas men continuously make more sperm throughout their lives, women have a finite number of eggs, which means that “every single one is exposed to the LNPs for life.”



Previous studies have shown nanoparticles to be a source of fetal inflammation. “Nobody knows the potentially catastrophic results of this,” warns Thorp. “In my area of expertise of maternal-fetal medicine, we have researched for decades on the catastrophic effect of inflammatory processes that may occur in the fetus and may result in miscarriage, fetal malformation, fetal death, neonatal death, infant death, permanent major newborn damage, permanent major autoimmune damage, permanent cognitive damage, permanent impairment of the immune health, and unleashing of infections and cancers.”

Just how concerning is the VAERS data so far? Dr. Thorp created a chart to compare the rate of miscarriages and fetal deaths (defined together as “pregnancy loss”) per month reported to the system for the COVID shots as compared to all other shots.

As you can see, we have seen 50 times the rate of reporting per month of miscarriages for this vaccine than the other vaccines put together. Thorp mentioned on my show that lest people think he opposes vaccines, he particularly recommends the flu and pertussis vaccines to his pregnant patients. You can see the rate of reporting for pregnancy loss among those shots is very low.

Now look at the rate of fetal malformations that have been reported to VAERS for COVID vaccines as compared to others.

Thorp requested that anyone who had the jab pushed on her in her pregnancy and believes she has suffered adverse effects in herself, her pregnancy, or her newborn to please contact him at jathorp@bellsouth.net.

Given that Scotland seemed to have experienced the most obvious safety alarm signal, why aren’t they looking into any of this? Well, in the richest of ironies, Glasgow Royal Fertility Clinic, one of the top fertility clinics in Scotland, has announced it will not serve any women without the shot. Why do they so badly not want a control group from which to study?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-what-did-pfizer-know-and-when-3-important-findings-from-recent-document-releases,2022-01-11
Ilhan Omar must resign: New evidence from nearly three dozen Somalis reveals a probable spree of felonies,"According to the media's general judgment, 2020 U.S. voters are most concerned with purportedly complex issues of crime and justice. Voters should place no trust in this. This same media forbade itself to investigate a simple, yet objectively historic corruption scandal of national interest.



Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has almost certainly committed the most extensive spree of felonies by a congressperson in U.S. history. As a criminal, she also appears to be historically inept. Scores of verified items of evidence against her are in the public record. Omar has never challenged their authenticity and has never produced a single piece of evidence to support her version of events.

She faces a primary on Tuesday. She again won her party's endorsement. She again won House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's endorsement — and her funding.

The mainstream media judges this remarkable situation to be irrelevant to Minnesota voters, let alone the dominant concern. Editorial malpractice on issues of crime, justice, and the 2020 election spreads everywhere this summer; by no coincidence, the spread can be traced to irresponsible media coverage of a deadly riot in Rep. Omar's district.

Below are 32 new, verifiable, archived pieces of evidence of Omar's historic crime spree.

* * * * *

* * * * *

Above: One of many Somali-language tributes to ""Colonel Nur Said Elmi,"" Rep. Ilhan Omar's father, sent from around the world by family, friends, and contacts following his tragic June 2020 death from a COVID-19 infection. As a high-ranking officer in Somalia's (U.S.-backed) military from the 1970s until 1991, he was well known by this name and title.

* * * * *

In mid-June, Ilhan Omar's father tragically died from a COVID-19 infection. Expressions of grief, condolences, and prayers arrived from around the world, but particularly from the Somali-speaking immigrant community of Minneapolis and from the U.K. By all accounts, he earned his reputation as a gentle, kind neighbor, well known and beloved within Cedar-Riverside, as he had been in Somalia.





Here's proof Ilhan Omar had the 'most extensive spree of felonies' by a congressperson EVER www.youtube.com





His relevance to Rep. Omar's landmark scandal is, of course, his birth name. Upon arriving in the United States in 1995, he claimed to be ""Nur Omar Mohamed"" and received a Social Security number with this name. However, all appeared to know him as Nur Said. He presented himself as Nur Said. Both Ilhan and her sister Sahra Noor referred to their father as Nur Said (prior to deleting the evidence). He is identified on-screen as ""Nur Said, Ilhan's father"" in the 2018 documentary film ""Time for Ilhan"" and again as ""Nur Said"" in the credits. Twice.

Most importantly, British citizen Leila Nur Said Elmi declared her father to be ""Nur Said Elmi, military officer"" on her 1997 marriage application. (Click the link to see the application and a photo of Leila Nur Said Elmi with both Ilhan and Nur Said.)

From 2009 until 2017, Ilhan Omar was married (by a Christian minister) to British citizen Ahmed Nur Said Elmi. Somali naming customs are patrilineal and do not use family surnames. For example, ""Ahmed Nur Said Elmi"" implies that Ahmed's father is ""Nur,"" his grandfather is ""Said,"" and his great-grandfather is ""Elmi.""

Also from 2009 until 2017, Ilhan Omar lived with, raised three kids with, and illegally filed multiple joint tax returns with a second man — not Ahmed Nur Said Elmi.

Just a couple months after marrying, Ilhan and her legal husband both enrolled at North Dakota State University and received federal financial aid. Married couples are not required to submit evidence of their respective parents' assets on FAFSA applications and thus likely receive much more favorable loan terms.

Almost certainly, Rep. Omar fraudulently married her brother, a British citizen, in the service of immigration fraud, education fraud, and federal student loan fraud. Along the way, she filed at least two years of fraudulent tax returns, and possibly eight. She lived in several different subsidized housing units during this time. She likely received subsidized health care and child care during this time. For eight years, every application she signed for state and federal aid was likely fraudulent. During her 2017 divorce from Ahmed Nur Said Elmi, Ilhan submitted a nine-question statement to the court signed under penalty of perjury. Literally — she signed just below the statement of acknowledgment. Eight of her nine answers appear to be perjurious. Each instance is punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.

The paperwork she signed for her successful 2016 run and two-year tenure as a Minnesota state representative may contain instances of perjury as well.

It appears that the media may be waiting for verifiable references to her father as ""Nur Said Elmi"" rather than ""Nur Said."" Logically, this should not be considered necessary, considering the following:

Ilhan's father and her father-in-law would have been named ""Nur Said."" Only one ""Nur Said"" in the necessary age range appears in publicly available archives in either the U.S. or U.K.

However, here these references are. Below are dozens of new, verifiable, archived references to father as ""Nur Said Elmi"" from family, friends, and contacts. You will also find many new references to his daughter Leyla Nur Said Elmi, his son Mohamed Nur Said Elmi, and even to his son Ahmed Nur Said Elmi.

Further, you will find the first-ever public references as to why Ilhan's father was well known by this name. He is referred to as Colonel Nur Said Elmi, who led the U.S.-backed ""54th reserve brigade in the 60th division"" during the 1982 Ethiopian-Somali Border War. Colonel Nur is also said to have ""led a regiment"" in the 1977-1978 Ogaden War.

Abdirahman Issa Kahin owns and operates Afro Deli in Minneapolis. He is well known as a friend of the family — so much so that the Minnesota Star-Tribune interviewed him for its obituary:

He held several positions in civil service in the Somali government and worked for the postal service in Minneapolis after he came to the U.S. His nicknames in Cedar-Riverside were ""Colonel"" and ""Superdad."" Mohamed had a ""huge"" concept of family and was a father figure to many people in Cedar-Riverside, said Abdirahman Kahin, the owner of Afro Deli. ""He was the father that everyone wanted to have,"" Kahin said. ""Open-minded, listening, taking your phone number.""

Note that Abdirahman Issa Kahin, like the Star-Tribune, is careful to refer to Ilhan's father as ""Nur Omar.""

However, he then referred to ""Ilhan Omar, Leyla, and Sahra Nur."" Leyla, of course, is Leyla Nur Said Elmi and had attested on her marriage application that her father is ""Nur Said Elmi, military officer.""

Also note the continued, transparent absurdity of the Star-Tribune's coverage. ""Colonel"" is said to only be his ""nickname."" And he simply worked in ""civil service.""

Meanwhile, Sahan Journal — an outlet founded in 2019 by a former Star-Tribune reporter in partnership with Minnesota Public Radio — filed a much different story, putting the Star-Tribune to shame. Though it also did not mention ""Nur Said Elmi,"" it was the first outlet anywhere to finally confirm his former prominence in Somalia was due to his military career:





The article went on to bemoan the fact that ""news stories about Nur's death have for the most part obscured his legacy, painting him as little more than Rep. Ilhan Omar's father. But Nur was a leader in his own right, and those who knew him well hailed him as a national treasure for Somalis at home and in the diaspora.""

Clearly, there's an incredible amount of information worth unpacking in the Sahan Journal article. Since 2016, the Star-Tribune — and national media in general — chose to conceal this historic scandal from U.S. voters.

Their malfeasance is the only reason Rep. Omar is on the ballot this week in Minnesota. Our deadly national wave of riots began in this ill-served, media-neglected district.

John Cleese isn't racist. He's just old.,"If you hang out with comedians a lot you'll hear calls to ""punch up"" rather than ""punch down."" If you're unfamiliar with jokemonger parlance, ""punching up"" means sticking it to people in positions of power, authority, and privilege. Punching down means going after the little guy, or minority groups.

That duality of options has always made me uncomfortable. A standup friend of mine, Joe DeVito, hit the nail on the head during a conversation with me once. The ""punching up"" metaphor makes sense—if you think comedy is all about punching.

I don't tend to view comedy as punching. I hail from the Dick Van Dyke ""tap dance and make people smile"" camp more than the George Carlin prophet-cum-comic school of thought. Nothing against George Carlin, it's just not my core motivation. Ironic, I know, given that I make a good living as a political satirist and podcast host. (Recently I advocated legalizing hallucinogenic mushrooms, questioned basic assumptions about nuclear weapons, and made fun of Woke cultural appropriation hysteria.)

When the issue of punching up arises in inter-comic squabbling, I'll often point to Monty Python as a non-pugilistic brand of humor. What were those guys punching, exactly? Class stratification? German punctiliousness? The ossified cultural consensus on how and when to properly use a fish? Nope. Monty Python was a bunch of comedic geniuses cranking out industrial-strength absurdism. Obviously they hit upon all manner of issues, ranging from class to sexuality to the etiquette of returning dead parrots to pet stores. But if you had asked the cast if they were ""punching up or punching down?"" I suspect they would have rolled their eyes and offered you a lager.

For that reason I felt defensive about Monty Python alumnus John Cleese this week when the aged comedian found his way into the daily Two Minutes of Hate, which is Twitter. (Interesting John Cleese fact — he once turned down a peerage in the House of Lords because it would require him to stay in England during the winter.) Here's what Cleese said:

Some years ago I opined that London was not really an English city any more. Since then, virtually all my friends from abroad have confirmed my observation. So there must be some truth in it. ... I note also that London was the UK city that voted most strongly to remain in the EU.

This turned into a Twitter avalanche indicting John Cleese as a dog-whistling racist. I'm going to climb out on a limb here and say ... maybe he's not?

First, ""Some years ago I opined that London was not really an English city anymore."" Well, he's right. London is geographically English, but other than its physical proximity to Surrey, it's not English — it's global. Its last census reported that 36.7 percent of its denizens are foreign-born. About 45 percent of the people who live there are White British (Welsh, Irish, English, Scottish). Which is to say, less than half of London is English. The rest are a mélange of Europeans, non-Europeans, first- and second-generation immigrants, Klingons, Vulcans, Wookies, and folks from elsewhere in the Commonwealth and/or Narnia.

It's a global city, like New York. It is richly diverse and cosmopolitan, which is a strength and draw to millions of people who live there. However, I will argue that it's difficult to be ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan while simultaneously being homogeneously English. Mutually exclusive, in fact.

Although to be fair, people aren't mad at Cleese for observing that London isn't English, they're mad because he wishes it were. Cleese appears to prefer Englishness over multiculturalism. (Note the distinction between ""culture"" and ""race."") Following the media storm, he tweeted, ""I prefer cultures that do not tolerate female genital mutilation. Will this will be considered racist by all those who hover, eagerly hoping that someone will offend them — on someone else's behalf, naturally.""

My read on the situation is that Cleese is not racist, he's old. What I mean by that is: Life is always in flux, cities are by nature dynamic, society is fluid. People tend to want things to stay static, and they don't, and that's irksome for many, particularly as they grow elderly and nostalgic. I question when London was last really ""English,"" given that it was the imperial capital of half the globe well before he was born, and no doubt had several pockets of Indians and Jamaicans and Vulcans living there by the time he showed up.

All the same, is John Cleese allowed to prefer English over polyglot? Because I think that's the root heresy at work here: saying that English culture might be superior to some others, and preferring it to them.

New York City is far, far more diverse and multicultural than, say, Portland, Oregon. Portland is so overwhelmingly white that it's basically a giant bleach commercial with some craft breweries and street buskers thrown in. Ethnicity aside, can Portlanders prefer their cultural homogeneity over the vastly more polyglot city of Houston? So long as people agree that immigration is positive and we should be neighborly and welcoming to newcomers, I'm disinclined to hound people for their personal preferences.

I don't know whether or not John Cleese meets that threshold. We know that he favored Brexit. I suspect, based on scattershot Cleese musings, that he wants a Britain that is open and welcoming to foreigners, but that he would also like them to become polite, uptight, tea-drinking gardeners once they've moved there.

I could be wrong. I don't know the depths of John Cleese's heart, and whether or not his pro-Brexit stance comes from hatred of distant bureaucrats (good) or dislike of foreigners and immigrants (bad). I suspect most of the people shouting at him on Twitter have no idea either.

Which is my main and final point. Maybe a single isolated tweet isn't sufficient information to psychically intuit whether someone is a bigot or not? We're all on the same page here: Bigotry is bad. Don't be a racist. Don't be a homophobe. But if we're going to champion the idea that the worst non-criminal thing you can be in our culture is a bigot, then we should also be at least a tad reserved about passing out scarlet letters just because there's a slow news day and we spot a fun Twitter pile-on to get worked up about.

Were I British I would have voted ""Remain"" on Brexit. (I appreciate the philosophical argument to leave, but I don't think withdrawing from the common market will work out.) Which is to say, I disagree with John Cleese about Brexit. But there's a big difference between saying John Cleese is wrong, and saying John Cleese is evil.

And therein lies much of the problem with trying to solve the world's problems on Twitter.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/ilhan-omar-must-resign-new-evidence-from-nearly-three-dozen-somalis-reveals-a-probable-spree-of-felonies,2019-06-04
Horowitz: NIH study finds those with shots had fewer N antibodies even after COVID infection,"“The best vaccination is to get infected yourself. … It’s the most potent vaccination.” ~Dr. Anthony Fauci, 10/11/2004

It sure appears that the more we inject people with the mRNA gene therapy, the more the virus circulates and the more they get infected. All the data from the U.K., New Zealand, and our own Walgreens seems to indicate that the more you vax, the more you get infected. Just ask our very own vice president, who got infected just a few weeks after receiving her fourth jab, which is the supposed sweet spot of vaccine efficacy and antibody titer levels. Now, a new study by NIH researchers offers a possible glimpse into the mechanics of the leaky and illusory “immunity” of these novel shots.

In a preprint paper posted last week, the NIH researchers studied the N (nucleocapsid) antibody levels of those who participated in the Moderna clinical trial vs. the placebo group upon the unblinding of the participants. Their findings were earth-shattering.

“We analyzed data from 1,789 participants (1,298 placebo recipients and 491 vaccine recipients) with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the blinded phase (through March 2021). Among participants with PCR-confirmed Covid-19 illness, seroconversion to anti-N Abs at a median follow up of 53 days post diagnosis occurred in 21/52 (40%) of the mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients vs. 605/648 (93%) of the placebo recipients (p < 0.001).”

Kudos to Igor Chudov for finding this paper that clearly our government agencies are not excited to advertise. Overall, the study’s authors found, “For any given viral copy number, the odds of anti-N seropositivity were 13.67 times higher for the placebo arm than the vaccine arm.”

It’s truly hard to overstate the significance of this finding. These are the actual participants in the Moderna trial, and their levels were checked roughly seven weeks after being diagnosed with COVID, plus this was a study of the original strain of the virus when supposedly the vaccines were more effective. Yet just 40% of those with prior infection among the vaccinated group had anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, while 93% of the placebo group did. To be clear, this means that not only is the vaccine inferior to natural immunity, but it is so inferior that it might inhibit your acquisition of immunity to the nucleocapsid protein of the virus even if you wind up getting the virus, which you assuredly will because the vaccines don’t stop infection.

When you hear the proponents of the shots bragging about antibody titers, they are measuring the anti-spike protein (S) antibodies. The shots code your body to produce the most dangerous part of the virus, but on the other hand you don’t get the benefit of full immunity because your body is trained to recognize only the spike, not the main shell of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The implication of this study would be that the more you vaccinate, the more it erases your natural immunity, so not only do you still get the virus, but you will continue getting it because you can never achieve full immunity, as you might with natural infection without having been jabbed with a gene therapy that primes your body to respond inappropriately. It is an anti-herd immunity shot.

Last October, we were ridiculed for bringing this point to light based on a finding from the Public Health England vaccine surveillance report. The U.K. government researchers asserted (p. 23) that their serology tests were underestimating the number of people with prior infection due to ""recent observations from UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) surveillance data that N antibody levels appear to be lower in individuals who acquire infection following 2 doses of vaccination."" In other words, they seemed to believe that N antibodies are primarily produced with natural infection, but many people with the shots can never acquire those full-spectrum antibodies, even if they wind up catching the virus. This new NIH paper perfectly confirms the suspicion of the U.K. researchers.

Does the inhibition of anti-N antibodies explain why data continues to show the more you vax, the more you get infected?

Just consider the latest Walgreens data for the results of 66,000 tests nationwide for the week of April 17. Even though the unvaccinated were administered the most tests of any cohort (likely because of employer testing mandates), they account for the lowest share of the weekly positive results. It seems to get worse both as you go up in doses and in duration from the dose!

Here are the positivity rates by dose:

And here are the percentages of positive results by cohort juxtaposed to their share of testing:

Note that the triple-vaxxed account for 51.4% of the positive results (while only accounting for 45.1% of the tests), even though they only compose 30.4% of the population. 66.6% of the total population has at least two shots, but account for 79.4% of the total positives at Walgreens, and this data has been consistent for a while.

In other words, the vaccine campaign has been the ultimate exercise in perfidy, in which everything they accuse the unvaccinated of being guilty of actually applies to the vaccinated. Think of how many soldiers, doctors and nurses, and government workers are losing their careers to this day for not getting these shots, including those who already have immunity.

Now consider the fact that Pfizer has just applied for approval of a third dose for young children, even though:

It’s for a strain of the virus that no longer exists.

It’s for a virus that doesn’t affect them clinically.

A paper just published in the Lancet shows that even three doses wane in efficacy, even for serious illness, in adults after just a few months.

A recent Danish study shows zero all-cause mortality benefit (actually slightly negative) from Pfizer’s original clinical trial.

The CDC just posted data showing 75% of children already have more robust natural immunity.

The shot causes a 120-fold increase in heart inflammation over the background rate for some cohorts following the second shot, according to a Nordic study published in JAMA, among many other potential maladies and injuries.

This is on par with transgender science! Then again, these are some of the same doctors and “scientists” who want to treat men with obstetrics.

It’s also noteworthy that this NIH study tracked the Moderna study participants roughly around May 2021 and still found, that early on, that 52 of the 491 trial participants from the trial arm caught COVID. Yet they still marketed it for months later as stopping the spread. To this day, Pfizer (Comirnaty) has a printed FDA label stating fraudulently that its use is “for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.” Indeed, the shots are actually “vaccines” against achieving what Fauci himself called “the most potent vaccination” in the form of natural infection.



Then again, in a society where criminal is victim, illegal alien is citizen, and man is woman, perhaps it’s not a stretch to label an agent that causes spread and prevents permanent immunization as a sterilizing vaccine.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/john-cleese-isnt-racist-hes-just-old,2022-04-28
"Sanders tweets list of 27 countries with 'universal health care,' but not one uses his socialist system","Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders took to Twitter Thursday afternoon to promote his health care plan. In a tweet, the socialist senator from Vermont said, ""Remember: our 'crazy idea' of universal health care is a reality in...""

He then proceeded to list 27 countries, mostly in Europe, that left-wing Americans often cite as examples of nations with the kind of health care they would want for the United States.

There's only one problem: Not a single country Sanders listed has anything like the socialist health care system he wants to impose on the American people. Literally, not a single one.

Sanders' system

Let's start by identifying the key features of Sanders' health care plan as identified by the Twitter account ""Bad Econ Takes"" and all of which are listed on Sanders' website:

A universal, state-run system that acts as an insurance company that covers everyone in the U.S. A ban on private insurance except for elective procedures A public health care plan that covers prescription drugs, mental health services, and long-term care No co-payments or deductibles

Not even close



Dissecting 27 different global health care systems is a large undertaking, but for the purpose of this article, we'll focus on the ones that are nothing like what Sanders is pitching.

The Democratic presidential candidate listed three countries — Israel, the Netherlands, and Switzerland — whose health systems are nothing like what Sanders is proposing. None of these countries have a public health insurance program that everyone automatically qualifies for and covers prescription drugs and other services; all of them operate on private insurance; and none of them prohibit co-payments or deductibles.

The Swiss, for instance, have achieved universal health coverage entirely through private insurance plans that everyone is required to purchase. Meanwhile, the Israelis have access to a mix of large non-profits/NGOs and private insurance companies. About 40 percent of Israelis purchase private health insurance. Similarly, the Dutch do not have anything like ""Medicare For All."" Their health system is a privately run two-track system where partly state-financed private insurance covers routine doctor visits and hospital stays, and a state-run system kicks in for long-term elderly care and the terminally ill.

What about the UK, Canada, and Denmark?

Sanders often points to the British, Canadian, and Danish health systems as role models. The problem is that their systems are also quite different from what he's proposing.

To be clear, all three countries do have large state-run insurance mechanisms. However, unlike Sanders' proposal, Canada and Denmark do have some private insurance markets and the residents of those countries have co-payments and deductibles. Moreover, their immigration and naturalization laws are far stricter than those of the United States to qualify for benefits.

The British NHS program may be the closest to what Sanders is proposing in that the Brits do have a nationalized system with limited private insurance; however, there are some major differences. For instance, in the U.K., prescription medications, dental care, and eye care do require payments.

We'll go into greater detail some other time, but for the time being, the tweet below by ""Bad Econ Takes"" provides a summary of how these countries' health programs differ from Sanders' Medicare For All scheme.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/nih-covid-shots-antibodies,2020-02-14
Stuckey: Why kids (and you) shouldn't be forced to mask,"Editor's note: This story is reposted from Allie Beth Stuckey's website.

*****

Many media outlets are reporting on an increase in cases and pediatric hospitalizations due to COVID. In response, cities, counties and school districts are implementing mask mandates. In some areas, like Dallas County, children as young as 2 years old will be required to wear masks in commercial entities.

To be frank, I find this insane. Considering all the data available that shows the lack of efficacy of most masks in most settings, especially in kids, there is no apparent reason to mandate masks for schools.

Before we get into it, let me say that I have never been an outright anti-masker, and I sure as heck have never believed COVID-19 is some kind of hoax.

I know people whose families have been seriously, negatively impacted by the virus, so I have seen its severity. Also, I'm a germaphobe and a bit of a hypochondriac; it doesn't take much to make me scared of a virus. Back when we thought COVID had a 20% death rate, I was one of the people screaming from the rooftops (aka Twitter) that people need to stay inside. I was sanitizing my groceries, for crying out loud. (I may or may not still be sanitizing my hands every five seconds.)

But, as time went on, and 15 days to slow the spread and relieve the hospitals turned into months of shifting goal posts and mixed messages that seemed to be more correlated with politics and public opinion (here's one example) than science, it became clear that many of our public health experts, and certainly our politicians, really aren't trafficking in fact.

From everything I've read from the world's leading researchers, the science shows there are certain situations in which certain masks worn a certain way by certain people may be effective at preventing the spread of COVID, but even that is debatable. Personally, I think the risks far outweigh the benefits of masking kids. But, I'll present you with the data, and you can decide for yourself.

First, let's talk about this Delta variant that's sent everyone into a tizzy — kind of for good reason, but also kind of not.

The Delta variant is causing a spike in cases, and there is an increase in hospitalizations, too. But we're still nowhere near where we were at our peak in January as far as deaths go. Vaccines could get the credit, and/or it could be that the strain isn't actually as deadly as the original. And, as we'll get to more later, the AAP found that pediatric hospitalization numbers are being inflated because of the CDC's requirement for testing.

Plus, if Delta goes the way it's gone in the other countries it's passed through, it's going to spike then steeply drop off.

Data from India (where Delta originated), Netherlands, and the UK all show a spike in cases due to Delta and a sharp decrease. This data is compiled by the New York Times.

Delta rose and fell in India. Mask compliance remains low in the country (32%).

Delta rose and fell in the Netherlands. The country ditched masks in most places on June 26, and they are only required in some spaces for people 13 & over.

Delta rose and is still falling in the UK. Masks are not required in England, are enforced in some places in England and Wales, and are not required in Northern Ireland for worshipers or students in classrooms.



Delta will do the same in the United States as it has in other countries — spike, then fall — regardless of universal masking.

We really don't have a lot of evidence of mask mandates staving off the virus at all.

In late October 2020, 93% of adults in the United States reported that they sometimes, often or always wear masks when they leave their home. 72% said they always do.(That puts us right on par withGermany, and ahead of other European countries, as of January 2021.)

And yet data from the NYT shows that the end of October marks the beginning of the biggest spike in COVID cases:

Sweden never mandated masks. In January, only 12% of Swedes said they wore a mask all the time, with 59% saying never. They haven't fared any worse than we have, and their death rate is lower than some other European countries, like those in the UK, who have had mask mandates.

We can also compare Sweden to a U.S. state with a similar population size, Michigan, which implemented its mask mandate in March 2020. While Sweden has had slightly more cases than Michigan (1.11 million vs. 1.02 million), Sweden has had far fewer deaths than Michigan (14,658 vs. 21,243).



Yinon Weiss, a reporter at the Federalist, graphed COVID case stats from Our World in Data of European countries, as well as states in the U.S. and pinpointed when each national and state government implemented mask mandates. What he found was that mask mandates seem to have no effect on the spread of the virus. *See charts toward the end of the article.*

A recent example is Israel, which reinstated its mask mandate on June 25.

As you can see, Israel's cases have risen in a similar fashion as other countries, like Netherlands, which did the exact opposite — they ditched their mask mandate right before the rise in Delta cases.



Sweden never mandated masks (and has even created astigma around them) or locked down. Their death rate is much lower than some other European countries that have mandated them, like countries in the UK.

Now, there are other studies looking at other states and countries that do show that cases began to decrease after a mask mandate. But I believe that's more coincidence than causation. Why? Because of the many studies that have already been done on the effectiveness of masks at stopping the transmission of disease.

Mask mandates aren't proven to do much because masks aren't proven to do much.

Several studies demonstrate this:

● The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University points out that research on the efficacy of masks to prevent the spread of COVID is weak:

In 2010, at the end of the last influenza pandemic, there were six published randomised controlled trials with 4,147 participants focusing on the benefits of different types of masks. Two were done in healthcare workers and four in family or student clusters. The face mask trials for influenza-like illness (ILI) reported poor compliance, rarely reported harms and revealed the pressing need for future trials.



Despite the clear requirement to carry out further large, pragmatic trials a decade later, only six had been published: five in healthcare workers and one in pilgrims. This recent crop of trials added 9,112 participants to the total randomised denominator of 13,259 and showed that masks alone have no significant effect in interrupting the spread of ILI or influenza in the general population, nor in healthcare workers.



It would appear that despite two decades of pandemic preparedness, there is considerable uncertainty as to the value of wearing masks. For instance, high rates of infection with cloth masks could be due to harms caused by cloth masks, or benefits of medical masks. The numerous systematic reviews that have been recently published all include the same evidence base so unsurprisingly broadly reach the same conclusions. However, recent reviews using lower quality evidence found masks to be effective. Whilst also recommending robust randomised trials to inform the evidence for these interventions.



Many countries have gone onto mandate masks for the public in various settings. Several others — Denmark, and Norway — generally do not. Norway's Institute for Public Health reported that if masks did work then any difference in infection rates would be small when infection rates are low: assuming 20% asymptomatics and a risk reduction of 40% for wearing masks, 200 000 people would need to wear one to prevent one new infection per week.

● The New England Journal of Medicine concluded this in May 2020:

We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.

● A randomized controlled trial in Japan testing for the effectiveness of surgical masks in reducing the incidence of the common cold found, ""Face mask use in health care workers has not been demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds. A larger study is needed to definitively establish noninferiority of no mask use.""

● A 2010 study by Cambridge University found, ""While there is some experimental evidence that masks should be able to reduce infectiousness under controlled conditions, there is less evidence on whether this translates to effectiveness in natural settings. There is little evidence to support the effectiveness of face masks to reduce the risk of infection.""

● A study from Oxford Clinical Infectious Diseases found that ""single-use medical masks are preferable to cloth masks, for which there is no evidence of protection and which might facilitate transmission of pathogens when used repeatedly without adequate sterilization.""

Hmm. Sitting in a cloth mask all day without sterilization could transmit pathogens (organisms that can transmit diseases). Interesting.

● Danish randomized controlled trial with 6,000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting.

Other countries get it. We, apparently, don't.

Even UNICEF, which is pro-mask in general (and, I would add, seems to not be following the science by recommending cotton masks), strongly advises against kids under age 5 wearing masks, and recommends mask-wearing for children ages 6-11 only in certain settings.

This is in direct opposition to airlines and some city governments mandating masks for children as young as age 2.

The UK removed face mask requirements for students in May. Education secretary Gavin Williamson said, ""Removing face masks will hugely improve interactions between teachers and students, while all other school safety measures will remain in place to help keep the virus out of classrooms.""

A Swedish student was kicked out of classfor refusing to take off his mask. As noted above, the Netherlands only urges mask wearing for people 13 and over.

Also, keep in mind that mask-wearing has been a prevalent trend in Asia — China, specifically — for years, and that obviously didn't stop the virus from originating and spreading there.

And maybe it's also worth noting that many of the same people mandating/advocating for these rules aren't always following them (like Lori Lightfoot, Gretchen Whitmer,Gavin Newsom, Barack Obama, Muriel Bowserand Nancy Pelosi, to name a few). Just something to consider.

Even if masks were proven to be super effective, kids have a very, very, very small chance of getting anything close to a severe case of COVID.

The American Academy of Pediatrics finds that pediatric hospitalization of kids because of COVID is extremely rare. A recent study found that some hospitals are reporting children admitted to the hospital with COVID symptoms, or who tested positive for COVID, but who were not admitted because of COVID:

Children have suffered tremendously due to policies that have kept schools and recreational facilities closed to them, and the burden has been greatest on children who are low-income and English language learners. Scientific and media reports that inaccurately portray the risk of COVID-19 to children can do harm by alarming parents and providing justification for ongoing restrictions to in-person education and other programming (i.e. summer camps). Kushner et al and Webb et al have contributed greatly to the field by careful work to understand the true burden of COVID-19 disease among children. Via these studies, parents and policy makers should be reassured that pediatric hospitalization for severe COVID-19 disease is indeed rare.

Dr. Roshni Mathew, a Stanford School of Medicine pediatric infectious disease specialist, told NPR: ""For children in particular, the risk of serious consequences from COVID-19 is the same magnitude as the risk they face from the flu, she says. But many parents seem more worried about the new and less familiar disease. That anxiety is heightened by the new guidelines on mask-wearing. But experts urge parents to try not to worry too much.""

If we're to take the CDC's numbers at face value (there may be a reason or two not to), 416 children have reportedly died ""with COVID"" out of 74 million children in the U.S. Most, it seems, had underlying conditions. These facts, taken with the AAP's warning we previously noted about inflated pediatric hospitalization numbers, lets us know that there is almost a 0% chance of healthy kids dying from the virus.

While every life lost matters, it's important to have some perspective.

In the 2017-18 flu season, the CDC estimates that 643 children 17 and under died of the flu.

Deaths in children with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection are reportable in the United States and 183 deaths were reported for the 2017-2018 season. However, influenza-associated pediatric deaths are likely under-reported as not all children whose death was related to an influenza virus infection may have been tested for influenza. Therefore, we used a mathematical model to estimate the total number of pediatric deaths based on hospitalization rates and the frequency of death in and out of the hospital from death certificates, estimating that there were more than 640 deaths associated with influenza in children.

Keep in mind, too, that flu seasons are about six months. We've had COVID for over a-year-and-a-half. So, far more children died of/with the flu in six months a few years ago than have died of/with COVID in the last 18+ months. There were 11 million kids who tested positive for the flu in the 2017-18 season. There have been 4 million children who have tested positive for COVID so far.

Did anyone suggest shutting down schools or wearing masks in 2018? Why not? Because, until COVID, we understood the importance of kids receiving in-person instruction unencumbered by plexiglass and pathogen-laden face cloths. The only thing that's changed, at least for this age group, is politics. As Matt Walsh said in a school board meeting recently, the masks are really more about security for the teachers, school board and administration, not for the kids.

Even if kids do get it, they're unlikely to pass to teachers (who, by the way, can get vaccinated if they want to).

Studies in Sweden, France, Wales, and China show that transmission from a child to an adult, mask or not, is extremely rare. From the University of Vermont:

""The data are striking,"" said Dr. Raszka. ""The key takeaway is that children are not driving the pandemic. After six months, we have a wealth of accumulating data showing that children are less likely to become infected and seem less infectious; it is congregating adults who aren't following safety protocols who are responsible for driving the upward curve.""

The risk of mask-wearing for kids simply outweigh the benefits.

Dr. Marty Makary, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, wrote this about the adverse effect of masks on kids for the Wall Street Journal:

In March, Ireland's Department of Health announced that it won't require masks in schools because they ""may exacerbate anxiety or breathing difficulties for some students."" Some children compensate for such difficulties by breathing through their mouths. Chronic and prolonged mouth breathing can alter facial development. It is well-documented that children who mouth-breathe because adenoids block their nasal airways can develop a mouth deformity and elongated face.



The possible psychological harm of widespread masking is an even greater worry. Facial expressions are integral to human connection, particularly for young children, who are only learning how to signal fear, confusion and happiness. Covering a child's face mutes these nonverbal forms of communication and can result in robotic and emotionless interactions, anxiety and depression. Seeing people speak is a building block of phonetic development. It is especially important for children with disabilities such as hearing impairment.

In summary…

Kids are at extremely low risk of severe COVID illness. They are not driving the spread of COVID to adults. Plus, everyone 12 and over has had the opportunity to get vaccinated. If the vaccines work, everyone who has taken it is protected, and everyone who has chosen not to take the vaccine has accepted whatever risks that choice may or may not pose. There is therefore no reason to treat kids as if they are a threat to public health.

Furthermore, there is no solid evidence to prove that masking kids is an effective strategy in mitigating COVID, and, in fact, there is plenty of evidence to the contrary. Parents can protect their kids as they see fit, but they should not be forced to wear masks.

"WATCH Glenn Beck's EPIC takedown of leftist LIES about America, at CPAC 2021","Did you know that New England was the first major population in the world to abolish slavery, doing so nearly 30 years before Britain passed the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act in 1780? Did you know that, of the 12.7 million Africans who were enslaved during the transatlantic slave trade from 1501 to 1875, only 2.4% were brought to the United States? The remaining more than 10 million enslaved people went to Portuguese, English, French, Spanish, and Dutch holdings. Did you know that there are over 40 million people around the globe who are enslaved right now? Why are we arguing about people who were enslaved hundreds of years ago instead of freeing people today?

Speaking at the 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas, Texas, Glenn Beck shared a treasure trove of rare artifacts and documents from the history vaults at Mercury One to debunk the leftist lies about slavery, racism, and the real history of America.

""I am sick and tired of the lies that are constantly coming at us. I am sick and tired of it — and I think you are, too. So we're going to set the record straight,"" Glenn began.

""Americans, hear me ... slavery is not about racism. Slavery is not about America. Slavery is a human condition, it's a human condition that needs to be worked on at all times. Racism is a human condition,"" Glenn said as he revealed the artifacts and documents provided by M1, Glenn's 501(c)(3) charity founded to provide humanitarian aid and, in partnership with sister organizations The Nazarene Fund and Operation Underground Railroad, to rescue, liberate, and restore the lives of hundreds of people who are currently enslaved.

""[Americans] were the first in the world [to abolish slavery] — and we were also the only people that had white people, killing white people, to free black people. Five hundred thousand Americans died for freedom. The people that fought and died, they believed in a higher ideal. They believed ... that all men are created equal. That's why we fought and died. That's why we carry on with that today. That's what the Republican Party should be all about today,"" he added.

""We all are created equal and endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. Stand for those rights! That is our unum. That will unite us,"" Glenn declared to a standing ovation.

French President Emmanuel Macron caves; delays climate change tax amid deadly riots,"French President Emmanuel Macron has capitulated after weeks of protests in his country, and agreed to postpone a pending fuel tax that sparked violent demonstrations in the European nation. Macron had claimed that the fuel tax was necessary to combat climate change.

What are the details?

Macron originally announced that a 30-cent tax hike on fuel would go into effect on Jan. 1, which sparked weeks of protests. Since the heightened violence erupted on Saturday, four people have been killed in riots that resulted in another 100 injuries and over 400 arrests as leaders seek to tamp down the unrest.

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe held a news conference announcing that the increased tax on fuel would be delayed by six months.

NPR reported that Philippe said on French television: ""One would have to be deaf and blind not to see or hear that anger. I hear it...It is the anger of France who works hard and struggles to make ends meet.""

""No tax is worth threatening the unity of the nation,"" Philippe continued, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.

Rioters have looted stores, set cars on fire, and vandalized both the Arc de Triomphe and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier amid their outrage.

The fuel tax is part of President Macron's broader environmental initiative, which is designed to fight climate change, but its announcement served as a breaking point for French citizens — as voters' views of the young leader have soured over his 18 months in office. Critics have accused Macron of favoring the rich in his reform agenda, and his constituent favorability ratings toppled from hovering in the low 40s during the summer, to 28 percent as of last month.

Anything else?

Those rioting against the fuel tax proposal are known as the ""Yellow Vests,"" comprised of mostly rural citizens feeling the pinch over a series of initiatives by Macron that include the loosening of labor laws.

Neon yellow safety vests donned by the demonstrators are symbolic in that they're required to be worn by all motorists in the country, but the fuel protests morphed into a broader anti-government message as the chaos has waged on.

""Originally, the yellow vest protesters were people from rural areas who have to drive long distances as part of their daily life,"" NPR's Jake Cigainero reported. ""Protests appeared in pockets around France to denounce Macron's green tax and then quickly grew into a larger movement that includes members of the working and middle class who are expressing their frustration about slipping standards of living.

""They say their income are too high to qualify for social benefits but too low to make ends meet,"" Cigainero added. ""The movement has no official leadership and was organized initially through social media groups.""



Other protests against climate change-inspired measures have also sprung up in recent days in Belgium and Canada.",https://www.theblaze.com/personality/graham-allen/sex-change-advice-for-3-year-olds-graham-allen-takes-on-uk-clinic,2018-12-04
Turning Point USA's Candace Owens says it would have been 'fine' if Hitler had stayed in Germany,"Turning Point USA's communications director, Candace Owens, told those gathered at an event in December in London that if Hitler had just focused on Germany instead of trying to conquer Europe, that would have been ""ok."" She argued that his only problem was globalism, and wanting to expand beyond his nation's borders.

Wait...what happened?

Answering a question on the role of nationalism during the London event, Owens said:



Yeah, I agree. I actually don't have any problems at all with the word ""nationalism."" I think that it — the definition gets poisoned by elitists that actually want globalism. Globalism is what I don't want. So, when you think about, whenever we say nationalism, the first thing people think about, at least in America, is Hitler. you know, he was a national socialist. But if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, ok. Fine. The problem is he wanted, he had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalize, he wanted everybody to be German, everybody to be speaking German, everybody to look a different way. That's not, to me, that's not nationalism. So, in thinking of how we could go back down the line, I don't really have an issue with nationalism. I don't. I think that it's ok, it's important to retain your country's identity and to make sure that what's happening here, which I think is incredibly worrisome in terms of the, just the decrease in the birthrate that we're seeing in the U.K, is what you kind of want to avoid. So, I'm not, I don't have anything problem — I have no problems with nationalism. It's globalism that I try to avoid.

As any amateur historian would be able to tell you, Hitler's domestic rule in Germany was anything but ""fine."" According to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, 165,200 German Jews were killed by the end of World War II. In Austria, which shared Germany's language and much of its culture, an additional 65,459 were killed. In total, six million Jews were killed throughout Europe. We won't rehash the rest of Hitler's evils in this article, but a quick internet search or trip to the library should reveal that there were many of them.



Owens would later tell the Daily Beast that she thought Hitler was a ""homicidal maniacal globalist"" and ""the scum of the earth,"" but defended nationalism which she said that ""Americans wrongly equate"" with Hitler.

AUDIO: Judge Andrew Napolitano told Fox News host that President Trump is an 'unindicted co-conspirator',"On Tuesday's episode of ""Pat Gray Unleashed,"" Pat Gray and Jeff Fisher discussed comments Judge Andrew Napolitano made during a discussion he had Monday with Fox News anchor Shepard Smith.

According to Napolitano, special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Russian collusion surrounding President Donald Trump had uncovered enough evidence to consider Trump an ""unindicted co-conspirator."" Napolitano added that he believes the question at hand is whether or not Mueller will push for an indictment.

Pat called Napolitano's comment bold and added that he is not confident Mueller does have enough evidence to indict the president.

Fisher lamented that everyone involved in Mueller's investigation is probably lying, suggesting that we should just shut the whole government down.

FACT: Gun homicides are NOT on the rise in America. Glenn Beck has the stats,"On Monday's radio program, Glenn Beck talked about how the mainstream media twists the facts to convince Americans that gun homicides are on the rise. Interestingly, even the Washington Post has confirmed that statistics show gun homicides have dropped ""substantially over the past 25 years"" in a recent report.

And yet, the majority of the media, both domestic and international, continue to push an anti-gun narrative that would have us all believe that gun violence is out of control in the United States.

Glenn noted a few examples, such as Amnesty International's claim that ""in the U.S., gun violence is an epidemic,"" and the BBC, who has claimed repeatedly that ""Americans are obsessed with guns.""

""America is too crazy about guns,"" Glenn said in a BBC article. ""They can't even decide between an Apple MacBook and an AR rifle, like the one used in many of the nonstop mass shootings. If you're an American, you're probably asking yourself, 'should I get a Chromebook or a handgun like the one used in the Las Vegas shooting?'

""Really? That's what Americans are thinking?"" exclaimed Glenn. ""This, of course, is according to the BBC, the leading news source for a country in the throes of a knife crime epidemic.""

"Glenn Beck warns 'it's coming here,' amid reports that UK mom was arrested for calling transgender woman a man","A British mother was arrested at home in front of her two children, and detained for seven hours after she called a transgender woman a man on Twitter, according to a Daily Mail report.



""I was arrested in my home by three officers, with my autistic ten-year-old daughter and breastfed 20-month-old son present,"" 38-year-old Kate Scottow of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, said.

""I was then detained for seven hours in a cell ... I was arrested for harassment and malicious communications because I called someone out and misgendered them on Twitter,"" she added.

"Coronavirus lockdown measures could last at least 18 MONTHS, researchers say","Stuck in quarantine and going a little bit crazy? Homeschooling the kids already driving you nuts?

On the radio program Friday, Glenn Beck predicted we'd be in this situation for at least 8 weeks, but now a group of researchers in London are thinking we could be social distancing for much longer. In fact, their report says that as long as one person in the world has coronavirus, dangerous outbreaks of COVID-19 will continue to occur and spread.

The researchers say the world should continue practicing social distancing every time a small outbreak occurs, to prevent it from becoming something bigger. And they propose implementing lockdown measures for the next 12 to 18 months, unless we find a vaccine (which could take even longer). They say it could be two months on of quarantine, one month off.

If that's the case, will Americans stand for that? asked Glenn. Or will we eventually say ""enough is enough?""

'Grossly miscalculated move': Why did Iran seize UK oil tanker and crew?,"In less than one month, Iran has breached limits on uranium enrichment, shot down a U.S. drone, and now seized a British-owned oil tankerin international waters.

The Stena Impero oil tanker and its 23 crew members were captured in the Strait of Hormuz by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on Friday. Read more details here.

On Monday's radio program, chief researcher Jason Buttrill joined Glenn Beck to discuss the escalating tensions between Tehran and the West.

""Iran is not operating from a position of strength. They are operating out of a position of weakness,"" Jason said. ""So now, they're pushing to see how far they can push, to see if they'll get some sort of an overreaction, whether that is we react poorly and escalate the situation militarily, or force us to the negotiating table because sanctions are crippling them.""



Jason called the seizure a ""grossly miscalculated move"" by the Iranian forces.



""The geopolitics of oil coming out of the Strait of Hormuz have changed,"" he said. ""We're just not compelled to react if they do pull a move off like this, because the situation has changed, the economics have changed, where the oil is coming from has changed. A smaller percentage of NATO allies, with the exception of Japan, don't get their oil from that area any more.

""Nothing will come from this,"" he continued. ""They're doing everything they can to get us to the negotiating table. The president has to sit back and let things play out ... and make sure that everyone else doesn't respond with too much force.""

JK Rowling TORCHES 'certain celebrities' who back pedophile-linked kids' charity — and takes no prisoners,"Famed ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling took to Twitter to blast ""certain celebrities"" and ""genderists"" who continue to support and defend a controversial charity for transgender children that was recently linked to an organization that promotes services to pedophiles.

Dr. Jacob Breslow, the former trustee for trans youth charity Mermaids, stepped down after a bombshell report revealed that he gave a presentation defending the rights of pedophiles at a 2011 conference hosted by B4U-ACT, a group that promotes ""services and resources for self-identified individuals (adults and adolescents) who are sexually attracted to children.""

Rowling called out the ""genderists"" who are defending the charity's decision to hire a ""paedophilia apologist"" as trustee of a children's charity, saying, ""I thought things were pretty bad when you were arguing to put convicted rapists in women's jails, when you shrugged off masked men roughing up lesbian protestors and tried to shout down detransitioners talking about what was done to them by ideologically-captured doctors. Women, gay people and vulnerable kids have suffered real harm and you? You cheered it all on.""

""You still prefer wilful blindness and four word mantras to considering you might have got this badly wrong. You became part of an authoritarian, misogynist, homophobic movement and you didn't even notice. Enjoy the sense of your own righteousness while you can. It won't last,"" Rowling ranted.

Rowling accused the children's charity of hiring ""a man who wrote sympathetically about orgasming 'on or with' a child,"" and an ""online moderator [who] encouraged kids to move onto a platform notorious for sexual exploitation.""

""They couldn't have achieved it without the money and public support of certain corporations and celebrities, who eagerly boosted them even though the red flags have been there for years,"" Rowling wrote in another Twitter thread. Celebrities including ""Harry Potter"" actress Emma Watson, Prince Harry, and Meghan Markle have openly supported the charity for transgender youth.

On the radio program Thursday, Glenn Beck applauded the left-leaning author and activist for ""drawing a line in the sand"" when it comes to extremist gender theology.

""She's been labeled a TERF, a trans-exclusionary radical feminist. She has had death threats, but she still speaks out,"" Glenn said of Rowling.

""There are people standing up, and this is a very good thing. And necessary. My question is: Are you prepared now?""

Nigel Farage: 'DAMAGE that Biden has done to America's international reputation could NOT be greater',"The United States and Great Britain have enjoyed an alliance since World War I, but President Joe Biden's failure to coordinate his Afghanistan withdrawal with allies like the U.K. has devastated America's overseas reputation, argues Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage.

Farage joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Monday with the latest on how America's diplomatic relations with its allies may look for the rest of Biden's presidency, and perhaps much further into the foreseeable future.

""You know, I've spent 40 years working for American companies and businesses, being allies, politically, with Donald Trump and many friends of the Republican Party. There's nobody this side of the pond who is more pro-American, more pro-respectful relationship than I am,"" Farage told Glenn. ""And it hurts me to say this, but for Biden to unconditionally withdraw from the military mission after 20 years, without any planning or any foresight as to how we get our nationals out in the case of a Taliban advance, and to do it without even consulting the British prime minister, and refusing to answer his phone call for almost 48 hours, sends a message to us. And the message is, we cannot trust America.

""Despite being our closest partner for over 100 years, we cannot trust America with this man in charge. And it's a sad realization, but it's true. And I think it's even further than the relationship with the UK and the USA. I think NATO, frankly, ceases to function. So the damage that Biden has done to America's international reputation could not be greater,"" he added.

Glenn and Farage also agreed that, while the corporate media accused former President Donald Trump of wrecking the NATO alliance, Nigel explained why it's Biden who has truly thrown that relationship into turmoil.

""The way the international mainstream media wanted to portray the Trump movement, just as they did with the Brexit movement, [was] 'Trump is going to destroy NATO.' No, no, no, what Trump did, he turned up at the NATO HQ of Brussels and said ... that we cannot go on with a NATO where major countries like Germany are only paying half the membership fee,"" Farage explained. ""The NATO rules are actually very fair. Regardless of the size of a country, you must spend 2% of GDP on defense. And the Germans were spending one [percent.]. So actually, in many ways, what Trump was doing was trying to make NATO fair. But it was willfully, willfully misportrayed.

""What Biden has done, is to say, 'Look, we're the big guys in NATO. But, hey, we just do stuff without consulting, despite the fact that you, too, have had many hundreds of people killed in Afghanistan, and put big money into Afghanistan. But without even the compliment of a conversation, we've decided that, effectively, the NATO mission is over.' So, yeah, the special relationship with Britain is completely in tatters. NATO, I'm not even sure it could possibly survive what it's just gone through,"" he continued.

""And, of course, when you look at those photographs today, of Taliban soldiers now dressed in American military equipment with $85 billion worth of U.S. military hardware now in the hands of these people, with the giant lithium reserves that exist in Afghanistan now completely open to exploitation with Communist China, and warnings coming in the UK today that our terrorism threat is now going up directly as a result of what has happened in Afghanistan ... believe me, Glenn, this is on every level a disaster.""

‘My life is in danger from both these gangs and my own government’: British activist seeks asylum in US after exposing child-sex gangs,"British activist and citizen journalist Tommy Robinson was found guilty of contempt on Thursday and given a second prison sentence for broadcasting on social media the identities of defendants accused of sexually exploiting young girls in 2018.

Robinson, who has previously been convicted of multiple felonies (including fraud-related crimes), has asked President Donald Trump for political asylum in the United States over fears his life is in danger from both the child-sex gangs and the British government.

'I am begging America to see this, that my life is in danger from both these gangs and my own government,"" Robinson told ""The Wilkow Majority"" host Andrew Wilkow during an interview Wednesday.

Andrew joined Glenn Beck on Thursday's radio show to share takeaways from the Robinson interview.

""The story that he told us was, ever since speaking out about these gangs of men who have given over to the belief that non-Muslims are the kafir, they are the non-believers, they are the infidels, and they have begun to take liberties with young women, mostly in small towns,"" Andrew said.

""What he has said is that it is not just the threats coming from the gangs. It is the fact he is making these judges and police officials look really bad,"" he added. ""One of the questions I had for him was, when these sexual assaults occur — as we read about them in Germany since the migrant crisis has been plaguing Europe for quite some time — has any member of government or upper echelon of the police department had their daughters subjected to this? And he said, 'No. It is almost as if they know to target lower working class.' This is something being done to working class British citizens with the government kind of looking the other way.""

Andrew said the men in the sexual exploitation case got ""sweetheart deals"" and by broadcasting the case on Facebook Live, Robinson may have ""embarrassed"" the judge.

""So, now the fear is not the death threats he [Robinson] is getting from these gangs, which he says he was informed that six of them were on their way to his house to murder him at one point,"" Andrew continued. ""[Robinson] said, 'I generally believe my government wants me to go away, that I am the problem with the politically correct society that we have built in Europe.' He said, 'I am begging America to see this, that my life is in danger from both these gangs and my own government at this point'.""

""He is dead if he goes to prison,"" Glenn surmised.

Theresa May's Brexit plan overwhelmingly defeated by Parliament,"In an overwhelming (yet predicted) landslide defeat, Parliament rejected British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan. May has spent the last two years creating this plan, since the UK voted in 2016 to leave the European Union.

What happened?

Parliament voted against May 432 to 202.

Without this deal in place, the future of how Brexit will play out is uncertain. Brexit is scheduled to take effect on March 29, although European Union leaders have said that it is open to allowing an extension on this deadline if necessary. In this case, all 27 remaining member nations would have to to vote to grant an extension.

So-called ""remainers"" hope that this could lead to a second referendum vote that would keep the U.K. in the European Union, but this seems unlikely.

Turkey postpones its assault on the Kurds in Syria; ISIS reportedly ups its attacks,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced Friday that his country would postpone its assault on the Kurds in Syria, but stressed that this postponement was only temporary. This comes as Kurdish forces report that ISIS has been attacking some of their positions in Syria.

Why does Turkey want to attack the Kurds?

The Kurds are an ethnic group living in a region called Kurdistan that spans parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Armenia.

Turkey has had trouble inside its own borders with a Kurdish militant group known as the PKK. Both the U.S. and the European Union have designated the PKK as a terrorist organization, but see a distinction between the PKK and other ethnically Kurdish groups in Syria and Iraq. The Kurds have proven to be invaluable allies in the fight against ISIS.

Erdogan has taken advantage of the instability in Syria to launch a series of attacks on Kurdish-held positions. In October, he promised to ""descend on them [the Kurds] with more comprehensive and effective [strength]."" In June, Turkey had threatened to attack the Syrian city of Manbij, where both U.S. and Kurdish forces were based. The U.S. convinced the Kurds to withdraw from Manbij, which appeased the Turkish government and prevented the attack.

What did Erdogan say?

""Our phone call with President Trump, along with contacts between our diplomats and security officials and statements by the United States, have led us to wait a little longer,"" Erdogan said on Friday. ""Obviously, this is not an open-ended waiting period.""

President Donald Trump's call with Erdogan on Dec. 14 took place less than a week before Trump's announcement that the United States would be pulling its troops out of Syria because ISIS, he said, had been defeated. Erdogan reportedly told Trump during that phone conversation that there was no longer any need for U.S. forces to remain in that country. This move upset members of Trump's own Cabinet and led to the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

However, shortly after announcing that ISIS had been defeated, Trump also tweeted that Russia, Iran, Syria, and ""many others"" were upset about the U.S. withdrawal because it meant that ""now they will have to fight ISIS and others, who they hate, without us."" He also said that he was building up the military so that if ""ISIS hits us they are doomed.""

There are about 2,000 U.S. forces deployed in Syria to combat ISIS. They are largely engaged in training local forces.

Meanwhile, the Kurds say that ISIS is attacking again

The Syrian Democratic Forces, a largely Kurdish group in Syria that had worked closely with the United States, reported that ISIS had launched more attacks.

The head of the SDF's media office tweeted Friday that ""ISIS is launching a huge attack, heavy clashes are taking place there,"" and that ""only 35 percent percent from Hajin is liberated by our forces."" Hajin is a region in the southeastern part of Syria.

According to Reuters, an SDF official named Mustafa Bali reported that ISIS was using car bombs and militants to launch these attacks in Hajin.",https://www.theblaze.com/steve-deace/sweden,2018-12-21
UK police investigate a man for retweeting a limerick,"On Wednesday's episode of ""Pat Gray Unleashed,"" Pat Gray and Keith Malinak discussed the story of a United Kingdom man questioned by a ""community cohesion"" officer after receiving a complaint about the man's activity on Twitter.

A former police officer, Harry Miller, 53, received a phone call from Officer Mansoor Gul on Wednesday after receiving a complaint Miller had allegedly been sharing transphobic content on Twitter.

After more than 30 minutes of questioning, the officer told Miller that, although a crime had not been committed, ""We need to check your thinking,"" the Telegraph reported.

What did the police say?



Scott Young, assistant chief constable issued a statement on Monday, according to Hull Live, that stated:

Following media coverage over the last few days, I want to take this opportunity to provide some clarity around why the police investigate hate incidents.



Hate incidents can cause extreme distress to victims and communities, some of whom are incredibly vulnerable members of our society. A hate incident is recorded as such if the victim perceives the actions taken to be wholly, or partially, motivated by hostility or prejudice.



This relates to any actions, whether spoken or written, around race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and transgender.



We, and all forces, follow College of Policing guidance in relation to handling reports of hate incidents, which can often be a precursor and can escalate to more serious crimes and we, as the police, have a responsibility to prevent crime.



In this case, there were more than 30 tweets reported to us of a transphobic nature, not just a liked or retweeted limerick as some reports have suggested.



This isn't a case of the ""police controlling people's thoughts."" The actions taken by the individual and his comments made around transgender caused someone distress. We take all reports of hate related incidents seriously and aim to ensure they do not escalate into anything further.



The correct decision was made to record the report as a hate incident (as opposed to a hate crime in which a full investigation would have followed), and to proportionately progress by making contact with the individual concerned to discuss the actions taken on social media.



There is evidence to show hate related incidents are already under reported with people feeling they won't be taken seriously and not having confidence in the police.



I want to offer my reassurance that we will always take reports of this nature seriously, and as with this case, take proportionate action.

What else?

Miller took to Twitter, where he described the experience and expressed how the officer made him feel like a criminal crime even though a crime had not been committed.

4. I said, I didn't write that. He said, 'Ah. But you Liked it and promoted it.'

I asked why he was wasting his time on a non crime. He said, 'It's not a crime, but it will be recorded as a hate incident.'

— Harry The Owl - Limerick Criminal (@HarryTheOwl) January 23, 2019

7. This is where it gets incredibly sinister. The cop told me that he needed to speak with me because, even though I'd committed no crime whatsoever, he needed (and I quote) 'to check my THINKING!' Seriously. Honestly.

— Harry The Owl - Limerick Criminal (@HarryTheOwl) January 23, 2019





Watch the video below for details.

Pat asserted that the man should have refused to answer the officer's questions and hung up the phone. After all, no crime had been committed, so the officer did not have a legitimate reason for contacting Miller.

One last thing

According to CitizensAdvice.org, hate incidents are defined as when a person says something that makes the ""victim"" or anyone else think it was motivated by hostility or prejudice based on one of the following things:

disability

race

religion

transgender identity

sexual orientation.

Anyone can be a victim of a hate incident, according to CitizensAdvice.org, and if a citizen feels they have been victimized they should report all hate incidents to the police.

Conservative hosts react to drag show marketed for children and legislation that could change it all,"The “Drag the Kids to Pride” drag show sparked outrage between conservatives, parents, attendees of the event, and police on Saturday, June 4 afternoon.

The organizers called it a ""family-friendly spin-off of their Champagne Drag Brunch that would allow kids to dance with performers on stage.""

Texas House Rep. Bryan Slaton (R) tweeted that Drag shows are ""no place for a child.""

Man caught on camera injecting grocery store food with his OWN BLOOD,"A U.K. lawyer went on a gruesome rampage in west London carrying a bucket of syringes filled with his own blood, throwing some at people, and using others to inject supermarket foods with the revolting contaminant.

Leoaai Elghareeb, 37, was caught on camera injecting grocery products with his own blood in at least three supermarkets. He is also alleged to have thrown syringes and eggs at passersby on the street between stores.

Elghareeb is pleading not guilty by reason of insanity in a U.K. court. A consultant forensic psychiatrist told the court that Elghareeb was ""severely psychotic"" at the time of the ""alleged rampage"".

""In the early evening of a late summer's day last year, Mr Elghareeb walked down the Fulham Palace Road in West London carrying a bucket. It was filled with syringes, some of which had hypodermic needles attached. A number of those syringes were filled with blood - his own,"" prosecutor Philip Stott said, according to the Mirror.



""Mr Elghareeb then entered, in turn, three supermarkets on the Fulham Palace Road — in order they were: Waitrose, Sainsbury's and Tesco — and proceeded to stick those syringes in food products inside those branches of those supermarkets. Along the way he also threw some of the syringes at people inside and outside the store including hitting a passerby on the street.""

The three stores involved threw away nearly $680,000 of food and other products and were shut down for several days.",https://www.theblaze.com/unleashed/retweeting-a-limerick,2022-02-23
'It's really sick and dark': Gay journalist Chadwick Moore says pedophiles are trying to gain acceptance into the LGBT community,"CORRECTION: Originally published on September 9, 2020, this article introduces a video clip in which Andrew Wilkow and guest Chadwick Moore discuss Senate Bill 145 and other then-current events which they perceived as attempts by ""the left"" to ""normalize pedophilia"" and in some cases, include sex offenders under LGBT legal protections. This is false. SB-145 is not intended to legally protect sex offenders or classify pedophilia as a sexual orientation, but ""to reform the state's sex offender registry to be fairer to young LGBT adults who may be in technical violation of statutory rape laws,"" according to this Reuters Fact Check. This article is not intended to endorse or validate the opinions expressed in the video.





California's controversial Senate Bill 145, which would reduce penalties for sexual relations with minors, passed both legislative houses last week and now sits on the desk of Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).



According to State Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored the bill, the current law discriminates against the LGBT community.

""Senate Bill 145 is an anti-discrimination law,"" Wiener told KXTV-TV. He went on to explain that SB 145 would eliminate automatic sex offender registration for adults who have anal or oral sex with a minor. Instead, a judge would make the decision. Also, SB 145 would only apply in cases involving minors between ages 14 and 17 and with an offender within a 10-year age range.

In this episode of ""Wilkow,"" BlazeTV host Andrew Wilkow was joined by journalist Chadwick Moore, a former liberal who once wrote that admitting he was a gay man to his father, ""a Republican and a farmer in Iowa,"" was easier than ""coming out as a conservative"" in New York.

Prompted by the controversy surrounding SB- 145, Wilkow and Moore discussed what they perceived to be attempts by ""the left"" to normalize pedophilia and include sex offenders under the legal protections of the LGBT community.

""It's really sick and dark,"" Moore opined. ""These things are coming out in the activist circles and entering the mainstream narrative. [...] You know, this is how the left always operates, with what's called the Overton window. They will put a really insane idea out there just to shift the frame of acceptable public discourse.""

""They are masters at using language to change the narrative and change how people view the world,"" Moore went on to suggest. He claimed that pedophiles are now calling themselves ""Minor Attracted Persons"" or ""MAPs"" and arguing that pedophilia is merely a ""sexual orientation"" in what he considered to be an attempt to gain acceptance into the LGBT community.

""It's truly baffling and sick and no one will call them out,"" Moore said.
