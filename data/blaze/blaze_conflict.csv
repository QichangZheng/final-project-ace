Mark Levin Objects to WashPost Publisher Heading Reagan Foundation: a 'Clear Conflict',"Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty broke some news in her column that became a Twitter Moment: ""Reagan Foundation asks Trump and RNC to stop using Ronald Reagan's name in campaign.""

Tumulty began:

The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, which runs the 40th president’s library near Los Angeles, has demanded that President Trump and the Republican National Committee (RNC) quit raising campaign money by using Ronald Reagan’s name and likeness. “It was simply handled with a phone call mid-last week to the RNC, and they agreed to stop,” Reagan Foundation chief marketing officer Melissa Giller said in an email Saturday.

Giller objected to a fundraising email that went out July 19 with “Donald J. Trump” identified as the sender and a subject line that read: “Ronald Reagan and Yours Truly.” Team Trump offered, for a donation of $45 or more, a commemorative set of two gold-colored coins, one each with an image of Reagan and Trump.

How did Tumulty get this scoop? See paragraph 9: ""Frederick J. Ryan Jr., who chairs the Reagan Foundation board, is also publisher and CEO of The Washington Post. He declined to offer a comment for this column.""

This raises the question: why didn't the Post insist that Ryan drop his Reagan Foundation responsibilities when he became publisher of this very anti-Trump, anti-Reagan newspaper? And why didn't the Reagan Foundation see a liberal-media conflict? On Sunday, Reagan administration alumnus and radio and TV star Mark Levin objected on his social sites:

I did not realize that Fred Ryan, who is now the publisher and CEO of the Washington Post is also the chairman of the Reagan Library & Foundation board. Now, given the Washington Post's leftist agenda, and the conservative legacy of the great Ronald Reagan, this appears to me to be a huge conflict. And it also explains why the Washington Post ran a story about the Reagan Library objecting to President Trump's use of the Reagan name for fundraising -- that means Fred Ryan objected.

Levin noted he and many others have supported the Reagan Foundation for decades, and resent this anti-Trump stunt:

I am appalled that the Fred Ryan's Washington Post and the Reagan Library under Fred Ryan's chairmanship, would pull this publicity stunt on President Trump. And I expect the thousands of Reagan alumni who worked for President Reagan share my concern. Mr. Ryan, decide who and what you want to be, but it's obvious you cannot be both the Washington Post publisher/CEO and the Reagan Library board chairman when there's a clear conflict.

This makes about as much sense as the CEO of Fox News running the Jimmy Carter Center.",https://bit.ly/3SMw74E,2020-07-26
About Blaze Media,"Blaze News Editorial Standards

Blaze News is your source for news and information, original reporting, and insightful opinions about the stories that matter most.

Overview Blaze News holds its correspondents, editors, journalists, and contributors to high journalistic, ethical, and professional standards. Blaze News follows the AP Stylebook except in certain enumerated cases, which are set forth in the Blaze News style guide. If you feel that Blaze News has failed to maintain these standards or have a more general comment, please make your feedback known using this contact form. Our readers put their trust in the Blaze News editorial team and our fact-checking, ethics, and corrections policies are designed to safeguard that trust.

Fact Checking Policy Accuracy is extremely important and the Blaze News editorial process has several safeguards in place to ensure accuracy. In today's hyper-connected world, news moves fast, but that doesn't mean Blaze News is willing to sacrifice accuracy. As journalists, accuracy is our best defense and most potent means for showcasing the truth in our work. When possible, we reference original sources. Otherwise, a story will cite social media sources or posts, or other news organizations. Whenever possible, we will avoid anonymous sourcing. However, if important information cannot be reported through traditional on-the-record channels, we will attempt to independently verify information from anonymous sources to a very high degree of confidence. Authors that wish to use anonymous sourcing must reveal the identity of the anonymous source to the managing editor. We try to identify the source of each fact we cover. When a piece of content is subjective in nature, we mark it as such — as either a Commentary or Op-ed — so the reader understands the piece is based partly on the author's opinions. When the fact-checking policy is not met and an error occurs, we will issue a correction. See our corrections policy below for more information.

Ethics Policy Blaze News is a values-based publication and our ethics are centered around the virtues of integrity, honesty, transparency, and independence. Blaze News strives to ensure that subjects of our articles are treated fairly and objectively. As such, we will not run a story that paints any person or organization in a negative light without giving that person or organization a reasonable opportunity to comment. Generally, this means at least one business day. There are two exceptions to this rule: When the subject of the story has already released a full statement — or declined to make such a statement — to another reputable news organization, and During the course of a breaking, time sensitive news story about a matter of immediate import, e.g., an active shooter situation. In the case of exceptions, the reporter shall work diligently to obtain a comment or statement from the subject of the story as soon as possible. We do our utmost to ensure that all quotes are presented with 100 percent accuracy and fairness and are never deceptively edited to omit relevant context that might change the news significance of the story. Regarding aggregation of a new story, Blaze News credits the source(s) of the original story by explicitly naming them. To the greatest extent possible, our reporters are expected to consult original source documents rather than other media reports in order to ensure that we are not recapitulating errors that may exist in the reporting of other outlets. When a conflict of interest could arise, we either work to assign the story to mitigate the conflict or where it cannot be mitigated, we disclose that conflict in our content with an editor's note. Blaze News has a zero-tolerance policy for plagiarism and treats plagiarism allegations very seriously.

Corrections Policy When necessary, corrections will be made expeditiously and with full transparency. Typos that make it through the editorial process may be corrected without an editorial note only to the extent that they do not change the meaning of the story. Typos that do change the meaning of the story (for instance, a typo in the spelling of the name of a person mentioned in a story or that changes the meaning of a sentence) will be corrected with an editorial note at the bottom of the piece. Any fact requiring correction or modification that changes any significant aspect of the story should be corrected with an editor's note at the top of the story that sets forth, in as much detail as is necessary for fairness and accuracy, what has been changed in the story and why. In such cases, the title should likewise be changed and ""(UPDATED)"" added to let readers know that a significant correction has been made. In some cases, a correction will be required that is so central to the story that fairness demands that the entire story be removed. In that case, the entire text of the story should be removed and replaced with an editor's note that explains what the original story stated, why Blaze News no longer can stand behind it, and an apology to all persons who may have been negatively impacted by the story. We will never intentionally leave a dead link to a story. If you feel that Blaze News has made an error or have a more general comment, please make your feedback known using this contact form.

Mass Killings and Active Shooter Situations Blaze News does not publish a murderer's propaganda or manifesto. If it is vital to the story, we will provide a summary that indicates ""according to social media postings, the killer seems to have been motivated by a belief in X,"" but we will not reprint their own words or include their videos. This policy also applies to terrorism. Blaze News never wants to give a killer or terrorist organization a platform, justification, attention or fame that they are seeking. We will always hide, blur or obscure the faces of the killers with exception of ""AT LARGE"" killers or suspects.

Ownership and Funding Blaze News is owned and operated by Blaze Media LLC, a private for-profit company. It is funded through advertising, merchandise, and subscription revenue.",https://bit.ly/3W919q7,2018-12-11

Company shall not be required to deliver all ordered advertising inventory under a given I/O with respect to Advertisements that are not delivered in accordance with this Agreement. (c) Non-conforming Advertisements; Content Control . As used in this Agreement, ""Non-conforming Advertisement"" means any Advertisements or constituent element(s) thereof (including, but not limited to, software code associated with Advertisements e.g. pixels, tags, JavaScript), or websites to which such Advertisements are linked, that, in Company's sole but reasonable determination (i) do not comply with the Policies, or this Agreement; (ii) do not comply with any applicable law, regulation, or other judicial or administrative order, including, but not limited to, consumer protection laws and regulations; or (iii) may tend to bring disparagement, ridicule, or scorn upon Company or any of Company's Affiliates.

Company requires at least forty-eight (48) hours to incorporate any changes requested by Client to a particular Advertisement. Once an Advertisement has been submitted to Company, Client is prohibited from changing any aspect of such Advertisement, including any Linked Content, without Company's prior consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. (e) Rescheduling . Client understands that Company is a news agency and that breaking news and other events may warrant cancellations of Advertisements on the Network.

(f) Custom Material . Client shall not publish or otherwise use or exploit any Advertisement which includes Custom Material (as defined in Section 10(a)) outside of Company's Network without Company's prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

Invoices will be sent to the billing address provided on the I/O and will include Information reasonably specified by Client, such as the I/O number, Advertiser name, brand name or campaign name, and any number or other identifiable reference stated as required for invoicing on the I/O. Client shall pay each invoice in full in immediately available funds by check, wire, ACH, or credit card, within thirty (30) days after Client's receipt of each invoice, or as otherwise stated in a payment schedule set forth on the I/O, without any deduction or right of set-off or counterclaim. Interest shall be assessed on late payments at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (or, if less, the highest rate permitted by law).

Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if Company does not receive timely payment. In the event Advertiser's or Agency's credit is or becomes impaired, Company shall have the right to require payment in advance.

5. Reporting. On or before the first Monday following the initial broadcast week of the campaign stated on the I/O, Company shall provide confirmation to Client, either electronically or otherwise, stating whether the components of the I/O have begun delivery. Thereafter, and upon Client's request, Company shall provide proof of performance for the invoiced period, which may include access to online or electronic reporting. Reports will be broken out by day, delivery method, and summarized by creative execution, content area (ad placement), impressions, clicks, spend/cost, opens, and other variables as may be defined on the I/O (e.g. keywords). Upon Client's request, Company shall include verifications of performance with monthly invoices issued hereunder, but the furnishing and accuracy of such verifications shall not be a condition precedent to Client's obligation to timely pay any such invoice. Company shall not be liable to Agency or Advertiser for, and Company makes no representations or warranties with respect to, such verifications, except that such verifications shall accurately reflect the internal log for the system/platform on which the advertising was distributed.

The indemnifying Party will not settle or resolve any Claim in a manner that imposes any liability or obligation on the indemnitee(s) or affects the indemnitee(s)'rights in connection therewith without the prior written approval of the indemnitee(s), which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Each indemnifying Party hereunder shall reimburse the indemnitee(s) on demand for any Losses arising at any time after the Effective Date for which the indemnification obligations hereunder apply.

9. Breach; Remedies. Neither Party will be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement unless and until the non-breaching Party gives the other Party specific written notice of the nature of such breach and the Party in breach fails to cure such breach within five (5) business days after receipt of such written notice; provided, however, if such breach is of the nature that it cannot reasonably be cured within such period, the Party in breach will be afforded such additional time as reasonably necessary to cure such breach, provided the Party in breach promptly commences such remedial action and diligently pursues such action to completion. Each Party's rights and remedies under this Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies which may now or subsequently exist at law or in equity.

10. Cancellation and Termination. (a) Without Cause. Unless designated on the I/O as non-cancelable, (x) Company has the right to cancel the entire I/O, or any portion thereof, upon five (5) business days’ written notice (including email) to Client and (y) Client has the right to cancel the entire I/O, or any portion thereof, upon written notice (including email) to Company subject to the cancellation charges with respect to each type of advertising format in Sections 18 (a)-(d) hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and without limiting cancellation charges set forth in Section 18, Client shall remain liable to Company for (i) amounts due for any custom content or development provided to Client or completed by Company or its third-party vendor (""Custom Material"") prior to the effective date of termination/cancellation, which shall become immediately due and payable by Client and (ii) amounts due under the I/O for all services and advertisements that have been performed, completed or delivered (as authorized on the applicable I/O) through the effective date of termination/cancellation, or if no amount is specified on the I/O for such services, then a pro-rated amount based off the full amount owed under the I/O, which shall become immediately due and payable by Client. For I/Os that contemplate the provision or creation of Custom Material, Company will specify the amounts due for such Custom Material as a separate line item. (b) For Cause. Company and Client shall each have the right to terminate an I/O at any time upon written notice (including email) to the other Party if the other Party is in breach of this Agreement under Section 9 hereof. In addition, Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice thereof in the event either Advertiser or Agency becomes insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, is adjudged bankrupt, or if a receiver is appointed for Advertiser's or Agency's property or business, if Advertiser or Agency files a petition seeking relief under any bankruptcy act, or if a petition is filed against Advertiser or Agency under any such act. In the event of termination of this Agreement by Company pursuant to this Section 10(b), Client agrees that the balance of the total contract sum set forth on the I/O(s) which has not been paid as of the date of termination shall become immediately due and payable by Client.

11. Makegoods. As used in this Agreement, ""Makegoods"" means a rerun or rebroadcast of an Advertisement that was previously cancelled by Company or was not published due solely to Company's error. Company will monitor delivery of Client's Advertisements, and will notify Client in writing as soon as commercially practicable if Company believes that an under-delivery of guaranteed deliverables is likely. In the event actual deliverables for any campaign fall below guaranteed levels as set forth on the I/O, and/or if there is an omission of any Advertisement (placement or creative unit) attributable solely to Company's error, then Company shall in good faith arrange for a Makegood within a commercially reasonable period of time thereafter, and this will be Company's sole liability and Client's sole recourse in connection with such cancelled or non­published Advertisements. For avoidance of doubt, Client shall not be entitled to Makegoods where under-delivery of guaranteed deliverables is the result of a third-party error or omission. No Makegoods will be provided with respect to performance advertising inventory (i.e., non-guaranteed deliverables), as the predictability, forecasting, and conversions for such advertising deliverables vary and, therefore, delivery, or any delivery, is impossible to guarantee.

12. Disclaimer. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, COMPANY'S SERVICES HEREUNDER AND ITS NETWORK ARE PROVIDED ON AN ""AS-IS"" AND ""AS AVAILABLE"" BASIS, AND COMPANY DOES NOT MAKE AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RESPECTING COMPANY'S SERVICES AND THE NETWORK, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; (B) WARRANTIES AS TO THE QUALITY OR PERFORMANCE OF THE NETWORK IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING THE DELIVERY OR AVAILABILITY OF ADVERTISEMENTS; AND (C) WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES OF CONVERSION RATES, PAY-UP RATES, RESPONSE RATES, OR ABILITY TO CONVERT RESPONSES TO ADVERTISEMENTS INTO SALES. COMPANY MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY (i) THAT ANY PUBLICATION OF AN ADVERTISEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO PERSONS RESIDING IN ANY PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHICAL REGION OR LEGAL JURISDICTION; (ii) AS TO THE EXACT NUMBER OF PAGE IMPRESSIONS THAT WILL BE DELIVERED ON SPECIFIC DATES DURING AN ONLINE CAMPAIGN; OR (iii) AS TO THE QUALITY OF REPRODUCTIONS OF ADVERTISEMENTS ON THE NETWORK. THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND DISCLAIMERS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

13. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY OR COMPANY'S AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE TO CLIENT FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

Client acknowledges that Company would not enter into this Agreement without the limitations on liability contained herein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may disclose Confidential Information of the Discloser in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body, as otherwise required by law or the rules of any applicable securities exchange, or as necessary to establish or enforce the rights of either Party under this Agreement; provided, however, that both Discloser and Recipient will stipulate to any orders necessary to protect such information from public disclosure.

16. Privacy. Each Party shall post on its respective website its privacy policy and shall adhere to such policy, which shall be in accordance with applicable laws. In the event either Party fails to either continue to post a privacy policy or to adhere to such policy, the other Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice thereof to the other Party.

VIDEO: Top 4 Clips of the Week: 'The Chad Prather Show',"On Friday, Chad recapped the top four moments from ""The Chad Prather Show"" this week. Enjoy...

Ep 122: Try To Take My AR-15! Image source: BlazeTV screenshot In this clip, Chad explained Joe Biden's story about kicking a gang leader named ""Corn Pop"" out of the public pool in Wilmington, Delaware, where he was a lifeguard. Chad and his crew likened Biden's story to the Outsiders. ""Now Joe Biden says he went to this inner-city community, this urban community, to be a lifeguard because, according to him, he wanted to learn more about the black community. Now that is a very woke teenager,"" Chad said.

Ep 123: Going To War With Iran? Image source: BlazeTV screenshot In this clip, Chad and Party Foul Steve discussed the pros and cons of the United States allowing Saudi Arabia to fight their own battles vs. the cost of oil. Steve pointed out that conflict in the Middle East began long before the discovery of oil. Chad concluded that gas prices are likely to rise 22 cents a gallon for consumers if the United States does remain engaged in the current conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran. ""If we do not get in that conflict and we stay completely out of it, 22 cents a gallon is worth it,"" Steve said.

Ep 124: We Need A Marriage Counselor Image source: BlazeTV screenshot In this clip, Chad was joined by Party Foul Steve's wife, Toni Powell, to discuss how they both deal with time spent with and away from their spouse. ""Jade admitted on the podcast recently about how she likes when I leave. She likes when I come home, but she likes when I leave, "" Chad said.

Ep 125 Unpacking the #MeToo movement Image source: BlazeTV screenshot In this clip, Chad was joined by Jennifer Nickerson to discuss how the #MeToo movement has destroyed the dating scene and harms men and women who have been victims of sexual assault. ""The first time a guy does this, you get away from it. You don't keep subjecting yourself to it,"" Chad said.

Word is bond for Debra Soh,"Debra Soh has a recurring dream that she's on a rollercoaster, and she can't get off. She doesn't like rollercoasters. She hates them. So the dream has always filled her with unease. But what she's learned to do when she finds herself trapped in a clanking iron seat as it inches up a mechanical hill, toward a freefall, is to give in, to enjoy it, or at least to believe that the plummet won't be so bad.

This attitude has blossomed outward, into her waking life.

""I think in general,"" she says, ""if you experience any discomfort or pain, the only way you can overcome that is to embrace it and say, 'This might be something I don't like, but what is it that I can take from this?'""

A few hours ago she was in Canada; now she's 1,400 miles from home, in Dallas, Texas, at Mercury Studios, for The Glenn Beck Podcast. She is surrounded by cameras and microphones, perched at a wooden table across from Glenn Beck, who just asked her about furries, the subculture of people who dress up as animals, presumably for sexual reasons. Glenn's voice lingers, ""Is it a sex thing?""

She pinches the black gemstone of her forefinger ring, then wiggles it down to a riprap of knuckle — lingering, caught in self-interrogation, careful and specific with her answers: Debra Soh is thinking.

The metallic air constrains with a thud of anticipation.

No, she says. It is not about sex, she says. It is about community.

Then she says that the truth matters.

Word is bond for Debrah Soh. As a sexologist, neuroscientist, former academic, journalist, and columnist for Playboy, she is answering the thorniest questions we're all curious to ask but eager to avoid. The ones that make us blush or cringe, the ones about gender and rape and manhood, about wayward feminists and child sex robots.

Before the podcast, in the makeup room, draped into her red vinyl chair, Soh was warm-voiced and kind and sweet. Now, an hour later, she stares ahead through dark eyes and talks with deliberate pauses. Even her vocabulary has shifted. The effortless warmth that lilts at the end of every sentence has been replaced by many-syllabled words spoken in a lower timbre. I'm not calling her disingenuous. The opposite, in fact: Her tone accords to the contextual rigors of her place and setting, an emotional intelligence that feels multilingual.

Behind Soh, the jointed arms of a camera-rig spook up like robotic graveyard willows. A doting forge of halogen yellow shimmers from high-watt lamps, off into Tramadol bright, through air too cold to carry any kind of a scent. It's oddly quiet on Stage 19, which was once used as a film set for ""Barney & Friends,"" the children's show with adults in animal costumes, humans pretending to be a goofy purple dinosaur and his reptilian lackeys. And as Soh lingers in thought, her reticence is haunted by similar goons, who are cloaked instead by generic usernames and anime profile picture. They are hidden everywhere, even here, prowling in the shadows among the ghosts of Barney and Mother Goose and Baby Bop.

The time is 1:00 p.m., but there are no windows here so you wouldn't know it, as Soh shifts her bone-ribboned hands like two feathering wands. She is the only woman in a room full of men, talking about how it's okay for men to be men, saying that women don't want a man who won't be a man.

When she was a child, Soh had gender dysphoria: All her friends were boys. People called her a tomboy. She hated girly clothes and dolls and pink of any kind. She loathed being female. She enjoyed sprinting around the house with a He-Man sword and standing up to pee. Her parents were supportive. They never forced her to be a boy or a girl. They let her dress however she wanted. They let her shave her head. At the time, she was convinced that she'd been born in the wrong body. Then, as a teenager, she gravitated toward feminine clothing, grew her hair out, and carried a purse.

All her life, many of her best friends have been gay. She thinks of herself as having grown up as a straight girl in the gay community. Every June, she went to the Pride Parade with a raucous group. On one of these occasions, well before she'd ever even considered a career as a sexologist, an older gay friend told her: ""Don't be ashamed to talk about sex, because there's nothing shameful about it.""

On-air, she speaks with the same pointedness you find in her writing. She remains stoic, seemingly unaffected by the near-frost temperature of the studio, while — in reality — she's freezing. Everyone is. Only she's half their size! But, her being a professional, she has figured out exactly where and what the camera frames (from the tabletop up: the rest is hidden). So she clamps her thighs into a black jacket with bright silver zippers, a space heater at her feet. And hides any teeth-chatter or shivering. And rarely speaks in contractions. Preferring to separate one given word from another, so that each sentence is an assembly-line production of vowels, and fricatives, and silence.

She neither smiles nor laughs. But when Glenn asks about brain imaging, one of her areas of expertise, she breaks this stoniness, and her eyes bulge like imperative statements. Without meaning to, she rattles off medical jargon, something about the interstate-like pathways of this or that neural circuit. Glenn wobbles his head and shakes his hand and tells her to slow down and talk normal. A few minutes later, the podcast is over, and the set bustles to a close. Cameras being dismantled, lights unrigged, microphones probed and wires looped into circles.

Soh and I chat in her dressing room. It's mid-October of 2018, and the entire Western world is juiced with the word ""Kavanaugh"" (as in, Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh), amid allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when she was 15 and he was 17. Everyone must have an opinion about this situation — well, according to Twitter. And every opinion is an act of warfare, something people sacrifice friendships to maintain.

So, of course, the topic of Judge Brett Kavanaugh comes up at different parts of Soh's day, briefly.

But fleeting as it is conversationally, the Kavanaugh question bums around and undergirds the helpless platitudes that transform headline news into public opinion. Kavanaugh's confirmation did a number on the whole country. Doesn't matter who you are or what side of the barbed-wire gate you chose — or even if you shrimped out and played dead like a champ — a conflict of that intensity, as widespread and harsh, will glue itself to your thoughts until the next disaster plows into the nation's consciousness or fury, possibly even longer, and all the time all we want to know is how? and why? Because now more than ever people are desperate with questions. Debra Soh has answers. More important, she says them as a matter of principle.

""Honesty, intellectual honesty, is my most important virtue,"" she says. ""I think being honest with yourself, too, because that's important for personal growth, and in terms of how you interact with other people, and the kind of life that you live.""

As a college student, she loved studying the science of sex. Had a path laid out for herself: work as a researcher, then establish her own research lab, then her own research program. But, after more than a decade at university, having finally earned her Ph.D., she was overcome by a discouraging uncertainty about her future.

""I decided that the [academic] climate had changed so much that, for me, it wouldn't have been a rewarding path forward,"" she says. ""I just didn't see the point of myself being in an environment where I couldn't pursue interesting questions.""

The decision was by no means impetuous. She rummaged around for months. But it always came back to one thing: she felt threatened. What if she said the wrong thing? Which became, ""What is happening that I even have to ask that question?""

In 2014, on a whim, she attended the Furnal Equinox, Canada's largest furry convention, where nearly 1,000 furries had gathered in Toronto. (""When else would I get a chance to meet a bunch of furries?"") She wrote about the experience in an academic article titled ""A peek inside a furry convention"" for the journal ""Sexual Behavior."" Then ""Harper's Magazine"" ran it (""Below the Pelt""), and — just like that — Soh had a new career. Since then, it's just been hill work — lots of climbing. Building on her success as a journalist, she and Jonathan Kay created ""Wrongspeak,"" a podcast about ""the things we believe to be true but cannot say.""

So much of her life has been academic, and her writing has an at-times inflexible scholarly feel that delicately blends into personal stories. Like her Playboy article about her personal history with the gay community, how she writes confessionally, then weaves into an examination of sexologist Ray Blanchard and ""his theory of the fraternal birth order effect — the idea that gay men were, on average, more likely than straight men or lesbian women to have a greater number of older brothers."" (Blanchard's work inspired Soh to pursue sexology.)

One of her specialties is paraphilia, or ""atypical sexual interests"" like voyeurism, exhibitionism, and fetishism, which she neatly explains in this animated rundown for Men's Health. She takes a similar approach in ""Sex, Gender and Bullshit,"" a ten-part series by We the Internet TV. Of course, as a sexologist, she faces the inevitable question, the one you're probably thinking, about her own sex life — the awkward, ""So you must study all this kinky sex for personal reasons?"" People ask her every time. She politely, with humor, tells them that, despite her profession, her sex life could be classified as ""vanilla."" She leaves it at that.

Because, more than just a sexologist, she serves as a middleman for the rest of us. Like when she explains the difference between sex and gender in one of her Playboy columns:

Biological sex refers to whether we are male or female, based on our reproductive functions and anatomy. Gender is how we feel in relation to our biological sex. For 99 percent of us, our sex and anatomy dictate our gender; they are essentially the same thing.

With this definition, Soh addresses one of the overarching sexual complications of our era: the social environment is steamed, and we don't know about women or men anymore, not like we used to. Much of this is the result of legitimate and meaningful progress. In the last three years alone, the LGBT rights movement has launched millions of Americans straight up Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Human rights. Dignity. But many people, understandably, have been capsized by the pace of it, while also expected to be immediately in agreement with this at-times dauntingly new part of the mainstream. Especially transgenderism. The concept of gender fluidity alone has sent many heads into orbit. Partly because there's an academic tone to much of it that many people aren't used to or don't care for, and perhaps they're more overwhelmed with confusion than steeped in the hostility and bigotry that they are so often, unfairly, accused of.

Soh often jokes that talking about the science of sex should be no more scandalous than charting the dietary habits of geese: No controversy, just facts and data. Because sexology is meant to be a purely scientific study of human sexuality, absent of social issues and policy and theory. Not the case these days, she says, baffled that politics — from the left and the right — have entered sexology to begin with. But while many of Soh's ideas are taboo among the right, e.g. that pornography addiction does not exist and that pedophiles should be treated humanely, conservatives and libertarians have — so far — shown her warmth.

All day today, she's been hesitant to open up, as if afraid she'll misspeak. It becomes clear that the people she's afraid of are trans-activists, who comprise a small portion of the population here in America but whose persistence and conviction have driven the movement into ubiquity. As Soh sees it, while transgender rights have been positive for many people, the activism itself occasionally devolves into the very bullying it claims to oppose. (To be clear, Soh supports the transgender movement, but only when practiced by adults, i.e., surgery and hormone treatment should wait until adulthood, after puberty). Trans-activists have perfected online activism. They gather on Twitter, Reddit, and Tumblr, in niche communities, where they organize group efforts, resulting in the same kind of echo-chamber tribalism that you find among their ideological counterparts, e.g., men's rights activists (MRAs), incels (involuntary celibates), and MGTOWs (Men Going Their Own Way).

The news media support trans-activists far more than their right-leaning opposition — often for good reason — but this can also leave trans-activists unchecked. Which is problematic, given how they fight. They even attack ostensible allies, as seen by their disdain for TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists). TERFs believe that gender is a social construct assigned at birth and used to oppress women. Therefore, they argue, trans women are not in fact women, they are men, and, by dint of insisting otherwise, they are in fact flexing their male privilege over women. Trans-activists consider this belief transphobic and paint TERFs as bigots.

Opinions about trans-activists tend to be more extreme and intense than opinions about other activists. They're seen as heroes by some, tyrants by others. And they fight like they're cornered, with an air of invincibility.

Call it a matter of opinion, but I consider Dave Chappelle the cultural philosopher king of new America, the Voltaire of our time. Nobody owns him. Nobody tells him what to do. He probes America and people respond. He is fair, and sharp, and his comedy defies boundaries: it spares no one. Yet the trans-activists, with the help of journalists, got steamed about Chappelle's transgender jokes in a recent Netflix special: ""I support anyone's right to be who they want to be,"" he said. ""My question is: to what extent do I have to participate in your self-image?"" Then, on his next special, he doubled down with a marathon of transgender jokes. The retaliatory uproar was loud. ""Bigotry + Chappelle"" was a popular equation for a veritable flood of salty op-eds and exclamatory tweets.

Soh says that the problem in that situation was activists' inability to shrug off something they're offended by without making a show of their outrage.

Point being, trans-activists have repeatedly confronted Soh on social media and in op-eds, labeling her a concern troll who uses ""self-victimization"" and catastrophizes their confrontations, which they do not consider harassment. They have accused her of transphobia for a slew of reasons, most recently for discussing rapid-onset gender dysphoria (ROGD), a theory that they consider transphobic. They have called her alt-right, even neo-Nazi, for her interest in the James Damore memo and her criticism of racial quotas at universities. Most of all, though, they hate her stance on gender dysphoria in children.

Specifically, they label her a troll for promoting the ""desistance"" approach to childhood gender dysphoria, an alternative to increasingly popular two-tier approach, which involves: 1) social transitioning: when a person changes their name and pronouns to fit their gender; and 2) physical transitioning: puberty blockers. (There's a serious debate about whether or not trans-activists actually support hormones and sex reassignment surgery as an option for children.) The 11 studies on desistance near-unanimously concluded that, in most cases, the adults who had had gender dysphoria as a child wound up being gay or bisexual, and happily cisgender, i.e. they no longer felt like they were in the wrong body.

In an article for HuffPost, trans-activist Brynn Tannehill argues that the ""desistance narrative is built upon bad statistics, bad science, homophobia and transphobia,"" adding that the studies themselves are riddled with shoddy work, often the result of cruelty, even mockery, by researchers. She pries apart several of these studies' methodological errors. In 2015, trans-activists led a concerted effort to expose alleged anti-LGBT practices by psychologist Kenneth Zucker, who was in charge of desistance research at the Child and Gender Identity Clinic at CAMH in Toronto. They accused him of conspiring with hate groups to ""cure"" gay children with conversion therapy, among other things. The hospital fired Zucker and closed the Child and Gender Identity Clinic.

In his article about the convoluted politics of childhood gender dysphoria, Jesse Singal counters each of Tannehill's criticisms:

Every study that has been conducted on [desistance] has found the same thing. At the moment there is strong evidence that even many children with rather severe gender dysphoria will, in the long run, shed it and come to feel comfortable with the bodies they were born with.

Either way, many trans-activists just don't like desistance. Something about the haze of it. Like their reality is being overlooked, because no amount of data could explain how they feel. Transgender people suffer from anxiety and depression at an alarmingly higher rate than the rest of the population, even as children, which can result in self-harm, even suicide. Trans-activists often fault society for locking gender dysphoric children inside a physical reality that they don't belong to. Just as their opponents consider transitioning and non-binary parenting harmful to children, trans-activists see the reverse as destructive.

Soh doesn't buy their argument, says that their intentions are political, adding that she first noticed a frantic cultural shift toward trans-activism in 2015, around the time she wrote ""Why transgender kids should wait to transition."" She adds that previous data estimated that 3-in-1,000 Americans were transgender, and that that number has doubled in the past decade. ""Why is it that every [news] piece is telling parents that every child should transition?"" she asks. ""It wasn't as mainstream an idea as it is now. Like now, people almost take for granted that if a little kid says that they're the opposite sex, that, 'Of course, you should just let them transition. Tell them, ""I love you"" and affirm their feelings and help them transition.'""Her tone shifts, lower: ""I think many kids are going to be affected by this. We're going to see in 10 years, they are going to be changing their minds.""

In a rebuttal to some of Soh's major points, psychologists Lily Durwood and Kristina Olson counter the idea that trans-activists even hold such ideas about gender dysphoric children:

No one in mainstream medicine (or elsewhere, to our knowledge) is performing surgery on or providing hormones to prepubescent transgender children.

Of course, ""prepubescent"" is relative: some children begin puberty as young as 8 or 9. For Soh, that's still too young for any sort of medical intervention. Either way, she says, adults are enforcing ideology for political reasons. So much so, she says, that scientists, doctors, and mental health officials increasingly avoid the topic altogether. But she hasn't shied away, and she hasn't given up: ""I try to be optimistic and think that we'll come back from it,"" she says. ""That science will prevail, that reason will prevail. But it seems like, every day, every week, there's more and more misinformation moving us in the wrong direction. People almost take for granted that if a little kid says that they're the opposite sex, that, 'Of course, you should just let them transition.' But even if a kid says they want to be the opposite sex, why are we taking them at face-value? Kids say all kinds of things. Adults should be more responsible.""

Here's a quote from a trans-activist, whose blog includes a three-part series titled ""Debra Soh is really bad at trans science"":

Nearly all anti-trans scientific claims are unsound, outright false, or plainly misleading, including those made by the foremost voices of public transphobia.

This absolutist rhetoric makes it nearly impossible for anyone to challenge trans-activists (critics of any kind are seen as ""the foremost voices of public transphobia""). By traditional standards, such an approach would be considered fallacious, then discarded as nonsense. But ""tradition"" is one of the concepts that trans-activists are confronting. They tend not to see their rhetoric as filled with ad hominem attacks, but as truthful, justified an appropriate response to rhetoric that they consider bigoted and transphobic.

The whole thing is so damn confusing! Like a tug-of-war, and we onlookers become the little flag in the middle. How can two groups of people be so certain that they are right and their enemy is wrong? Where's the line between legitimate criticism and bullying, when discussing transgenderism? Are social media platforms and news media unreasonably biased in support of trans-activists? Or do trans people face so much vitriol that they need extra protection? Who's actually the intolerant or regressive one? Which side is the aggressor? Who's the victim? Who do we believe? And who actually has the power? How reasonable are trans-activists' expectations of the general public concerning pronoun usage, ""dead-naming,"" and, the real tricky one: whether or not it is transphobic for a cisgendered straight person not to be attracted to someone who has transitioned to the opposite sex? And does policy that supports these expectations violate the rights of anyone who disagrees? Even the basics are uncertain. Should our understanding of gender be social? Or biological? Is sexuality a social construct or a genetic reality? Are trans-activists actually stifling scientific advancement? Or are scientists' views on transgenderism actually outdated, bigoted, and fascistic? In other words, sex and gender have become more than just sex for many people. Now, it's about identity.

Soft-voiced, ""Why is it nowadays that there are so many things that have been deemed harmful or dangerous that we can't say or think them, even though they're true?"" asks Soh. ""I don't think this is a good way to live. And our culture is a mess right now. But I do hope it's going to come back to the middle. Because it always goes really far in one direction and then it slowly comes back.""

This is the credo of the so-called Intellectual Dark Web — Dave Rubin, Christina Hoff Sommers, Jordan Peterson, Gad Saad, Joe Rogan, and, now, Debra Soh.

""[IDW members are] portrayed by journalists like they're awful, demonic people,"" she says. ""And then when I meet them and talk to them, they're so genuinely kind. But that narrative is the reference point where most people are coming from.""

A few months ago she spent three hours on ""The Joe Rogan Experience.""

""Rogan does the long-form interview because he wants to see, 'Do you actually know what you're talking about?'"" she says.

""Because it is easy for people to spout these platitudes, or to memorize what they are supposed to say. And then if you prod them and say, 'Well why do you think that? What is your evidence for that?' it usually it stops there. Especially in a three-hour interview. Eventually, what you really think and who you really are start to come out.""

As is the case with many of Rogan's guests, Soh has become politically homeless. She finds it surreal, the way her career keeps playing out. But, really, it is a sign of the times. Soh is a sign of the times.

* * *

She glances down at her watch's large, manly, statuesque face. Today has been all haste and timeline. A mechanical stride to it, careening from one motion-picture scene to another, onto the next full-scale stage with all new furniture and backdrops. She saunters to the Stage 3 for ""The News and Why It Matters."" Earlier, a few hours ago — an amount of time that seems impossible, given all that Soh has accomplished today—the studio was a cold, cold place, a few degrees from your breath in the air. Warmer, now. Maybe too warm — ah, jeez, too warm for sure — and behind the plywood walls, off-set, myself and a few others hide, sweating and vying for the chair under the A.C.'s jet stream.

The pine aroma of the set powders the nose. Forest-like, with hints of spray-paint and industrial glue. From the other side of the wall, the set appears to be a winter cabin. The way the elaborate panels and the roaring taxidermied bear seem real, and mechanical sounds whir like a thunderstorm and the floor has been stomped on for years, painted so many times that its edges look like gorgeous stones covered in minerals and pastel-tinted crystals. Backstep a few feet and the curtain shoots up. At the edge of snares and wire. Metal walkways four stories high. Risers, props — and every heavy thing has wheels. Everybody quiet at the same time, with the countdown for the show: five, four, three, two, and the silent one.

Under the cannonballs of stage-light, the show scoots to life.

Soh starts by saying that she's a liberal, but what does that even mean anymore? She has other elegant things to say, quietly. Behind the set, the control panel spurs with so many screens, each yawning into a different vision of the program. A few of us gaze at the show as it's being played out on tiny monitors, none of which emit sound, but we hear every on-screen person speaking because we're all in the same room.

At one point, maybe off-air, they start talking about sex robots and how, rumor is, there's going to be a robot brothel in Houston. Someone says that we better be careful: If the robots gain consciousness they're not gonna like being raped and abused. Someone else says that machines are just machines.

Strange future either way. But it's happening, and, oddly, the possibility of robot prostitutes signifies a masterful, nuanced eruption of human advancement. Because over the past twenty years, we have witnessed a rare event in human history. A monumental transformation last seen during the Industrial Revolution, when people's conception of the world — everything they knew — shifted. Our idea of life as part of a world designed and guided by God was stamped out by factories, motors, and interchangeable parts. Suddenly, the world had gears, steam, and corrupted air that billowed from smokestacks. People clustered nearer to each other, gawking as machinery rose up all around them. They were the creators, and their metal inventions were proof that they had become a new kind of God.

Similarly, now, we are realizing for the first time that we no longer belong to a mere world; we belong to a universe. And our understanding of this universe — everything we know — has shifted from the idea of the world as a machine, to the universe as a network: Boundless, infinite, uncaring, incomprehensible. It turns out that we, regardless of any inventions we claim, are the finite, mechanical contraptions, patterned by the unknowable, God-like network that always outlives us.

As soon as the show finishes, Soh trods back out through the swinging doors. As usual, the 75-foot-tall midway of Mercury Studios bustles with activity, always someone dashing from one studio to another, headsets on or thumbing at clipboards. Amid the chaos, Soh remains calm. All black clothing and twinkle-red stilettos, streaks of blonde down her shoulder-length hair. She peeks at the original Darth Vader mask in Glenn's office, curving her finger into her chin as she stares, then says, ""Until recently, I had considered myself a feminist.""

She wavers between the Darth Vader mask and the crowd of models down the hall, in an independent studio not affiliated with BlazeTV, as part of some photoshoot. A horror magazine, supposedly, and they are dressed in provocative costumes — one minute it's a lizard, the next minute it's Mrs. Claus, then a superhero or a jailbird in a shredded prison mini-dress. Tall, Amazonian women, who strut like they're on a platform. Early-to-mid 20s, but hard to tell with their Pharaoh-mask of makeup. They lurk into the studio for a while, then emerge an hour or so later to wander the hallway looking hungry and bored as Soh talks about the pitfalls of feminism in the #MeToo era.

""At the core it had some good points,"" she says. ""More recently, I think it does a disservice to women because it's teaching women to believe things about men and women that are not based in reality. I think most rational women have distanced themselves from feminism, because it stands for things that most rational women are not going to be okay with.""

In print, that quote reads harsh and a little arrogant. But the way she says it — it's like she is secretly heartbroken that a good friend abandoned her, and she misses her home. She says that, to succeed, feminism must embrace science. Then she waves her hand at an imaginary thing, at the invisible outline of feminism, as if asking it to please come back, and a woman in cheetah lingerie stares.

It's 4:15 p.m.; one last interview; in the radio studio. Since arriving here at 11:00 this morning, Soh has launched from one commotion to the next. By her own observation — about how Joe Rogan's marathon interviews reveal who the person actually is — any of her defenses are now down, cramped to a halt by fatigue, and this is Debra Soh at her realest. She is kind, and funny, and she spills lettuce from her salad as we talk.

Her voice tilts upward at the end of each sentence. Hulking over her, a massive camera strapped into a rail like a mechanical rabbit at a Greyhound race, and it suddenly — loudly — violently — thrashes to motion and starts groaning and spinning and flashing and shifting along a rail. Is it launching? Taking flight? It startles all of us and, for a moment, we stare horrifically at the animatronic life-form having a conniption fit, some weird machine with a mind of its own, a tiny black pontoon on a trapeze railway, careening upward always.

Then the little robot falls back to sleep.

""I used to be intimidated by controversial ideas,"" she says. ""When I first started writing, I always worried about what people would think. Now, I'm not okay to stay quiet. If I don't agree with something, I can't keep my mouth shut.""

Above all else, she believes in empathy, believes that people are empathic. She says she constantly asks herself, ""Am I doing enough?"" As in, is she doing enough to effect the change she wants to see, despite any risks?

As a teenager, she loved punk music. In her studded denim jacket and her blue mohawk, she felt alive at punk shows. The way violence always lingered, in the mosh pits and the stagedives and the motoring drumbeats. Yet, the moment someone fell down, the instant someone lost balance or got hurt, everybody stopped to make sure they were OK.",https://www.theblaze.com/advertising-terms,2019-06-24
Blaze News Editorial Standards,"Overview Blaze News holds its correspondents, editors, journalists, and contributors to high journalistic, ethical, and professional standards. Blaze News follows the AP Stylebook except in certain enumerated cases, which are set forth in the Blaze News style guide. If you feel that Blaze News has failed to maintain these standards or have a more general comment, please make your feedback known using this contact form. Our readers put their trust in the Blaze News editorial team and our fact-checking, ethics, and corrections policies are designed to safeguard that trust.



Fact Checking Policy Accuracy is extremely important and the Blaze News editorial process has several safeguards in place to ensure accuracy. In today's hyper-connected world, news moves fast, but that doesn't mean Blaze News is willing to sacrifice accuracy. As journalists, accuracy is our best defense and most potent means for showcasing the truth in our work. When possible, we reference original sources. Otherwise, a story will cite social media sources or posts, or other news organizations. Whenever possible, we will avoid anonymous sourcing. However, if important information cannot be reported through traditional on-the-record channels, we will attempt to independently verify information from anonymous sources to a very high degree of confidence. Authors that wish to use anonymous sourcing must reveal the identity of the anonymous source to the managing editor. We try to identify the source of each fact we cover. When a piece of content is subjective in nature, we mark it as such — as either a Commentary or Op-ed — so the reader understands the piece is based partly on the author's opinions. When the fact-checking policy is not met and an error occurs, we will issue a correction. See our corrections policy below for more information.

Ethics Policy Blaze News is a values-based publication and our ethics are centered around the virtues of integrity, honesty, transparency, and independence. Blaze News strives to ensure that subjects of our articles are treated fairly and objectively. As such, we will not run a story that paints any person or organization in a negative light without giving that person or organization a reasonable opportunity to comment. Generally, this means at least one business day. There are two exceptions to this rule: When the subject of the story has already released a full statement — or declined to make such a statement — to another reputable news organization, and During the course of a breaking, time sensitive news story about a matter of immediate import, e.g., an active shooter situation. In the case of exceptions, the reporter shall work diligently to obtain a comment or statement from the subject of the story as soon as possible. We do our utmost to ensure that all quotes are presented with 100 percent accuracy and fairness and are never deceptively edited to omit relevant context that might change the news significance of the story. Regarding aggregation of a new story, Blaze News credits the source(s) of the original story by explicitly naming them. To the greatest extent possible, our reporters are expected to consult original source documents rather than other media reports in order to ensure that we are not recapitulating errors that may exist in the reporting of other outlets. When a conflict of interest could arise, we either work to assign the story to mitigate the conflict or where it cannot be mitigated, we disclose that conflict in our content with an editor's note. Blaze News has a zero-tolerance policy for plagiarism and treats plagiarism allegations very seriously.

Corrections Policy When necessary, corrections will be made expeditiously and with full transparency. Typos that make it through the editorial process may be corrected without an editorial note only to the extent that they do not change the meaning of the story. Typos that do change the meaning of the story (for instance, a typo in the spelling of the name of a person mentioned in a story or that changes the meaning of a sentence) will be corrected with an editorial note at the bottom of the piece. Any fact requiring correction or modification that changes any significant aspect of the story should be corrected with an editor's note at the top of the story that sets forth, in as much detail as is necessary for fairness and accuracy, what has been changed in the story and why. In such cases, the title should likewise be changed and ""(UPDATED)"" added to let readers know that a significant correction has been made. In some cases, a correction will be required that is so central to the story that fairness demands that the entire story be removed. In that case, the entire text of the story should be removed and replaced with an editor's note that explains what the original story stated, why Blaze News no longer can stand behind it, and an apology to all persons who may have been negatively impacted by the story. We will never intentionally leave a dead link to a story. If you feel that Blaze News has made an error or have a more general comment, please make your feedback known using this contact form.

Mass Killings and Active Shooter Situations Blaze News does not publish a murderer's propaganda or manifesto. If it is vital to the story, we will provide a summary that indicates ""according to social media postings, the killer seems to have been motivated by a belief in X,"" but we will not reprint their own words or include their videos. This policy also applies to terrorism. Blaze News never wants to give a killer or terrorist organization a platform, justification, attention or fame that they are seeking. We will always hide, blur or obscure the faces of the killers with exception of ""AT LARGE"" killers or suspects.

Delano Squires: Joe Biden taught Rachel Nichols and Maria Taylor how to play racial identity politics,"President Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris to be his running mate because she's a black woman.

How do I know this? Biden said so. A year ago, when considering the future vice president, Biden bowed to the identity gods, stating he'd only consider a black woman for the vice presidency. His decision drew attention away from Harris' actual qualifications and probably aggravated Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, two of her more senior Senate colleagues.

Rachel Nichols got herself entangled in a similar drama when she expressed her belief that ESPN promoted Maria Taylor to host of NBA Countdown because Taylor is black. Why does Nichols believe that? Because Taylor and countless other black ESPN employees keep publicly and privately demanding that the network hire and promote more black people.

Identity politics rule and divide America. No one should be surprised that the Worldwide Leader in Sports suffers from the same obsession as the White House, academia, Hollywood, our military, and seemingly every other American institution.

It makes perfect sense for Rachel Nichols, a white woman, and Maria Taylor, a black woman, to be locked in a nasty racial tug of war playing out on the pages of the New York Times, the paper of record for identity politics.



The Times released an article on July 4 exposing the rift between Nichols and Taylor, two of ESPN's highest-profile employees. Last year, Nichols was accidentally captured on camera commenting on Taylor's latest promotion. The network awarded Taylor the coveted job of hosting its NBA pregame show. Nichols thought that job belonged to her. She expressed her frustration to a LeBron James associate.

I listened to the audio clip placed in the New York Times story. Nichols said nothing wrong. I don't expect her to be happy about being replaced, especially if she feels part of the reason is unrelated to talent. We can't have functioning workplaces if even the mildest expressions of frustration can turn into an organizational scandal. I also understand why Maria Taylor and her supporters are upset. Many athletes and sports journalists paint this as another instance of white people claiming to be allies in public but privately undermining their black colleagues.

This story is only newsworthy and interesting because it involves public personalities who fit the race and gender narrative that drives corporate media stories.

But there's another issue at play here, one that goes far beyond ESPN and professional sports. It is our current obsession with personal identity. Nichols' comments were actually less about Taylor and more about ESPN and the perception that it was fast-tracking Taylor because of its poor record on diversity in the past.

That perception fits perfectly into a cultural moment in which the focus on identity is not merely about ways in which Americans are different. It is mainly used to explain power dynamics that make some groups of people victims of systemic injustice and others perpetrators of oppression. The death of George Floyd caused many companies to look for ways to conciliate their black employees and prove to the public that they were supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement. Public commitments to hire and promote more black people, especially black women, accomplished both goals.

Joe Biden succumbed to the exact same pressure as ESPN. Biden's decision to put Harris on the Democratic ticket was welcomed by the politicians and activists who had been pressuring him to do so. Did it improve America's race relations? That's up for debate. What's not up for debate is that Biden's move made race and sex — not political ideology, popularity, or strategic value — the two most important qualifications for all prospective candidates.

Joe Biden could have publicly committed to picking the most qualified person and still selected Harris. Instead, he folded under public pressure. So do most of our elite institutions. The stain of being labeled racist, sexist, homophobic, or transphobic causes them to make decisions that are more about self-preservation than social good.

The consequences of bowing to identity extortion aren't confined to our institutions. There is also an ""identity stigma"" on the people who receive these opportunities, regardless of their actual qualifications. If the people providing access to jobs spend all of their time talking about allocating resources based on race, sex, and gender identity, no one should be surprised by pushback from anyone who feels they are being denied opportunities based on characteristics outside their control.



As a father, the lesson here is clear. If I treat all of my children poorly, they will grow up to resent me. If I treat one better than the others, they will grow up to resent each other. America is rife with resentment.

Our institutions would benefit from focusing more on merit and qualifications than personal identity. We learn and grow from being exposed to different people with different experiences, yet skin color and sex don't tell you everything you need to know about a person. Organizations demonstrate their commitment to equity by consistently applying the same standards of performance and evaluation to all employees, not by assuming there should be a predetermined number of people of a specific demographic in every position. Doing so may have made the controversy surrounding Maria Taylor and Rachel Nichols a non-story.

Hopefully we all learn that lesson.",https://www.theblaze.com/contributors/word-is-bond-for-debra-soh,2021-07-09
Fearless: ESPN’s Rachel Nichols-Maria Taylor feud diminishes NBA star Chris Paul’s magical moment,"Don't be confused about the Rachel Nichols-Maria Taylor battle. This is clear as daylight. Nichols was caught in a private moment saying that Taylor was, basically, a diversity hire when she replaced Nichols on ESPN's NBA coverage. So yes, Taylor's credentials were questioned. But there are no innocent victims here.

This is pure deathsport.

Taylor and Nichols are two tough women using dirty tricks, pettiness, gossip, and back-stabbing to fight out this political battle for personal goals. And if you think Taylor had nothing to do with leaking the Nichols tape that supposedly victimizes her, well, then you need to catch up.

But you know, I'm already wrong about one thing. I said there are no victims. There is one: Chris Paul.

Nichols' and Taylor's blood-curdling fight, their co-workers' panic in the storm, ESPN management's wishy-washiness, and the media's cowardice — dropping Woj bombs in their shorts — are all balling up to hijack the NBA Finals from Paul, who deserves the moment.

It was stolen from him time and again over the past 10 years. So let's just forget about the Real Housewives of ESPN for a minute. Turn away from the crash on the ESPN highway and check out Paul. Give him his moment.

Paul had 32 points and nine assists for Phoenix Tuesday night in the Suns' 118-105 victory over Milwaukee in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. That came after he scored 41 on the Los Angeles Clippers to clinch a spot in the finals.



He is 36 years old, playing on his fifth team. And this is his first NBA Finals. He is basically a journeyman star, if there can be such a thing, without a championship.

We like to compare legacies, so imagine what Paul's would be if former NBA commissioner David Stern hadn't used his veto power in 2011. That's when the New Orleans Hornets tried to trade Paul to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he would've been teammates with Kobe Bryant. Stern nixed the deal.

Imagine if Paul had spent several years as Bryant's wingman, he could've gone down as the second greatest point guard in NBA history, after Magic Johnson.

But Stern stepped in and put a stop to that trade — according to The New York Times — when several other team owners complained that the Lakers would be too good.

How many championships would Paul have won? What would we be seeing today, instead of a seemingly good guy and team player who is still searching for the greatness label that comes with winning a title?

Do you know what Paul did when Stern nixed the deal? He called an agent and looked for advice on how to plot against Stern. No, wait, that's Nichols' playbook. No, he sat on incriminating evidence, and then went public with it when … oops, no, that's Taylor.

Unless I missed it, Paul didn't pitch a fit or go public or start conniving. It appears that Paul handled adversity with class when he was denied something he wanted. He was denied something. He bounced around to several teams, looking for that chance at a title.

And now, in his first year with the Suns, it is within reach.

Paul's reaction to Stern's heavy hand is testament to his talent, confidence, and will to succeed.

Meanwhile, ESPN removed Nichols from her sideline reporting gig during the NBA Finals. Her daily NBA show ""The Jump'' was inexplicably canceled for the day.

Although it's a bit hard to pin down exactly what Nichols did terribly wrong here, beyond gossip with a friend and expose her unapproved wrongthink.

On the call with LeBron James adviser Adam Mendelsohn, Nichols said that Taylor's race — she's black — played into her replacing Nichols on the show ""NBA Countdown.'' Nichols called ESPN diversity hiring ""crappy'' and said that if they wanted to fix that, they shouldn't do it in a way that costs her. If they hurt others? Presumably that would be OK.

Nichols was looking for advice on how to protect her space.

ESPN has known about this for a year and done very little other than, apparently, giving in to Taylor's wishes to not have Nichols live on her show. Instead, Nichols' appearances are recorded in advance so that she and Taylor don't interact.

So, exactly what is ESPN's stance? The company didn't take one until after Nichols' story went public.

Meanwhile, Taylor is trying to get a new contract with ESPN. Her current one runs out this month. She reportedly was offered $5 million, but she turned it down, wanting Stephen A. Smith-level money, meaning roughly $8 million. And while I don't know for sure that she leaked that tape, it sure seems probable, as it will now be hard to dump her.

You have to wonder: If any of these people — Nichols, Taylor, ESPN management — had Paul's level of talent, confidence, and will to succeed, would this version of Real Housewives of ESPN have a healthier storyline?



Chris Paul is the real story here. He's had injuries, missed games because of COVID, and yet he's on the brink of his greatest achievement.

""It's been a lot,'' he said. ""I'm telling you.''

Here's hoping he gets what he deserves. In fact, here's hoping everyone gets what they deserve.",https://www.theblaze.com/editorial-standards,2021-07-07
Fearless: Scottie Pippen’s racial assault on Phil Jackson shows we need a war on Twitter crack,"Twitter is cocaine. Silicon Valley-manufactured ""Black Twitter"" is crack cocaine.

Professional sports are experiencing a crack epidemic. The athletes, executives, and leagues are addicted to or live in fear of ""Black Twitter,"" the allegedly informal community of Twitter users and bots who portray themselves as black.

Crack Twitter, my name for Black Twitter, is the online gatekeeper of the degenerate culture Hollywood and music industry executives have defined for black people.

Cocaine damages the brain. The drug, in the worst-case scenario, causes an insatiable dopamine addiction. Lucky cocaine users can handle an occasional powder ""bump"" at parties. Unlucky users, particularly those who freebase cocaine (crack), develop schizophrenia and paranoia and fall into prolonged depression.

The clearest sign of social media crack addiction is the paranoid user who constantly rants, raves, and tweaks about racism terrorizing every aspect of his life.

Olympic hammer thrower Gwen Berry heard the national anthem playing and screamed that it was a disrespectful, racist setup. ESPN basketball analyst Jay Williams greeted the news of the Celtics hiring their sixth black head coach by hailing it as a historic first for black people.



Not to be outdone, on Monday, Williams' ESPN colleague Jalen Rose taped a rambling, do-rag-wearing, hair-greasing, hair-combing non-apology for racially smearing Kevin Love's selection to the Olympic basketball team. You should hunt down Rose's Instagram live video. It's 45 minutes of unintentional comedy. It's like watching Pookie from the movie ""New Jack City"" explain quantum physics.

But NBA legend Scottie Pippen was Monday's biggest tweaker. Pip appeared on ""The Dan Patrick Radio Show."" He accused his former coach, Phil Jackson, of racism for drawing up a game-winning shot for Toni Kukoc in a 1994 playoff game against the Knicks.

That game and that moment form the lone stain on Pippen's exemplary playing career. Pippen refused to re-enter the game because of Jackson's play call. Kukoc sank the shot with Pippen sulking on the bench. Pippen should quit drawing attention to the infamous moment he quit on his teammates.

His social media addiction won't allow it. He's now resorted to racially smearing the coach who helped him win six NBA titles.

I blame Twitter and social media. I'm not joking. Social media apps are driving the racial hysteria plaguing the country. From actor Jussie Smollett's hoax to NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace's garage-door noose to basketball star LeBron James' paranoid tweet about being afraid to walk outside, Crack Twitter is responsible for the race-bait pandemic. Twitter algorithms are constructed to release massive numbers of dopamine likes, retweets, and follows for racial accusations.

Pippen has 660,000 Twitter followers and 1.7 million Instagram followers. He feels pressure to deliver dopamine-friendly content to his 2.3 million social media followers. There's no better product than race bait. It's the coca leaf of cocaine.

Pippen, Rose, and Williams are all good dudes. They're not ill-intentioned. They don't have a legit problem with white people. They certainly don't have a problem with the fruit (women) of the white tree.

Social media hacked their brains.

Twenty years from now, America will be flooded with documentaries explaining how Silicon Valley algorithms promoted and rewarded racial conflict.

I feel sorry for these guys. They're unaware they have an addiction. I have the same addiction. Most public figures suffer from Twitter addiction, and the Crack Twitter addiction is most pronounced among black public figures. The first and most important step toward recovery is admitting you have the problem.

Once you admit the problem, then you can see how it perverts your thoughts and causes you to see every human interaction through the lens of racism. Once you admit the problem, then you can take steps to combat the problem.

Back to Pippen.

Phil Jackson likely drew up the game's final play for Kukoc because he assumed Anthony Mason, arguably the league's top defensive player at the time, would be defending Pippen. Or maybe Jackson had a gut feeling Kukoc would make the shot. Great coaches have great instincts.

I understand Pippen's frustration. The Chicago Bulls took advantage of him in contract negotiations. Pippen was having the best season of his career. It was his first time playing outside Michael Jordan's shadow. Jordan had retired to pursue baseball. And Pippen saw Kukoc as a possible down-the-road threat to his ascension as Chicago's top player.

I get it.

Phil Jackson is as flawed as every other human being. I'm sure he has his biases. But a racist? That allegation is way too damaging to just toss out willy-nilly. What baits us to do that?

Twitter. Racial demonization is the app's lifeblood.



For far too long, we've tolerated a media ecosystem that demands we all snort or freebase Twitter's cocaine. Google, the all-powerful Silicon Valley search engine, defines public figures by their Twitter feeds. Punch a public figure's name into Google, and the first or second thing that pops up is usually his or her Twitter feed.

Researchers say 20 percent of Americans use Twitter. I bet at least 95 percent of the American media use Twitter. The app has an outsized impact on defining public figures and shaping how the media present reality. The app distorts reality. Nothing has done more to create the false reality that police are executing a genocidal plot against black men than Twitter's algorithms.

Cocaine is an auditory hallucinogen. Modern athletes are high on social media. This second-wave crack epidemic is worse than the first.

We need a war on Crack Twitter.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/delano-squires-joe-biden-taught-rachel-nichols-and-maria-taylor-how-to-play-racial-identity-politics,2021-06-29
Fearless: The Maria Taylor-Rachel Nichols catfight exposes Taylor as too fragile for the racial conflict she advocates,"ESPN host Maria Taylor is winning the Victim Olympics.

No one in corporate media can match the 34-year-old's ability to be perpetually racially offended and to express that offense in the pages of the New York Times or on an ESPN platform.

In June 2020, Taylor launched her Jesse Owens-like run of feigning offense when she pretended that New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees hosted a Klan rally by expressing support for the national anthem. During a finger-wagging and head-bobbing appearance on Stephen A. Smith's ESPN debate show, Taylor clubbed Brees with memories of Rev. George Floyd King Jr., the fentanyl activist-turned-race martyr.

It was a gold-medal performance.

She followed that effort with a July 2020 story in the New York Times, smearing fellow ESPN colleague Dave Lamont as racist. Lamont, who is white, was overheard on a conference call complaining to his wife that the conference call was a gripe session for black employees.



""It was such a slap in the face,"" Taylor told the New York Times. ""When I was in it, that was horrible. But now, looking back, it was an awakening moment. This is part of our culture. There are people that feel this way.""

According to media reports, ESPN nearly fired Lamont because he offended Taylor. Long before Taylor endured Lamont's vicious racism, Lamont and his wife helped raise a black young man. But that pales in comparison to pointing out that black employees at a sports network hijacked a conference call so they could share their emotional reaction to the death of Rev. George Floyd King Jr.

It was another gold-medal performance from Maria Taylor.

And now, on the Fourth of July, Taylor took Victim Olympics gold one more time. The New York Times published Taylor's latest horrifying brush with systemic racism. In a leaked, private, off-air conversation, Taylor's alleged ESPN broadcasting ally Rachel Nichols complained to a high-profile NBA source that Taylor had received an assignment Nichols wanted because ESPN executives were under diversity pressure.

""I wish Maria Taylor all the success in the world — she covers football, she covers basketball,"" Nichols said in an accidentally recorded video in July 2020. ""If you need to give her more things to do because you are feeling pressure about your crappy longtime record on diversity — which, by the way, I know personally from the female side of it — like, go for it. Just find it somewhere else. You are not going to find it from me or taking my thing away.""

Taylor was so traumatized by this bit of commonplace and private work gossip that, over the past year, she has refused to speak to or appear on camera with Nichols.

The Times obtained and published an email Taylor wrote to ESPN executives, including the network's chief officer Jimmy Pitaro.

""I will not call myself a victim, but I certainly have felt victimized and I do not feel as though my complaints have been taken seriously. In fact, the first time I have heard from (human resources) after 2 incidents of racial insensitivity was to ask if I leaked Rachel's tape to the media. I would never do that.

""Simply being a front facing black woman at this company has taken its toll physically and mentally.""

Gold. Absolute gold.

Taylor stomped out Drew Brees in the 100-meter dash. She smoked Dave Lamont in the 200 meter. She long-jumped (the shark) Rachel Nichols. Taylor's last hurdle is securing an $8 million contract similar to Stephen A. Smith's.

This is a Victim Olympics run that would make Al Sharpton blush in envy.

Taylor is in the final three weeks of an ESPN contract that pays her around $1 million. According to New York Post media columnist Andrew Marchand, Taylor is demanding a $7 million raise.

If she doesn't get the raise, I have a suggestion for her. She's the next Robin DiAngelo, the author of the book ""White Fragility."" Taylor can write ""Black Fragility: Why It's So Hard For Black People To Talk About Racism.""

The book could delve into the hypocrisy of the Victim Olympics. Maria Taylor and all of her enablers have grown accustomed to attributing any success white people have to white privilege. Black and white people are applauded daily via social media for asserting this.



In a conversation not meant to be made public, Rachel Nichols politely suggested that part of Taylor's success was attributable to Taylor's dark skin. In private, Nichols did what Taylor and friends have been doing publicly virtually every day.

The New York Times framed Nichols' comments as a workplace hate crime, headlining its tabloid-style gossip piece ""A disparaging video prompts explosive fallout within ESPN.""

If Nichols' insinuation is disparaging, no wonder America is in racial chaos. Corporate media and social media traffic in disparaging, anti-white race-bait videos that prompt an explosive fallout. No one should be surprised that Nichols and others are starting to push back privately and publicly.

There's no room for fragility in a race war. Taylor should turn in her victimhood gold medals and woman up for the racial fight her actions promote.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/fearless-espns-rachel-nichols-maria-taylor-feud-diminishes-nba-star-chris-pauls-magical-moment,2021-07-05
"Whitlock: Faith conquers fear, powers the American dream, and fuels my Blaze Media project","In the absence of religious faith, fear reigns and freedom recedes.

Discerning the origin of the current, fear-based American social climate is not difficult. Don't blame scientists in China for releasing the angst virus assaulting traditional American liberties.

Blame the tech engineers operating in Silicon Valley laboratories. They invented the social media apps that amplify fear and empower ""cancel culture,"" the nuclear weapons dislodging America from its Judeo-Christian values.

Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey are Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Douglas S. MacArthur ending America's 60-year culture war with an unparalleled bombing campaign. What started with President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society initiative is closing with repression of speech, corporate media propaganda, and an evisceration of America's Judeo-Christian ethos.

Facebook and Twitter finished the mission of turning America secular, godless, and shamelessly immoral. The apps allegedly intended to bring us together have torn us apart. We should not be surprised. The apps urge self-worship, celebrity worship, and consumerism, which lead to hedonism, idolatry, and materialism.

A secular society always produces chaos and division.

Branded as racists, Uncle Toms, coons, homophobes, transphobes, hypocrites, and misogynists, American Christians fear publicly identifying themselves by their faith. They've placed their political identity and racial identity above their religious identity.



They're conservatives. Or Republicans. Or nationalists, both white and black. Or libertarians. Or liberals. Or social justice activists. Or, worse, Trump supporters and Trump resisters.

They avoid saying the name that made John Brown and Frederick Douglass abolitionists, compelled Thomas Jefferson to write that ""all men are created equal,"" comforted Union soldiers during the Civil War, and inspired Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. They avoid directly referring to the name that made America great in the first place, the name that forced us to overcome our superficial differences and transform those differences into our greatest strength.

Jesus.

He's been canceled, crucified by a toxic secular culture that bullies His believers with threats to expose their sins on the Satan-con Valley social media platforms and/or the Satan-con Valley-catering corporate media outlets.

Fear is the enemy of truth, freedom, and the American dream.

I signed a contract to partner with Blaze Media on a digital media project dedicated to pushing back against the corporate-supported, systematic effort to undermine America through racial division and fear. I joined Blaze Media because I wanted to partner with people who wouldn't look at me funny when I referred to Jesus as part of my journalistic worldview and platform.

I joined Blaze Media because Glenn Beck smiled when I said Jesus is the only solution for what ails America, because Steve Deace wears his faith publicly, and so do Phil Robertson, Allie Beth Stuckey, and others.

I am not a sports journalist-turned-preacher. I'm not a finger-wagging hypocrite looking down on the people who don't share my beliefs. I'm a sinner. I'm the same guy who wrote hilarious Pussy Galore columns for Fox Sports, the same guy who used to waste his time and money drinking and carousing inside the Spearmint Rhino in Las Vegas, Tootsie's in Miami, Diamond Joe's in Kansas City, and Magic City in Atlanta.

I'm someone who knows that in order for me to make better decisions — in all aspects of my life — I need Jesus.

I'm someone who recognizes that any success I've achieved in a 30-year career is a byproduct of the values my grandmother, a tiny church in Indianapolis, my parents, and my siblings instilled in me as a young boy.

My testimony is amazing. It's further evidence of the power of faith and the availability of the American dream.

My brand and approach to journalism and broadcasting are fearless. My courage is rooted in faith.

Fear is destroying America. It locked us in our homes, forced us to cover our faces, and forbade us to worship together for more than a year. It stole freedoms we took for granted. It allowed Colin Kaepernick to polarize our national anthem. It turned rare incidents of deadly police misconduct into a fictional genocidal pandemic. It spawned race hoaxes and a generation of race-baiting grifters. It diminished sports' ability to unify.



That's why we are launching the Fearless platform, which will start with my show, ""Fearless with Jason Whitlock,"" and a second podcast showcasing my friendship with my right-hand man, ""Uncle Jimmy"" (Dodds), and will eventually include a Fearless writing vertical.

We're going to fight back. We're going to be the abolitionists of fear. From my new hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, we're joining hands with Beck, Deace, Robertson, Mark Levin, Steven Crowder, Dave Rubin, Allie Beth Stuckey, and the rest of Blaze Media to stand as an example of what Americans can accomplish when we put our differences aside and work together.

On the surface, Fearless will look a little different from the rest of the Blaze Media family. But our love of country will be just as strong, our appreciation for this nation's founding documents just as sincere, and our search for liberating truths just as intense.

The 400-year African American journey is this nation's most compelling and powerful narrative. It's proof the American dream is real and attainable. That's why our adversaries abroad and within are perverting, manipulating, and weaponizing the African American narrative. Black Americans' fight for freedom made the United States live up to the ideals espoused in the Declaration of Independence — the equality of man and unalienable rights bestowed by our Creator.

Our relentless pursuit of freedom was the iron that sharpened American iron.

The Chinese Communist Party knows this. The revolutionaries in Satan-con Valley know this. The editors at the New York Times know this. The trained, self-described Marxists who founded Black Lives Matter know this.



In order to destroy America, you must cripple belief in the rags-to-riches American dream and the conviction that America is a force for good. Reshaping the African American narrative into a journey that damns this nation — rather than one that illuminates our unprecedented resolve to do better — hastens our decline.

The black journey fueled American exceptionalism. The elite architects of chaos cleverly and covertly attack this obvious truth.

""Black Twitter"" is not an organic construct. It's a social media algorithm designed to paint any truth-speaking public figure as a racist or a race traitor. The New York Times' 1619 Project isn't journalism. It's the companion of academia's virus, critical race theory, propaganda designed to foster racial animus and erode black patriotism. Black Lives Matter isn't concerned with the welfare of black men. It's a fundraising arm of the Democratic Party and a lobbyist for the LGBTQ agenda.

The racial conflict BLM, Antifa, and social media influencers promote smokescreens a far more insidious plot — the plot to cancel Jesus and impose a cultural Marxism on the United States. Global elites prefer China's system of authoritarian governance and worker exploitation. Backers of the Great Reset and Build Back Better prefer that America function the way China does. Jesus and communism cannot coexist. Karl Marx, the father of Marxism and the proponent of communism, explained that in his political theory.

The racial smokescreen is working. We're losing the faux race war and surrendering the freedoms that made America the envy of the world.

We're losing because we've sidelined our best soldier — Jesus. The original combatants of the Civil War drew on Jesus as their primary power source. Have you ever studied the lyrics of the Battle Hymn of the Republic?

Here's my favorite passage:

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was borne across the sea

With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me

As he died to make men holy let us die to make men free

His truth is marching on

Glory, glory hallelujah

Julia Ward Howe, a white abolitionist, wrote those words in 1861. The words spurred men to sacrifice their lives for the freedom of others. Mine eyes have seen the glory of what Americans can accomplish when we come together as one nation under God, when we conquer our fears.

Your sin does not nullify your Christianity. It justifies it. Let go of that fear. Your sins, no matter what they are, do not prohibit you from speaking truth, standing on biblical principles, and being heard.

The enemies of truth, the elites rewriting history and redefining American freedom, are not silent or scared. Their immorality (sin) emboldens them. Our sin silences us. Not any more. Not if I can help it.

The mission statement of the Fearless Project is simple: We're a digital media platform dedicated to promoting a culture of fearlessness, free speech, truth-seeking, and American patriotism.

We will accomplish our mission by critiquing, lampooning, and probing the events shaping conversations around sports, race, and popular culture.

You will not have to believe what I believe to enjoy and benefit from ""Fearless."" That's the gift of a Judeo-Christian culture. It works to ensure that non-believers receive the same opportunity to pursue their dreams as everyone else.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/fearless-scottie-pippens-racial-assault-on-phil-jackson-shows-we-need-a-war-on-twitter-crack,2021-06-08
"Delano Squires: LeBron James, Serena Williams, activists athletes should publicly defend women athletes against transgender invasion","Professional sports have been completely taken over by politics. What started with athletes protesting during the national anthem and demanding team support for political causes has culminated in the leagues themselves using courts, fields, and jerseys to promote ""racial equity"" and major corporations weighing in on proposed state legislation.

Conspicuously absent from the list of causes worthy of increased awareness are the girls and women who have publicly opposed the inclusion of biological males in women's sports. State laws that attempt to restrict girls' sports to biological females have been characterized in corporate media outlets from USA Today to ESPN as attacks against transgender athletes. The Biden administration withdrew from a federal lawsuit in Connecticut that tried to limit participation in girls' sports to female athletes. The passage of the Equality Act by the House of Representatives early this year further demonstrates that the girls fighting for athletic fairness have as little support among elected officials as they do in corporate media or pop culture.

I find it fascinating that no professional leagues, high-profile players, or social justice activists have spoken up to say anything about how these changes will impact girls and women who have trained from a young age to compete at the highest levels. The WNBA has carved out a reputation for being very active in protesting racial justice causes, but it has been completely silent on an issue that could have a direct impact on the league. The same can be said for Jemele Hill, Serena Wiliams, LeBron James, and Megan Rapinoe. Each one has argued for using their platforms to speak for the voiceless and advocate for the marginalized.



This issue shows the limits of activism in sports. Players and sports journalists know that engaging in social justice causes, whether on or off the court, can improve their public profile as long as the issue is in line with the cultural zeitgeist. What's more difficult, and much less culturally rewarding, is to come out against a policy that many see as the latest frontier of justice for an oppressed group.

This type of selective activism is a sign of cowardice.

The most elite female athletes know that their male counterparts are bigger, stronger, and faster and that no amount of hormone therapy can totally eradicate those physical advantages. They are afraid of saying anything that would offend the transgender community or bring them criticism on social media. They sit by as girls suffer the public indignity of standing on the podium and smiling as a biological male walks away with medals and prize money that is meant for female athletes.

The left's radical views on sex and gender are the types of changes that destabilize societies. While they focus on race — which is literally skin deep — they completely ignore the long-term physical, emotional, and societal impacts of rejecting the body'snatural design and telos. People who think their bodies and minds are in conflict with one another need care and compassion, specifically because I believe that God created males and females equal in dignity and worth but different in composition and function. People who don't share my Christian convictions should at least trust science enough to know that while much of the public debate about gender identity focuses on what people feel and believe, athletics are largely an exercise in what the body can do. Thinking you were born in the wrong body doesn't change the physical advantages that body provides. Unfortunately, too few people are willing to acknowledge that fact. Activist athletes want to be seen as revolutionaries ushering in a new age of social equality. They're not. The only thing radical about them is their conformity to whatever opinions the cultural gatekeepers deem acceptable.

"Nick Cannon says marriage racist, Jason Whitlock looks at black America and culture war.","Corporate media wants us to believe racism is at the heart of America's fragmentation. The truth is, it's a lack of shared values. The media's fixation on race and racism distracts us from seeing what's obvious.

We've raised at least two generations of young people who reject this country's founding principles and values. Academia and Hollywood have demonized Western Civilization and responsible men.

Last week, celebrity entertainer Nick Cannon told the cast of ""The Breakfast Club,"" a popular urban radio/TV show, that the concept of traditional marriage is racist.

""That's a Eurocentric concept when you think about the idea of you're supposed to have this one person for the rest of your life,"" Cannon said. ""And really that's just to classify property when you think about it.""

Cannon, 40, has seven children with four different women. He went on to explain that the women in his relationships are the leaders and decision-makers.

""Those women, and all women, are the ones that open themselves up and say, 'I would like to allow this man into my world and I will birth this child.' It ain't my decision. I'm just following suit,"" Cannon said.

Nick Cannon is a sperm donor and an ATM, automated teller machine. He basically argued that he's not responsible for the children he creates beyond financial contribution. He rejects the biblical role of man and the biblical construct of marriage. He rejects the founding principles and values of this country and Western Civilization.



He's a typical leftist elitist. He's entitled and irresponsible. I would not want to live in the same neighborhood as Nick Cannon. He's weak. America is filled with weak men, men who want out of the driver's seat, men who spurn responsibility and accountability.

Cannon and others have bought into the concept that male leadership is a white man's burden and white supremacy's best friend. According to the left, if you believe in the values of Western Civilization, you're likely racist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, and a closeted member of the KKK.

What if you're just someone who believes in a proven formula of success?

The seven kids-with-four-baby mamas formula has yet to be proven as effective as the seven kids-with-your-wife formula. No formula is full proof. But the data are pretty overwhelming that intact nuclear families produce strong kids and cohesive, safe neighborhoods, cities, states, and societies. Neighborhoods with high concentrations of broken families are generally beset with pathologies.

Cannon should know this. He grew up in dysfunction. His grandfather raised him in San Diego.

I'm outraged by Cannon's comments because I realize the Left has convinced black people to adopt Cannon's point of view. The Left is imposing values on all of its constituents that are anti-Western Civilization.

Many people on the conservative side are justifiably appalled that black people cannot recognize we are being brainwashed into believing Western Civilization and religious values have oppressed us rather than liberated us. We're being baited into a conflict that will have the appearance of a racial conflict, when the true conflict is over values.

Do you believe in marriage between man and woman? Do you believe there are more than two genders? Do you believe in eugenics and Planned Parenthood's black baby holocaust? Do you believe in freedom or do you prefer government control? Do you believe in the right to bear arms?



We're not in the midst of a race war. We're in a culture and values war. It's really a holy war.

Do you believe in one nation under God?

My journalistic career has been dedicated to provoking thought, challenging popular orthodoxy and groupthink, and educating black people on the path from poverty to wealth.

We're headed the wrong direction! The Left is steering us the wrong way, away from God, away from the principles and values that allowed us to conquer slavery, Jim Crow, segregation, and other forms of oppression.

Our focus on the alleged racism of others is preventing us from seeing what's happening to us. We're abandoning our values.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/jason-whitlock,2021-08-14
Fearless: Jason Whitlock’s letter to black America explaining the real purpose of made-for-TV racial conflict,"Dear Black People:

We are being lied to and set up. The mainstream media, Democratic politicians, social justice activists, and perhaps even your church pastor have led you to believe America is in the midst of a racial conflict similar to the Civil War and the civil rights movement.

They have pitted us against the Proud Boys, the KKK, rural militia groups, and Trump supporters in a made-for-TV race war. Just five years after Barack Obama completed two terms as president of the United States, we're supposed to believe America has been overrun by violent white supremacists determined to reinstate segregation, Jim Crow laws, and maybe even slavery.

Evidence of this massive wave of 1920s-style bigotry amounts to three things: 1) Republicans want all voters to show a government-issued ID; 2) On January 6, unarmed Trump supporters crashed the Capitol and took pictures inside Nancy Pelosi's office; 3) Across the nation, police kill on average 250 black men and 450 white men per year.

Oh, I almost forgot. There's a fourth piece of evidence. Colin Kaepernick failed to land a job as a starting quarterback after pissing off a large segment of football fans by taking a knee during the national anthem.

Those are the main smoking guns proving that white supremacy is the most dangerous domestic threat America faces. George Floyd, a habitual criminal and drug addict, is the Crispus Attucks of this raging race war. He is our rallying cry and hero.

It's a setup. We're being used as decoys and distractions in a war that has nothing to do with race.

The real war is about global power and the future of America's system of government. This country's elite, global citizens, and corporations prefer communism over capitalism and democracy. They prefer China's system over our system.



America has been the world's leader in racial progress and fairness. The mainstream media are not allowed to explain this to you. Advertisers, aka major corporations, will no longer support media outlets that back our current democratic and capitalistic systems of governance.

You say, what about Fox News? Turn it on. It's filled with a bunch of MyPillow and wounded soldier commercials. America's big, global corporations, the ones looking to improve their market share in China, are not financially supporting Fox News. The most popular voices at Fox News dislike China.

The faux race war the mainstream media have promoted is a tool being used to convince you and non-black Americans that our system of government has been a giant failure. They want you to believe that a great reset is necessary to achieve fairness.

The reset is communism, which starts with the gateway drug of socialism and ends in full-blown Marxism. China is run by the Communist Chinese Party. Communism has no respect for individual freedom or religion of any kind. Communism has no tolerance for political dissent.

Your religion and free speech will not survive the reset. Communism is racial oppression's best friend. When a nation is stripped of religious faith and free speech, few people have the courage to defend the rights of minorities. The elites cozying up to China do not care about you. They are aware of how despicably China treats black people. They are aware of how China squashes dissent.

Do your own research on communism and what it stamps out and how it oppresses. Don't take my word.

You might be wondering why Oprah Winfrey or LeBron James or some other super popular black celebrity isn't telling you what I am. They're global elites. The reset won't hurt them or their loved ones. Communism favors wealthy elites far more than capitalism and democracy do. Oprah, LeBron, and the other uber-wealthy black tokens will thrive under socialism and communism.

You won't. Unless you're a 6'6"" basketball star or some other black entertainer capable of entertaining the people in power. That's a tiny percentage of black people.

Why won't your favorite white cable newsman or newswoman tell you what I'm telling you? Rachel Maddow, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, Joe Scarborough, aren't they our allies? No. They're not. They're political lobbyists working on behalf of the corporations and politicians pushing the reset.

OK. What about me? You might think I'm a political partisan working on behalf of conservative Republicans. That is certainly how I've been painted by left-leaning media outlets and social media platforms. And I'm now partnered with Blaze Media, a platform that leans right.

Judge my career. I have been at this for more than 30 years. I have been equally despised by the left and the right. I have publicly feuded with Bill O'Reilly and Keith Olbermann. I've been a guest on their old Fox News and MSNBC shows. I've worked and/or written for ESPN, Fox Sports, the Huffington Post, Playboy Magazine, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal. I spent years bashing Sarah Palin.

I don't play for any political team. I've never voted. I go wherever I believe I can speak, follow, and write the truth. The truth I believe the most is that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior.

I believe Jesus is under attack. That's why I'm at Blaze Media. You can't defend Jesus at corporate media outlets. Advertisers won't allow it. You can discuss the religion of racism every day at ESPN, CNN, MSNBC, and even Fox Sports. But it's taboo to discuss the cure for racism — Jesus — on those platforms.

I'm not saying any of this because there's a big paycheck for black men espousing my views. The money for black broadcasters and journalists is connected to preaching the race-bait religion.

Let me be clear. I'm not broke by any stretch. I've earned and saved a substantial sum of money. But I've bypassed far more money than I've earned with the choice I've made to follow the truth wherever it leads and my refusal to support the racial groupthink dictated by global elites.

My faith won't allow me to jump on board with the lunacy, racism, and sacrilege of Black Lives Matter, a movement founded by three lesbian self-admitted trained Marxists. BLM is an atheist movement in support of LGBTQ issues and the reshaping of America into a communist country. BLM is part of the deception.

Black people tell me all the time: ""I don't support the BLM organization, but I support the slogan and sentiment.""

Let me translate that. You despise the devil's tree but love the fruit it produces. That's some Don Lemon-Lori Lightfoot-Van Jones-Colin Kaepernick level of hypocrisy. You know, all the Malcolm X-wannabe, anti-white radicals in relationships with white partners. They hate the white tree but can't live without the white fruit.

We have to stop letting everyone use us. We're being played. We're all being played, black and white working-class people. It's all a giant setup. Look at what they did to Trump supporters. They were manipulated into storming the Capitol, and then the corporate media portrayed it as a bloody, violent KKK rally intended to overthrow democracy. The so-called ""insurrection"" is an excuse for the government to seize more power and crush dissent.

We, black people, have been convinced the crushing of working-class white people is good for us.

It's not. Working-class white people, Christian white people, are our true allies, not the elites. We can't see that because of the made-for-TV hyper-focus on racial conflict.

The defunding and demoralizing of police are tactics deployed to increase violence in major cities. Local media outlets are focusing on this rise in crime, national media outlets have followed suit, and social media platforms are generating viral videos exposing the crime wave.

Guess who are the stars of this content. Black perpetrators.

It's all a massive setup. The stirring of racial animus between Obama worshippers and Trump worshippers is orchestrated by billionaire elites, executed by trained Marxists, promoted by millionaire influencers in the media, sports, and entertainment worlds, and co-signed by religious leaders pursuing popularity.

Black America, print this letter and share it with family, friends, co-workers, and, most importantly, your pastor.



My critics will tell you: ""Oh, Jason Whitlock is a sellout. He hates black people.""

That's laughable. It's part of the deception. I despise the people deceiving us, manipulating us to participate in a racial clash that will be used to destroy the religious and individual freedoms that liberated us.

There's a reason black and brown people across the globe fight to get into this country and excel when they do. They love the American tree and the fruit it produces.

"Sha-Maria Law: ESPN sacrificed Rachel Nichols to honor George Floyd, the Alphabet Mafia, and America’s cultural insurrectionists","ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro is engaged in a prolonged war with the Taliban, commonly referred to in sports media circles as the ""BLM-LGBTQ+ Alphabet Mafia.""

Wednesday, under the tenets of Sha-Maria Law, the Alphabet Mafia beheaded NBA broadcaster Rachel Nichols for private disobedience of identity politics guidelines. ESPN removed Nichols from its NBA coverage and canceled her show, ""The Jump."" With a year left on her contract, according to reports, Nichols will no longer appear on the Worldwide Leader in Sports.

A year ago, Nichols, a white Jewish woman, gossiped with a male member of her tribe about ESPN management handing black colleague Maria Taylor a job that had been contractually promised to Nichols. Unbeknownst to Nichols, her comments were accidently recorded by a camera in her Orlando hotel room and subsequently shared with leadership of a Taliban cell headquartered in Bristol, Connecticut.

Because Nichols made these inconsequential comments during the summer of 2020, the first holy holiday celebrating the death of career criminal St. George Floyd, the Alphabet Mafia placed a bounty on Nichols' career at ESPN. Working with Taylor, the Alphabet Mafia newspaper of record, the New York Times, smeared Nichols as a bigot, forcing Pitaro to execute Nichols.

Some critics are comparing Pitaro to U.S. President Joe Biden, saying Pitaro's submission to the sports media Taliban is analogous to Biden's catastrophic Afghanistan exit. The New York Post's influential media critic Andrew Marchand published a column Wednesday night blaming Pitaro for fumbling the Nichols-Taylor dispute.



""In the history of sports media mismanagement, the way ESPN handled Rachel Nichols' situation may not be the worst, but it can make a case,"" Marchand wrote. ""The fiasco was the result of embarrassing, indecisive management from ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro on down. More than a year ago, ESPN did not do anything of substance about Nichols' comments when they first found out about them. Nothing. Nada.""

It's a fair take. However, I disagree. I am far more sympathetic to Pitaro's plight.

Full disclosure, ESPN rehired me in 2013 to found a website dedicated to covering the intersection of sports, race, and culture. Unfortunately, my black skin did not compensate for my woke shortcomings, my faith-based conservative values, and my toxic masculinity. I was a frequent target of Deadspin's attack. ESPN fired me in 2015. Six years ago, I was Rachel Nichols, a sacrifice to the Alphabet Mafia.

Pitaro inherited the Alphabet War from his predecessor, former ESPN president John Skipper. From 2012 through 2017, Skipper surrendered complete control of the network to the terror group Deadspin and its infamous warlord Nick Denton, the Osama bin Laden of the Alphabet Mafia. In mid-2017, I wrote a piece for the Wall Street Journal explaining the successful insurrection Deadspin pulled off in the Disney capital of Kabul, Connecticut. Deadspin's insurrection was quite similar to the events on January 6 at the Capitol. ESPN security opened doors and welcomed insurrectionists onto its campus. Many ESPN employees worked in a clandestine manner with Deadspin Proud Boys Tommy Craggs, Tim Marchman, A.J. Daulerio, and single token Alphabet nationalist Greg Howard.

Denton, the founder of Gawker Media, used Deadspin to bully ESPN into adopting the identity politics agenda. For years, Deadspin attacked ESPN executives relentlessly, exposing embarrassing details about the sexual malfeasance of the network's executives and personalities. Fear of being a target of a Deadspin ""investigative"" story terrified ESPN leadership, especially Skipper. In 2018, Skipper was forced to resign when it became public that someone was using his cocaine addiction in an alleged extortion plot.

Skipper and ESPN's longtime head of human resources and Alphabet Mafia soldier Paul Richardson negotiated a secret peace agreement with Deadspin. The network agreed to prioritize identity above talent and merit in its on- and off-air decision-making.

In front of the camera, sexual identity, skin color, and gender drove ESPN to form the worst Monday Night Football booth in the history of the iconic show, pairing legendary NFL coach Jon Gruden with solid baseball play-by-play man Sean McDonough and talented sideline reporter Lisa Salters. During the broadcast of FOOTBALL games, Gruden and McDonough routinely expressed horror at the level of violence displayed.

Behind the camera, sexual identity, skin color, and gender led the network to elevate female executives to supervising positions over studio shows, which led to no-impact, mostly attractive female broadcasters landing high-priced hosting jobs on nearly every studio show. Skipper gave huge contracts to Michelle Beadle, Cari Champion, Jemele Hill, Katie Nolan, Samantha Ponder, etc.

If you want to understand why Maria Taylor balked at a raise from $1 million to $5 million and left for NBC, you have to understand the culture Skipper, Richardson, and Deadspin created at ESPN. Taylor was radicalized by Taliban culture early in her career. She is quite talented. But ESPN raised her to feel entitled. Her black skin qualified her for reparations.

Nichols is talented, too. She's also accomplished as a journalist. She worked as a legit journalist at the Washington Post for eight years. Not Jeff Bezos' Washington Post. Nichols worked for the Graham family's Washington Post. Nichols fought her way to the top of sports media with hard work and cunning politics. She earned it. Yes, Nichols played woke to survive and thrive within corporate media. But she did not deserve this embarrassing public execution. She did not deserve the New York Times hit piece insinuating racism, nor the savage and irresponsible tweets about her personal life.

She whined to a friend that identity politics stole an opportunity she earned. Who wouldn't do that? Who hasn't done that?

Nichols and Pitaro are victims of a strategy Skipper and Richardson implemented a decade ago. Pitaro replaced Skipper in 2018 and immediately declared war on the sports media Taliban. Pitaro demanded that ESPN sportscasters talk about sports rather than Twitter-approved political talking points. He bought out Michelle Beadle's $5 million-a-year contract when she could no longer hide her utter disdain for football, the primary ratings driver for all of sports television. Pitaro bought out Jemele Hill when she chose sophomoric political commentary over sophomoric sports commentary. Pitaro declined to participate in the sports media fantasy that a cute Boston bartender, Katie Nolan, was the future of sports television.

Pitaro and ESPN executive vice president Norby Williamson were having great success smoking insurrectionists out of their Bristol caves. Everything changed in the summer of 2020. That's when a Minneapolis police officer assisted fentanyl activist St. George Floyd in the destruction of his life. In terms of cultural change, Derek Chauvin's knee was more powerful than Colin Kaepernick's.

It resurrected the Taliban, aka the Alphabet Mafia.



Insurrectionists in sports media and across American culture glorified St. George Floyd so they could use him to seize power and exact revenge on the infidels who stray from or don't adhere to the politics of identity.

What we've seen play out at ESPN over the past decade mirrors the rest of American society. Those of you applauding the death of Rachel Nichols, including those of you with black skin, will be the next victim of Sha-Maria Law.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/nick-cannon-black-america-culture-war-whitlock,2021-08-26
"Squires: If 'silence is violence,' corporate media should stand trial every time black men like Mike Hickmon are killed","During the summer of 2020, it was common to hear from liberals seeking to guilt white people into supporting Black Lives Matter that “silence is violence” and “silence is complicity.”

Their belief was simple: The deaths of black men should matter to white people who have the privilege and resources to change America for the better. Corporate media and big business got the memo. So did the NBA, MLB, NHL, and NFL. All made some reference to BLM on their courts, fields, or uniforms.

The Washington Nationals postponed a game with the Philadelphia Phillies on August 27, 2020, to “call attention to racial and social injustice” in the wake of the Jacob Blake shooting. The team made no mention of the mass shooting a few weeks prior, when more than 20 black people were shot at a black party 12 minutes from the stadium.

This perverse dynamic is why the fatal shooting of coach Michael Hickmon in Lancaster, Texas, is not getting the type of attention you would expect from ESPN, Fox Sports, or the rest of corporate sports media.

According to reports, coach Hickmon was shot at a youth football game by Yaqub Talib, brother of retired NFL cornerback Aqib Talib, after a fight at the end of the game. Yaqub Talib turned himself in to police on August 15 after they issued a warrant for his arrest on murder charges. Witnesses allege Aqib Talib participated in the fight that precipitated the shooting.

Murder is the ultimate act of evil, regardless of the ethnic makeup of the victim or perpetrator. But if silence is violence, then the only group more violent toward black men than their peers are the black elites whose righteous indignation flares up like seasonal allergies when the loss of black life is a sign of ongoing racial strife.

It is unfair to demand that every black celebrity respond publicly to every homicide with a black victim. That doesn’t mean people shouldn’t ask why sports networks that covered the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict would completely ignore a fatal shooting at a youth football game that involved a former NFL player. I have not heard from Stephen A. Smith, Shannon Sharpe, or Snoop Dogg — who has been a very public supporter of youth football. The highest-profile ESPN personality who has addressed this incident is Kendrick Perkins, an NBA analyst.

The reason for this violent silence is simple. Black death is profitable to corporate media only if the person holding the gun is white. This incident would likely generate a lot more attention if a white player with a bad reputation had been involved.

When white men engage in acts of violence, their actions are attributed to their privilege, rage, and racism. When black men do the same, society is blamed for putting them in an environment that forced them into criminal behavior. Perhaps the people who have become so accustomed to blaming poverty for crime have a hard time understanding how the brother of a millionaire could end up shooting someone at a football game for kids.









Coach Hickmon’s son was on the field at the time of the shooting. Not only is this a traumatic incident for him personally, but it is also a terrible lesson for all of the boys in the game. Black boys are exposed to death way too often in this country, from the suburbs of Dallas to public housing units in Washington, D.C. They hear the gunshots at night, and many have lost friends to senseless acts of violence. They hear it in their music and see it in the videos they watch. They are saturated in death, and many turn to sports as a way to escape the harsh realities in their neighborhoods.

Activists want all the public attention on black victims when they are shot by white police officers, but not when the triggerman looks like his target. These same “racial justice” advocates turn into White Lives Matter spokesmen whenever people try to bring attention to the shootings that happen on a daily basis in black neighborhoods across the country.

The racial disparity in homicide victimization is so large that the rates for whites and blacks can’t be shown on the same graph. This is why homicide is both the leading cause of death for young black men and the second leading cause of black male incarceration. Too many young black men have been taught to sow in seconds and reap in years. Prison is what awaits a man who has low impulse control, a dangerous weapon, and a lack of respect for human life.

The kids on that field learned a series of bad lessons that day. They witnessed the death of their coach at the hands of a man with access to millions. They saw adults who couldn’t control their emotions turn a football field into a crime scene. They saw a former NFL player use his name and resources to escalate conflict instead of trying to calm things down on the field. This isn’t the type of example they need on their journey toward manhood. In the aftermath, they will also receive a sober reminder: Black lives do matter – but only when white people take them.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/ready-fearless-jason-whitlocks-letter-to-black-america-explaining-the-real-purpose-of-made-for-tv-racial-conflict,2022-08-19
"Squires: America is learning: Countries that sow self-hatred, narcissism, and feminized masculinity reap self-destruction","One of the most fascinating developments over the past week has been watching political pundits and social commentators celebrate virtues in Ukraine, from armed resistance to national loyalty, that are frequently criticized in America.

My sense is that the ruling class assumes our citizens would have the same response to a hostile foreign invasion. They may be right, but the biblical principle of sowing and reaping suggests a very different outcome.

A recent tweet from NPR is one example of the type of seed that finds fertile ground in our culture.

“Russia’s attack on Ukraine means there’s a stressful news cycle ahead of us. The reality of conflict is always a shock to the system. Here are 5 ways to cope.”

The entire thread was completely on-brand for NPR, from the thumbnail illustration of an androgynous person of color laying in the fetal position to the language of personal therapy emanating from the subsequent tweets.

It was an easy alley-oop for the conservatives on Twitter who shared the post to the followers, but the post was an important snapshot of the character traits being cultivated in our society.

We have become a fragile nation increasingly unable to deal with the realities of life. The 2016 election of Donald Trump made this crystal clear. Colleges across the country offered students play dough, coloring books, hot chocolate, and bubbles to cope with the stress of an election outcome.

Previous generations of young men between 18 and 22 stormed the beaches of Normandy, fought the Viet Cong in Da Nang, and were beaten during Freedom Rides for civil rights in America. Early adulthood now is characterized by safe spaces and comfort animals.

The NPR post wasn’t just a window into American fragility. It was also another example of our most popular faith – the cult of self. One Army recruitment ad in 2021 followed the story of “Emma,” a soldier who talked about being inspired to join the military after reflecting on the activism of her two moms and adventure-seeking sorority sisters.

The video is a perfect distillation of America in the 21st century – the ultimate act of self-sacrifice has been transformed into a personal vanity project of self-fulfillment. Recruitment ads from China and Russia show young men leaving their families, engaging in physically demanding training exercises, jumping out of planes, scaling walls, and driving tanks. The virtues being promoted in their ads – bravery, sacrifice, honor, discipline, patriotism, courage – transcend language and nationality.

What makes things even more difficult is the extent to which the left uses every organ of culture, from sports to movies, to sell the message that America is irredeemably racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and xenophobic. Who would want to die for such an evil country? Alienating your citizens from their nation is not a wise move when our adversaries in other countries are willing to exploit every perceived weakness to expand their own power.

These weaknesses have been exacerbated by the left’s forward assault on manhood. A Christian professor named Karen Swallow Prior tweeted a video of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and a small group of men who committed to stay and fight for their country. She said, “I doubt these guys tweet about ‘manliness.’” The subtext was that conservative evangelical American men talk about masculinity more than they embody it.

What she failed to mention is that American society has been grinding away at men and manhood for decades. A desire to help men get more in touch with their feelings has morphed into something much more ominous. Every few months a new man in a dress is being upheld as brave and courageous for pushing the boundaries of gender. Men who object to the fashion choices of Harry Styles, Billy Porter, or Kid Cudi are seen as toxic and regressive.

This erosion of masculinity extends into the home as well, and not just through depictions of bumbling, incompetent dads on television sitcoms. The one tactical advantage women have in the gender wars is their words. Women who berate and disrespect their husbands are doing untold damage to both their mates and children. We went from mothers saying, “I don’t need a man” to daughters saying, “I don’t want a man” to sons saying, “I don’t want to be a man.”

The domestic power struggle that feminism has been encouraging for decades has led to men who are less assertive and more indecisive than their forefathers. Women who reject male leadership in the home often fear the misuse of authority, but that abdication also removes responsibility. It’s a package deal, in the same way the sun provides both light and heat.

I know many women who object to rigid gender roles, whether in the home or broader society. I don’t know a single one who wants to take on the role of protecting men from harm or the responsibility of being the sole provider in a household that has an able-bodied man present.

This contradiction is captured by a famous quote from C.S. Lewis.

“In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful.”

One historian’s new book claims that white evangelicals corrupted Christianity in America with the rugged masculinity embodied by John Wayne. Reading contemporary cultural norms into the Bible can certainly lead to bad doctrine, but the reason some pastors feel compelled to speak about biblical manhood is because they understand what happens to a culture that embraces the church of Jesus and Elton John.



A country that promotes national alienation, paints masculinity as inherently toxic, and rewards fragility, neuroses, and anxiety is in no position to fight external battles. It must first address the corrosion that is occurring within its borders. It’s hard to envision bravery from people who crumble under the weight of microaggressions or go into a state of panic when they see someone without a piece of cloth covering their nose and mouth. War creates a fog for those in it, but it is clarifying for people fortunate enough to live in peace.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/sha-maria-law-espn-sacrificed-rachel-nichols-to-honor-george-floyd-the-alphabet-mafia-and-americas-cultural-insurrectionists,2022-03-01
"Squires: Americans need truth, logic, and courage to free our institutions from 'pregnant men' and 'female penises'","The recent exchange between Professor Khiara Bridges and Senator Josh Hawley provides an important lesson about the state of America’s most important institutions. Bridges, who teaches at the University of California's Berkeley School of Law, was invited to testify at hearing on abortion access. Hawley asked her whether her repeated use of the phrase “person with the capacity for pregnancy” was her way of saying “woman.”

Over the next minute, she claimed “trans men” and “non-binary” people are also capable of pregnancy, stated Hawley’s line of questioning was “transphobic,” and claimed his refusal to affirm the idea of male pregnancy was tied to the suicide rates among trans people. The media outlets that hailed Bridges for “owning” Senator Hawley make our current state of affairs even clearer.

America’s most important institutions have lost public trust because of the corruption, incompetence, and political ideology of the people leading them.

We live at a point in human history when the most wealthy, educated, and powerful people in the country will not acknowledge the most basic truths about men and women. Their attempts to redefine reality cannot build or preserve anything. Destruction, both literally and figuratively, follows them like a shadow.

Attempts to rationalize the sudden acceptance of “pregnant men” and “women with penises” have two certain outcomes: brain rot from the inability to think logically and spiritual demoralization from the unwillingness to speak truthfully. Neither one is healthy for the future of the republic.

Smugness and self-importance aside, the power the ruling class exerts over our lives makes these changes even harder to accept.

In 2021, Americans were told that COVID vaccines would prevent infection and transmission. This claim was repeated by Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, as well as Bill Gates and President Biden. They were obviously wrong.

Leaders with humility and wisdom would admit their error and chart a new course. The people who run our institutions did the opposite. Over the next year, Merriam-Webster changed the definition of “vaccine,” people were fired for disobeying mandates, and the media attempted to silence dissenters.

My trust in our national COVID response was shaken much earlier. On June 5, 2020, more than 1,000 public health professionals signed an open letter arguing that large protests against racial injustice should be allowed, even as some people still couldn’t leave home to work.

The letter stated, “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19.” The signatories clearly understood COVID’s political leanings, because they later clarified that their letter should not be taken as an approval of all protests, particularly ones against stay-home orders.

Their message was clear: Visiting your family may prove deadly, but having 10,000 people crammed cheek by jowl into the town square is fine if they have the right political views.

If the public health establishment was COVID’s biggest loser in public trust, the public education system took the silver medal. One year of unions fighting to keep schools closed and parents seeing what their children were being taught did more to advance school choice than decades of conservative political rhetoric.

Likewise, police abolitionists wish they could be as effective at undermining conservative confidence in law enforcement as images of an Ohio mom being tased and handcuffed at an outdoor football game and a New York City man being assaulted by police officers for violating social distancing rules. The videos of police inaction in Uvalde have only compounded the damage COVID did to the public image of police.

The leaders of our institutions have a vested interest in slowing – and reversing – their decline. In the near future, saying that you graduated from Harvard or Stanford won’t confer any prestige. It will be an indication that you’re a sucker who could have paid half the price to a state university if your goal was to “learn” that men can get pregnant.

Professor Bridges has an impressive set of credentials, but her attempts at linguistic and emotional manipulation during her congressional testimony were a lesson in trans activism 101. Any institution that lends its reputation, whether through credentialing or employment, is implicated in her attempts to frame biological truth as an existential harm to trans people.

The truth is that higher rates of suicide, anxiety, and depression should be expected among people whose minds are in conflict with their bodies. Civil wars – whether within the body politic or the human body – always have casualties. The mental health concerns associated with transgenderism are caused by a denial of reality, not insufficient affirmation. It is neither loving nor kind to encourage a person to live by lies.

External attacks often strengthen institutional resolve. Internal arguments are rendered insignificant in the face of an advancing enemy. Survival always trumps unanimity. Conversely, no amount of external whitewashing and advocacy can prop up an institution that is dead on the inside. No amount of browbeating can convince people that up is down or 2+2 = 5. They may mimic the right words, but that does not mean they believe the lies.



College professors, elected officials, CEOs, journalists, and activists assume their advanced degrees, hefty salaries, and political power are enough to justify the trust we place in their words. They are clearly mistaken. They blame the public for being insufficiently compliant, but their criticism is being aimed in the wrong direction. This problem won’t be solved by putting us under a microscope. If correction is what they seek, it is time they look in the mirror.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-2657888989,2022-07-15
Squires: America’s destroyers want to convict Kyle Rittenhouse for defending his community and country,"The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse epitomizes the cultural conflict that is raging in every part of American society. Despite the media's best efforts to convince the public otherwise, this conflict isn't another example of our historical struggle with race. It's not even about Democrats and Republicans.

At its core, the fight we're in is between destroyers and defenders.

The first group sees America as a country infected to its core by the sins of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia. That is why they are committed to abolishing and dismantling any systems or institutions that enforce traditional norms, sustain order, or stand in the way of their political goals.

The second group sees America as a country worth defending. They acknowledge its imperfections and celebrate signs of societal progress. That is why they are willing to risk bodily harm, financial ruin, and social censure to protect traditional norms and support values that help people flourish. Defenders want to prune branches that produce bad fruit. Destroyers want to burn down the entire forest.

Kyle Rittenhouse is on trial for shooting and killing two men and injuring a third in the riots that engulfed Kenosha, Wisconsin. The defendant's future will be decided by a jury tasked with weighing evidence and rendering a verdict, but the reaction to his actions that night and subsequent trial says a lot about the future of our country.

Corporate media's position in the battle between destroyers and defenders has been clear since George Floyd's death sparked months of marches and peaceful protests as well as riots and looting across the country. Ideologues masquerading as journalists spent much of 2020 informing the public that rioting is the ""voice of the unheard"" and that destroying private property is a form of political speech. They also stood in front of burning buildings and characterized the people doing the torching as ""mostly peaceful."" Local officials like Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan indulged anarchists who took over part of her city and declared it an autonomous zone.

Cable news personalities have called Rittenhouse everything from a vigilante to a terrorist. Joy Reid even read the name of the convicted sex offender Rittenhouse claimed he fatally shot in self-defense. That type of veneration is typically reserved for black people killed by the police, but to the left, even a white child molester is worth defending if he advances a political goal.

This isn't just about physical possessions and property. The same destructive impulses can be seen in the left's attempts to smear parents concerned about what their children are being taught in school. Michael Steele, a Republican and former lieutenant governor of Maryland, joined with Joy Reid to mock parents who object to schools assigning sexually explicit books to their children. Destroyers have a difficult time understanding parents like this because the only thing they feel duty-bound to defend is their political ideology.

This attack on defenders is also a proxy war on men. Every society requires men to be protectors — both physically and financially. American society is crumbling because we have convinced ourselves that impulse to defend the vulnerable is toxic. That is why the left attacks men who oppose abortion or champion the importance of the nuclear family. They prefer their men weak and docile, with just enough testosterone to serve as male ""allies"" but not enough to challenge the cultural zeitgeist. The left loves the type of dads who take their children to Drag Queen Story Hour and then post about it on social media. They hate the ones who see the coming decline of a society that celebrates grown men dressed as women teaching young children to twerk.

Our institutions have failed to protect the country from destroyers. The vacuum created by elected officials and cultural influencers who refuse to lead provides the void that citizens invariably end up filling. That is the case whether we're talking about New York subway passenger Bernard Goetz in 1984, Kyle Rittenhouse in 2020, or David Dorn, a retired police captain killed in 2020 while trying to defend a store from being looted.

Building, sustaining, and defending values and norms takes time and dedication. It takes no skill to destroy.

A sane country would promote and defend the people who want to protect their communities and condemn the people who want to destroy them. Unfortunately, the American ruling class does the complete opposite. It justifies destruction — only when carried out by the ""right"" types of people — and criticizes people whose first instinct is protection. With those incentives, it's no wonder people in many cities feel like they are trapped in environments marked by lawlessness and disorder.



The same dynamics at play in the streets of America are also present in the battle for hearts and minds. We are living in an age where some of the most influential media personalities and outlets think adults consuming ""outrage porn"" online is worse than children being exposed to actual pornography in school. Such is the nature of this cultural battle. They want to destroy. It's your job to defend.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-america-is-learning-countries-that-sow-self-hatred-narcissism-and-feminized-masculinity-reap-self-destruction,2021-11-16
"Squires: Black men in my generation must lead the battle against RadFems, BLM, and the groups out to destroy the nuclear family","America’s centuries-long battle to become a more perfect union has devolved into a war on the marital union. Nowhere has this fight against marriage and the nuclear family been more intense than among black men, women, and their children. This war is not being waged by racists in white hoods. That type of fight would spark a strong communal response.

No, the soldiers dismantling the black family wear Black Lives Matter T-shirts, call themselves radical feminists and allies, teach at prestigious universities, and often share the pigmentation of the people they want to emancipate from the patriarchy. Worse, these soldiers claim they are pro-family.

Brittney Cooper, the self-described “Professor Crunk,” is a senior strategist in this unholy war. She’s a radical black feminist, an associate professor at Rutgers University, a featured contributor on MSNBC, and a favorite guest for host Joy Reid. This week, professor Crunk has been on the front lines of the abortion debate. In an appearance on Marc Lamont Hill’s show, Cooper argued that the right to abortion is essential to building strong black families.

Via Twitter, I asked professor Crunk how someone who is pro-abortion could also describe herself as pro-family. Her response captured the ""daddy doctrine"" guiding the left’s attack plan for the past 60 years.

“We don’t need traditional nuclear families for Black thriving,” she replied.

Professor Cooper said out loud what the black community has been living for the past half-century, and her views are consistent with her influential black co-conspirators in politics, media, and entertainment.

Turncoats are the intellectual backbone of the war on the black family, the war to detach black Americans from God’s design for men, women, and their children. They have been incredibly effective.

The number of American children born to unmarried parents has increased significantly in the past 50 years. Nowhere has this cultural shift been more pronounced than within black families. About 25% of black children were born to unmarried parents in 1965. It reached 50% by 1975 and has been over 70% since 1995.

Studies show that social, emotional, and educational outcomes for children are best when they are raised by their married biological parents in low-conflict relationships. Compared to children raised in other family arrangements, children who are raised by their married parents achieve higher levels of education and have lower levels of teen pregnancy, criminal activity, and behavioral problems. Democrats and the subversive black activists and intellectuals who support them may deny this, but it doesn’t change the facts.

Fighting this ideology will require a radical reorganization of priorities and recognition of the people and strategy being used to diminish the necessity of God’s marriage covenant. Step one will involve a mindset shift. We can no longer be more consumed with the history and society our ancestors endured than with the future and society our descendants will inherit.

I’m hoping my children’s children will read the 2119 Project, a mash-up of two of the most controversial documents of their times — the Moynihan Report that focused on the state of the black family in the 1960s and the 1619 Project that situates chattel slavery as this nation’s most central institution.

The 2119 Project will chronicle how my generation fought to rebuild the family structure that Cooper and other subversive actors spent generations trying to destroy. The time to act is now, because given our current trajectory, its prologue will need to explain how black people in America went from slaves to citizens to serfs over the course of 500 years.

The answer is quite simple. Permanent dependency is what awaits any group, regardless of ethnicity, that believes the affirmation and protection of children needs to come from “privileged” strangers and the government, rather than from their own parents.

This is why black men need to lead the charge in rebuilding the family. Children deserve to grow up in environments where they see their fathers love, honor, and protect their mothers. They also deserve to see their mothers love, honor, and respect their fathers. The type of stability this brings is a useful protectant in a cold, unforgiving world. For some reason, many black elites would rather use their time and talent to guilt white liberals into being anti-racist than use their platforms to promote a pro-family agenda.

This war started in the 1960s, with Great Society programs and societal changes brought on by the sexual revolution and second-wave feminism. Now the views on the nuclear family promoted by black politicians, intellectuals, activists, celebrities, entertainers, and influencers vacillate between benign neglect and open hostility.

Professor Cooper wrote the following six years ago in a column for Salon: “American families are changing, and we should celebrate the fact that the two-parent, nuclear family ideal has gone the way of the floppy disk.”

During a 2014 panel discussion on MSNBC, Cooper, along with fellow professors Michael Eric Dyson and Melissa Harris-Perry, dismissed the importance of black fathers. Their defenders would say that they mocked the notion that “magical black daddies” are the panacea for all that ails the black community. But not a single member of that panel would take a similar position on “superhero moms.”

The fact that three social scientists would deny decades of research and innumerable observations across time and culture about the importance of family structure shows they prioritize their ideological commitments over what is best for children.

Every social ill in this country would turn around if more children grew up in loving homes with both parents. The dissolution of the family, across race, impacts everything from abortion to incarceration rates. The results of this change have been clear to any honest observer. What is harder to see are the people who are pushing these changes.

The most radical actors at the top of the pyramid are committed ideologues whose primary concerns are amassing political power, wealth redistribution, and utopian visions of an entrenched matriarchy free from the double-barreled oppressions of racism and sexism.

Right under them are a powerful set of people unwittingly promoting a political agenda they don’t fully understand. These people are what seasoned propagandists would call “useful idiots.”

These include black media members who have promoted Black Lives Matter without ever asking why none of the organization’s 13 original principles used the words “boy, man, or father” even in the parts of the BLM manifesto on the black family. Alicia Garza and Patrisse Cullors were interviewed by Roland Martin, Joy Reid, Marc Lamont Hill, Trevor Noah, Jemele Hill, the Breakfast Club, and “The View” without ever having to explain why they think the nuclear family should be disrupted.

On the bottom of the pyramid are the millions of black people whose views on family have slowly been transformed through the reordering of social and cultural norms caused by the first two groups.

No culture, community, or country can thrive when its most influential personalities are dedicated to undermining the values, behaviors, and norms that lead to success. That is why anyone who fights against the nuclear family, regardless of how “pro-black” they claim to be, should be seen as an impediment to progress in the black community. Growing up in a home with married parents doesn’t guarantee success, but a community that says the natural family is obsolete is destined for failure.

The financial, emotional, physical, and social damage done during this war is incalculable. What the black community needs now are people with influence to incorporate the benefits of marriage and family into every single aspect of the culture. We need to become as comfortable expressing aspirations for our children around marriage and family as we are for college. Inner-city schools have no issue promoting college attendance to children whose parents don’t have four-year degrees. Helping children see themselves as future husbands and wives should be no different.

The women arguing against the nuclear family often have a deep disdain for heterosexual black men who refuse to play their game. Part of the problem is that too many black men have bought in to the same ideology that has their female counterparts in mental bondage. They think that children are a burden, that women should be the backbone of the black community, and that masculinity is toxic. These views take the complementary roles God designed men and women to play and turn them on their heads.



There’s nothing wrong with culture wars. Given our recent track record abroad in armed conflicts, they are probably the only wars Americans should be fighting. The non-marital birth rates for all groups are on the rise. That means every American has a vested interest in seeing conditions improve in the black family. It is time for all of us, especially black men, to get into the fight.

We don’t owe any loyalty to anyone who thinks we are expendable. Children need their fathers, and we need to be willing to fight to the death for our families. How we are remembered in the 2119 Project will depend on whether we answer the call to fight today.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-america-needs-truth-courage,2021-12-03
"Squires: Nothing would reduce crime in black neighborhoods more than family, faith, and fathers","Al Sharpton’s recent crime summit in Harlem is a needed reminder that a few more black faces in the statehouse are not nearly as important as a black father in his own house.

The longtime civil rights activist convened a meeting with Mayor Eric Adams, New York state Attorney General Letitia James, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and several other prominent black leaders in New York City and state politics to discuss violent crime and public safety.

Like many large cities, in New York, most homicide victims and perpetrators are black. Unfortunately, street crime is a lot less likely to end up as a topic of discussion on CNN than police misconduct, but the city is battling the perception that it is descending into a state of chaos and disorder. While the city’s 433 homicides in 2022 represented an 11% decrease from 2021, major crimes were up 23%.

No one wants to live in the New York of the 1990s, where murders topped 2,000, so I am hopeful that meeting will bear good fruit over time. One thing I can (almost) guarantee is that very little attention will be given to the role families play in preventing crime.

I know from personal experience. I worked for over a decade in local government in Washington, D.C., and the final year was spent in the city’s gun violence prevention office.

It was a new initiative that mobilized the entire government to address gun crimes from a public health perspective. Prevention and intervention were major priorities because the consensus from criminal justice experts was that you couldn’t arrest your way out of the problem. The people leading the efforts to calm tensions after a shooting or connect a formerly incarcerated resident to job training were dedicated to their communities.

But there was one glaring omission from the violence prevention ecosystem that complicated our work: parents and families.

No amount of planning and strategizing about gun violence will be successful if elected officials and their advisers ignore the role families play in socialization and values development. When a teenage boy shoots and kills one of his peers, the first adults who should be held accountable for his actions are his parents, not teachers or social workers.

This all-encompassing view of government has functioned as a cultural steroid for decades, deforming the body politic by increasing the power of elected officials and unelected bureaucrats while the American family has atrophied.

A 13-year-old in Washington, D.C., was recently shot and killed after being confronted by a homeowner at 4 a.m. The boy has been described by one local media outlet as “tampering” with cars in the neighborhood before he was shot. The death of a teenager is a tragic event, regardless of the circumstances, but several commenters online led with some variation of the statement, “Property is not worth taking the life of a teenager” instead of the more obvious observation: a 13-year-old should be in bed at 4 a.m., not out attempting to steal cars.

This is not blaming the victim. It is placing responsibility where it belongs. We would hold a police chief responsible if his officers regularly engaged in illegal conduct in the line of duty. We would hold a principal responsible if multiple teachers in her school were caught having illicit sexual relationships with students. In the same way, we should hold parents accountable for the behavior of their minor children.

Unfortunately, if there is one thing liberals – including black elected officials – are allergic to, it is the notion that black people should be held responsible for anything we think, say, or do.

This is why their answers to every social ill in black neighborhoods always start with more funding for social service programs. To these leaders, black people don’t act of our own free will. We’re controlled by past trauma, present discrimination, and the degree to which our material needs are met.

Far too many intellectuals and politicians on the left speak and act as if moral reasoning and emotional regulation are for white people.

A white man caught on tape using a racial slur in frustration during an altercation with a black man is an evil bigot. A black man who uses a gun to settle his disputes with another black man is the victim of systemic disinvestment in his community.

This is the hard bigotry of no expectations.

This worldview is the farthest thing from empowerment. Getting more black politicians in office is a win for the people who worship at the altar of “representation,"" but it provides no tangible benefits to the people who live in high-crime neighborhoods. This is why I’m not nearly as excited about the fact that the mayors of the nation’s four largest cities are all black as some people may be. If the state of black family life doesn’t improve, that historical first will only mean changing the color of the people who have assumed the role of “daddy” in many neighborhoods.



Elected officials can change laws and make policy, but aside from incarceration, they can’t prevent a person from committing a crime. What they can do is enforce the law and make it clear that antisocial, criminal behavior will not be tolerated. They can also encourage the formation of strong families consisting of a married father and mother raising their children in a loving, low-conflict home that improves the odds for positive social and emotional outcomes.

These are the types of homes that can start to reverse our crime trends. Nothing would shrink the footprint of police officers in black neighborhoods more than a resurgence of faith, family, and fathers. That might mean fewer brown faces in the halls of power for a period of time, but that’s a trade I am willing to make.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-americas-destroyers-want-to-convict-kyle-rittenhouse-for-defending-his-community-and-country,2023-01-11
Squires: Democrats love abortion the same way they loved slavery,"Abortion supporters across the country have been in full panic mode since Politico published a story claiming the Supreme Court has voted to strike down Roe v. Wade. The purported leaked draft majority opinion being written by Justice Samuel Alito in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization suggests there are already enough votes to send the issue of abortion back to the states, where some have instituted bans after six weeks (e.g. Texas) and others have made it legal up until birth (e.g. New York).



If this leaked document is a true reflection of the court’s coming decision, Americans should expect the most intense political battle in a generation. The reason is quite simple: Abortion is as important to Democrats in blue states today as slavery was to Democrats in Southern states prior to the Civil War.

What conservatives have been fighting for since Roe and the subsequent Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision in 1992 is a second abolitionist movement. It is just as much a fight between good and evil as the fight against chattel slavery that shaped our nation’s history, law, and culture.

Both chattel slavery and abortion deny the inherent dignity and worth of humans who are made in the image of God. Both view human beings as valuable only to the extent that they enrich the lives of their “owners,” who argue that they alone have the right to choose the fate of their property. Both rely heavily on euphemism to hide the barbarity of each practice – “peculiar institution” in the case of slavery and the “right to choose” and “reproductive justice” in the case of abortion. Both have abolitionists on one side facing off against absolutists who defend each institution with maximum ferocity as well as accommodationists who would rather not disturb the status quo.

Frederick Douglass, one of this nation’s most vocal critics of slavery, understood the role public opinion played in the justification of human rights violations. He stated, “Like all other great transgressions of the law of eternal rectitude, slavery thus produces an element in the popular and depraved moral sentiment favorable to its own existence.”

Douglass’ description of the depraved thinking required to justify chattel slavery is no different than what is needed to defend intentionally killing the unborn. Abortion abolitionists should expect absolutists to play every card in the deck, from accusations that Republicans want to turn women into breeders with no constitutional rights to claims that back-alley abortions will become the norm in post-Roe America.

Another predictable line of attack will be Democrats framing abortion restrictions as an attack on black women. Liberal politicians, journalists, entertainers, pundits, and even “pro-life pastors” typically seek to tear down any institution founded by a person with a documented history of racism, oppose disparities in social outcomes driven by public policy, and protest the destruction of black bodies.

Abortion is one of their few exceptions.

They would rather not discuss Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood and known eugenicist, or the fact that black women account for close to 40% of all abortions in this country. The people who take to the streets to chant “black lives matter” are the same ones who think fewer black children being killed in the womb is upholding “white supremacy.”

In 1862, one year before President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, Douglass asked the question, “What shall be done with the four million slaves if they are emancipated?”

Abortion abolitionists today should ask a similar question: “What shall be done with the babies if every one of them is given a chance to live?

The answer should be simple: Love and protect them. We should value children the same way their Creator does.

Our moral compass has been broken for so long that we forget the womb is where God’s creative powers are expressed most vividly. One Bible passage puts it this way: “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well.”

The complexity and intricacy of human life should inspire awe and reverence. Instead, it causes weeping and gnashing of teeth for members of an entire political movement that is terrified it might lose an invented right to kill innocent human beings based on their stage of development.

One thing that needs to accompany this abolitionist movement is a greater understanding of the importance marriage plays in the proper ordering of family formation and child-rearing. In a perfect world, America’s abortion rate would be among the lowest in the world because its marriage rate would be among the highest. Decades of social science demonstrate that children have the best outcomes when they are raised by their married biological parents in low-conflict homes.

Decades of feminist-inspired public policy and cultural norms have taught generations of Americans that marriage and children oppress women and keep them from their highest calling: participation in the workforce. Both men and women have accepted the idea that anything a woman does to make money – even selling her body to strangers – is more empowering than raising her own children and managing her own home.

That worldview is why over 60 million babies have been aborted since Roe.





Abortion abolitionists must move forward with moral clarity and realize there is no group more marginalized than the preborn. The people who want to maintain the “right” to literally tear babies limb from limb in the womb should never be allowed to claim the moral high ground. Democrats went from “safe, legal, and rare” to “shout your abortion!” in the span of a few election cycles. But this fight says more about our nation’s spiritual health than our political climate.



Abortion abolitionists believe children are a blessing from God whose lives deserve protection. Abortion absolutists see the children as burdens and opportunity costs based on whether they are wanted by their mothers. Those two beliefs cannot peacefully coexist in a nation that claims to trust God and fight for the vulnerable.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-black-men-in-my-generation-must-lead-the-battle-against-radfems-blm-and-the-groups-out-to-destroy-the-nuclear-family,2022-05-03
Adele Feminists Transphobia Controversy,"Adele is the latest celebrity to get caught up in the gender war that is raging in the West. The British singer made the following remark at a recent award show while accepting an award for a new “gender-neutral” artist of the year category:

“I understand why the name of this award has changed, but I really love being a woman and being a female artist. I do!”

Adele received applause from the audience, but that didn’t prevent critics online from accusing her of transphobia.

Her experience represents the dirtiest little secret in America’s political culture.

Feminists. Hate. Women.

This may sound hyperbolic and counterintuitive, but the use of terms like “birthing people,” “menstruator,” and “non-prostate owner” in the halls of Congress and corporate media outlets prove it every day. It’s hard to claim you care about a group of people when you deny their existence, reject everything that makes them unique, and refuse to advocate on their behalf.

The most salient example in the culture today is the feminist support of biological males competing in girls’ sports. Corporate sports media companies like ESPN, Fox Sports, and Deadspin rarely address this issue, and when they do, it is always to defend the men who demand access.

The same dynamic exists in every area of politics and culture. There is no area of American life that remains the exclusive province of biological females.

The mothers of today’s women’s liberation movement have prioritized confused sons over confident daughters. Their anthem has gone from the opening line of Helen Reddy’s liberation song to the opening line of a James Brown classic.

“I am woman, hear me roar” is out. “This is a man’s world” is in.

This reality hovers on the surface of every conversation about sex and gender identity, but the use of dehumanizing language from the champions of women’s rights reflects a much larger issue.

Feminism is doomed to failure because it is an ideology that claims to want equality for women while rejecting the things that make women unique.

Feminists confuse equality with sameness, which sends a signal to our entire society that the height of womanhood is thinking, speaking, and behaving like men.

The irony is that many of the social norms feminists have worked to undo have been exactly what men have desired for ages.

The clearest example is in all things related to sex. We live in an age when virgins are mocked and women who have casual sexual encounters with different men every weekend are celebrated.

This is one reason abortion is one of the central planks of the feminist movement. It allows women to have sex free of reproductive consequences, just like their male counterparts.

Feminists also sold women the lie that a high-powered career is a more worthy pursuit than staying at home to manage their own homes or teach their own children. This worldview is the source of a great deal of the conflict between men and women. It is also a source of the frustrations many women feel when they realize they neither have the time nor energy to have the perfect career and ideal home life.

This dynamic never goes in the opposite direction.

Most men don’t complain about the lack of representation in the social work or teaching professions. We don’t lead protests to integrate ladies’ night at the local bowling alley or to gain admission to women’s colleges. We don’t start movements to gain access to all-female spaces or mimic female speech patterns in the home when communicating with our children.

Those things don’t typically happen because most men value masculinity. Unfortunately, those who don’t are the favorite foot soldiers in the left’s war against manhood.

As is always the case in America, there is a racial component that complicates these dynamics even further.

One black transgender actor named Angelica Ross appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network and lectured a room full of black women about their “privilege” and role in perpetuating harm against trans women.

I imagine this may have been the first time these women have been accused of wielding privilege, but it definitely won’t be the last. In a world in which everyone is seen as either oppressed or an oppressor based on different aspects of their identity, a cisgender black woman will occupy a higher social station than any transwoman. That means the latter can demand more resources and opportunities at the expense of the former.

Let the intersectional Hunger Games begin.

Feminism is an ideology fueled by anti-identity. If the patriarchy says women should be protected, feminists reject chivalry as patronizing. If men argue for modesty, feminists argue for lewdness.

In some ways freedom is more difficult to manage than subjugation. Liberation becomes a more pernicious form of bondage when the purpose of our lives and the highest use of our bodies is to pursue our own interests, not to glorify God and reflect the beauty of His creation.

This is why a society is doomed to failure when it sees a woman who is married with children by 21 as oppressed, but a stripper or cam model of the same age as empowered.



The choice for women today is clear. They can align with the feminists who believe womanhood is a feeling that is impossible to define or with the traditionalists who value and cherish femininity. They can choose the women who prioritize the feelings and mental health needs of men who believe they were born in the wrong body or the men who believe women deserve their own spaces free from the intrusion of “prostate owners.”

This fight isn’t going anywhere. The left believes womanhood should be rejected. The right – for now – thinks it should be protected. The future of women is at stake. Either they will fight for their right to exist or succumb to the feminists who subconsciously believe men are better at everything – even at being women.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-crime-faith-family-fathers,2022-02-11
Squires: 'Media laundering' keeps the public misinformed and advances the left's dangerous plans,"The recent controversy over Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill demonstrates how the corporate press acts as a “media laundering” operation that “washes” unpopular ideas on behalf of activists, politicians, corporations, and entertainers on the left. On virtually every major issue, media outlets like MSNBC, the Washington Post, and the Atlantic shape and amplify the preferred narrative of the Democratic party.



The actual proposed legislation that awaits Governor Ron DeSantis’ signature is in reality called the “Parental Rights in Education” bill, but virtually no one outside his state would know that.

Media laundering is the reason.

To truly appreciate the scope of the operation, one must understand its foundation. Money laundering schemes make large amounts of money from illegal activities (e.g., drug trafficking) look like they come from a legitimate source through a three-step process of “placement,” “layering,” and “integration.”

Placement involves injecting dirty money into a bank or other legitimate financial institution. The next step, layering, involves concealing the source of the money through a series of financial transactions (e.g., large purchases, offshore transfers) to change its form and make it hard to follow. In the final step, integration, the laundered money is withdrawn from legitimate accounts to be used for whatever purpose the criminal has in mind.

Media laundering schemes work on similar principles. In the world of information, “introduction” is the insertion of a legitimate issue into discussions of politics and culture. The second step, “confusion,” involves concealing the source of an idea or the finer details of a particular issue through a series of rhetorical tricks. These range from emotional manipulation, euphemisms, and policing tone to ad hominem attacks and dodging legitimate questions. In the final step, “acceptance,” an approved position and accompanying narrative have been created for use by other journalists, politicians, entertainers, and other people who rely on the liberal media for information.

The power of media laundering is that once ideas have been “washed” and declared acceptable, the people behind the scheme can apply maximum pressure in every area of society to ensure conformity.

In Florida’s case, the most controversial part of its parental rights bill would prohibit classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for children in kindergarten through third grade or in higher grades in a way that is not developmentally appropriate according to state standards.

One reporter from the Associated Press announced the passage of the bill this way: “The Florida legislature has passed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to sign into law.” Headlines from other “mainstream” sources included the following.

Florida Just Passed The “Don’t Say Gay” Bill — Time

‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill passes Florida Senate — BBC News

Florida lawmakers pass ‘Don’t Say Gay’ — ABC News

Florida House passes ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill — NBC News

Florida House passes controversial “Don’t Say Gay” bill — CBS News

‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill passes in the Florida House — NPR

Instead of informing the public about the actual language in the bill and the issues animating the debate about it, the media acts like the press office for the left. The Democrats who have spent the last two weeks saying “gay” in TikTok videos and at rallies would much rather do that than clearly explain why schools need to teach 5-year-old children that some boys and girls are born in the wrong body.

Another issue involving children is Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s directive to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to investigate medical professionals and parents who enable a child’s “gender-transition” surgery. A district judge in Texas recently blocked DFPS from implementing this policy. Gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke answered a question from a teenage girl who wants to be put on testosterone by echoing her claim about the increase in suicide attempts by trans youth.

A functioning press would cover these issues honestly instead of putting its thumb on the scales of public opinion. People need to hear real questions and answers about such important matters of policy and social life.

If journalists and politicians on the left were forced to acknowledge that men can’t become women and vice versa, they would have to explain why medical treatments that sterilize adolescents and young adults should be seen as compassionate. They would never respond to a spike in adolescent anorexia by calling for medical professionals to prescribe appetite suppressants and gastric bypass surgery to teens.

When it comes to the issue of gender identity, however, they have made the public accept the idea that conflicts between perceptions of the mind and the reality of the body require the body to change. The net impact is that Americans are less informed about the substance of our most important political debates even though we have access to more information than at any other point in history.

Issues related to sexuality and gender identity are the clearest examples of media laundering, but the practice is much more common than most people realize.

The video of ESPN personality Michael Wilbon chastising Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant for his recent comments about COVID vaccine mandates in New York City perfectly captures the media’s role throughout the pandemic. The veteran journalist rebuked Durant for not telling his teammate Kyrie Irving to “put a shot in your arm” and claimed mayor Eric Adams doesn’t have time to attend to the needs of a basketball team.

What he didn’t do was inform the public that the vaccine does not prevent either infection nor transmission, unlike the vaccines he said Irving needed to take to attend school. He also didn’t say that given Irving’s age and occupation, he is at extremely low risk for serious injury or death from COVID. Wilbon also knows that the Nets reached out to Irving after several of their vaccinated players caught COVID in December and that New York’s current COVID policy allows Irving to attend home games but not play in them.

All of these are facts the public would expect trained journalists to raise in order to have a more informed discussion. Instead, Wilbon appealed to emotions by noting the COVID death toll.

ESPN, like most corporate media, has laundered the left’s preferred narratives on COVID for two years. This is why journalists have mocked people who said they wanted to do their own research on masks and vaccines. The attempt to get Joe Rogan kicked off Spotify demonstrates media laundering only works when the public is restricted to sources of information that have been approved by the ruling class.

The purpose of laundering, whether ideas or capital, is to avoid accountability. Criminals know that having to explain their source of income in a court of law could lead to a lifetime in prison. Ideologues know that their ideas – from destroying the nuclear family to Drag Queen Story Hour – would be extremely unpopular in the court of public opinion.



Subjecting people to unrelenting narratives untethered from the truth, whether about their risk of being killed by police or dying from a respiratory virus, is a form of cruel and unusual punishment. The people behind the media laundering schemes do it to create a fearful, docile, and obedient class of citizens who support whatever the people in power are promoting at any given minute. That is why the national press would never refer to a ban on abortions after six weeks as a “Don’t Kill Babies” bill.

We must be persistent in demanding answers to the most important questions of the day, especially when our children are involved. Media outlets like to paint themselves as a moral compass, but their schemes show they are just a cultural weathervane.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-democrats-love-abortion-the-same-way-they-loved-slavery,2022-03-15
Squires: America's leading voices on race are committing the ultimate betrayal of Dr. King's legacy,"Today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a holiday created to honor one of this country’s most important figures.

Dr. King worked to heal the country of its chronic illnesses of segregation and racial discrimination. His successors prefer to keep the body politic sick, often by fighting for some of the things he fought against.

They have betrayed his legacy.

Dr. King lived his life working to make America’s deeds live up to its creeds, whether by reciting parables from the Bible or quoting our founding documents. He spoke boldly about the immorality and hypocrisy of a nation founded on the equality of all men legalizing and normalizing the subjugation of some men based on skin color. His successors have adopted a much different agenda.

Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton share Dr. King’s roots in a church tradition that has always seen social activism and moral formation as intertwined.

They should have continued to fight against the things that hold black people back from fully reaping the benefits of a free and open society. Good leaders adapt to the times, so those fights might have been over public policy or self-destructive cultural practices.

Instead, they turned the civil rights movement into the racial grievance industry.

Subsequent generations have continued the downward trajectory. The movement used to be powered by people who believed in equality under the law. They fought so that skin color would not be a barrier to opportunities.

Now the movement is powered by people inking lucrative book deals and collecting millions in donations from middle-class black people, guilty white people, and Big Tech CEOs.

The worst part of this transformation isn’t the fact that activists have gotten rich; it’s that their ideas only improve their lives, not ours. They have a perverse incentive to paint America as a hopelessly racist country.

That is why I can’t imagine that someone like Dr. King, who fought so hard against racial injustice, would support Ibram X. Kendi’s belief that the only way to remedy past discrimination is present discrimination and the only way to remedy present discrimination is future discrimination.

I also can’t imagine that a man who was killed in the midst of organizing a multiracial “Poor People’s Campaign” would subscribe to characterizing black millionaires and billionaires as “oppressed” while berating white store clerks in Eastern Kentucky for their “privilege.”

Perhaps the most important difference between King and the leading social justice movements today is the foundation upon which their respective movements are built. King and his peers grounded their civil rights work in the Christian scriptures. Today’s activists have a very different foundation.

The women who started the Black Lives Matter organization are self-described Marxists whose guiding principles never mention God and whose protest movement is not connected in any way to the church.

This doesn’t mean they don’t have spiritual roots. Patrisse Cullors, one of BLM’s co-founders, said the following in reference to calling out the names of victims at protests:

“It is literally almost resurrecting a spirit so they can work through us to get the work that we need to get done.”

BLM is built on Marxist views of class conflict and the belief that the material world is all that matters. Its adherents don’t seek to answer the deep questions of right and wrong or good and evil. They speak in the language of resources and wealth, goods and equity.

King and his Christian followers had a belief in God that gave them hope. They believed love could overcome hatred. Today’s activists seem to be filled with anger and despair. They threaten violence when they feel they’ve been denied justice.

King’s activism produced optimism; BLM’s activism produces nihilism.

This is why it is so rare to find a happy radical.

Dr. King also differs from today’s activists because of his willingness to apply the same moral standards and loving critiques to African-Americans as to white people.

After committing to banishing discrimination and segregation from every aspect of American life, Dr. King said the following in a 1957 speech in Birmingham:

“And another thing, my friends, we kill each other too much. We cut up each other too much. There is something that we can do. We’ve got to go down in the quiet hour and think about this thing. We’ve got to lift our moral standards at every hand, at every point. You may not have a Ph.D. degree; you may not have an M.A. degree; you may not have an A.B. degree. But the great thing about life is that any man can be good, and honest, and ethical, and moral, and can have character.”

Black Democratic politicians, pundits, activists, and academics today would say this type of rhetoric promotes what they derisively call “respectability politics,” but Dr. King knew that you can’t demand someone treat you as priceless when you treat yourself as worthless.

Another lesson today’s activists should have learned from Dr. King is that the rejection of moderation often leads to more radicalism.

Is it any surprise that the Black Panthers would choose a more radical path after seeing the well-dressed, dignified black Christians marching for equal access to the ballot box and lunch counter met with police dogs and water hoses?

We are in danger of repeating that mistake.

The left thinks white Americans have benefited from centuries of unearned privilege, and they want to even the score. They work tirelessly — and pay Robin DiAngelo handsomely — to activate the racial consciousness of every white person in the country, whether their ancestors came here on the Mayflower or emigrated recently from Finland. Then they make white people the only racial group who can be attacked publicly.

The Daily Beast declares, “You Damn Karens Are Killing America.”

CNN claims, “There's nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man.”

The Root publishes a race tutorial on the “5 Types of ‘Becky.’”

White liberals love these types of headlines because they are burdened by race guilt. Their public self-flagellation is a purifying religious ritual. It grants them absolution from the sins of their ancestors and puts distance between themselves and the white people who are still ritually unclean.

But what does the left think comes next when they call every Republican – whether black or white – a white supremacist? They are summoning demons they will not be able to control.

Ethnic conflict and hatred are the rule, not exception, across human history. Wise leaders would heed this universal lesson, look to the past to show how far we have come as a nation, and correct course to avoid a future filled with tribal warfare.

Foolish leaders would continue to inflame racial tensions to further their political goals by explicitly apportioning government resources and cultural capital by race.

It is clear which types of leaders we have today. Our elected officials and leading race scribes think that discrimination under the guise of equity is progress. They are committing the ultimate act of betrayal of Dr. King’s legacy.

Our country has come very far. Unfortunately, the civil rights activists who lay claim to his mantle have fallen just as far. The NAACP of King’s day filed lawsuits to overturn Jim Crow laws across the South. Today’s NAACP fights to overturn pro-life laws in Texas.

The brightest minds of King’s generation worked tirelessly to push legislation that gave black people equality under the law. Now Michael Eric Dyson accuses black conservatives of being mouthpieces for white supremacy and Ben Crump rejoices because the term “master bedroom” is no longer used in real estate listings.

Both men claim America has failed to live up to Dr. King’s dream, but in reality they are the ones who betrayed his vision for the country.

This desperation is a sign that the demand for racism far exceeds the supply. That is a testament to the progress we have made on the issue of race.

Dr. King knew that racial discrimination was completely incompatible with biblical justice or America’s founding principles. He gave his life to eradicate racial hatred in pursuit of a better country for his children and grandchildren.



We are faced with the same task today. We have new challenges that he could never imagine, but we should heed his call to see our common humanity as more important than our skin color.

If we don’t, King’s dream will give way to a new national nightmare.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-feminists-hate-women-period,2022-01-17
Squires: The Buffalo shooting was motivated by race hatred — and the media response is motivated by outrage inequity,"The racially motivated shooting in a Buffalo supermarket was a heinous crime that has been condemned by Americans of every color, faith, and political stripe. The shooter, Payton Gendron, drove over three hours to launch his attack on a neighborhood that has the highest percentage of black residents in upstate New York. He surrendered to police and has pled “not guilty” to charges of first-degree murder.

As is often the case, the Buffalo massacre quickly ceased being about the innocent victims or the pain and grief their families are enduring. The main story morphed into the shooter’s political motivations and the degree to which he was influenced by political rhetoric around the “replacement theory” associated with conservative politicians and media personalities, including Tucker Carlson.

Gendron’s 180-page manifesto, which has been taken off the internet, reads like a tangled web of political positions on everything from gun control laws to “green nationalism.” He certainly does describe himself as a white supremacist. The problem is that our conversations around race have become so poisoned that “white supremacy” is also evidenced by the fact that black NBA players were cheered on by white fans one day after the shootings, according to Deadspin. The author of that column didn’t seem to question whether the 21 people shot in three incidents in downtown Milwaukee Friday night also weighed on the minds of Milwaukee Bucks players during Sunday’s game against the Boston Celtics.

If we can ask questions about the shooter’s motivations for his crime, we should also ask about our motives for highlighting certain types of senseless violence and ignoring others.

Doing so would reveal an ugly and uncomfortable truth: Our political culture is infected with “outrage inequity” when it comes to race, crime, and violence. The main symptom of this condition is the selective application of moral indignation and condemnation based on specific victim-perpetrator color combinations.

The left’s view of equity holds that social outcomes should roughly match population percentages. For example, if an urban school system is 25% black, white, Asian, and Hispanic, equity advocates would expect the students in gifted programs and specialized schools – two of a district’s most important resources – to have a similar mix of students.

A school system that was 90% black and Hispanic but produced gifted programs and specialized schools that were 90% white and only five percent black would have some serious explaining to do. Leaders of that school district would have to contend with accusations that they are only concerned about education when it involves white students.

One unfortunate reality the Buffalo shooting made clear is that similar inequities exist when it comes to the types of crimes that receive national attention. Certain politicians, pundits, entertainers, journalists, and corporations are only interested in crime stories that involve white perpetrators and black victims. They chant “black lives matter” with their lips, but their actions and selective outrage reveal a worldview more accurately described as “white suspects matter.”

There is an ugly history of lynchings, cross-burnings, firebombings, and targeted shootings that have been carried out to terrorize black communities and create a sense of fear among black citizens. Violence motivated by white supremacy should be swiftly condemned, and thankfully it is in today’s society.

The reason these crimes are evil isn’t because the perpetrators are white and the victims are black. They are evil because every human being is created in the image of God and murder is an affront against our Creator. This principle holds regardless of the ethnic backgrounds of everyone involved or the motivations of the killers.

We’ve lost the ability to say that, because we live in a country where even self-professed Christians subscribe to outrage inequity driven by ethnic partiality. Christians who believe all humans are guilty of sin – and in need of the same savior – should be the first ones to acknowledge that neither vice nor virtue is inherent to any one group. Too often, however, they engage in the same types of vague claims about support for white supremacy as their secular counterparts, who now accuse black conservatives of being closeted Klansmen.

Like Deadspin, they dilute the potency and power of “white supremacy” by applying it haphazardly to trivial matters. Their use of terms like “whiteness” as a catchall that encompasses everything from the nuclear family to self-reliance also makes hopes of productive racial dialogue and “racial reconciliation” impossible.

It also makes understanding any other type of hate crime extremely difficult. The provincial thinking of America’s leading race scribes can’t even compute a shooting in a Laguna Woods church carried out by a Chinese immigrant motivated by hatred toward Taiwan.

Outrage inequity isn’t just about murder. It is also what made a verbal dispute in New York involving a white woman and black birdwatcher into a national story drawing comparisons to Emmett Till. It also explains why Jussie Smollett’s hate hoax consumed so much media coverage, while the dozens of schoolchildren who are shot in Chicago each year receive none.



We cannot continue on this path.

We will never reach a state of outrage equity until we allow sympathy to flow to victims of violent crimes without regard for their ethnic identity. It is natural and humane to mourn when you hear about a person being cut down by gunfire while going about their daily life. That should be the case no matter what the victims look like.

Moving to a place of outrage equity will require the consistent application of ethical, moral, and legal standards to the analysis of violent crimes.

It is hard to take racial justice advocates seriously when their response to thousands of black victims of street crime each year is “defund the police,” while the response to the atrocious – but comparatively rare – incidents of racial violence is a call for anti-black hate crime legislation and new executive orders.

Outrage equity also means assessments of the role political rhetoric plays in a heinous crime should apply the same standard, whether the suspect parrots talking points about white genocide from David Duke or black genocide from Benjamin Crump.

Analyzing the motivations and root causes of violent criminals should also be done without regard to ethnicity or socioeconomic status. No longer can some perpetrators be cast as blameless victims of structural forces and historic oppression and others as moral agents driven by ethnic rage and privilege.

People notice that the same outlets that blame Republicans for Payton Gendron’s actions blamed Darrell Brooks’ SUV for killing six people and injuring 60 during a Christmas parade in Waukesha. Achieving outrage equity will require a single standard when attributing blame to inanimate objects involved in crimes.

Contrary to popular belief, the reason I bring so much attention to street crimes in our biggest cities has nothing to do with playing to a specific audience. I do it because homicide is the leading cause of death of young black men, and I don’t want another generation of black boys thinking that living past 25 is a major life accomplishment.

I’m also tired of the people who use legitimate tragedies involving innocent black victims to highlight white perpetrators, not tell the truth about protecting black lives. These individuals practice a pernicious form of ethnic partiality that disqualifies them from being the arbiters of moral authority they presume themselves to be.

I would say the same thing if a white conservative site only ran stories about child sex crimes involving black suspects, even though more than 85% of people charged for possessing child pornography are white. Questions about motive would be completely appropriate if the 3% of black child pornography suspects were also the focus of 95% of the larger conservative commentary in this area.

I wish both liberals and conservatives alike would focus on the victims of crime and their families. This is a much more humane, compassionate way to address these issues. Seeing victims of crime as pieces to be moved around a cultural chess board is a sign of a sick culture that places a higher value on political power than preserving life. This applies equally to the left and right.

Transformed hearts are what we need in this country today, not more entrenched tribal conflict. The cross of Christ gives us the perfect path. It is there that we see both the universal nature of sin and the only source of true reconciliation between God and man. I pray we find our way soon.

Squires: The black feminist entanglement with white liberals deliberately emasculates black men and undermines strong black families,"A recent op-ed in the New York Post that referred to confirmed Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown-Jackson, Vice President Kamala Harris, and other notable black women in business and entertainment raised eyebrows because of its provocative title: “Why more black women should consider marrying white men.”

The column acknowledged that the vast majority of married black people have black spouses, but argued that college-educated black women should expand their dating pool to increase their chances of getting married and avoid “dating down” within the black community.

The man who wrote the editorial, Ralph Richard Banks, is a law professor at Stanford and author of a book on declining black marriage rates entitled “Is Marriage for White People?” I share Banks’ concern about the social and economic impact of the decline in marriage and rise of nonmarital births in the black community since the 1960s.

I have also been perplexed by the political leaders, intellectuals, activists, and cultural influencers who claim to care about black people but refuse to publicly discuss the importance of marriage and family. Then I realized that the left rejects any prioritization of black nuclear families because doing so would be an act of political bigamy.

Why?

Contrary to what Ralph Richard Banks believes, black women have married white men in large numbers, just not in the way he proposes. The most significant political union of the past 30 years is the interracial marriage between black feminists and white liberals that now powers the modern Democratic Party.

This is a marriage of convenience, not love. Black feminists believe that unequal wealth distribution, systemic racism, and the perils of patriarchy are the main problems facing African-Americans today. Talking about marriage takes away from their main solutions: bigger government, better white people, and less toxic black men.

The first solution is why white liberals pursued this arrangement. Democrats typically look to grow the bureaucracy, and unmarried women with children are the key constituency for social welfare programs like Aid for Dependent Children (AFDC) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).

Nonmarital conception is also a driving force behind America’s abortion rates. Black women power the Democratic Party. They also account for close to 40% of abortions in this country. Organizations like Planned Parenthood that support the Democratic Party know that unmarried women account for the vast majority of abortions. They also know that a drastic decrease of out-of-wedlock births would do more to threaten the abortion industry that any anti-abortion law.

Joy Reid responded to a question I posed about whether human life has inherent value by asking me whether I believe women are just “broodmares"" for men to control (including rape) who should be forced into “'breeding kennels"" by the state. Her white liberal supporters cheered her on.

No one paused to think about how this type of worldview impacts society’s views about children, motherhood, and family. These are the same people who argue abortion laws that would lead to more black children being born are tools of white supremacy.

There is also a third partner in this marriage whose goals and dreams have been sacrificed on the altar of political expediency. These are the black men who, politically speaking, have been cuckolded by white liberals who refer to them as “my girlfriend’s husband.” They mind the house while the other two parties enjoy date night out on the town.

They are “gelded guys,” a pliable and obedient species. They think they have political power but are as beholden to parroting the talking points of their black female counterparts as the feminists are to obeying their white trans overlords. You can tell them by their incessant Twitter posts about “toxic masculinity” or how black women “saved” democracy in the 2020 election.

These are men like Michael Eric Dyson, who join fellow professors and feminists like Melissa Harris Perry and Brittney Cooper to mock people who think black fathers and intact families are needed for the black community to thrive.

Understanding this “entanglement” is one of the keys to making sense of the rapidly changing cultural norms around race, sexuality, and gender identity that are the main battle fronts of the culture war.

The only people who criticized Barack Obama – whether as a candidate or president – whenever he affirmed the importance of marriage, fathers, and family were black feminists, white liberals, and the black men allied with both groups. Their position changed when he was hailed by Newsweek as “The First Gay President” in an essay that explored his evolution on same-sex marriage.

Joe Biden will undoubtedly go down in history as the first “trans” president, and the same dynamic is again at play. Some of the most important figures in his gender evolution are black women like Rep. Cori Bush who have normalized terms like “birthing people,” submissive political wives like Jemele Hill who raise no objections as women are being erased from sports, and men like Marc Lamont Hill who think men can get pregnant.

The rise of Black Lives Matter is the perfect example of how this twisted relationship dynamic plays out in the real world.

The organization’s “Black Villages” principle — one of its original 13 – said the following:

“We are committed to disrupting the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and 'villages' that collectively care for one another, and especially “our” children to the degree that mothers, parents and children are comfortable.”

This principle alone should have disqualified BLM as a legitimate civil rights organization. White liberals in Hollywood, Big Tech, Fortune 500 companies, and elected officials responded by pouring millions into the organization and turning its leaders into celebrities and real estate moguls.

A functioning media would have asked Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza why a movement claiming to advocate on behalf of black Americans would ever commit to disrupting the nuclear family or abolishing the police. Instead, black journalists and social commentators like Roland Martin and Marc Lamont Hill allowed them to use the tragic deaths of black men to advance an agenda that served personal and political interests.

White liberals got Trump out of office, BLM made millions, and the country had the single largest increase in homicides (30%) in 60 years.

If there is anything the American public should have learned over the past few years, it’s the fact that open marriages do not work. Marriages are meant to be exclusive. Fighting for the black family will require a radical reorganization of priorities and a complete divorce from any leader, institution, or movement that believes children will do better in a society with greater access to mastectomies and mutilations than to married parents.



Studies show that social, emotional, and educational outcomes for children are best when they are raised by their married biological parents in low-conflict relationships. White liberals and black feminists have no problem with marriage. They just prefer to publicly promote women marrying the state rather than the fathers of their children.

I have no problem with black women who choose to marry white men or men of any other color. I would gladly take solid interracial marriages and nuclear families over the destructive political union that powers the Democratic Party. Unlike the Supreme Court decision that struck down anti-miscegenation laws in America, that marriage is not very loving.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-our-leading-race-scribes-are-committing-the-ultimate-betrayal-of-dr-king-s-legacy,2022-04-08
Squires: The real ‘American Taliban’ wages a war on children by promoting abortion and death culture,"There's a short video showing a British instructor explaining to an Afghan woman why she should appreciate an early 20th-century artist who turned a urinal into conceptual art. The scene epitomizes the failure of Western cultural imperialism.

It also reminded me that the left is engaged in a high-stakes conflict that it is winning: its all-out war on American children.

After Texas lawmakers recently passed a bill prohibiting abortion after a baby's heartbeat is detected, the phrase ""American Taliban"" trended across Twitter. It's hard to understand how the people who don't want babies dismembered in the womb would be seen as the backward theocrats while the people who would legalize abortion up until birth would be seen as caring and compassionate.

This development shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who understands that abortion — the intentional taking of innocent human life — is one of the left's most deeply held values. The Democratic Party paints itself as a pro-woman and pro-child coalition concerned for the marginalized and oppressed. Its legislative and cultural priorities reveal a very dark alternate reality. The truth is that the left hates women and children.



Like the immoral woman described in Proverbs, the lips of Nancy Pelosi's party drip honey and its speech is smoother than oil. It all sounds tempting until you realize it's a worldview that leads to death.

Abortion is the most obvious front of the left's war on children. There were over 600,000 abortions performed in 2018, according to the CDC. Democrats are quick to point out that most of the women having abortions are low-income and many are ethnic minorities. Both points are true. Apparently the party that decries the twin evils of capitalism and racism has no problem with fewer babies being born if they are poor and black. The party that boldly proclaims ""black lives matter"" while on a perpetual heat-seeking mission for any institution that honors bigots from the past has no issue with Margaret Sanger's racist views or the legacy of eugenics still seen in our nation's largest abortion provider. Planned Parenthood traces its roots back to Sanger's first birth control clinic in Brooklyn in 1917. To this day, about half of all black babies in New York City are killed in the womb before they draw their first breaths.

The left seethes with apoplectic rage whenever it feels abortion is being threatened, but it also has plans for the children who actually are born. Its first goal is to get the babies out of the arms of their mothers. They see women who stay home with their children as a step back in feminism's long march to turn women — in terms of priorities and temperament — into men who can give birth. Even though the research demonstrates the benefits of mothers staying home to care for their young children — something most Americans support — the left acts as if a woman has more value to her employer than to her own family. Part of the left's motivation is the knowledge that recruiting the next generation into its culture war requires thousands of hours of basic training.

That instruction starts in day care and moves to the school for some children as young as three. Once there, many kids are bombarded by teachers who have swapped a focus on reading, writing, and arithmetic for racial narcissism, activism, and protesting. Los Angeles teachers' union President Cecily Myart-Cruz recently admitted this when she claimed that it was fine if students didn't learn multiplication last year because now they know the words ""insurrection"" and ""coup,"" as well as the difference between a riot and a protest. She is not alone. The Chicago Teachers Union claimed, ""The push to reopen schools is rooted in sexism, racism, and misogyny."" The education establishment in this country has been hijacked by partisan advocates who could not care less whether our children are literate and numerate as long as they come out every election to vote for Democrats once they turn 18. They have no problem openly admitting that critical theory is more important to them than critical thinking. What's the result? Our children are not learning. There was a time when American children learned Latin in high school. Now most need remedial English in college.

American children face attacks on all sides, from their personhood in utero to their minds in the classroom. The last ten years have been marked by growing intensity on the gender identity battlefront. Democrats are completely on board with the notion that people — including school-aged children — can pick their gender. They would never encourage an anorexic teenage girl to get gastric bypass surgery, but when it comes to other intense feelings of conflict between mind and body, they promote the radical alteration of the body. What most people probably don't know is that John Money, the man who introduced the term ""gender identity,"" was a psychologist who was involved in the sex reassignment of a child named David Reimer in the 1960s. Money forced Reimer, who was raised as a girl, to perform sex acts with his twin brother while he photographed them. Both brothers committed suicide in their 30s.

The left hates your children. Democrats don't believe pre-born babies have inherent worth. They have no problem undermining parental authority if it means getting the opportunity to shape the minds and morals of the next generation of voters. Decades of research show children have the best outcomes when they are raised by their married biological parents. Yet it is easier to get an elected Democrat to promote pornography and sex work than to publicly affirm the role of marriage and the nuclear family in producing positive social outcomes.



Liberal ideology couldn't make Afghan women accept bathroom art as normal because the people in that country actually believe in something more important than superficial notions of identity. That may come as a surprise to American elites whose views are a mile wide and an inch deep. The quickness with which the Afghan government folded to the Taliban demonstrated that a small group of highly committed people can drive off a well-funded enemy who lacks the courage of its convictions. It's time for parents in this country to use their own weapons — prayer, petition, public pressure — to fight for what they hold most dear.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-outrage-equity,2021-09-03
"Squires: The War of the Worldviews is being waged in the schoolhouse, the big house — and your house","Increased partisanship in America has led commentators in recent years to wonder whether the country is heading for another Civil War or national divorce. While the threat of violent conflict remains low for now, the political rhetoric feels hotter than in recent memory.

America is in the midst of a cultural war of worldviews, and economist Thomas Sowell played the role of Paul Revere decades ago when he said, “There is a great deal of self-congratulation in some liberal circles because of all the things that have been done for blacks, but if you destroy the family, law and order, and education, there is nothing else you can do that will make up for it.”

The impact of liberalism on black families he described in the early '90s is being felt by all families today.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill this week that includes $70 million in funding to encourage responsible fatherhood and provide support to youth and families. Hall of Fame NFL head coach Tony Dungy spoke at the event and reminded his critics that President Obama talked about the importance of marriage and fatherhood during his administration. As is the case today, all of the criticism Obama received whenever he linked social outcomes to family structure came from his liberal allies who thought focusing on personal agency took attention away from needed systemic change.

This is why Democratic family policies are always about how much money the government spends to support households and never about the importance of marriage or the social, emotional, or economic benefits of the nuclear family. Democrats confuse benevolence with empowerment. The irony is that for all of its “Power to the People!” rhetoric and sloganeering and, the left is really about amassing power for the state.

People who rely on the government for food, shelter, and other basic needs are dependent, not empowered. Those who want to keep them in that dependent state do so in part because they know most people won’t vote to take bread off of their own tables.

Education is another area in which shared norms have given way to contentious partisanship. For decades, most parents of every race, ethnicity, and religion thought schools should teach the basics: reading, writing, and arithmetic. Some may have had complaints about the quality of their child’s school, but everyone agreed on the purpose. Today, the schoolhouse has been transformed into a political training center in the name of “equity.”

The creators of one curriculum funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation claim that “white supremacy culture” shows up in the classroom when students are required to show their work and the focus is on getting the right answer. Other school districts are teaching students that “all white people play a part in perpetuating systemic racism.” Race essentialism and obsession are only one part of the left’s indoctrination strategy.

The other is the introduction of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) ideology into the classroom. Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law – deceptively described as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill – clearly marks out the battle lines. The law’s supporters don’t believe young children should be exposed to content that discusses sexuality or gender identity. Its opponents responded by saying “gay” in every public venue, including the Oscars, and demanding the right to talk to children about the “Gender Unicorn” and personal pronouns.

The same radicalism can be seen in the rise and fall of the “defund the police” movement that captured the national stage after the death of George Floyd. Politicians, corporations, and corporate media outlets aided and abetted the breakdown of civil order in 2020 even as cities were burning and businesses were being destroyed. They believed Black Lives Matter was a legitimate organization with worthy goals and unknowingly linked themselves to a movement with leaders who wanted to abolish – not reform – the police.

The results were predictable. In a year in which most Americans spent months locked indoors, homicides spiked by 30% in 2020, the largest increase ever recorded in a single year. The same people who claim to care about black lives never take the time to even acknowledge that vast majority of murder victims in big cities like New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Baltimore are young black men.

The breakdown of social order Thomas Sowell described was preceded by an abandonment of God and elevation of the state. No issue makes this clearer than abortion. The left went from the party of “safe, legal, and rare” to the party of abortion up until birth. They have a visceral reaction to the thought of more babies being born that is equal parts hysterical and ghoulish. In some ways it makes sense. Control over life and death ultimately belongs to God. Taking away a woman’s ability to kill her offspring is an affront to those who believe in the power – and divinity – of women.

The two major parties show their priorities through the pen, the purse, and the pulpit. Democrats are no longer the party of the working class and labor unions. They are the party of the managerial elite. Their target audience is the UPS human resources director who mandates company-wide diversity, inclusion, and equity (DIE) training, not the drivers delivering packages.



The war of worldviews continues to rage. Republicans should follow the lead of Florida and continue to publicly advocate for the importance of faith, fathers, families, and freedom. Many won’t because they would rather be seen as respectable to people who despise their values than fight for the people who share them. This battle requires courage, not just rhetoric. Now is not the time for conservatives who think Drag Queen Story Hour is a “blessing of liberty,” criticize legislators for grilling a Supreme Court nominee on her leniency toward pedophiles, or argue that large corporations like Disney have a right to engage in political advocacy on the taxpayer’s dime. We’ve allowed cultural destruction to go on for too long. Now is the time to rebuild.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-the-black-feminist-entanglement-with-white-liberals-deliberately-emasculates-black-men-and-undermines-strong-black-families,2022-04-15
"Whitlock: Attitude explains Tyre Nichols' tragedy, not racism","The tragic death of Tyre Nichols raises the possibility that the conflict between law enforcement and black men has more to do with attitude than racism.



Nichols, a 29-year-old Memphis man, died 17 days ago after a violent encounter with five Memphis police officers. Video footage of that encounter is scheduled for public release today. People who have seen the body camera footage say it reminds them of the Rodney King tape.

King, of course, was brutally beaten by Los Angeles police officers in 1991 at the conclusion of a long police chase. King survived. The city of Los Angeles nearly didn’t. The 1992 acquittal of the officers who beat King set off six days of violent rioting in Los Angeles that left 63 people dead and more than 2,000 people injured. It took the Marines, Army, and National Guard to stop the rioting in Los Angeles.

Similar violence could beset Memphis this weekend. In fact, the Tyre Nichols video could spark nationwide rioting. Nichols could be George Floyd 2.0.

CNN sent Don Lemon to Memphis to fan the flames. Memphis’ police chief, Cerelyn Davis, is doing her part to hype unrest. She’s conducted multiple interviews that, in my opinion, are aimed at increasing maximum anger and hostility.

“You’re going to see acts that defy humanity,” she told Don Lemon.

According to reports, after a routine traffic stop, Nichols fled the scene. Police chased and/or searched for Nichols for seven minutes and then beat him up for three minutes.

The five police officers have been fired and charged with second-degree murder. Like Nichols, the five officers are young, black men. The oldest officer is 32. The youngest is 24.

Cerelyn Davis, the police chief, is a black woman. Her predecessor, Michael Rallings, was a black man. His predecessor, Toney Armstrong, was a black man.

The city of Memphis is 65% black and is beset with a troubling pattern of black men killing each other.

The case of Tyre Nichols tells a different story than the Rodney King case. King was black. The four officers tried for assaulting King were white. Corporate media framed the Rodney King case as an example of police misconduct fueled by racism.

Perhaps there’s a different common denominator in cases of police violence. Maybe the proper narrative focuses on attitude and frustration. Perhaps an attitude of resistance triggers lethal frustration among law enforcement.

Maybe people, regardless of color, who do not resist the commands and authority of law enforcement never trigger lethal frustration from police.

Let me add some critical context. I know exactly how the Tyre Nichols family feels. As I’ve shared previously, in 2012, my cousin, Anton Butler, was tasered to death by Indianapolis sheriffs in the storming rain. The sheriffs claimed he resisted arrest and forced them to use their Tasers.

I helped raise Anton. I bought him school clothes and Christmas gifts — read books with him. He, his brother, and cousins spent summers with me in Kansas City when they were children. I loved Anton. I paid for his funeral. I believe the sheriffs overreacted.

I also believe Anton made a mistake resisting their commands.

Policing is a frustrating, high-stress job. It’s a mistake to increase the stress and frustration of police officers. You can trigger them to combust.

As a man, I am primarily responsible for my safety — the government is not. My attitude toward law enforcement is to reduce stress. I’ve been pulled over for speeding numerous times. My attitude has created many warning tickets and no violence.

Too many young, black men have been programmed to hate and fear the police. The hate and fear spark resistance, which elevates frustration.









It’s tragic what happened to Tyre Nichols. It’s tragic what happened to my cousin, Anton. I will live with that painful memory for the rest of my life. His mama and brother live with that memory every day.

The frustration of law enforcement is not color-coded. Black and white officers feel the exact same frustration and lose control of themselves at the same rate.

We can’t keep doing the exact same things, expecting new results. How many cities must burn to the ground before we change the discussion about law enforcement and the black community?

I get why Ben Crump doesn’t want to change the discussion. Racializing these conflicts makes Crump rich. I get why Al Sharpton doesn’t want to change the discussion. Racializing these conflicts increases Sharpton’s popularity and relevance.

Crump is representing the Nichols family. Sharpton is flying into Memphis to officiate Nichols’ funeral. Don Lemon is in Memphis to document the inevitable looting and violence that will damage a predominantly black city.

Joe Biden and Democratic politicians will tell black voters that the racism of white conservatives caused five black police officers to kill a black man in a city totally controlled by Democrats.

It won’t cross anyone’s mind to analyze the mindset and attitudes of young, black men. We love to resist authority, and we think it’s acceptable that that resistance leads to deadly conflict.

Whitlock: Bigoted LeBron James promises DNC –Dead Negroes Confederacy – to remain silent on Emmett Till 2.0 murder,"Five years ago, LeBron James claimed a vandal spray-painted the N-word on the gate of his Brentwood, California, mansion.



At the time of the alleged incident, James and his family primarily resided in Cleveland, and James was in Oakland participating in the NBA Finals. James’ employees removed and painted over the racist graffiti before police arrived and could investigate.

Nevertheless, when discussing the “crime” from the NBA’s highest platform, James analogized what he and his family experienced to the mother of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old black boy murdered in Mississippi in 1955 for whistling at a white woman.

“It just goes to show that racism will always be a part of the world, a part of America,” James said at the 2017 NBA Finals. “And hate in America, especially for African-Americans, is living every day. And even though that it’s concealed most of the time, even though people hide their faces and will say things about you, and when they see you they smile in your face. It’s alive every single day.

“I think back to Emmett Till’s mom, actually. It’s kind of one of the first things I thought of. The reason that she had an open casket is because she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America. No matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in America is tough.”

Spray-painted graffiti that LeBron James and his family never personally saw made LeBron think of the pain Mamie Till felt over the murder of her teenage son.

James, in my opinion, was lying. The hate he whined about was a hoax intended to garner sympathy and elevate his brand as a social justice warrior. I believed that in 2017, and I believe it even more today, analyzing his reaction to the murder of Ethan Liming in the parking lot of James’ celebrated, Akron, Ohio, I Promise School.

Liming and his family have far more in common with Emmett and Mamie Till than LeBron James ever will.

Two weeks ago today, three men beat Liming, a 17-year-old honor-roll student, to death near an outdoor basketball court at I Promise School. Liming is white. His accused assailants are black.

Liming and three friends were joyriding in his car and shooting a water paintball gun. They stopped at I Promise School. Two of Liming’s friends – two black teenagers – got out of the car with the water gun and approached four men playing basketball. According to initial reports, Liming’s friends fired the water gun at the men. Three of the men chased Liming’s friends back to Liming’s car. Liming, a 6-foot-1 football and baseball player, stepped out of the car and tried to calm the situation. He was attacked. The three men beat him brutally. According to witness statements and the police report, the assailants punched and kicked Liming after he was knocked unconscious on the ground.

The assailants then allegedly prevented Liming’s friends from rushing him to a hospital. The assailants snatched one of the teenager’s cellphones as they tried to call for help, took Liming’s car keys, and moved his car to the opposite side of the parking lot. Liming’s third friend ran away from the scene and called police. When police arrived, Liming was dead. Approximately a week later, law enforcement arrested the three assailants. They’ve been charged with murder and sit in jail on $1 million bonds.

A quick recap: Two black kids shot a water paintball gun at four black men, sparking a confrontation outside a white kid’s car. The white kid attempted to calm the situation. Three black men beat him to death in the parking lot of the school fronted by a high-profile racial justice warrior, the Muhammad Ali of the 21st century.

Here’s what LeBron James has had to say about the incident:

“Our condolences goes out to the family who lost a loved one!! My the heavens above watch over you during this tragedy! Pray for our community!”

His heartfelt, grammatically challenged tweet included heart and crown emojis. There was no mention of Emmett or Mamie Till. No mention of racial hatred.

Five black kids got in a fight, and the white kid who initially acted as peacemaker got killed. What would LeBron tweet if a black child was brutally beaten by three white men at I Promise School?

He would analogize it to Emmett Till and compare 2022 America to 1955 America. What happened to Ethan Liming is similar to what happened to Till. Till was allegedly trying to amuse his friends when he whistled at Carolyn Bryant, a white shopkeeper. Days later, when told of the incident, Bryant’s husband turned a would-be harmless joke into a murder that rocked America.

The water-gun horseplay of Liming’s black friends sparked his murder. Deshawn Stafford, 20, Tyler Stafford, 19, and Donovan Jones, 21 – the accused assailants – turned a harmless prank into a murder that LeBron James and his media sychophants want to ignore.

LeBron wore a hoodie to protest the death of Trayvon Martin, a teenage boy in Sanford, Florida. LeBron ranted that black people are hunted every day after two white men shot Ahmaud Arbery. LeBron put a target on the back of a white Ohio police officer after he shot a teenage black girl who was attempting to stab a black woman.

LeBron has smoke for everyone white he believes wrongly takes a life. He has nothing substantive to say when black people take lives. LeBron James is a stereotypical bigot. Racial bigotry, of any stripe, is rooted in lust for power. The KKK terrorized black and white people who failed to support the racist policies of the Democratic Party. That’s not an opinion. It’s a historical fact.

LeBron is a political soldier for the Democratic Party. His bigotry is rooted in lust for political power. Democrats have painted their political opponents as bigots. It’s LeBron’s job to promote that narrative. He pounces on every high-profile opportunity, and he’s not above going the Jussie Smollett route and creating faux hate crime.

He analogized himself to Mamie Till at the behest of his political puppet masters. He will never address the family dysfunction and chaos that leads far too many black boys and men to settle conflict with deadly violence. The DNC – the Dead Negroes Confederacy – loves dead negroes. The DNC forbids its constituents to publicly discuss the pervasive violence that plagues black communities.



That issue is to be ignored until it magically disappears due to indifference.

LeBron is indifferent to the violence that killed Ethan Liming. LeBron, like many leftists, expects black men to randomly kill.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-the-war-of-the-worldviews-is-being-waged-in-the-schoolhouse-the-big-house-and-your-house,2022-06-16
Whitlock: Can Elon Musk save America from the new KKK: ‘black Twitter’?,"Ten days ago, when we learned that Elon Musk bought a 9% stake in Twitter, I argued that the richest man in the world could not save and/or transform the toxic platform.

Perhaps I was wrong. Early Monday morning, Musk posted on Twitter his SEC filing to purchase the social media app’s remaining 91 percent. He wants to take the company private. His intent is to save Twitter by making it a free-speech platform again.

I’m still unsure if Twitter can be saved. And I’m not comfortable with one man having so much influence over public discourse. But the news of Musk’s $43 billion takeover bid has me feeling a bit optimistic. Musk can’t make Twitter worse, can he?

The platform’s hostility to truth, amplification of secular values, and promotion of identity politics have undermined the principles that inspired American freedom and liberty. Twitter – not Donald Trump, the Proud Boys, or Tucker Carlson’s brilliant monologues – is the existential threat eroding our democracy by pushing us toward violent racial conflict.

“Black Twitter,” the informal community of users who allegedly represent the identity of black people, is the bane of American society. Black Twitter is the online version of the Ku Klux Klan, the enforcement arm of a racist Democratic Party political strategy that silences truth, dissent, and biblical values with Twitter lynch mobs.

There’s no difference between the old white KKK and the new black KKK. Both groups worked on behalf of the Democratic Party. They terrorized black and white people who did not support the agenda of the Democratic Party.

Black Twitter is the Luca Brasi of the BLM-LGBTQIA+ Alphabet Mafia. For those of you who have never seen ""The Godfather,"" Brasi was a notorious hit man for Don Corleone and the Corleone crime family. When a rival crime family tried to unseat the Corleone family, taking out Luca Brasi was seen as essential.

You can’t improve Twitter and amplify truth on the platform until black Twitter sleeps with the fishes.

If Musk is serious about limiting Twitter’s ability to harm free speech and freedom, he must discover a way to dismantle black Twitter.

Fear of black Twitter is at the root of corporate media lies and false narratives. The worst nightmare of everyone in corporate media is provoking a black Twitter mob to storm their mentions, burn a cross, and demand their firing. Media employees know their bosses will acquiesce to the demand rather than risk the same mob turning on them.

So a media employee with Christian values cannot publicly state that “all lives matter.” According to black Twitter, that statement is racist. Grant Napear, a longtime broadcaster for the Sacramento Kings, was forced to resign in 2020 after tweeting ALL LIVES MATTER.

According to the Bible, Napear’s statement was Christian, not racist.

But black Twitter’s negative influence extends far beyond sloganeering. Let’s evaluate things that have happened just in the past week.

NFL coaching legend Tony Dungy, a devout Christian, had to explain why he supported Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ $70-million initiative aimed at supporting fathers. Dungy was pictured with DeSantis at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' facility. DeSantis is a Republican. Black Twitter believes black men should not work with and/or associate with Republicans. Dungy has spent his life advocating for fathers. Dungy and DeSantis have shared values on the importance of fathers and nuclear families. Black Twitter believes black people should ignore their biblical values or prioritize them below political power.

Tuesday, San Francisco Giants first-base coach Antoan Richardson, who is black, claimed that a white coach on the opposing team referred to him as a “motherf—er” and that it reeked of racism.

“I say this because his words were disproportionately unwarranted and reeked of undertones of racism when he referred to me as ‘that motherf–er,’ as if to be controlled or a piece of property or enslaved. I think it’s just really important we understand what happened tonight.”

Profanity and name-calling are commonplace in sports. Twitter has conditioned black people to see all engagement with white people as an outgrowth of slavery and racism. Antoan Richardson has been radicalized.

The same, albeit more extreme, radicalization process is at the heart of the violent and terroristic behavior of Frank James, the suspected New York subway shooter. James is a different version of Darrell Brooks, the Waukesha mass murderer. Twitter and other social media apps promote the notion that America hasn’t changed since the 1850s. James and Brooks have been convinced they’re Nat Turner, violently emancipating black people from oppression. Black Twitter rewards people for analogizing 2020 America to 1619 America. That’s why Brian Flores and Colin Kaepernick believe the NFL operates like a slave plantation. Black Twitter rewards this kind of idiocy.

It also argues that black men have every right to violently resist arrest and put themselves in position for a police officer to overreact and make a deadly mistake. Black Twitter will demand that we shout Patrick Lyoya’s name rather than learn something from his encounter with police. Lyoya is the Congolese immigrant shot and killed by a Grand Rapids, Michigan, cop after a struggle.

Lyoya wrestled with a cop and apparently tried to grab the officer’s taser before being shot while pinned to the ground. You can make the argument the police officer overreacted. But you can make a much stronger argument that it’s foolish to wrestle with a cop and reach for his weapon. Black Twitter won’t allow us to make that argument.

Neither will it allow us to have an honest discussion about the actions that led to NFL quarterback Dwayne Haskins’ tragic death. When black men die, black Twitter demands that we worship them and never critically evaluate their actions.



Black Twitter believes only the actions of white men matter. Everyone else is nothing more than a potential victim of the actions of white men. That worldview is inconsistent with a biblical worldview. That worldview emasculates every man who isn’t white. That’s why I call black Twitter the black KKK.

Both groups are dedicated to emasculating black men at the behest of the Democratic Party.

Here’s hoping Elon Musk, a white African, can save America from the KKK.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-attitude-explains-tyre-nichols-tragedy-not-racism,2022-04-14
"Whitlock: 'Chill pill' New York subway assault exposes the weakness of men, the foolishness of women, and the strength of the racial grievance industry","There's a twitter feed: @libsoftiktok. Its bio states: ""Showing how society is deteriorating through videos."" The feed launched approximately one year ago. It has nearly 370,000 followers.

Libs of TikTok is the predictable reaction to the 2020 Summer of George Floyd, the ""Karen"" videos, and the past decade of viral social media videos second-guessing police-involved shootings of black suspects by white cops.

Influencers such as Shaun King and DeRay McKesson built followings and raised money popularizing the belief that white police officers were wildly, randomly, and frequently killing unarmed black men. Corporate media outlets played along with the ruse because it increased ratings, clicks, and relevancy. Young journalists such as Wesley Lowery rode the ruse to a Pulitzer Prize while at the Washington Post and then parlayed that notoriety into a lucrative TV job at CBS Evening News. Colin Kaepernick rebranded from NFL flop to social justice martyr. LeBron James cast himself as the inarticulate Muhammad Ali. Working in conjunction with Black Lives Matter, the Democratic Party raised funds, terrorized major cities, mobilized voters, weaponized poll workers, defunded and demoralized the police.

For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Social media's racial grievance industry has finally spawned a clever white rebuttal — Libs of TikTok.

Among many other things, the feed showcases instances of bad behavior by black Karens or Kendricks. Here's a video of a Rutgers University professor going on a racist rant for five minutes. The professor is a garden-variety Stacey Abrams.

But here's a more interesting video. It shows an ugly incident on a New York subway. A black man punches a white woman for using the phrase ""chill pill."" You should watch the whole video. It's both sickening and fascinating. The violence is sickening. The reaction to it is fascinating.

No one reacted. Women didn't move to check to see if the woman was harmed. Men didn't move to defend the woman. Everyone froze and watched.

The most prevalent response on Twitter was to blast the men for not coming to the woman's defense. That was my gut reaction. And then I thought about what I would do in that situation. On my podcast and in these columns, I spend a lot of time talking about the need for men to be bold, fearless, and masculine.

What would I have done on a crowded subway had I witnessed a deranged bully confront a woman and then strike her for saying he needed to take a ""chill pill""?

If the woman were a friend or relative, I know exactly what I would have done. I would have struck the man and dealt with the consequences, whatever they were. But what if the woman were a stranger, a damsel in distress?

I can't confidently say I would have reacted. Not in 2021. Twenty years ago, I would at the very least have moved to restrain the man until the police arrived. Now I have no confidence that the police will arrive. My perception of New York is that the city is lawless. Mayor Bill de Blasio has taken drastic measures to limit the authority and prevalence of law enforcement. Many major cities have done likewise.

Corporate media and social media champion black criminal suspects. By defending a white woman from the attack of a black suspect, any man, whether white or black, runs the risk of being vilified and harassed.

A year ago, a white cop shot a black girl as she tried to stab another black girl. The cop was demonized. LeBron James sent a menacing tweet that targeted the police officer.

The left has established a culture that works against men defending women. The culture is double-edged. The victim of the subway attack has bought into the new culture, too. She believed there was upside in verbally confronting a deranged male nutjob. I'm not blaming the victim. She's a victim. I just happen to believe 20 years ago she would've turned away from the male nutjob.



I feel sorry for the woman. I feel sorry for all of us. We're hostages to a society dominated by illogic, dishonesty, and racial grievance. The system is rigged for men to be weak, women to be foolish, and nonstop racial conflict.

We're rigged for self-destruction.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-bigoted-lebron-james,2021-10-28
Whitlock: CNN+ another casualty of Donald Trump’s ‘Dead Dems Society’,"The left needs Donald Trump more than we do. That’s the takeaway from the rapid and shocking collapse of CNN+, the stillborn streaming service Cable News Network birthed three weeks ago and pronounced dead on Thursday.



Donald Trump is the sun that fuels the left. He is the source of their energy, the god they worship, the justification for their retention of power, the wind beneath their wings.

The left needs President Trump far more than we do.

Let me define my use of the word “we.” It represents those of us who are grateful to live in the most free, most fair, and most successful country on the planet. It represents those of us who recognize that our founding documents, the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence, were biblically inspired and have been the force rooting out the unfairness of man’s nature.

My use of the word “we” in this instance isn’t intended to be politically partisan. It does not connote the political right. It signifies people in their right minds, people who are rational, objective, and believers in truth. We no longer need Donald Trump.

That is not written to denigrate and/or criticize America’s 45th president. It’s written to convey how far we’ve come and what he taught us. There was clearly a time, even if some of us failed to recognize it, that we desperately needed President Trump. We needed him to open our eyes to the depth and pervasiveness of America’s political corruption. We needed him to expose corporate media’s hostility toward the average American. We needed him to inspire us to stand up to the establishment.

Donald Trump was actor Robin Williams in the movie ""Dead Poets Society,"" the eccentric teacher shouting “carpe diem” to teenagers who couldn’t resist the force of his personality. At the film's climax, Williams’ character, teacher John Keating, was wrongfully blamed for the suicide of one his students, Neil Perry. Perry’s parents forced the school to fire Keating, devastating the flock of boys inspired by Keating’s teachings. The boys staged an impromptu classroom insurrection, shouting “O captain! My captain!” when Keating briefly returned to class to collect his belongings.

Donald Trump is the star of ""Dead Dems Society."" His final lesson focused on election integrity. It reached its climax on January 6, when the establishment assassinated Ashli Babbitt for shouting “O captain! My captain!” inside the Capitol. The establishment blames Trump for Babbitt’s death. The truth is that corrupt politicians put Babbitt in harm’s way and an inept cop acted incompetently.

My point is we have graduated from Welton Academy, the fictional prep school in ""Dead Poets Society."" Keating taught his students well. He sent arrows into the world. His students no longer needed him. They knew how to seize the day.

That’s where we are with Donald Trump. We know what to do. The left doesn’t. The left is collapsing now that it is being forced to live without orbiting around Trump, the source of its power.

“Everybody profited from the ratings and the clicks with the anti-Trump vitriol,” Fox News media expert Joe Concha told me. “And now that Trump is gone, everybody’s struggling.”

Everybody on the left. CNN+ folded. Netflix is hemorrhaging subscribers. Spotify declined to renew its deal with the Obamas. MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow suddenly only wants to host her show once a week. Comedian Bill Maher now regularly cracks just as many jokes on liberals as conservatives. Jack Dorsey gave up his Twitter CEO chair, is a critic of the Twitter board, and claims CNN was staging conflict in Ferguson, Missouri, during the Michael Brown controversy.

When the left has to actually defend its agenda rather than just shout “Trump,” its insanity takes center stage.

Disney is insane. The California-based company wants to dictate political policy in Florida. The Sunshine State enacted a law prohibiting teachers from teaching sexuality and gender to kindergartners through third grade. It’s a rational law. It empowers parents, leaving them as the primary “groomers” of their kids. Disney joined the leftists fighting against the law and the empowerment of parents.

Disney and the left want public schoolteachers to groom the sexuality and gender of 5-year-olds.

The absence of Trump from the White House makes the left’s agenda the star of the reality show corporate media broadcasts. The show is an absolute train wreck. It’s satanic.

The left’s “Defund the Police” sitcom has led to a dramatic increase in crime and violence. It has now turned extreme leftists against their political allies. New York City Mayor Eric Adams is engaged in a feud with Black Lives Matter. Adams has recently criticized BLM for ignoring the deaths of black people not killed by police.

Hank Newsome, the head of BLM New York, called Adams, who is black, a “white man in blackface.”

Now that they can’t fight Trump, the left is fighting each other. The modern left isn’t about building back better. It’s about tearing down everything in sight.

The left needs Donald Trump back in the White House more than we do. His existence on the political stage lets Democrats pretend they’re a force for good. Without Trump, all the Democrats have left is climate change. Speculating about Mother Nature isn’t nearly as profitable or interesting as calling Trump the next Adolf Hitler.



""Don’t Look Up,"" the Leonardo DiCaprio-fronted climate-change movie, couldn’t bail out Netflix.

""Dead Dems Society"" is still America’s No. 1 movie.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-can-elon-musk-save-america-from-the-new-kkk-black-twitter,2022-04-22
"Whitlock: For Deion Sanders, the road to Damascus starts with an apology. For black people, it begins with less worry over the actions of white people.","Deion Sanders says he was joking Tuesday when he ended an interview abruptly because a newspaper reporter repeatedly called him ""Deion.""



If so, the NFL legend-turned-Jackson State University head coach cracked a bad joke at the SWAC football media day. He created the impression that the white reporter disrespected him because of his black race.

The reporter, Nick Suss of Mississippi's Clarion Ledger newspaper, finds himself embroiled in a social media storm he did not create. Deion's ""joke"" has made Suss' job much more difficult. Twenty-four hours ago, Suss begged people on Twitter to ""please stop tweeting about me."" He knows he can't win this battle. A white man from Mississippi has little chance of surviving a racial conflict adjudicated via social media.

This is Suss' ""Mississippi Burning"" nightmare. Only Deion can put out the fire.



Here's what happened. Sanders specifically called for Nick Suss to ask him a question.

""Let me get Nick, let me get Nick. Nick is a good guy,"" Sanders began the exchange.

Suss responded, ""Hey, Deion, just wondering if you could.""

Sanders cut him off: ""Hold on, let's back up a little bit. You don't call Nick Saban Nick. Don't call me Deion now. ""

""I call Nick Saban Nick,"" Suss politely fired back. ""I call you Deion.""

Deion would not relent: ""No, you don't. No, you don't. That's a lie. If you call Nick Saban Nick, you know you'll get cussed out on the spot. So don't do me like that. Treat me like Nick.""

Sanders smiled and then began to laugh. ""OK, Deion,"" Suss retorted and began to smile and laugh, too. Sanders stood up and walked out of the interview.

Reporters immediately tweeted about the incident. The Clarion Ledger wrote a news story covering the exchange. Six hours later, Sanders released a video showing his interaction with Suss and ending it with a video of Sanders dancing to the mid-2000s rap song ""Walk It Out.""

Now for the rest of the story.

On Monday, the Clarion Ledger published a story focusing on the domestic violence legal entanglements of Jackson State's top 2021 recruit, four-star wide receiver Quaydarius Davis. He's the highest-rated recruit in Jackson State history. He originally committed to the University of Kansas. Kansas cut ties with Davis in late March when a friend of Davis' alleged victim posted two pictures of her in a hospital room allegedly recovering from injuries.

Deion is upset with the Clarion Ledger. Nick Suss is collateral damage.

Reporters, black and white, routinely call coaches by their first name. Heck, race-bait queen Jemele Hill even tweeted out that she covered Nick Saban and Tom Izzo at Michigan State and referred to them by their first names in interviews.

Deion assassinated Suss' character because he's mad at Suss' employer.

This is un-Christian. Sanders is a believer. He's a flawed believer like the rest of us. I am a Deion Sanders fan. I love the work he's doing and the attention he's bringing to historically black colleges and universities. Deion is well-intentioned.

The road to hell and the road to Damascus are both paved with good intentions. In this instance, Deion needs to change course and head toward Damascus. He owes Suss an apology. He can't write this off as a joke gone bad. It's a bad joke that leaves Suss damaged.

As black people, we waste way too much energy interpreting the actions of white people and too little time evaluating our own. We foolishly believe their actions are more important than our actions. We've anointed them our gods.

Did he call me by my first name out of disrespect or because he's familiar with me?

A couple of months ago, my best friend from high school's son, an 18-year-old, called me Jason in a text message. We were communicating about his graduation gift. I corrected him and said, ""Call me Mr. Whitlock.""



He apologized and explained that he's so used to hearing his dad and mom talk about Jason that that was all he could think to call me. The kid is black. His whole family is black. Sometimes people get so familiar with you that it's natural for them to become informal.

It happens to public figures. Reporters think they know the coaches they cover. When I worked in Kansas City, we called Marty Schottenheimer Marty and Roy Williams Roy. I haven't lived in KC in a decade, I call Andy Reid Andy or Big Red.

Deion knows all this. He's angry at a newspaper and so he gave into what's popular on social media — race bait. He fired an unfair shot at a harmless, well-intentioned reporter.

The road to Damascus is just an apology away.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-chill-pill-new-york-subway-assault-exposes-the-weakness-of-men-the-foolishness-of-women-and-the-strength-of-the-racial-grievance-industry,2021-07-21
"Whitlock: Kanye West remains dangerous, disgusting, and harmful to demonic leftists","Kanye West is not as confusing as he often sounds. His outlook on life stems from a defined set of values spelled out in the Bible. His actions and words often conflict with his outlook.



He’s normal. Every human being struggles to align their values and deeds. The difference between West and most human beings is the transparency of his failures.

Yesterday, West sat down for an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The 45-year-old rapper, fashion designer, and provocateur was his usual mix of brilliance, confusion, contradiction, and oddity. When asked how people respond to a baby ultrasound lanyard he wears, West proclaimed his faith.

“I don’t care about people’s responses,” he said. “I care about the fact that there’s more black babies being aborted than born in New York City at this point, that 50 percent of black death in America is abortion. So I really don’t care about people’s responses. I perform for an audience of one, and that’s God.”

It was a brilliant and courageous answer, especially for a Hollywood celebrity. We’ve come to expect that from West.

Earlier this week, at a fashion show in Paris, West and gal pal Candace Owens donned T-shirts emblazoned with the words “White Lives Matter.”

The shirts mocked the Black Lives Matter movement. Via Instagram, Kanye called BLM a “scam.” Owens has a documentary set to release in five days – ""The Greatest Lie Ever Told"" – that is expected to further expose BLM’s financial malfeasance and LGBTQ agenda.

Kanye is drumming up attention for Owens’ takedown of BLM. The progressive establishment, the globalists using race to divide, conquer, and queer America, are frustrated by their inability to control “Kunta Kinte” West. Adidas is threatening to dissolve its long-standing partnership with West. Corporate media outlets dispatched their legion of race police to publicly flog West for affirming the value of white life. Rolling Stone complained that the shirts legitimized extremism. A potpourri of black intellectuals deemed the shirts disgusting, harmful, and dangerous.

West did not back away from the controversy in his conversation with Carlson. He said he acted on a “gut instinct.” He then oddly analogized the stunt to disgraced Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding.

That’s classic Kanye West. He contradicts. He produces an album titled ""Jesus Is King"" and then collaborates with Lil Nas X on the song and video “Industry Baby,” which depicts gay prison sex.

West, like most of us, serves God and the world. The pull of the world is much stronger for West. He’s one of the world’s biggest celebrities. The success of his music and fashion depend on public opinion and popularity. He succumbs to those pressures.

Fame is an intoxicating and destructive drug. Kanye is battling his addiction to it with biblical faith. I respect the sincerity of his fight. He truly values family and being a good father. He wants to see black Americans improve our plight. He believes in the power of truth.

His comments related to abortion and the normalization of obesity – “it’s actually clinically unhealthy. And for people to promote that, it’s demonic” – reveal a deeper understanding of the cultural rot destroying America.



We’re in a battle of good vs. evil. Kanye is one of the good guys. He’s trying to be on the right side of God rather than the history left-wing atheists plan to write.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-cnn-plus-another-casualty-of-donald-trumps-dead-dems-society,2022-10-07
Whitlock: Lia Thomas’ swimming title repulses and alarms people who are ‘lie-phobic’,"Lia Thomas, the male swimmer competing at the NCAA women’s national championship, is just another log on the fire of lies engulfing America.



According to the headlines, Thomas made history Thursday night, winning the 500 freestyle by nearly two seconds, becoming the first transgender woman to win a Division I national title.

If you object to this obscenity, corporate and social media argue that you do so out of fear of Thomas and other transgenders. Sally Jenkins of the Washington Post articulated the prevailing sentiment Thursday morning, writing:

“To exclude trans athletes from elite competition, out of our own constricting fears and uncertainty, is wrong, harmfully so.”

See, you’re transphobic. You have an “aversion or hostility to, disdain for, or fear of transgender people.”

I don’t fear Lia Thomas. I have no aversion to, hostility toward, or disdain for him. There are those of us who are lie-phobic. We have an aversion and hostility to, disdain for, and fear of lies, particularly falsities codified into culture, rules, and law.

We see an avalanche of lies transforming our once great nation into the United States of Lies and Chaos. We see the uprooting of truth and the empowerment of falsehoods as the climate change that will destroy the planet.

Lia Thomas has no business swimming against women. He has a penis. He spent his first 20 years on this planet living and competing as a man. Despite two years of hormone treatment, he has the shoulders, size, and build of a man. His reduced testosterone level doesn’t qualify him for womanhood. God hands out those qualifications inside the womb. We recognize those credentials on a birth certificate.

There are those of us who still believe man’s ""science"" does not trump God’s truth.

I harbor no ill will toward Lia Thomas. He is a pawn being used in the devil’s game of deception. My animus is saved for Satan’s collaborators: the atheists, agnostics, and so-called Christians who helped build the inferno of lies Thomas just joined. America’s coalition of liars touches every demographic, every faith, and every political faction.

America can’t reject the Lia Thomas lie because we’ve swallowed too many of the others:

January 6 was an insurrection comparable to Pearl Harbor and 9/11.

Police are killing black men so randomly that black people should live in fear of routine traffic stops.

America was founded in 1619, when it enslaved its first black person.

Securing our southern border is racist.

The N-word is a harmless term of endearment when used by black people.

The Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution are invalid and irredeemably racist because our Founding Fathers owned slaves.

George Floyd is a hero worthy of memorials and monuments.

Marriage between a man and a woman is no different from marriage between two people of the same sex.

Obese women (and men) are perfectly healthy.

Abortion isn’t murder or immoral. It’s proof women are equal.

Masks stop the spread of COVID.

No, wait, experimental medical trials (vaccines) stop the spread of COVID.

Colin Kaepernick and LeBron James are bright public intellectuals sincerely challenging the establishment’s racism.

Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler.

No, wait, Vladimir Putin is Adolf Hitler.

America is a smorgasbord of lies. White lies. Black lies. Brown lies. Gender lies. Political lies. Racial lies. The lies make chaos and division inevitable. Our fear and reluctance to confront and combat these lies doom this nation.

Lia Thomas isn’t the problem. His gender dysphoria is not new. There have been men who felt like women since the beginning of time. The rest of us are the problem. Rather than treat Thomas’ dysphoria, we have chosen to adopt it as our own, normalize it, and build a world obedient to feelings over truth.

A children’s hospital in Portland has issued an instruction manual for young boys on how to tuck their penises. Citigroup, the banking conglomerate, announced it will pay the travel expenses for employees seeking out-of-state abortions.

The United States of Lies supports and financially rewards immorality. People who object to and/or warn that the tsunami of lies will be our undoing are demonized and punished. So most of us play along. We suffer in silence, hoping the insanity will reach a level of absurdity that erases the legitimacy of all of it.

We underestimate the strength of the ties that bind America’s coalition of liars. Lying to yourself is similar to pregnancy. You can’t be a little bit deceitful. One lie leads to the acceptance of the next lie.

Nikole Hannah-Jones, the author of the New York Times' 1619 Project, cannot speak against the Lia Thomas lie because she knows that could make the LGBTQ+ crowd challenge her 1619 lie.

You follow? The liars have to stick together.

A Black Lives Matter supporter can’t publicly question the sanity of allowing illegal immigrants to flood our southern border because he or she fears scrutiny of the sanity of BLM.



Reverend Al Sharpton can’t criticize same-sex marriage. Race hustlers and sexuality hustlers formed an alliance 60 years ago. Sharpton must support COVID and mask hysteria. His lies force him to embrace their lies. He joined NATO for liars.

It’s likely you did, too. Thinking it would bring peace, you probably jumped on board with same-sex marriage, or the myth that Jan. 6 was a horrifying, deadly conflict between police and white supremacists, or that George Floyd played no role in his own death, or there’s nothing wrong with black people calling each other the N-word.

Lies do not promote or deliver peace. They foment disorder. Lia Thomas is out of order because we’ve ingested a buffet of lies for far too long.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-for-deion-sanders-the-road-to-damascus-starts-with-an-apology-for-black-people-it-begins-with-less-worry-over-the-actions-of-white-people,2022-03-18
Whitlock: Maria Taylor is waiting to exhale while ESPN and the rest of America can’t breathe,"ESPN's mission statement is ""to serve sports fans in the community. Anytime. Anywhere.""

Over the past decade, the self-proclaimed ""Worldwide Leader in Sports"" has been forced to deviate from its mission. Its mission statement unofficially became ""to serve liberal sports fans in every community. Anytime. Anywhere.""

The Maria Taylor-Rachel Nichols controversy will spark a different ESPN mission statement. ""To serve angry and easily offended black women in every community. Anytime. Anywhere.""

I know I'm not supposed to say that. I'm supposed to shout ""Yass queen"" and pretend that Taylor's fight for an $8 million-a-year contract is the equivalent of Rosa Parks refusing to take a back seat on a bus.

Sorry, I'm not going to tell that lie. We can't construct a country and a workplace culture centered around satiating the egos, emotions, and economic demands of women or people who claim to be offended by everything.

America promises freedom and opportunity. America does not promise its citizens freedom from offense. That's a make-believe utopian world created and promoted by Marxists determined to cast America as the most evil place on earth.



In her bid to improve her contract leverage, Taylor and her enablers are casting ESPN as one of America's most racist work cultures. Because Nichols asserted that Taylor's dark skin contributed to Taylor getting a job promised to Nichols, Taylor, the National Association of Black Journalists, a Los Angeles Times columnist, and many others are pretending Bristol, Connecticut, is Mississippi Burning.

It's not true. I worked at ESPN twice. ESPN is not hostile to black employees. It's hostile to employees who don't toe the Democratic Party political line.

In 2017, I wrote a column for the Wall Street Journal spelling out how the radical website Deadspin bullied ESPN to adopt a far-left bias. Here's a short excerpt from my piece. You can read the whole thing here.

Deadspin significantly elevated the price of implementing change at ESPN. The often-caustic blog mastered search-engine optimization and Twitter's ability to gin up faux outrage. Its writers trolled ESPN talent and executives, getting plenty of attention along the way. The site particularly delighted in exposing alleged sexual malfeasance among ESPN employees.

Deadspin's bullying of ESPN happened between 2007 and 2015. By the time of my WSJ piece, Deadspin had justifiably declared victory over the Worldwide Leader. In 2016, Deadspin expat Kevin Draper, now the New York Times' sports media reporter, wrote a post celebrating ESPN's progressive agenda and point of view.

Sports fans were far less enthusiastic. ESPN's ratings dipped at a rate that couldn't be explained solely by cable-cutting. Rebel bloggers such as Dave Portnoy and Clay Travis enhanced their followings by pointing out and capitalizing on ESPN's political correctness and blandness.

By 2018, the Walt Disney Company recognized its mistake and used ESPN president John Skipper's cocaine-induced departure as a pivot point. ESPN's new president, Jimmy Pitaro, took over the sports network and promptly pushed to remove its political bias. Donald Trump troller in chief Jemele Hill was pushed out of her prominent role as a host of the 6 p.m. SportsCenter. Pitaro instructed the network's broadcasters and opinionists to avoid politics and Donald Trump.

Ironically, another drug-induced departure — the death of fentanyl activist Rev. George Floyd Luther III — sparked a new ESPN pivot. When St. George died, Maria Taylor emerged as the second coming of Jemele Hill. She used St. George's death as a springboard to launch herself as the pretty face of ESPN.

She turned the Worldwide Leader into the sports marketing arm of Black Lives Matter. She verbally beat up Saints quarterback Drew Brees for stating support of the national anthem. In the pages of the New York Times, in stories written by Kevin Draper — the former Deadspin writer — Taylor smeared a white co-worker, Dave Lamont, as racist because he was overheard saying black employees were griping on a conference call.

Taylor told Draper, ""It was such a slap in the face. When I was in it, that was horrible. But now, looking back, it was an awakening moment. This is part of our culture. There are people that feel this way.""

This week, Taylor's awakening has brought ESPN to its knees. She's now offended because in a private conversation, Nichols told a white man that ESPN's crappy record on diversity forced the network to give Taylor a hosting job that had been promised contractually to Nichols.

ESPN removed Nichols from NBA Finals coverage and took her daily show off the air for one day. The blowback on Nichols is preposterous and unfair.

But what's worse will be the damage done to ESPN's work culture. Everybody — black and white — can see what Taylor is doing. It's all a money-grab. ESPN broadcasters have been getting slapped with hefty pay cuts the past two years. Taylor wants her salary elevated from $1 million to $8 million, according to reports.

She's framing ESPN as racist to get the money. In this cancel culture environment, she might cost Jimmy Pitaro his job.

Yesterday, a column in the Los Angeles Times called Taylor the ""perfect journalist."" I'm not kidding. Here's the excerpt:



Taylor was described to the Los Angeles Times by current and former ESPN employees as a ""perfect journalist."" In addition to her talent on camera, she is known internally for working hard, mentoring young journalists of all backgrounds and establishing a foundation to support women and journalists of color.

Do newspapers even know what journalism is? Mentoring young journalists and establishing foundations of support for women and journalists of color sounds more like charity than journalism. Journalism is breaking news, probing news sources for interesting insight and perspective, developing sources.

Maria Taylor sounds like an activist. Or a character from Terry McMillan's book-turned-movie ""Waiting to Exhale.""

I bet Jimmy Pitaro can't breathe right now.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-kanye-west-remains-dangerous-disgusting-and-harmful-to-demonic-leftists,2021-07-08
"Whitlock: Maria Taylor, the 1965 Moynihan Report, the black matriarchy, and Cersei Lannister explain ESPN's game of thrones","The sense of entitlement that caused 34-year-old broadcaster Maria Taylor to exit ESPN in a ridiculous and nasty contract dispute was built over the course of nearly 60 years.



Yesterday, Taylor and ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro jointly announced that her seven-year meteoric rise at the network had abruptly crashed and burned. Taylor and her representatives demanded a contract that rivaled 53-year-old ESPN employee Stephen A. Smith's. Smith earns between $8 and $12 million. He's worked at the company for the better part of two decades. For better or worse, he replaced Chris Berman as the face of the network. He has an audience and a following.

Taylor has an attitude, a striking appearance, and a willingness to do anything in pursuit of power and money. She reminds me of my favorite character from ""Game of Thrones,"" Cersei Lannister. I guess that would make Rachel Nichols Lady Margaery, a deceased rival of Cersei's.

In a desperate, last-minute attempt to leverage ESPN to meet her contract demands, Taylor, with assistance from the New York Times, torched Nichols, NFL legend Drew Brees, broadcaster Dave Lamont, and all of King's Landing. Taylor pretended that a year-old private comment by Nichols, a white female co-worker, was the final piece of proof exposing the vicious systemic oppression Taylor endured while ESPN management whisked her to the top of the industry.

For the last year, Taylor sipped wine, sang ""We Shall Overcome,"" and stood on the neck and shoulders of George Floyd in a cash grab. I might be insulting Cersei Lannister with the Maria Taylor comparison.



Maria Taylor's entitlement is 60 years in the making. Let me explain how Taylor got here, how at the tender age of 34 she convinced herself a white woman's private gossip made her worth $8 million a year.

This all started in the mid-1960s when the assistant secretary of labor, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, decided to research and write a study examining the plight of black Americans. His report was titled ""The Negro Family: The Case for National Action."" It was published in 1965. The media referred to it as ""The Moynihan Report."" Sparked by President Lyndon Johnson's ""war on poverty"" initiative and the civil rights movement, the Moynihan Report was five chapters long and called for the government to take unprecedented action in support of the black family.

Moynihan wrote:

In this new period the expectations of the Negro Americans will go beyond civil rights. Being Americans, they will now expect that in the near future equal opportunities for them as a group will produce roughly equal results, as compared with other groups. This is not going to happen. Nor will it happen for generations to come unless a new and special effort is made.

Moynihan continued:

Measures that have worked in the past, or would work for most groups in the present, will not work here. A national effort is required that will give a unity of purpose to the many activities of the Federal government in this area, directed to a new kind of national goal: the establishment of a stable Negro family structure.

The Moynihan Report was a direct call for investment in the black man. In chapter four, the report specifically addressed the problem of a black matriarchal culture. The report stated: ""A fundamental fact of Negro American family life is the often reversed roles of husband and wife…. Negro husbands have unusually low power.""

It's easy to find the Moynihan Report online. Here's a link to it. Read it all for yourself. It reads like prophecy.

President Johnson initially loved the Moynihan Report. In June 1965 at Howard University, he gave a speech, co-authored by Moynihan, based on the report. Two months later, the media demonized the Moynihan Report as racist, and Johnson disavowed it and scrapped it from the war on poverty and Great Society initiatives.

Let me crystalize what happened. The Moynihan Report called for investment in the black man and the restoration of the black family. Great Society programs focused on investment in women and couldn't care less about traditional family structure.

The spoils of the civil rights movement went to women. The feminist movement overtook the civil rights movement. The black woman stuck her finger in the air, figured out the direction of the winds, and switched teams.

You may not like it, but that's what happened.

Moynihan diagnosed a cancer destroying black America — the emasculation and marginalization of the black man. The left rejected his diagnosis, framed it as racist, offered the black woman 20 pieces of silver, and metastasized the cancer by doubling down on black matriarchy.

Maria Taylor is the byproduct of the black matriarchy, of 55 years of relentless investment in and celebration of the black woman and the exact opposite treatment of the black man and the black family. She's been told for 55 years that she can do no wrong, that she is the proper leader of black culture, and that she doesn't need a black man for anything beyond occasional casual sex.

The whole system has been rigged to create black Cersei Lannisters.

Fifty-five years ago, the Moynihan Report specifically addressed the widening educational and achievement gap between the black woman and black man. Those gaps are far wider today. But all focus is placed on elevating the black woman. There is no focus on elevating black men or black boys. You know what we get? George Floyd memorials. Ahmaud Arbery birthday parties. We get black criminals raised from the dead, resurrected as pagan gods.

And you wonder why I'm pissed half the time.

Every bit of the chaos, dysfunction, degeneracy, violence, and lack of achievement everyday black people are living with today was documented, predicted, and discussed in 1965. A clear game plan and solution were called for in 1965.

We let the media convince us that investing in the black man and black family was racist. You wonder why corporate media is obsessed with framing everything as racist. It works as a way of getting black people to make decisions against their best interest.



The left wants you to believe America is systemically racist, so that they can tear up the Constitution and rewrite it in a way that gives elites more power and control.

Whitlock: Pro sports leagues riding the gay and black ‘Pride’ paths to hell,"The Bible stakes a clear position on pride. It is regarded as Satan’s aphrodisiac of choice, more powerful than wine, drugs, money, or brute force. A series of verses in the book of Proverbs spell out God’s position on pride.



Proverbs 11:2: “When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom.”

Proverbs 16:18: “One’s pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor.”

Proverbs 8:13: “The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.”

Proverbs 16:18: “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”

Roman Catholics believe pride is one of seven deadly sins – lust, greed, envy, sloth, gluttony, and envy are the others – and the root of all sin.

Ivan Provorov, a defenseman for the Philadelphia Flyers, belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, an offshoot of Roman Catholicism. No one should be surprised that he declined to participate in his team’s “Pride Night” activities. In fact, no serious Christian should involve himself with any celebration of pride, whether it’s gay pride, black pride, trans pride, American pride, Egg McMuffin pride, or even pride pride.

Pride is rooted in idolatry, the prioritization of a symbol, a thing, or an activity above worship of God.

Tuesday night, during pregame warm-ups, Provorov refused to wear an LGBTQ+ jersey and use a stick with rainbow tape. He told reporters he wanted to stay true to himself and his religion. His decision spurred derision and pushback from inside and outside the hockey world. NHL Network broadcaster Ethan Hradek suggested that Provorov should go fight in the Ukraine-Russian war.

“Ivan Provorov can get on a plane any day he wants and go back to a place where he feels more comfortable, take less money, and get on with his life that way if that’s problematic for him. If this is that much of a problem for him, to maybe assimilate into his group of teammates and in the community here in this country, that’s OK. Listen, you can feel any way you want. But the beauty is, if it bothers you that much, there’s always a chance to leave, go back to where you feel more comfortable – I understand there’s a conflict of sorts going on over there, maybe get involved.”

Tim Micallef, host of a popular sports talk show in Canada, ripped Provorov with the popular wrong-side-of-history argument.

“I will always be on the side of equality,” he said. “People will hide behind ideologies, like amazingly enough, religion. But I’m strong on this one and quite comfortable. Either you are for equality or you’re on the wrong side of history. Period.”

Some men pursue God, not history. Man is the God of recorded history. Micallef and others worship man. Provorov worships God.

Man believes pride is a virtue. The Bible says pride is Satan’s best tool for destruction. Who am I to believe?

I see the destructive power of pride on a daily basis. Even man’s written history reflects pride’s destructiveness. White supremacy is rooted in racial pride/racial idolatry. Black pride works just the same way as white pride. That’s why proponents of Black Lives Matter delight in having white people kneel and beg forgiveness.

The prioritization of skin color as a primary identity has led black people to embrace and defend a culture that denigrates and dehumanizes black people. We ignore the slaughter of our children based on the race of the killer. That’s black pride. It forbids black people to hate their sin. God commands us to hate sin, not people. Hating sin is good.

“The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil.”

America’s embrace of pride has reversed God’s directive. We hate people and celebrate sin.

Ivan Provorov is hated now because his faith compels him to avoid celebrating a lifestyle the Bible says is unhealthy. He disagrees with feigning pride in an activity he believes is wrong. He does not hate gay people. He’s not advocating that we deny gay people fundamental freedoms, rights, and respect. He’s rejecting pride, a deadly sin in his mind.

What would lead to a better society: hating people or rejecting pride?

The answer is easy. We should reject pride. It spawns wickedness and division. People’s sexual preference does not qualify them for a special night of celebration. Neither does a skin color.

Man’s nature is evil. Ivan Provorov and many other believers embrace the teachings in the Bible because it’s the best way to combat our destructive nature. Provorov wants to be on the right side of God because he knows man is incapable of producing a righteous world without biblical instruction.

Man uses hatred of man to produce justice. God tells us hatred of sin produces justice.

Let me make it simple. I have a weight problem. Man advises me to hate Ronald McDonald. God tells me to hate gluttony.



This sounds like a joke. It’s not. The woke have crafted arguments that obesity is a byproduct of white supremacy. Here’s one example. In a few years, the NHL and other sports leagues will be hosting Obesity Pride Nights. They’ll smother the hockey puck in gravy and demand that players eat fried chicken and cheeseburgers while on the ice.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-maria-taylor-is-waiting-to-exhale-while-espn-and-the-rest-of-america-cant-breathe,2023-01-19
Whitlock: Shannon Sharpe needs a lesson on ‘sticks and stones’ and the source of Skip Bayless’ jealousy,"The “sticks and stones” adage originated in 1862 on the pages of ""The Christian Recorder,"" the oldest African-American newspaper in the United States.



It read: “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never break me.”

A decade later, a Scottish writer, Mrs. George Cupples, tweaked the phrase in a book, replacing the second “break” with the word “harm.”

I retell this bit of history to illustrate how far American culture has moved away from Christian values and the strength that accompanies those beliefs. Words now trigger and provoke. They justify a hyperbolic response. They power a culture that overemphasizes the perception of respect.

The culture of perceived respect is most deeply rooted among black people. Black culture demands that black people not allow anyone of any race to disrespect them. A verbal slight prompts a face-saving, over-the-top rebuke at best and violence at worst. Verbal disrespect is a hill worth dying on in a secular society.

It’s not in a culture ruled by a biblical worldview. At the root of the “sticks and stones” adage is a belief that each individual is performing for an audience of one: God. Another man’s words cannot harm me, especially if that man’s words are inconsistent with the thoughts, words, and deeds of Jesus Christ.

It is not a sign of weakness to ignore the misguided babel of your fellow man and woman. It’s a sign of strength and faith in a higher power. One hundred and sixty years ago, when black people dealt with virulent and pervasive discrimination and disrespect, we turned to God for validation and identity. Now that we are free, we constantly seek the approval of our fellow man, especially the white ones.

This is what triggered Pro Football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe yesterday when he exploded on live television during a passionate discussion with Skip Bayless.

On their Fox Sports 1 debate show, “Undisputed,” Bayless accused Sharpe of being jealous of Tampa Bay quarterback Tom Brady’s lengthy career. Bayless, at one point, said that Brady, the most accomplished player in NFL history, is “way better” than Sharpe, causing the former tight end to erupt in anger.

“You make it seem like I was a bum,” Sharpe screamed. “I’m in the effing Hall of Fame. I got three Super Bowls.”

“So what?” Bayless retorted.

“See what you do? You take personal shots,” Sharpe responded. “You would take a personal shot at me to say this man is better than me because I say he’s playing bad this year. … You would disrespect me to support him?”

This play-by-play does not do justice to the wild, embarrassing emotion Sharpe displayed. Twice, Sharpe blurted out howls and screeches that could best be described as the expressions of violent eroticism or maybe the wails of a wounded animal.

Skip Bayless’ words harmed Shannon Sharpe.

This would not be the case if Sharpe leaned into a biblical worldview. Sharpe would laugh off Bayless’ verbal slights because he would realize that, in a football debate, Bayless was acting out of insecurity. Bayless diminished Sharpe to elevate himself. It’s a well-worn debate tactic.

I’m about to go a layer deeper, but I need to add some context before I do. I do not believe Skip Bayless is a bigot at all. I worked at Fox Sports 1 with Sharpe and Bayless. Bayless is eccentric. He is not driven by racial animus. He’s a highly frustrated failed athlete who delights in thinking he knows more about sports than athletes and other journalists do. On the positive side, my impression of Bayless is that he derives many of his core values from his religious faith.

I mention that because the “sticks and stones” adage originated in a black Christian newspaper during slavery as a reaction to white bigotry. It was a tool for black believers to reject and ignore the belittling and condescending comments hurled at them.

The adage is a reminder to all believers that greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world.

Our abandonment of religious faith has left us weak and overly sensitive. Someone – black or white – intentionally or unintentionally says the wrong word to us, and we think it’s important to confront and rebuke that person. It’s not.

How many young black men have been shot and killed by other black men over a perceived lack of respect? We’re in a constant battle for external respect, when our real conflict is our internal battle for obedience to God’s will.



Secular values produce weak men – men who can be triggered and controlled by their emotions.

Yesterday, to no real surprise, social media users championed Sharpe’s response to Bayless. Twitter remains the most secular place on earth. Former NFL MVP and CBS broadcaster Rich Gannon congratulated Sharpe on showing restraint. Thousands of other users praised Sharpe for not allowing Bayless to disrespect him.

Bayless tricked Sharpe into disrespecting himself. Sharpe looked unhinged and ready to fight a 70-year-old man. A man standing on God’s truth cannot be so easily fooled. A man standing with God laughs at Skip Bayless’ trolls, realizing Skip is jealous of Stephen A. Smith’s success at ESPN.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-maria-taylor-the-1965-moynihan-report-the-black-matriarchy-and-cersei-lannister-explain-espns-game-of-thrones,2022-12-13
Whitlock: The fall of Afghanistan illustrates the utter failure of the ‘intelligence community’ President Eisenhower predicted,"America today isn't hard to understand. In his farewell address 60 years ago, President Dwight Eisenhower explained the destructive path the ""intelligence community"" planned for us.

His explanation went well beyond expressing fear of a military-industrial complex. He warned that secularism, technology, and academia beholden to government would conspire with the military to undermine the greater purpose of our nation.

Every failure we're witnessing today — from Afghanistan to Big Tech censorship to critical racism theory being taught in our schools — can be traced to the 15-minute warning Eisenhower delivered on Jan. 17, 1961.

The American people have been stripped of their power. A cabal of military, political, technological, media, and academic elites has seized control of our republic under the pretense of fortifying democracy. I call the cabal the ""intelligence community,"" the elites who are convinced their degrees, titles, fancy word salads, and wealth make them a superior breed of human being. They practice intelligence supremacy. They grab power in the sincere belief that their ascendancy assures the safety and prosperity of the world at large. They are the most high.

Everyone outside this country can easily see that America no longer serves a higher power or a higher purpose. The Taliban conquered our military might because they justifiably rejected the secular values we tried to impose on their country.



That is not written or said as an endorsement of Sharia law, the set of Islamic religious rules that denies women equal rights. It's stated to expose the folly of thinking secular values could unseat religious ones in Afghanistan. You can't subdue the Greater Middle East with guns and drones, bombs and airplanes. Muslims, and other highly religious people, do not fear death the way Americans do.

Our military-industrial complex cannot control the Taliban or end their belief in the patriarchy. They're not trapped in the American-made matrix President Eisenhower predicted six decades ago. Eisenhower's farewell address is too often solely reduced to his military warning. His speech was much more than that. The World War II hero outlined the threat of Marxist political ideology in layman's terms.

""We face a hostile ideology — global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in method,"" Eisenhower said. ""Unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration. To meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle — with liberty at stake. Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment.""

That is Eisenhower, in 1961, telling us that a war is being waged in the minds of Americans. Would we remain one nation under God, or would a hostile, atheist ideology overrun our religious values and love of freedom?

Eisenhower then pivoted to discussing the dangers of an American society trapped by military expense.

""This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience,"" he said. ""The total influence — economic, political, even spiritual — is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.

""In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.""

From there, Eisenhower urged Americans to be suspicious of the federal government's influence on scholarly research and science. Sixty years ago, Eisenhower warned us about the Trust the Science movement. It's as if he knew one day America would provide funding for a lab in Wuhan, China.

""Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields,"" he said. ""In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.""

Finally, Eisenhower forecasted that Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg, and the satans of Silicon Valley would become our rulers.

""Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect,"" he said, ""as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.""

Sixty years ago, our 34th president interpreted George Orwell's book, ""1984,"" which was published four years before Eisenhower ascended to the presidency.

Two years after Eisenhower left office, President John Kennedy was assassinated. Five years later, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated. President Kennedy defied our military commanders in his handling of Cuba. Bobby Kennedy's first presidential campaign speech, ""Conflict in Vietnam and at Home,"" centered on exiting the Vietnam War. Dr. King spoke against the Vietnam War.

I'm not wearing a tin-foil hat. Neither was Dwight Eisenhower.

The whole world, even Taliban soldiers hiding in mountain caves, can see that our military, academic institutions, politicians, spying agencies, media, tech billionaires, and celebrity class have been corrupted by a blind pursuit of power, money, and fame.



Long before we surrendered Kabul, we surrendered the moral high ground through fear and cowardice. As control of America was stripped from the people, a handful of public executions silenced dissent. No one should be surprised the Taliban embarrassed us abroad.

Whitlock: The pursuit of ‘racial justice’ camouflages the revolution of American corporate media support,"Corporate media outlets are not fanning the flames of racial division for ratings or relevance. The goal is revolution, the rewriting of our Constitution and the dismantling of Western civilization.

CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, your local newspaper, and their collaborators in China and Silicon Valley want to define America as a failure, a casualty of institutionalized racism, a human experiment in need of radical change.

By pointing out this obvious fact, I run the risk of being labeled a conspiracy theorist. By acknowledging this obvious fact, you run the risk of being labeled a conspiracy theorist.

We can no longer afford to delude ourselves with comforting lies. There are few accidents when it comes to the seizure of political power. The last accident was Donald Trump winning the 2016 presidential election. Everything before and since has been a product of careful planning, design, and execution.

The lies spun about Kyle Rittenhouse, Jacob Blake, and Kenosha are not innocent mistakes. They're intentional talking points distributed to the outlets and personalities sympathetic to the cause of changing America by any means necessary.

""Rittenhouse crossed state lines!""

That rallying cry was no accident. That's a talking point handed to the useful idiots working inside corporate media. It's propaganda. So was presidential candidate Joe Biden's insinuation that Rittenhouse is a white supremacist.

Corporate media's fixation on defining every human encounter in racial terms is a tactic, not a virtue-signal born of white guilt. It's a strategy that characterizes America's 400-year narrative arc as racial conflict rather than a moral, societal evolution.

The Judeo-Christian values embedded in our Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights did more than establish our culture as separate from England's. Our founding documents set up an internal battle of good vs. evil. It forced America to examine and address its flaws. For nearly 200 years, America sacrificed its blood to expand freedom to black people, and American men surrendered power to expand freedom and agency to women.

America no longer debates morality. It has spent the last 60 years expanding the acceptance and normalization of immorality. Communism, and its hostility toward religion and objective truth, is immorality's best friend.

The public square is filled with people debating the gross lies propagated by corporate media. It's a brilliant tactic. We've spent much of the past decade arguing about whether law enforcement is systemically brutalizing unarmed black men. The whole conversation is a lie. The lie contaminates everything it touches.

That's how a trial about the interaction between four white men — Kyle Rittenhouse, Joseph Rosenbaum, Gaige Grosskreutz, and Anthony Huber — turned into a referendum on the criminal justice system and black men.

""Well, if Rittenhouse was black, the police would have shot him on sight, and the jury would have convicted him of murder.""

Breonna Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired the first shot, striking a Louisville police officer. Walker was never charged with shooting a cop. He's viewed as a victim and a hero. On the same day Rittenhouse was acquitted, Andrew Coffee was acquitted of murder and attempted murder charges surrounding his shootout with police in Florida. Coffee is black. He's a felon. He illegally possessed a firearm.

These lies aren't being told for ratings and relevance. They're not told out of guilt. The lies camouflage the agenda. They create the illusion that revolutionaries are really just well-intentioned anti-racists. Anyone who objects is a racist or supports white supremacy.

The lies fertilize a revolution billionaire elitists are financing and promoting. They want a new constitution. They want America to operate like China, a country run by the communist party. Elites — athletes, entertainers, media personalities — all do quite well in China as long as they promote the government agenda.

LeBron James is 10 or 20 times more popular in China than he is in America. James is loyal to the people and the government that are most loyal to him. LeBron's childlike demonization of America serves his strategy. He's not uninformed. He's executing a strategy that serves him and other professional basketball players.

Participation in pro sports has far more to do with genetics than hard work. I'm not arguing that athletes don't work hard. I'm saying that a tiny percentage of the population will grow tall enough to play in the NBA. The average height of an NBA player is 6' 6"". About 15 percent of the world's population is 6 foot or taller. Less than 1 percent of the population reaches 6' 6"". The NBA caters to a tiny, elite group of genetics-lottery winners.



Strength — a key ingredient to play in the NFL — is also a byproduct of genetics. It's not a coincidence that basketball and football players are some of the biggest proponents of the racial lies being used to vilify this country.

The high-profile supporters of Black Lives Matter and the agenda to dismantle Western civilization fit an FBI profile:

Mixed race. Openly LGBTQ. Closeted LGBTQ. Atheist. Low IQ. Athletically gifted. White spouse/partner. Obsessed with social media.

They don't have to check every box. But if they check half of the eight, you've found a match. The people in charge of promoting the revolution know who they're looking for and who will support their agenda. This is a well-funded, highly orchestrated coup.

Pretending it is not only enhances its chances of success.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-shannon-sharpe-needs-a-lesson-on-sticks-and-stones-and-the-source-of-skip-bayless-jealousy,2021-11-22
Whitlock: US Olympic relay failure exposes the bigger problem undermining the success of black men,"The Olympic 4 x 100 relay is racist. That's the only logical explanation for the embarrassing performance of the United States men's relay team last night and over the past two decades.



In our country, Olympic-level sprinting is dominated by black men. The 4 x 100 relay requires four black American men to work cohesively together for approximately 38 seconds.

We can't do it. We certainly couldn't do it last night. And we've struggled doing it for the past 20 years.

In a qualifying heat at the Tokyo Games, Team USA finished sixth, behind China, Canada, Italy, Germany, and Ghana. It's impossible to make the relay final from sixth place in a heat. The United States won't be winning any sort of medal in an event we absolutely dominated until the race turned racist after our 2000 title at the Sydney Games.

Up until 2004, Team USA had won the gold in 15 of the 20 4 x 100 relays held in Olympic history. We owned the track and virtually all the sprints. We flashed our God-given gifts, our work ethic, and our ability to work as a team for the greater good. It was a showcase of black American excellence. Bob Hayes, Jim Hines, Carl Lewis, and Maurice Greene took the baton symbolically handed to them by Jesse Owens and represented this country at the highest level.



Then something very disturbing happened at the 2004 Olympics. Systemic racism started easing its way into the event at the Athens Games. America finished second in Greece.

Ibram X. Kendi argues the systemic relay racism was always there. But it wasn't until 2008 that black Twitter and ESPN pointed out that the Proud Boys, Trump supporters, and right-wing insurrectionists began manipulating the relay batons and the baton exchange zones. This manipulation made it impossible for black American men to excel in track and field's premier relay event.

America has not won a single medal in the relay since white bigots took control of the relay.

OK, I'm being sarcastic. Systemic racism has nothing to do with the two-decades-long failure of our once-dominant relay team. Systemic dysfunction actually explains the failure. What we witnessed last night is a symptom of a larger problem we in black America are loath to discuss.

Rather than having uncomfortable conversations with white people, we need to have uncomfortable conversations amongst ourselves concerning the fact that black men don't function well together.

It's obvious to everyone else. We're the only people who refuse to talk about it. We just hope the Crips and Bloods get old and retire. We think our kids will learn to resolve conflict without resorting to violence when white liberals decide to teach us other options.

If we ignore our dysfunction long enough, it will go away.

That kind of wishful thinking led to last night's relay fiasco. What transpired last night surprised no one paying attention. It's the equivalent of feigning disbelief on a Monday morning when you learn of how many black men or boys were gunned down over a weekend in Chicago, or Baltimore, or Indianapolis, or New York City. Black male dysfunction is expected.

Hours before the qualifying heat, the Washington Post published a long piece detailing the relay team's baton issues. The piece was titled, ""Medal or nothing: U.S. men's sprinters have a handoff problem."" The story reads as prophecy.

Last night, U.S. sprinters Ronnie Baker and Fred Kerley struggled mightily to complete the second baton exchange. It took three attempts. By the time it was completed, Baker and Kerley were side by side and Kerley was at a relative standstill. Anchorman Cravon Gillespie briefly climbed to third place and then faded badly as he began to look around at his competitors. Reaction to the collapse was swift and angry.

""The USA team did everything wrong in the men's relay,"" Carl Lewis complained via Twitter. ""The passing system is wrong, athletes running the wrong legs, and it was clear that there was no leadership. It was a total embarrassment, and completely unacceptable for a USA team to look worse than the AAU kids I saw.""

We got smoked by China. Not a Jamaican team led by Usain Bolt. China won the heat. Germany beat us. Ghana beat us. Ghana advanced to the final. Ghana apparently doesn't give a damn about the Proud Boys and the insurrectionists.

We can't use COVID protocols as an excuse. All the other countries have had limited practices because of the pandemic. You can't cover up 20 years of failure with excuses.

I know I keep making sarcastic jokes about racism. I'm doing it because the most damaging racism impacting black people today is the use of racism to eliminate accountability and responsibility for black men. Our sprinters are irresponsible because we fail to hold them accountable for their failure.

Black people across the globe immigrate to America and achieve their dreams because they embrace a far different mentality than what's cultivated in black American culture. Black sprinters in Ghana, Jamaica, Canada, and everywhere else don't have the kind of baton problems we have.

We can't work together. What happened?

When you're raised in family dysfunction, that dysfunction follows you for life, especially when you never acknowledge it, pretend it never existed, or believe it's white people's responsibility to address it or adjust to your dysfunction.



There's absolutely nothing wrong with black people. The problem is culture. We've embraced a culture that undermines our success. We've been programmed to believe our actions don't really determine our destiny. The actions of white people are all that matter. This worldview eliminates accountability and empowers irresponsibility.

Re-watch the 4 X 100 relay qualifier. Maybe one member of the Chinese relay is good enough to make our relay team. But China smoked us. How? Why? It's not talent. It's culture. It's an inability to set egos aside and work together in a cohesive fashion.

Let's say white people pitted us against each other. Let's say it started in slavery. No problem. I agree it happened. I also think it's insanely foolish to expect white people to fix it. It's not going to happen. It's no different from a man breaking your leg in a fight and expecting him to do the rehabilitation. Only you can do the rehab.

Black men, we have a culture problem. What are we going to do about it?

Whitlock: Will Max Kellerman and the woke sports media sabotage the 49ers’ two-QB experiment?,"The woke capital of the world could be home to the most interesting innovation in professional football … as long as critical racism theory doesn't ruin it.

San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan is pondering playing two quarterbacks this season, veteran Jimmy Garoppolo and rookie Trey Lance. Shanahan unveiled the potential two-QB wrinkle in his team's final exhibition game against the Raiders. It worked to near perfection. The 49ers won in a romp, 34-10. Garoppolo and Lance combined to lead touchdown drives. Both quarterbacks rushed for TDs.

More importantly, neither quarterback seems to have a problem with sharing the position.

""We had two successful drives with it, scored on both of them,"" Garoppolo said after the game. ""That's tough for defenses to handle. Whatever is best for the team, I'm here for it.""

Lance added: ""It's fun. I trust Coach Shanahan and I know Jimmy does and our whole team and locker room does. He's going to find ways to get the guys that need the ball the ball and do whatever it takes to win games.""



The QB position in professional football is controlled by a cliche: ""If you have two quarterbacks, you don't have one.""

That cliche drives decision-making at quarterback. Every team starts every season on the hunt for its franchise quarterback, its version of Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes, or Aaron Rodgers. Most teams fail to find their franchise guy. They end up with Jared Goff, Carson Wentz, or Teddy Bridgewater.

Quarterbacks are so central to team leadership that coaches are reluctant to unleash a mixed message within locker-room chemistry. Better to let Goff stand as a single leadership voice in the locker room than risk a divided message coming from a second quarterback. It's quite possibly an antiquated leadership model in an era when players take their cues from social media apps and brand managers about virtually everything. There are a million voices inside a locker room. Players check Twitter and Instagram at halftime.

What Shanahan is considering is long overdue. He's watched Saints head coach Sean Payton toy with the concept the last two or three seasons. For four to six snaps each game, the Saints spelled franchise quarterback Drew Brees with backup Taysom Hill. It worked. Hill is a terrific runner and a mediocre passer. It did not seem to break Brees' rhythm.

Trey Lance is an exceptional runner with far more upside as a passer than Hill. Garoppolo, of course, is the prototypical pocket passer. Four years ago, the 49ers traded a second-round pick to acquire Jimmy G from the Patriots. This past off-season, San Francisco traded up to select Lance with the number-three overall pick.

The 49ers have more invested in Lance than Garoppolo. It makes sense for the squad to explore how to get an immediate return on investment in Lance.

There's one factor that could potentially ruin Shanahan's much-needed experiment — an illogical discussion of race and racism forced by ESPN, Fox Sports, and Twitter.

Garoppolo is white. Lance is half black.

The never-ending search for Twitter-friendly content will cause sports talkers to needlessly inject race into the discussion. It's already started. ESPN's Max Kellerman got things rolling Monday morning with a chess analogy.

""I'm not saying it can't work,"" Kellerman blared. ""You can innovate, but this ain't the way it's always been done. And I think you take a risk innovating, not if you're in a position where you don't have the horses, right? You've got to do something. You've got to have an asymmetrical kind of strategy. Like, if you play chess, and you're the black pieces, which always goes second. Go figure, right? If you just do the theoretically strongest move every time, you're always a step behind the white pieces who start first, you've got to do something asymmetrical. You've got to do something to throw off the balance.""

Get it? Trey Lance is the black piece. Garoppolo starts the game, giving him an unfair advantage. Kellerman is doing the groundwork to frame the 49ers' QB strategy in racial terms, in ways that will increase his social media traction.

The 49ers are trying to win games. They have a roster capable of competing for a Super Bowl. Shanahan is taking an innovative approach to maxing out the QB position. It's not a racial conflict. Race has nothing to do with Shanahan's decision-making. He wants to win right now. Playing both quarterbacks could give the 49ers a shot at equaling the QB play in Tampa, Green Bay, and Seattle.



Playing two QBs is San Fran's theoretically strongest move.

Playing the race card is Kellerman's.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-the-pursuit-of-racial-justice-camouflages-the-revolution-of-american-corporate-media-support,2021-08-31
"'Get ready for $6 a gallon' gas, says former US diplomat to the Middle East","Moms filling up their minivans today are experiencing some serious sticker shock.

Contractors working on a job site with any distance at all from the home office are going to eat some serious travel expenses if they didn't build updated gas and travel costs into their bids.

Drivers and truckers delivering goods to grocery stores, grains to ports, or timber to plants are paying through the nose for diesel to ship what Americans need and want (and they aren't just going to eat the massive spike in fuel prices).

But the news gets worse: If you thought gas was expensive already, just wait. One expert with experience in the Middle East is warning Americans to get ready for $6 per gallon.

David Rundell, a onetime U.S. diplomat in oil-producing nations, told Fortune that the Russian-Ukraine conflict, coupled with our deteriorating relations with Saudi Arabia, spells doom for U.S. consumers' pocketbooks at the pump.

Rundell, who spent three decades as a U.S. diplomat in such oil-producing countries as Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Tunisia, told the magazine that the U.S. put itself behind the eight ball when it comes to negotiating to get the House of Saud to get more oil flowing.

""Russia and Saudi Arabia are the world’s two largest oil exporters. If we had good relations with Saudi Arabia, they would have stepped in to help as they have done many times in the past,” Rundell told Fortune.

The former diplomat, who is now a partner at Arabia Analytica, a consulting firm focused on the Middle East, added that ""our relationship with Saudi leaders continues to worsen. So, get ready for $6 a gallon.""

Rundell issued his warning as Americans saw gas prices hit an all-time high of $4.17 on Tuesday, the outlet said. The price is 11 cents per gallon more than it was the day before and 55 cents higher than just a week ago.

His warning also came before President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that the U.S. would bar imports of Russian oil and gas.

During his announcement, Biden told the nation that gas prices are ""going to go up further.""",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-us-olympic-relay-failure-exposes-the-bigger-problem-undermining-the-success-of-black-men,2022-03-08

Hamas mocks US after United Nations fails to condemn terror group for rocket attacks against Israel,"Hamas, a Palestinian terrorist group, mocked the United States last week after the United Nations failed to approve a U.S.-led resolution condemning the militant group's recent rocket attacks against Israel.

What happened?

The resolution would have condemned Hamas for ""repeatedly firing rockets into Israel and for inciting violence, thereby putting civilians at risk,"" while also demanding that Hamas and other terror groups in the region cease their attacks on Israel, according to Fox News. Additionally, the resolution also sought to condemn Hamas for building underground tunnels used to infiltrate Israel.

The resolution failed after a procedural vote at the U.N. General Assembly passed, requiring the U.S.-led resolution to be passed with a two-thirds majority vote. Ultimately, 87 members voted for the resolution, 58 voted against, and 32 members abstained. Unfortunately, the tally was not enough to breach the two-thirds threshold.

How did Hamas respond?

Hamas and other Palestinian terror groups said the U.N.'s failure to approve the resolution amounted to a ""slap in the face of America"" and a ""victory for the Palestinian resistance,"" the Jerusalem Post reported.

Khalil al-Haya, a senior Hamas official further characterized the resolution's failure as an ""uplift for the Palestinian resistance...in spite of American bullying."" He added that Hamas remains committed ""to the option of resistance, which has been endorsed by the Palestinians,"" while also thanking the countries that voted against the resolution, claiming their resistance ""prevented the US administration and Israel from criminalizing the Palestinian resistance.""

Other terrorist leaders in the area said the U.N. should condemn Israel and the U.S., not Hamas, Palestine, or other terror groups in the area.

What did Nikki Haley say?

Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikky Haley blasted the U.N. for its failure to adopt the resolution.

""We can't talk about peace in the Middle East until we can agree on a basic condemnation of Hamas and its terrorism,"" she said, according to Fox News. ""The U.N. had a chance to do that today, and it failed.""

Haley also drew attention to the double standard the U.N. employs against Israel, explaining it has approved 700 resolutions condemning Israel in some fashion, yet has never approved a resolution explicitly condemning Hamas.

""That, more than anything else, is a condemnation of the United Nations itself,"" Haley said.



Meanwhile, Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon told the General Assembly after the vote: ""You should be ashamed of yourselves, wait until you have to deal with terrorism in your own countries. Your silence in the face of evil reveals your true colors.""",https://www.theblaze.com/good-morning-mug-club/blacklivesmatter-burns-wisconsin-for-jacob-blake-shooting,2018-12-09
"Hotel dishwasher, a Christian, awarded $21 million in lawsuit over working Sundays","A former Miami hotel dishwasher was awarded a $21 million settlement in court after being made to work Sundays despite conflicts with her Catholic missionary work and eventually getting fired, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel.

Although the jury awarded 60-year-old Marie Jean Pierre $21 million in damages, punitive damages in federal court are capped so she will likely receive around $500,000. But her attorney said it wasn't about the money in the first place.

""I asked for $50 million, knowing that I was capped at $300,000,"" Pierre's lawyer, Marc Brumer, told NBC News. ""I didn't do this for the money. I did this to wright the wrongs.""

What's the story?

Pierre was hired to work at the Conrad Miami hotel in 2006. She said she told her employer at the time of her hiring that she could not work Sundays because she is a member of Soldiers of Christ Church, which is a Catholic missionary group.

The scheduling arrangement was fine from 2006 until 2009, when the hotel began scheduling her on Sundays. After she told them she'd have to quit if she was forced to work on Sundays, the hotel again accommodated her requests.

The issue resurfaced in 2015, when according to the lawsuit her manager demanded that she work Sundays of swap shifts with other coworkers to have the day off.

Pierre was fired in March 2016 for alleged misconduct, negligence and unexcused absences, she said in the lawsuit.

She sued Park Hotels & Resorts, the parent company, in 2017 for violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

What does the hotel say?

""During Ms. Pierre's ten years with the hotel, multiple concessions were made to accommodate her personal and religious commitments,"" a spokeswoman for Park Hotels said. ""We intend to appeal, and demonstrate that Conrad Miami was and remains a welcoming place for all guests and employees.""",https://www.theblaze.com/good-morning-mug-club/conflicting-electors-lawyer-bill-richmond-explains-how-the-electoral-college-works,2019-01-17
Investigation accuses high-ranking Georgia Republican of using his position to keep an accused child rapist out of prison,"One of the top Republicans in Georgia is accused of abusing his position in order to keep some people out of prison, including an accused child rapist.

Here's what we know

According to a joint investigation by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and WSB-TV, David Ralston, the Republican speaker of Georgia's House of Representatives, used his position to indefinitely delay court dates for a number of alleged criminals, including the following:

David Shell is accused of beating his wife, and locking her in their house so that she could not contact the police. He is also accused of throwing one of his girlfriends to the ground, slapping, and choking her, and beating, head butting, and biting the finger of another girlfriend. He was indicted and charged by a grand jury four years ago with being a repeat offender. Ralston has put off Shell's hearing seven times.

was charged with felony cruelty to children. Ralston delayed this case for nine years, until the district attorney dropped the charge since the victim had by that point left the state. Jason Brothers, a traveling evangelist, is accused of having raped and molested a 14-year-old girl more than five years ago. The girl reported the incident to police five years ago, but the case has been repeatedly postponed by Ralston eight times. ""I had no idea at that point that, all these years later, that we would have so many trial dates that had been canceled,"" the girl's mother told WSB. ""Every time we get our hopes up to get some release from the past and to be able to move on, you know, it's always a setback."" She said that she thought the delays were intentional.

When the Atlanta Journal-Constitution asked Shell about these accusations, he told them, ""That's why I gave [Ralston] 20,000 bucks,"" adding, ""He's worth every penny of it.""

In addition to being speaker of the House since 2010, Ralston is also an attorney. Shell hired Ralston to defend him during the trial. So did the other accused criminals mentioned above. But instead of going to trial and fighting for his clients, Ralston continually tells the court that his responsibilities as speaker conflict with various court dates, leading to repeated delays. Georgia law requires judges and prosecutors to give allowances for attorneys who also serve in the General Assembly.

Since Ralston is speaker, he has duties that fall outside of the normal legislative session, meaning he could technically call for a delay of trial at virtually any time.



The Journal-Constitution and WSB found 93 days when Ralston said he was unavailable for court appearances for his clients. Out of these 76 — 82 percent — did not occur during the General Assembly's legislative session. The two news outlets conducting this investigation requested his schedule for the past three years to prove that he had a reason to postpone each of these court dates, but Ralston refused. And under Georgia state law, he has that right.

""Please be advised that I am hereby requesting a continuance of these three cases from the criminal calendar call,"" Ralston wrote in one letter obtained by the Journal-Constitution. ""I hereby certify to the Court that my legislative duties and obligations will require that I be elsewhere on that date.""

What did Ralston say?

In a statement to the Journal-Constitution, Ralston defended these cancellations:

Legislative leave is a long-established provision of Georgia law which recognizes the unique needs of a citizen-legislature and protects the independence of the legislative branch of state government. Like other members of the General Assembly, I utilize this provision outside of the legislative session, when necessary, to attend to my legislative duties as both a state representative and Speaker of the House. I'm honored to serve the members of the House of Representatives and to be one of 236 citizen-legislators serving our great state. I appreciate that I'm not the only one who must balance the responsibilities of my profession and my elected office.

In 2016, the State Bar of Georgia publicly reprimanded Ralston for delaying a client's case while he was loaning money to that client. In this instance, Ralston settled and ""admitted that he had inadvertently violated two State Bar Rules,"" according to the Journal-Constitution.

Shell, who remains a free man, was surprisingly open with the newspaper. The kind of openness that might be a boon for prosecutors if his case ever went to trial. But he didn't seem too worried.

""The longer things wait, the less you remember,"" he told the paper. ""People move away — they've gone. And if they can't find this girl — which I don't even know where she's at anymore anyway — and when it comes to court and they ain't got a witness or whatever, what are they going to do then?""

What else?

Ralston has faced backlash since this investigation came out, from both sides of the aisle.

According to Levin, China is looking to beef up its air and naval forces to prepare for conflict with the United States, rendering its need for fortified ground forces a low-level need for national security.

Levin added that after eight years of former President Barack Obama, the Chinese military is leapfrogging the United States.

Biden/Harris campaign ignites controversy over conflicting stance toward the Green New Deal,"Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Vice President Mike Pence went toe-to-toe on the vice presidential debate stage on Wednesday.

Steven Crowder and the ""Louder with Crowder"" crew livestreamed the event and offered an evening of live fact-checking and commentary throughout the debate.

In this clip, moderator Susan Page of USA Today asked Harris about the stance a Biden-Harris administration would take regarding the Green New Deal.

""Vice President Biden said he did not support the Green New Deal, but if you look at the Biden-Harris campaign website, it describes the Green New Deal as a 'crucial framework.' What exactly would be the stance of a Biden-Harris administration toward the Green New Deal?"" the moderator asked.

""I will repeat, and as the American people already know, Joe Biden will not ban fracking,"" Harris replied.

Crowder jumped in, reminding his audience of the past when Biden stated he would end fracking. Harris also told her constituents there is ""no question"" she favors fracking.

Jordan Peterson Explains Why Conservatives and Liberals Need Each Other (2017),"Steven Crowder interviewed psychologist Jordan Peterson and discussed Peterson's theory about why conservatives and liberals need each other.

Peterson, a Canadian clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, expressed his long-held belief that if enough people grow up and live properly, carefully, and awake while applying acquired knowledge of the history and doctrine of their civilization, they have a better chance of avoiding polarization.

According to Peterson, individuals can be temperamentally conservative and temperamentally liberal as both are ""valid viewpoints because there is a place for those viewpoints on the world."" But, If you are conservative, you have to listen to the liberals because they have something to tell you. And the liberals have to listen to the ""conservatives because conservatives hold things together and stabilize things.""

""The reason free speech is so important, is that liberals and conservatives have to communicate in order to keep society going,"" Peterson expressed. ""Communication is essential to free speech. You have to be able to talk to each other or else you separate into armed camps and either one becomes the other's slave, one becomes a tyrant, or there is conflict.""

Egypt and Israel are increasing oil exports to Europe to compensate for the EU's embargo on Russian fuel products,"On Wednesday, the countries of Egypt and Israel penned a deal with the European Union to increase liquid natural gas sales to EU member states that are hoping to reduce their dependency on petroleum-based fuel products from Russia.

The deal, which was finalized in a ritzy Egyptian hotel, will require Israel to send gas to Egypt for it to be liquified and then shipped to EU member states, according to European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, ABC News reported.

“What a special moment,” von der Leyen proclaimed in a joint press conference alongside representatives of the Egyptian and Israeli governments. “I very warmly welcome the signing of this historic agreement.”

It is not currently clear how much gas will be imported by EU member states from either Egypt or Israel.

Von der Leyen indicated that this new agreement is part of Europe’s ongoing efforts to diversify energy sources away from Russian imports. It highlights an active attempt by the EU to import hydrocarbons from what is labeled “other trustworthy suppliers.”

Von der Leyen indicated that Israel and Egypt are ideal suppliers because of their good relations with EU member states and since both countries discovered large supplies of natural gas off shore.

This new deal will also help Egypt and Israel increase their gas production and drilling explorations in their territorial waters.

During a separate press conference with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, von der Leyen said, “It is known that the Russian war against Ukraine has exposed our European dependency on Russian fossil fuels, and we want to get rid of this dependency.”

In 2021, the EU imported roughly 40% of its gas from Russia and has had immense difficulty imposing sanctions on Russian fuel imports since Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated his country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Israeli Energy Minister Karin Elharrar said the new arrangement was a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which resulted in a widespread European energy crisis. She said that the agreement also highlights the increasing cooperation and further strengthening of relations between Egypt and Israel, two nations that used to be enemies.

Elharrar said, “This is a statement to those who see in our region only negative forces such as division and conflict. This (memorandum of understanding) shows us that we are paving a new path of partnership, solidarity, and sustainability.”

Egypt’s Petroleum Minister Tarek el-Molla said that the deal is “an important milestone” for cooperation between the three parties.",https://www.theblaze.com/louder-with-crowder/biden-harris-campaign-ignites-controversy-over-conflicting-stance-toward-the-green-new-deal,2022-06-15
"Leftist prosecutors refuse to enforce abortion bans, setting up conflict with pro-life states","Dozens of locally elected prosecutors from all over the country, many from Democratic areas within red states, are refusing to enforce abortion restrictions that have now been legalized following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

After the court overturned its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision Friday — permitting pro-life state legislatures to enact abortion restrictions — 90 elected prosecutors collectively representing more than 91.5 million people from 31 states and territories and the District of Columbia declared their intention to ignore pro-life laws restricting abortion, calling them ""a mockery of justice.""

""We stand together in our firm belief that prosecutors have a responsibility to refrain from using limited criminal legal system resources to criminalize personal medical decisions,"" the prosecutors said in a joint statement organized by Fair and Just Prosecution, a left-leaning legal nonprofit.



""As such, we decline to use our offices' resources to criminalize reproductive heath decisions and commit to exercise our well-settled discretion and refrain from prosecuting those who seek, provide, or support abortions,"" the statement reads.

The actions of these pro-abortion attorneys will escalate a growing conflict between liberal prosecutors who support abortion rights and pro-life state attorneys general and legislatures who, in accordance with the will of voters, enact restrictions on abortion.

Many of the prosecutors who signed on to the joint statement are from 12 states where abortion is now banned or likely to be banned, including Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and others. They argue that prosecutorial discretion permits them to prioritize other crimes instead of pursuing cases against abortion providers.

Pro-life advocates harshly criticized their position. James Bopp Jr., the general counsel of the National Right to Life Committee, said the prosecutors' statement was ""anti-democratic"" in a statement to CNN. His organization has published model legislation for pro-life lawmakers that would enable state attorneys general to take up abortion cases when local prosecutors refuse to do so.

""They were not elected to decide what the law was,"" Bopp told CNN. ""If they don't want to enforce these laws, then we'll have somebody else do it.""

Some state attorneys general already possess the power to override local prosecutors. Alabama and Arizona are two states, among others, where the attorney general holds the power to supersede local prosecutors for any reason, according to Emory Law Journal. They each have elected Republican attorneys general and have laws banning abortion that may take effect after the Supreme Court's decision.

Florida, Michigan, and several other states give broad powers to state officials to override local prosecutors when they deem it to be in the public interest, Politico reported.

Republicans have criticized the abuse of prosecutorial discretion by Democratic prosecutors.

""We have no doubt they are sincere in their pledge to not do their jobs,"" a spokeswoman for Georgia attorney general Chris Carr told the Center Square after local district attorneys said they would not enforce the state's heartbeat bill.

""It's a dereliction of duty for district attorneys and solicitors to pre-emptively pick and choose which laws they will enforce,"" Carr spokeswoman Kara Richardson said. ""It undermines the rule of law and erodes our system of self-governance.""",https://www.theblaze.com/louder-with-crowder/steven-crowder-2649784490,2022-06-30
YMCA pool bans 80-year-old woman after she demands transgender staff member leave locker room where little girls are undressing,"An 80-year-old Washington state woman has reportedly been banned from her local YMCA after she expressed extreme discomfort when a transgender staff member entered the women's locker room while young girls were undressing.

Julie Jaman, a resident of Port Townsend, Washington, told the Port Townsend Free Press that she was asked to leave the YMCA facilities at Mountain View pool after she demanded that a male wearing a female bathing suit be removed from the women's locker room, where she had been showering and a group of girls were changing out of their swimwear. A YMCA employee reportedly told Jaman she was discriminating against the transgender individual and threatened to call the police on her. In response, Jaman promptly left and filed her own complaint with the police department.

The incident occurred on July 26, when Jaman says she was swimming at Mountain View Pool, as was her weekly habit for 35 years. While showering after her weekly swim, Jaman said she heard a man's voice. Peering past the shower curtain, Jaman says she saw a male wearing a female bathing suit in the women's locker room ""looking at the little girls as they were taking off their suits.""

This person was identified by the Free Press as Clementine Adams, a YMCA staff member who identifies as transgender and female. Jaman said Adams was not wearing any staff identification at the time.

""There were gaps in the curtain and there I was, naked, with soap and water on me, and this guy, right there, very close to me,"" Jaman said. ""I asked, ‘Do you have a penis?’ He said, ‘That’s none of your business.’ That’s when I told him, ‘Get out of here, right now.’”

YMCA aquatic instructor Rowen DeLuna was also present in the locker room. Jaman reportedly approached DeLuna and demanded that Adams be removed from the locker room. Instead, DeLuna told Jaman, ""You're discriminating and you can't use the pool anymore and I'm calling the police,"" according to Jaman.

Stunned, Jaman dried herself, dressed, and prepared to leave. As she was at the door, DeLuna reportedly told her she was not abiding by the YMCA's principles and values. DeLuna and another YMCA employee also reportedly told her she could not leave.

""Bulls**t! I’m going to the police right now. I want help and I need it immediately,” Jaman told the YMCA staff members.

Police records reported by the Free Press confirm that both Jaman and a YMCA employee contacted the department about the incident.

A call report from Officer Marc Titterness said that Jaman ""had an emotional response to a strange male being in the bathroom and helping a young girl take off her bathing suit.""

The report also said an anonymous YMCA employee told police, ""Clementine was in the bathroom with a child in the day camp and Julie asked if she had a penis and started screaming at her to get out.""

In another call obtained by the Free Press, the YMCA employee said that ""Julie"" has ""been asked to leave and is refusing.""

A third call by the YMCA employee alleged that Jaman ""was screaming at employee and calling names and refusing to leave.""

After the incident, Jaman reportedly spoke with Wendy Bart, the CEO of the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, who gave a conflicting account of what happened.

Bart stood by the actions of her staff, including banning Jaman from the pool. Bart also said a staff member told her that Jaman had directed vulgar language at Adams, saying, ""You’re going to stick your f***ing penis in those little girls.""

Jaman vigorously denies she said anything of the kind. ""I am an 80-year-old woman and I do not talk like that,"" she told the Substack ""The Distance.""

No charges have been filed against Jaman, who since the incident has been protesting YMCA locker room and bathroom policies.



In public comments to the Port Townsend City Council on Aug. 1, Jaman said that ""women and children are being put at risk"" by the ""neo-cultural gender rules"" at the YMCA.



In written comments, she said, ""The YMCA policies on gender identity use 'pride' as a euphemism to prevent discrimination against one group of people but at the expense of another group — women who don’t want to use all-gender bathing/dressing areas. Although the Y does check to see if pool patrons have been convicted of sex crimes, there is danger in how the Olympic Y is furthering this policy of nondiscrimination, the potential of undignified/illegal behavior for lack of separate facilities. The policy fails to be inclusive at Mt View pool — women are now at risk of unwanted exposure to the opposite sex — object and you will no longer be allowed to use the pool. Is this how the Y intends to secure the safety and dignity of all its patrons — a YMCA principle?""

She suggested that the YMCA should provide an all-gender changing area in addition to gender-segregated changing facilities to accommodate everyone who wants to use the pool.

""The YMCA should immediately post clear signage indicating the existing dressing/shower rooms will be used by the opposite sex who gender identify differently. Also, all parents who send their children to YMCA programs should be informed that men who identify as women are allowed to accompany little girls into the dressing and bathroom areas,"" she wrote.

However, Council Member Libby Urner Wennstrom responded by calling on the City Council to ""take a stand against hate speech and discrimination against transgender people and to formally support the Y and its staff in their efforts to ensure everyone feels welcome to use our public pool.""

Council Member Aislinn Diamanti then apologized ""to all trans people"" who had to listen to Jaman and other members of the public who used the wrong pronouns in their comments.

""Just to participate in this public meeting they had to sit through that and that made me really sad,"" Diamanti said. Mayor David Faber added that as the chairman of the meeting, he wanted to ""err on the side of open discussion, but that was getting very close to really stepping over the line for me.""

The Olympic Peninsula YMCA also responded in an Aug. 1 statement affirming the organization's commitment to being ""inclusive.""

""We will not tolerate bias, hatred, or discrimination that leads to the oppression of individuals or communities. We will ensure sustained and meaningful progress toward equity and human dignity for all,"" the YMCA said.

The YMCA cited Washington state law that guarantees the right of transgender people to use gender-segregated facilities according to their self-declared gender identity, including restrooms, locker rooms, dressing rooms, and homeless or emergency shelters.

""The Y will uphold and respect this law in regards to YMCA staff, members, and program participants that use Mountain View Pool. At the Y, our goal is to provide an atmosphere free from discrimination, hatred, derogatory or unwelcome comments, intimidation, or actions based on an individual’s sex, age, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression or any other legally protected status,"" the statement read.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657514790,2022-08-08
"124 retired generals and admirals say US in 'deep peril' under Biden, warn of his 'mental' condition","More than 120 retired generals and admirals have signed a letter saying that the U.S. is in ""deep peril"" under the leadership of President Joe Biden, specifically warning that the mental condition of the nation's oldest commander in chief ""cannot be ignored.""

What are the details?

The letter was released by Flag Officers 4 America, and was signed by 124 retired ""military officers entitled to carry a flag indicating their rank,"" The Daily Caller noted.

It begins, ""Our Nation is in deep peril. We are in a fight for our survival as a Constitutional Republic like no other time since our founding in 1776. The conflict is between supporters of Socialism and Marxism vs. supporters of Constitutional freedom and liberty.""

The retired military leaders went on to say that ""without fair and honest elections that accurately reflect the 'will of the people' our Constitutional Republic is lost,"" saying that ""aside from the election, the Current Administration has launched a full-blown assault on our Constitutional rights in a dictatorial manner, bypassing the Congress, with more than 50 Executive Orders quickly signed.""

At the end of a long list of bullet points citing ""additional national security issues and actions,"" Flag Officers 4 America wrote:

""The mental and physical condition of the Commander in Chief cannot be ignored. He must be able to quickly make accurate national security decisions involving life and limb anywhere, day or night. Recent Democrat leadership's inquiries about nuclear code procedures sends a dangerous national security signal to nuclear armed adversaries, raising the question about who is in charge. We must always have an unquestionable chain of command.""

The officials ended the letter with a call for action, urging ""all citizens to get involved now at the local, state and/or national level to elect political representatives who will act to Save America, our Constitutional Republic, and hold those currently in office accountable,"" concluding, ""The 'will of the people' must be heard and followed.""

What else?

Biden, 78, is the oldest American president to ever be elected, and he faced questions from opponents during both the Democratic primary and the general election over his mental fitness for office.

A White House spokesperson told People magazine Wednesday that Biden ""is planning to have a checkup later this year, and the results will be made public.""

The outlet noted that White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters last week that the administration ""will be transparent"" to reporters about the results of Biden's first physical when it happens.

People also reported that ""Biden similarly promised during the 2020 campaign to be 'totally transparent in terms of my health.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657593491,2021-05-13
"More than 3,000 ISIS members surrender to US-backed forces in Syria","More than 3,000 ISIS members have surrendered to U.S.-backed Syrian forces in the town of Baghouz.

""Number of Daesh members surrendered to us since yesterday evening has risen to 3000. 3 Yazidi women and 4 children were rescued, too,"" Syrian Democratic Forces spokesman Mustafa Bali tweeted Tuesday.

The ISIS fighters and family members were part of the last holdout group that the Kurdish-led SDF had been flushing out in attacks in the region over the past three days, the Washington Examiner reported. In 2014, ISIS had declared itself a caliphate as it began taking over large areas in Syria and Iraq.



""The objective of our advance is to terrorise IS fighters so they surrender, and for the civilians to come out,"" SDF Unit Commander Ali Cheir said before the terrorists surrendered Tuesday, according to the report.

Huge clouds of black smoke and fire filled the skies above the ISIS encampment in Baghouz as it came under fire for the three nights in a row. The eastern village is the last bit of territory in Syria and Iraq that had been claimed by ISIS.

At least 38 terrorists were killed during attacks at two weapons depots earlier in the day, CNN reported.

ISIS video encourages members to stay strong

On Tuesday, ISIS released a 2-minute video purportedly recorded in Baghouz, The Guardian reported.

A militant, who identified himself as Abu Abid al-Azeem urges ISIS followers to remain steadfast.

""What is our guilt? What is our crime?"" al-Azeem said. ""Why are we bombed by planes, why do all the nations of the unbelieving world come together to fight us? Why are we besieged, why are we bombarded day and night, and the world is silent, instead gathering together to fight and make war on us? We wanted to apply sharia law. Tomorrow, God willing, we will be in paradise, and they will be burning in hell.""

What else?

In January, the U.S. began withdrawing troops from Syria following President Donald Trump drawdown order in December.

Trump's decision drew criticism from top military officials who said the U.S. would be abandoning its local Kurdish allies.

He later tweeted that ""we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!""

In February, the president predicted that ISIS would be eliminated within days.



""It should be formally announced sometime, probably next week, that we will have 100 percent of the caliphate,"" Trump said, according to NBC News.

At the time, U.S. officials said that the terrorists had lost all but two square miles of territory in Syria.

Trump later reversed his decision to withdraw all troops from the region. A few hundred American troops would remain for a period of time, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Feb. 22.

A bipartisan group of senators including applauded the move in a letter to the president.

""It is a tremendous accomplishment to defeat the caliphate, and we join you in deep appreciation fro the efforts of our military and our allies,"" the group wrote in the letter. ""Our goal now must be to ensure ISIS is not able to regenerate and pose a threat to American security here at home or abroad.""

""Like you, we seek to ensure that all of the gains made in Syria are not lost, that ISIS never returns, that Iran is not emboldened, and that we consolidate our gains and ensure the best outcome in Geneva for American interests,"" the letter continued.

""I agree 100% — All is being done,"" Trump wrote in a response directly on the letter and signed it.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657827809,2019-03-13
"43-year-old school administrator raped student, furnished minors with alcohol, investigators say","A school administrator in Georgia who has spent more than two decades in her position has been charged with statutory rape, child molestation, and furnishing minors with alcohol following a Halloween party that allegedly took place a few weeks ago.

On November 9, Murray County Schools Superintendent Steve Loughridge contacted Sheriff Jimmy Davenport to investigate a complaint he had received from a parent, alleging that minors had been furnished with alcohol at a recent Halloween party.

Because the sheriff's office provides resource officers to the school district, Davenport feared a conflict of interest. So he handed off the investigation to the Conasauga District Attorney's Office. What the D.A.'s office found is quite disturbing.

According to reports, Rachelle Louise Terry, 43, of the Murray County School District attended a Halloween party with minor students whom she supplied with alcoholic beverages. Even worse, she allegedly had a sexual relationship with one of the students at the party as well.

The exact date and location of the party are both unknown.

The day before Thanksgiving, Terry — who lives in Chatsworth, Georgia, about 90 miles north of Atlanta — turned herself in to Murray County Jail on five counts of purchasing alcohol for minors and five counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. She has also been charged with child molestation and statutory rape.

The age of consent in Georgia is 16, and any sexual relationship between a school staff member and a student is generally illegal. However, Georgia law reportedly stipulates that, in order to violate that law with a student at least 16 years of age, school administrators or teachers must have ""supervisory or disciplinary authority"" over that student. The age of the alleged victims in this case and their connection to Terry remain unknown.

Terry, who is married, is listed as the director of federal programs and enrollment for MCSD. The Daily Mail reports that she has held the position for 22 years and earns approximately $110,000 a year.

District spokeswoman Derichia Lynch confirmed that Terry has been placed on paid administrative leave, pending further investigation.

""Because she is under contract, her leave must be with pay until a hearing can be conducted,"" Lynch stated.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has also been apprised of the allegations and is asking for tips.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/124-retired-generals-and-admirals-say-us-in-deep-peril-under-biden-warn-of-his-mental-condition,2022-12-04
San Francisco 49ers display Black Lives Matter flag at stadium next to the US and California flags,"The San Francisco 49ers flew the Black Lives Matter flag outside Levi's Stadium on Monday in support of the social justice protests that have taken place across the country since former Minneapolis Police Department officers killed George Floyd in May, NBC Sports reported.

The 49ers, which previously employed former quarterback-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick, posted a picture of the Black Lives Matter flag flying next to the American flag and the California state flag with the caption ""indivisible with liberty and justice for all.""

Although major American professional sports leagues are still on hiatus due to COVID-19, the recent racial unrest in the U.S. leads to questions about what role political activism will play in sports when they do return.

The most prominent and divisive sports protests in recent memory, kneeling during the national anthem, could potentially become source of debate and controversy whenever the NFL and NBA resume play. President Donald Trump recently weighed in on that issue again.

""I said 'where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking,'"" Trump said during his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday. ""We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud, and we will stand tall.""

Trump was responding to previous comments from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, which seemed to suggest he was now going to be more supportive of peaceful protests in the league.

""I personally protest with you, and want to be part of the much-needed change in this country,"" Goodell said. ""We the National Football League admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest.""

The prerogative of NFL players to kneel in protest during the national anthem has been a source of conflict between the players and the league for years. Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem in 2016 to protest police brutality and other racial and social injustices.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/3000-isis-members-surrender-in-syria,2020-06-23
73% of Americans agree that extreme political views are hyped by misinformation — like that pushed by the liberal media in these 5 instances,"The latest Pearson Institute/AP-NORC survey was published on Thursday, revealing that Americans overwhelmingly agree that misinformation is a problem. Of the 1,003 adults aged 18 and older who were interviewed between September 9 and September 12, 77% agreed that ""misinformation increases hate crimes"" and 73% agreed it increases ""extreme political views.""

Sheila Kohanteb, forum executive director at the Pearson Institute for Study and Resolution of Global Conflict, said, ""The public continues to see misinformation as a significant problem that is impacting them personally.""



""Many are also worried about the impact on democracy including the ways misinformation fuel hate crimes and extreme political beliefs,"" Kohanteb added.

David Sterrett, senior research scientist with the AP-NORC Center, said of the results, ""There is a consensus among people, regardless of their partisanship, age, or race and ethnicity, that misinformation is a problem.""

MediaWise's director, Alex Mahadevan, suggested that ""uncertainty, polarization, [and] the decline of local news"" have brought about a ""perfect storm that's created a flood of misinformation.""

While the AP assigned blame to ""online misinformation,"" this universal concern over the veracity of false claims and their fallout was no doubt exacerbated in part by a myriad of consequential lies advanced by the establishment media in recent months and years.

Here are five instances where impactful false claims were advanced or amplified by liberal mainstream news organizations.

1. Russian Collusion Hoax



Claim: Then-candidate and later-President Donald Trump and his team conspired with the Russians to secure victory in the 2016 presidential election.

Impact: The false narrative and its supporting claims ultimately resulted in the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller; a two-year-long $32 million Russia probe; a midterm Democratic House victory; a distracted, investigation-addled presidency; and over 55% of Democrats left believing it to be true.

Facts: Special Counsel Robert Mueller's 2019 report cleared the Trump campaign, indicating that neither the president nor his team had conspired with the Russians during the 2016 election.

The Russian source of some of the rumors that were widely circulated about Trump is presently on trial and the Steele dossier, which the FBI used to spy on Trump, has been discredited.

2. Hunter Biden laptop story



Claim: The Hunter Biden laptop story initially reported on by the New York Post is Russian disinformation, ""unverifiable,"" and the libelous work of the Trump campaign.

Impact: The media, aided by Big Tech censorship and elements of the intelligence community antipathetic to Trump, successfully downplayed the implications of the damning evidence discovered on Hunter Biden's laptop, which he abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop.

The repair shop's owner received countless death threats and was roundly castigated.

Then-candidate Joe Biden won the 2020 election. A recent TechnoMetrica Institute of Policy and Politics poll found that 79% of respondents indicated that “a truthful interpretation of the laptop” by the media would have resulted in Trump's reelection.

Facts: The laptop's authenticity and its contents were verified by the liberal media after the election.

3. 'Fiery, But Mostly Peaceful' riots

Claim: The BLM riots ""were largely peaceful.""

Impact: This and other coordinated efforts to downplay violence committed by BLM rioters allegedly eliminated pressure on politicians to take action while also generating greater distrust in the news media.

Facts: In September 2020, Axios reported that the BLM riots incurred $1 billion in damage and was the ""most expensive in insurance history."" Other estimates put the cost closer to $2 billion.

Of the 8,700 BLM-related events, 574 involved violent acts in over 140 cities, including shootings, arson, looting, vehicular crimes, and explosions.

RealClear Investigations reported that between 6 and 20 persons were killed in the riots.

1 police officer was killed and 2,037 officers were assaulted or injured. 16,241 arrests were made.

4. Deaths at the Jan. 6 Capitol protests

Claim: Five cops were killed by Trump supporters on January 6, 2021, one of whom was bludgeoned to death.

Impact: Liberal outlets' suggestion that protesters killed police at or as the result of the Capitol protests lent credibility to those who repeated the lie for political advantage, including the president, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and January 6 committee panel chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.).

Facts: The only person killed at the Capitol was a protester, U.S. Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt, who was gunned down by Capitol police Lt. Michael Byrd.

No police officers died in the line of duty during the Capitol protests.



Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who was claimed to have been killed in or as the result of the fracas, returned to headquarters in ""good condition"" after the incident, but suffered two strokes the following day, reportedly dying of natural causes.

5. Nick Sandmann

Claim: Then-16-year-old Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann tried to intimidate a native American Vietnam War veteran when attending the March for Life at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. When the native elder sought to peacefully march by, Sandmann blocked his way and then prevented him from retreating. At some stage, Sandmann or one of his peers chanted ""build the wall.""

Impact: Sandmann was defamed as a ""racist kid,"" received death threats, and was the subject of vicious, violent rhetoric amplified by celebrities and others online.

CNN, the Washington Post, and NBC were among the outfits that had to settle multimillion-dollar defamation suits filed by Sandmann.

Facts: While waiting for their bus to arrive, Sandmann and his peers were targeted by a nearby group of black Hebrew Israelites, who leveled at them a litany of vulgar, racist remarks. Sandmann reportedly nonverbally motioned for one of his peers to stop engaging with one of Phillips' alleged associates, then nonconfrontationally stood in place.



Nathan Phillips, who is not a Vietnam War veteran, approached Sandmann, banging his drum just inches from the teen's face.

An independent investigation concluded there was no evidence that Sandmann and fellow students used ""offensive or racist"" statements. It also found that Phillips' account of the incident contained ""some inconsistencies.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/43-year-old-school-administrator-raped-student-furnished-minors-with-alcohol-investigators-say,2022-10-14
"'A First Amendment victory': Christian baker can refuse to make a cake for lesbian wedding, California court says","A Christian baker can refuse to make a cake for an event, such as a same-sex wedding, that conflicts with her religious beliefs, a California judge has determined.

In 2017, Cathy Miller — the owner of Tastries Bakery and Boutique in Bakersfield, California — was approached to bake a customized cake for an upcoming lesbian wedding. Because the event conflicted with Miller's Christian beliefs regarding the nature of marriage, she refused to lend her artistry to a customized cake. However, she did offer the couple, Eileen and Mireya Rodriguez-del Rio, two alternatives: She could bake them a generic, pre-made cake that would not require her personal artistry, or she could recommend to them other bakeries which could accommodate their request.

Miller's attorneys at the Thomas More Society claim that after this ""polite refusal,"" Miller was then ""targeted by gay activists"" and sued for discrimination by the state Department of Fair Housing and Employment.

In multiple lawsuits, the DFHE argued that, by denying the lesbian couple a customized cake, Tastries and Cathy’s Creations Inc. had violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act, a California law passed in 1959 and since expanded to protect consumers against discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or religion.

Paul Jonna, TMS special counsel and partner at LiMandri & Jonna LLP, noted that there is ""a certain irony ... that a law intended to protect individuals from religious discrimination was used to discriminate against Cathy for her religious beliefs.""

And, based on excerpts of cross-examination from the civil trial held in July, it appears that the state's attorneys did indeed ""discriminate against Cathy,"" probing her about the depth and sincerity of her Christian beliefs. According to a statement from TMS, attorney for the state Gregory Mann even asked Miller whether she adhered to Old Testament dietary laws ""in terms of not eating pigs, not eating shellfish, et cetera"" in an effort to cast doubt on Miller's testimony that she does her ""best"" to follow ""everything that the Bible says.""

Despite the state's best legal efforts, Judge Eric Bradshaw of the Superior Court of California in Kern County ruled in favor of Miller. The DFHE ""is barred by defendants' rights to Free Speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution from enforcing the Unruh Civil Rights Act to compel or prohibit defendants' speech,"" Bradshaw's ruling said in part.

TMS, which provided legal counsel to Miller pro bono, has celebrated the ruling as ""a First Amendment victory.""

""The freedom to practice one’s religion is enshrined in the First Amendment, and the United States Supreme Court has long upheld the freedom of artistic expression,"" said Charles LiMandri, special counsel at TMS and partner at LiMandri & Jonna LLP.

Miller has always insisted that she never meant to discriminate against anyone. She wanted only to run her business in accordance with the precepts of her religion. Back in 2017, she told news reporters, ""Here at Tastries, we love everyone. My husband and I are Christians, and we know that God created everyone, and He created everyone equal, so it's not that we don't like people of certain groups. There is just certain things that violate my conscience.""

The Associated Press reported that Eileen and Mireya Rodriguez-del Rio expect the decision to be appealed.

A GOP Senate chair is investigating Hunter Biden's business dealings in China,"A Republican senator will investigate whether Hunter Biden's business dealings with a Chinese company while his father, Joe, was vice president created a conflict of interest and possible national security issues, according to the Washington Free Beacon.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has received a classified briefing on the matter that was put together by officials from the Treasury Department, Commerce Department, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

The briefing contains information about Hunter Biden's role with BHR Partners, a Chinese equity firm at which Biden sat on the board. BHR was created through a deal between Chinese financiers and Rosemont Seneca Partners, a U.S. investment firm that Biden had a stake in.

""Chairman Grassley intends to review additional material and will contact the agencies with follow-up questions in the coming weeks,"" said Grassley communications director Michael Zona.

Biden joined the BHR board in 2013. In 2015, BHR, in partnership with the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, acquired the U.S. auto company Henniges Automotive for $600 million. Henniges produces technologies that have military applications. The Aviation Industry Corporation of China has been suspected in the past of hacking U.S. networks to steal military airplane designs for their own use.

At the time of that deal, John Kerry was secretary of state, and had to approve the transaction. Christopher Heinz, Kerry's stepson, worked with Biden at Rosemont Seneca.

Grassley first raised questions about the transaction in August, concerned that the influence of Obama administration officials might have pressured the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to approve the deal. CFIUS evaluates such deals for potential national security implications.

""There is cause for concern that potential conflicts of interest could have influenced CFIUS approval of the Henniges transaction,"" Grassley wrote. ""Accordingly, Congress and the public must fully understand the decision-making process that led to the Henniges approval and the extent to which CFIUS fully considered the transaction's national security risks.""

Biden stepped down from the board of BHR earlier this month, although he did not sell his 10 percent stake in the company. Through a statement by his lawyer, George Mesires, he denied any wrongdoing.

Editor's note: This article has been updated to remove a sentence stating that Christopher Heinz was involved with the BHR acquisition of Henniges Automotive. Heinz worked with Hunter Biden at Rosemont Seneca, but was not involved with the the aforementioned deal.

"Antifa member suspected of killing Aaron Danielson killed during attempted arrest by FBI, US Marshals","Michael Forest Reinoehl, the Antifa member who was suspected of killing a Trump-supporting demonstrator in Portland, was killed by law enforcement agents who came to arrest him in Washington state Thursday, Fox News reported.

A federal fugitive task force comprised of FBI agents, U.S. Marshals, Lakewood Police, Pierce County Sheriff's deputies, and the Washington State Department of Corrections was attempting to arrest Reinoehl on a murder warrant for the Aug. 29 killing of Aaron Danielson, who was a supporter of the conservative group Patriot Prayer.

What happened?

Reinoehl reportedly pulled a weapon when he was confronted by law enforcement, and multiple officers opened fire.



""Initial reports indicate the suspect produced a firearm, threatening the lives of law enforcement officers,"" a statement by the U.S. Marshals Service said. ""Task force members responded to the threat and struck the suspect who was pronounced dead at the scene.""

Thurston County Sheriff's Office Lt. Ray Brady told the New York Times that four officers shot at Reinoehl.

How did we get here?

A pro-Trump caravan drove through Portland, Oregon, on Aug. 29, at the same time as Black Lives Matter and Antifa were protesting. The two groups clashed downtown, and Danielson, who was wearing a Patriot Prayer hat and a Blue Lives Matter satchel, was shot in the chest and killed.



Those who were with Danielson at the time believe they were targeted for their conservative beliefs.

""We have a First Amendment in this country,"" Chandler Pappas told the Common Sense Conservative. ""And for whatever reason, there seems to be this opposition that thinks we can't do that. They have been attacking us for years. Really for decades in the grand scheme of things but very heavily in Portland.""

Conflicts, sometimes violent, between right- and left-wing groups have been an ongoing issue in Portland for years.

Admitted to the shooting?

A Vice News interview with Reinoehl was published earlier the same day he was killed. Reinoehl told Vice he believed he was being hunted.



Reinoehl also said he believed he killed Danielson in self-defense because he and his friend were about to be attacked.

""You know, lots of lawyers suggest that I shouldn't even be saying anything, but I feel it's important that the world at least gets a little bit of what's really going on,"" Reinoehl told Vice. ""I had no choice. I mean, I had a choice. I could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color. But I wasn't going to do that.""

Reinoehl described himself as ""100% Antifa all the way"" on social media and expressed a willingness to ""fight for my brothers and sisters.""

""We do not want violence but we do not run from it either!"" he wrote in a June 16 social media post.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-first-amendment-victory-christian-baker-can-refuse-to-make-a-cake-for-lesbian-wedding-california-court-says,2020-09-04
ABC issues public apology for passing off video of a Kentucky gun range as 'Slaughter in Syria',"ABC News issued an apology Monday for using footage of a Kentucky gun range and passing it off to be footage of a violent clash in Syria.

According to Becket Adams at the Washington Examiner, ABC's segment on ""Slaughter in Syria"" featured the footage.

What are the details?

ABC aired the footage on Sunday and Monday, purporting it to be feature footage from northern Syria.

Video of the deadly clash between the Syrian Kurds and the invading Turks turned out to be nothing more than a nighttime machine gun demonstration from Knob Creek Gun Range in West Point, Kentucky, according to the outlet.

The network has issued an apology for its mistake and yanked the video.

A network representative told the Examiner in a statement about the decision to take down the video.

""We've taken down video that aired on 'World News Tonight Sunday' and 'Good Morning America' this morning that appeared to be from the Syrian border immediately after questions were raised about its accuracy,"" the spokesperson said. ""ABC News regrets the error.""

A spokesperson for Knob Creek Gun Range also told the outlet that they're doing an investigation of their own into the incident.

""As of right now,"" the representative added, ""it seems to be our footage.""

On Sunday, NBC's Tom Llamas showed the video, claiming that it portrayed the conflict between the Turks and the Kurds.

""The situation rapidly spiraling out of control in northern Syria,"" Llamas said Sunday night, ""one week since President Trump ordered U.S. forces out of that region, effectively abandoning America's allies in the fight against [the Islamic State].""

""This video right here appears to show Turkey's military bombing Kurd civilians in a Syrian border town,"" he continued. ""The Kurds, who fought alongside the U.S. against ISIS. Now, horrific reports of atrocities committed by Turkish-backed fighters on those very allies.""

On Monday, senior foreign correspondent Ian Pannell introduced the footage on ""Good Morning America.""

""This video, obtained by ABC News, appears to show the fury of the Turkish attack on the border town of Tal Abyad,"" Pannell said.

What else?

""Good Morning America"" later issued a statement of its own via social media.

It read, ""CORRECTION: We've taken down video that aired on 'World News Tonight' Sunday and 'Good Morning America' this morning that appeared to be from the Syrian border immediately after questions were raised about its accuracy.

"Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh puts his money where his mouth is in the abortion debate, offers to adopt unwanted babies: 'Let the unborn be born'","University of Michigan head football coach Jim Harbaugh put his money where his mouth is in the debate over abortion. Harbaugh recently delivered an impassioned defense of the unborn, and offered to adopt any child that was unwanted by his players and staff members.

Harbaugh unapologetically railed against abortion during an interview with ESPN this week, while also advocating for adoption.

""I've told [them] the same thing I tell my kids, boys, the girls, same thing I tell our players, our staff members,"" Harbaugh told ESPN's Gene Wojciechowski. ""I encourage them if they have a pregnancy that wasn't planned, to go through with it, go through with it. Let that unborn child be born, and if at that time, you don't feel like you can care for it, you don't have the means or the wherewithal, then Sarah and I will take that baby.""

At a pro-life fundraising event in Michigan on July 17, Harbaugh and his wife Sarah said they would fight for the unborn.

“I believe in having the courage to let the unborn be born,” Harbaugh said, according to the Detroit Catholic. “I love life. I believe in having a loving care and respect for life and death. My faith and my science are what drive these beliefs in me.""

During the event, Harbaugh read a quote from Jeremiah 1:5: ""Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. Before you were born, I set you apart. I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.""

Harbaugh admitted that the overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court had caused fierce tensions between Americans.

“Passions can make the process messy, but when combined with respect, it ultimately produces the best outcomes,” said Harbaugh – who is a devout Catholic. “This process has been passionate and messy, but I have faith in the American people to ultimately develop the right policies and laws for all lives involved. I recognize one’s personal thinking regarding morality of a particular action may differ from their thinking on whether government should make that action illegal. There are many things one may hold to be immoral, but the government appropriately allows because of some greater good or personal or constitutional right.""

Harbaugh concluded, ""Yes, there are conflicts between the legitimate rights of the mother and the rights of the unborn child. One resolution might involve incredible hardship for the mother, family and society. Another results in the death of an unborn person.""

ESPN asked about his pro-life comments he made earlier this month.

""Faith, family, football ... those are my priorities. I just think that ... the abortion issue is one that's so big that it needs to be talked about,"" Harbaugh declared. ""It needs serious conversation. What do you think? What do I think? What do others think?""

""It's a life-or-death type of issue. And I believe in, and I respect, people's views,"" the football coach explained. ""But let's hear them. Let's discuss them because there's passion on both sides of this issue. So when you combine that with respect, that's when the best results come. ... [I'm] just contributing to that conversation and that communication, which I think is really important, in my opinion.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aaron-danielson-shooting-suspect-killed,2022-07-30
Pro-life group releases satirical video in which men declare that 'abortion rights are pro-choice men's rights',"The pro-life advocacy organization Live Action has released a satirical video that emphasizes how pro-choice men benefit from abortions.

While pro-choice advocates often frame the issue as being about women's rights, the video flips the script.

""Abortion rights are pro-choice men's rights,"" men declare in the video.

""The role of the the government is to make my irresponsible lifestyle sustainable,"" one of the men says. ""The other side will point out that abortion kills a human being. But my right to impregnate a woman and then leave her in the dust outweighs the baby's right to life.""

""I deserve to enjoy sex without commitment, marriage, or parenthood,"" another man says. ""Guys, we're forgetting that abortion is mainly about a man's sexual freedom.""

As the national debate over abortion continues to rage, pro-life advocates are hoping that the Supreme Court will uphold a Mississippi law that would prohibit most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Such a move would at least conflict with the court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, and the court could even overturn Roe entirely, which would represent a tremendous victory for pro-life advocates.

""For decades, we have been told the lie that abortion is a 'woman’s right' and that it offers her freedom and empowerment,"" Live Action founder and president Lila Rose said in a statement to the Daily Wire. ""The truth is that abortion has always been driven primarily by the demands and desires of so-called 'pro-choice' men.""

""Abortion has never been about respecting women, but rather about using a woman’s body for pleasure and then destroying the bodies of her children for profit,"" she said.

""This Live Action video shows the blatant hypocrisy of the multi-billion-dollar abortion industry’s ploy to ‘empower women’, when all it really does is harm her and destroy her innocent child’s life,"" Rose said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abc-issues-public-apology-for-passing-off-video-of-a-kentucky-gun-range-as-slaughter-in-syria,2021-12-11
"Pro-abortion protest in Los Angeles turns violent, at least one police officer injured","A pro-abortion protest in downtown Los Angeles turned into a violent clash with law enforcement after officers were called to disperse the increasingly disruptive crowds, resulting in the injury of at least one officer Tuesday night.

Fox News reported that the police officers were mostly monitoring the crowd, which started as a smaller gathering of around 30 outside the city’s federal courthouse building. As the night went on, the protest grew increasingly rowdy and disruptive. The crowd grew in size and had more than 250 people flooding Los Angeles’ streets and blocking pedestrian traffic.

The protest occurred despite state officials and lawmakers in the state of California vowing to codify the ability of Californians to access abortion in state law.

As the gathering grew in size, its attendees grew increasingly hostile and began throwing objects at the police officers present. The crowd’s violence prompted the Los Angeles Police Department to issue a citywide tactical alert during the heat of the conflict.

Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore said, “We attempted to communicate, clear, and provide dispersal orders to the group.”

The police chief added that the “crowd began to throw rocks and bottles at the officers"" when they were told to disperse.

Moore said that at least one officer from the Los Angeles Police Department was injured by members of the crowd.

At one point, members of the crowd even swarmed the police officers while the officers were in their vehicles.

On Monday, a leaked draft of a Supreme Court decision indicated that the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, the controversial case that led to the proliferation of legalized abortion throughout the U.S.

After the draft leaked, protests were held in major cities throughout the country, seemingly following the lead of pro-abortion advocates who gathered outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday.

After the leak, California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom issued a statement decrying the decision as an “appalling attack on the rights of women.”

Newsom said, “This draft opinion is an appalling attack on the rights of women across this country and if it stands, it will destroy lives and put countless women in danger. It will be the end of fundamental constitutional rights that American women have had for nearly 50 years.”

Newsom continued, “We have a Supreme Court that does not value the rights of women, and a political minority, that will stop at nothing to take those rights away. This won’t stop with choice and the right to privacy. They are undermining progress, and erasing the civil protections and rights so many have fought for over the last half-century.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abortion-jim-harbaugh-adoption-michigan,2022-05-04
"Abraham Lincoln HS in San Francisco may get renamed — iconic president who abolished slavery wasn't woke enough, renaming committee head says","As TheBlaze previously reported, Abraham Lincoln's name — along with the names of dozens of other historical figures with connections to slavery, genocide, or oppression — may soon may be coming off buildings in the San Francisco school district.

Friday is the deadline to have all the names submitted for consideration — and the San Francisco Chronicle shared insights from the man in charge of the renaming committee as to why Lincoln and other figures are on the chopping block — and why others aren't.

What are the details?

""Uprooting the problematic names and symbols that currently clutter buildings, streets, throughout the city is a worthy endeavor,"" Jeremiah Jeffries, chairman of the renaming committee and a first-grade teacher in San Francisco, told the paper. ""Only good can come from the public being reflective and intentional about the power of our words, names, and rhetoric within our public institutions.""

More from the Chronicle:

To many, Lincoln was one of the country's greatest presidents, the Great Emancipator, a beloved historic figure as well as political mentor to his successors, including Barack Obama, who used the Lincoln Bible for his inauguration.



Yet the renaming of Lincoln High School was a slam dunk for the committee, which didn't even discuss it, according to video of the meetings. The members of the committee, appointed by the school board, deemed whether a person's actions or beliefs met the criteria for renaming, and moved on. The committee's spreadsheet with notes on their research listed the federal treatment of Native Americans during his administration as the reason.

""The discussion for Lincoln centered around his treatment of First Nation peoples, because that was offered first,"" Jeffries told the paper. ""Once he met criteria in that way, we did not belabor the point.""

He added to the Chronicle that Lincoln's overall historical legacy is overblown — and even that the Civil War was not fought over slavery or the liberation of black people.

""The history of Lincoln and Native Americans is complicated, not nearly as well known as that of the Civil War and slavery,"" Jeffries told the paper. ""Lincoln, like the presidents before him and most after, did not show through policy or rhetoric that Black lives ever mattered to them outside of human capital and as casualties of wealth building.""

Pushback

""He saved the country from dividing and ruin,"" Harold Holzer, a Lincoln scholar and director of the Hunter College's Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute, told the Chronicle. ""He should be honored for it.""

Holzer added to the paper that Lincoln ""was more progressive than most people. There was pretty rampant hostility [toward Native Americans], and I think Lincoln rose above it. Nobody is going to pass 21st century mores if you're looking at the 18th and 19th centuries.""

More from the Chronicle:

Lincoln's administration supported the Homestead Act of 1862 and transcontinental railroad, which led to the loss of Indigenous peoples' land. Lincoln himself largely delegated the sometimes bloody response to Native American conflicts while focusing on the Civil War, according to historians.



But Lincoln, whose grandfather was killed by a Native American, oversaw the hanging of 38 indigenous warriors after a Santee Sioux uprising in Minnesota, but only after he personally reviewed the legal cases against the 303 men sentenced to death. He saved the lives of 265 Indigenous men.



Lincoln, historians say, was focused on the Civil War and therefore did little to change policies related to Native Americans, but had planned to.



""If we get through the war and I live, this Indian system will be reformed,"" he said. He never got the chance.

But for the renaming committee, Lincoln's treatment of Native Americans was more bad than good — and that's why he made the renaming list, the paper said.

""We asked ourselves, 'Did the name under consideration meet one or more of our criteria?' If that name met criteria, they were put on the list,"" Jeffries told the Chronicle.

The paper said that's exactly the same reason Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's name landed on the renaming list.

After all, Jeffries told the Chronicle, she ""chose to fly a flag that is the iconography of domestic terrorism, racism, white avarice, and inhumanity towards black and indigenous people at the City Hall. She is one of the few living examples on our list, so she still has time to dedicate the rest of her life to the upliftment of Black, First Nations and other people of color. She hasn't thus far, so her apology simply wasn't convincing.""

More from the paper:

At the same time, labor leader Cesar Chavez didn't make the list, despite his feelings toward undocumented immigrants, who he called ""wetbacks"" and other derogatory names. He encouraged his supporters to report them to the authorities for deportation.



United Farm Worker members would form ""wet lines"" at the border and beat those crossing, believing they would be strike breakers, according to his biographer Miriam Pawel.



Jeffries said no one on the committee offered evidence that Chavez met the criteria. He did not say whether anyone on the committee looked for any.

""We did not discuss the life of Cesar Chavez except to say that he did not meet criteria,"" he added to the Chronicle.

The school board is expected to vote on the name-change recommendations early next year, the paper said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abortion-rights-are-pro-choice-men-s-rights-men-declare-in-satirical-video-releases-satirical-video-in-which-men-declare-that,2020-12-15
"ACLU sides with state against small business, arguing owner can be compelled to post pictures of gay civil unions against her will","Lorie Smith is the owner of 303 Creative, a graphic and website design company based in Colorado. She is selective about the messages that she creates or promotes, owing to her Christian faith: ""I am always careful to avoid communicating ideas or messages ... that are inconsistent with my religious beliefs.""

Smith is generally willing to produce work on behalf of gay and transsexual customers, however, she wants to begin offering wedding-related services exclusively to straight couples. Since she believes same-sex civil unions conflict with God's will, she neither plans on hosting images of gay civil unions nor making her company complicit in celebrating them. In her complaint, Smith wrote that doing otherwise ""would compromise my Christian witness.""

Recognizing that Colorado's Anti-Discrimination Act will require her to do so, and keen not to violate CADA as it now stands, Smith has brought a pre-enforcement challenge to CADA.

Smith first filed her lawsuit in 2016. Her claims that CADA violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, among others, were heard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, which moved to dismiss.

The U.S. Supreme Court announced in February that it would hear 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis later this year.

The case concerns whether the state — in this instance, exercising its authority via a public accommodation law — can force an artist to speak or remain silent without violating the artist's First Amendment rights.

The issue was in essence raised before the Supreme Court in 2018. Though the Court refused to decide whether baker Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, and other such business owners can invoke religious objections to refuse certain persons' service, it ruled that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission exhibited anti-religious bias toward Phillips, who had refused to bake a same-sex couple a wedding cake. After the ruling, anti-discrimination legislation was still enforceable by states, but state officials were warned not to denigrate conscientious objectors' religious beliefs.

Among the amicus briefs filed in Smith's case (e.g., by the Claremont Institute's Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, etc.), was one filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU has a mandate to ""fight government abuse and to vigorously defend individual freedoms including speech and religion.""

In its amicus brief, the ACLU distinguished between an artist and an artist who intends to open his or her business to the public at large (i.e., between artists and artist-run businesses).

The ACLU wrote that ""CADA ... leaves businesses free to select the content of products or services they sell to the public, and merely requires them to offer those goods for sale in a nondiscriminatory manner."" The example provided is that a Christmas store can sell exclusively Christmas-related goods, as opposed to Hanukkah goods, but cannot refuse to sell the former to Jewish customers.

The ACLU suggested that CADA regulates businesses open to the public, but not to persons who ""earn a living instead through personal, individualized contracts."" The ACLU then likened Smith's case to a hypothetical ""architecture firm that serves the public [that refuses] to design homes for Muslims because it opposes their religion.""

Reason's Scott Shackford offered another example, demonstrating the trouble with the ACLU's conflation of speech and customer discrimination: ""If 303 Creative refused a customer's request to host a bunch of images of an ISIS terrorist attack, is that discrimination against the customer's religion if the customer is also a Muslim? Clearly, it's not ... She's refusing to host images she finds objectionable.""

Shackford emphasized that the ACLU ""is doing everything in its power to encourage the Court to reject any consideration of Smith's and 303 Creative's First Amendment rights, even going so far as attempting to reframe the central question to make it appear as though these rights are not relevant to the case.""

In a June opinion piece, Smith discussed the death threats, cyberattacks, harassment, and ongoing threats she has faced for her stance, and wrote: ""Whether your beliefs align with mine or not, all of us are at risk if the government that happens to be in power gets to say, 'These views are permitted. Those views aren't.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abortion-riot-los-angeles,2022-08-22
Adam Kinzinger introduced a resolution authorizing the US military to engage Russia if Putin uses WMDs,"On Sunday, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said that he introduced a resolution to authorize the U.S. military to engage in combat with Russia should the Russian military use chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

Kinzinger said while on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" that any such attack in Ukraine would be a “clear red line.” He said that if his proposed resolution was passed by Congress, it would give President Joe Biden the authorization to allow the U.S. to provide military assistance to Ukraine.

The New York Post reported that Kinzinger said, “I don’t think we need to be using force in Ukraine right now. I just introduced an AUMF, an authorization for the use of military force, giving the president basically congressional leverage for permission to use it if [weapons of mass destruction] — nuclear, biological, or chemical — are used in Ukraine.”

Kinzinger said the authorization would provide Biden leverage while also serving as a deterrent to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Kinzinger said that his resolution wouldn’t ""compel the president to [use military force]. It just says if [WMDs are] used, he has the leverage. It gives him better flexibility, but also it is a deterrent to Vladimir Putin.""

Shortly after his appearance on CBS, Kinzinger released a statement on his official Congressional Twitter account that said, “Words matter, but so do our actions. I’m introducing this AUMF as a clear redline so @POTUS can take appropriate action if Russia uses chemical, biological, and/or nuclear weapons. We must stand up for humanity and we must stand with our allies.”





In the immediate aftermath of the attacks on September 11, 2001, Congress passed an AUMF. In doing so, the national legislature authorized former President George W. Bush to use the U.S. military to launch military campaigns in the pursuit of punishing the terror groups that launched the attacks.



Congress approved a similar AUMF for the 2002 invasion of Iraq.

Kinzinger said that the U.S. must similarly be ready to engage in military conflict on behalf of Ukraine.

Kinzinger said, “Prior to World War II, there were moments nobody ever wanted to get involved and eventually came to realize they had to. I hope we don’t get to that point here, but we should be ready if we do.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abraham-lincoln-hs-could-get-renamed-not-woke-enough,2022-05-01
"Adam Schiff defends Democrats' holdup of COVID-19 relief bill, says unrelated additions are for 'health of our democracy'","House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has defended his party's continued holdup of the coronavirus relief bill currently being negotiated in Congress, saying that the unrelated additions Democrats are hoping to include in the legislation are meant to help strengthen ""the health of our democracy.""

What are the details?

The Democrats have been torched by Senate Republicans in recent days, after a bipartisan agreement on aid to Americans was reached over the weekend, but Democrats squashed the bill when it came up for a vote Sunday night in hopes of adding a list of items unrelated to the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The laundry list of items Democrats want to add to the estimated $2 trillion package includes a $35 million allotment to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., new voting measures, and — according to Bloomberg News — availability of aid for Planned Parenthood.

The Washington Examiner reported that House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) called the Democrats' demands a ""socialist wish list.""

The Democrats joined forces to vote down the measure again on Monday (as five Republican senators remain in coronavirus quarantines), leading to widespread frustration and calls for the upper chamber to get its act together.

During an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday, Schiff was asked about the Democrats' controversial requests, and he was quick to defend his party's intentions with the unrelated items.

""I think what they're really focused on is we want to make sure that we protect not only the health of the economy, but the health of our democracy,"" Schiff told host Chris Hayes. ""And for that reason, we want to make sure that we provide that people can vote by mail and have early voting.""

The California Democrat continued, ""I think what Donald Trump would like, what Mitch McConnell would like, is a situation where they can create a corporate slush fund that they can do with as they choose, and the voters won't be able to hold them accountable because they won't be able to get to the ballot places without risking their lives.""

""And so,"" he added. ""We view the economic health and the health of our democracy as very much interrelated. They view the health of their slush fund and suppressing the vote as interrelated, and I think that's part of the conflict.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aclu-sides-with-state-against-conscientious-objector,2020-03-25

Marxist roofer Dan Whelan begins the short film by explaining, ""When people today think of class in the United States, they typically envision a division based on income levels. Lower class, middle class, and upper class. However, this analysis is largely incorrect.

""Class is actually determined by a person's relationship to, or ownership of, the means of production. The means of production being a factory, a plantation, a skyscraper.""

Whelan goes on to argue that, ""Viewing class in its proper context allows us to present the argument that the middle class — frequently alluded to in conventional media and politics — is a fiction that deliberately obscures the relationship and conflict between workers and the owners of society.""

He concludes, ""The fiction of the middle class has outlived its usefulness in American political discourse as workers around the country begin to realize the collective power they can wield as a unified working class.""

Anything else?

This is the second time in recent days that the AFL-CIO has raised eyebrows with a social media post.

Last week, Fox News reported the labor giant tweeted out an image suggesting ""a guillotine only costs $1200 to build"" in reaction to a Delta Air Lines ad criticizing the cost of union dues.

AFL-CIO took down the post following backlash, with spokeswoman Carolyn Bobb explaining to CNN, ""We came across and shared this Internet meme. We realize it was in poor taste that doesn't reflect the values of the AFL-CIO and it has been taken down.""

"After months of protests, Hong Kong's leader finally scraps bill that would have extradited residents to mainland China","Following months of protests, the leader of Hong Kong has agreed to scrap a bill that would have allowed residents of the former British territory to be extradited to mainland China to stand trial.

Here's what we know

Carrie Lam, the leader of Hong Kong appointed by the Chinese government, announced the decision on Wednesday.

""We must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions,"" Lam said on Wednesday, according to CNN. ""After more than two months of social unrest, it is obvious to many that this discontentment extends far beyond the bill.""

Before this, the government of Hong Kong had shelved the bill, but had refused to get rid of it entirely. More than 1 million of the city's roughly 7.2 million inhabitants had participated in protests over this issue.

Since Hong Kong was returned to China by the United Kingdom in 1997, it has seen some of its freedoms slowly chipped away. China had promised to utilize a ""one country, two systems"" model of governance for Hong Kong for at least the first fifty years, in order to ease the transition, but has periodically put laws in place to bring Hong Kong more into line with Chinese rule.

This extradition bill was just the latest example of this type of anti-democratic change. The people of Hong Kong feared that the Chinese government would use it to make opposition leaders disappear.

It is not unreasonable for the people of Hong Kong to fear this outcome. Over the past few years, China has rounded up more than 1 million of its own people who belonged to the mostly-Muslim Uighur minority and placed them in re-education camps.

Olivia Enos, the senior policy analyst for the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, called Lam's decision to withdraw the bill ""an unmitigated win for protesters.""

""Unlike her previous declaration that the bill was dead, but it still technically remained in play, there is not threat of the bill resurfacing,"" Enos told TheBlaze. She said that the bill had ""posed an existential threat to freedom in Hong Kong.""

The government refused to budge on any other demands

In addition to getting rid of the protest bill permanently, the protesters had also demanded reforms in Hong Kong including free elections and a halt to the prosecution of the more than 1,000 protesters who had been arrested (a demand Lam called ""contrary to the rule of law""), as well as the creation of an independent commission that would investigate the city's police department.

The protesters had also demanded that the government stop refering to them as ""rioters,"" but Lam dismissed this idea, saying that there was ""no legal effect on how such incidents are described or categorized.""

Lam specified in her address on Wednesday that the government would not budge on any of these four additional issues. She urged the protesters to disband now that the extradition bill was gone, saying ""let's replace conflicts with conversations and let's look for solutions.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/adam-schiff-defends-democrats-hold-up-of-covid-19-relief-bill-says-unrelated-additions-are-for-health-of-our-democracy,2019-09-04
"AG Barr has 'created a process' to vet Giuliani's info on Hunter Biden, Ukrainian corruption, Graham says","Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) revealed Sunday that Attorney General William Barr has ""created a process"" to vet information that Rudy Giuliani discovered regarding Hunter Biden and Ukrainian corruption.

Speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, Graham, who spoke with Barr prior to his interview, said the Justice Department has not been ordered to investigate the Bidens but is vetting all intelligence about Ukraine.

""The Department of Justice is receiving information coming out of the Ukraine from Rudy to see,"" Graham said. ""He told me that they've created a process that Rudy could give information and they would see if it's verified. Rudy Giuliani is a well-known man. He's a crime fighter. He's loyal to the president. He's a good lawyer.""

Graham continued:

What I'm trying to say — to the president and anybody else — is that the Russians are still up to it. Deterrence is not working.



So let's look at Hunter Biden's conflict. Let's look at Joe Biden. Vice President Biden, what did you do when they told you your son was on Burisma's board? It undercuts your ability to fight corruption. Did you take it seriously? Obviously he didn't. But when it comes to documents coming out of the Ukraine, to Republicans and Democrats, be very cautious, turn anything you got over to the intel community.

However, Graham cautioned that Giuliani's information may have been generated as part of a Russian disinformation campaign and urged the lawyer to turn over his intelligence to the Justice Department.

""Here's my message to Rudy: If you've got something coming from the Ukraine, turn it over to the intelligence people, the Department of Justice, to any Democrat,"" Graham said.

Giuliani has spent an extensive amount of time digging for dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden, as well as searching for evidence of Ukrainian corruption. Gordon Sondland, the former U.S. ambassador to the European Union, said he worked with Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens.



Over the weekend, Giuliani claimed he has the ""smoking gun"" in the Hunter Biden case and claimed he has multiple witnesses who are ready to ""name names.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/afl-cio-promotes-marxist-video-slamming-capitalism-while-declaring-we-all-need-to-seize-the-means-of-production,2020-02-10
Airbnb says it will continue its ban on Israeli rentals in the West Bank,"Airbnb has denied reports that claimed it was reversing its decision to refuse to list any Israeli-owned properties in the West Bank.

What was the original policy?

On Nov. 19, Airbnb issued a statement on its website regarding ""the approximately 200 Airbnb listings in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and whether they should be available for rent on our platform."" The statement said that the company would ""remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.""

This decision did not affect Israeli-run Airbnbs in other disputed areas, like East Jerusalem or Golan Heights. Nor did it affect any Airbnbs in the rest of the country. The company also insisted that this move did not mean that it was boycotting Israel, or supporting the BDS movement. The BDS movement seeks to boycott, divest from, and sanction Israel until it meets its demands regarding land disputes with the Palestinian people.

Airbnb has been sued in both U.S. and Israeli courts over this decision.

What did the company say now?

On Monday, the Israeli news outlet Haaretz reported that Airbnb had decided to rescind this policy. Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin (who had reportedly met with representatives from Airbnb earlier that day, including Airbnb Vice President Chris Lehane) called this ""a step in the right direction"" and promised to ""continue to make sure all Israeli citizens get equal treatment, and keep on strengthening tourism in Israel.""

The company itself quickly responded denying that there had been any change.

""The reports issued earlier today are inaccurate,"" Airbnb's corporate office said, according to The Hill. The company claimed that its representatives had met with shareholders in Israel, and ""as a result of our meetings have an even deeper understanding that this is an incredibly complex and emotional issue."" It also promised to continue its ""dialogue with the Government of Israel and other stakeholders,"" but stressed that it was still ""developing the tools needed to implement our policy"" of not listing Israeli-owned properties in the West Bank.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/after-months-of-protests-hong-kongs-leader-finally-scraps-bill-that-would-have-extradited-residents-to-mainland-china,2018-12-17
VIDEO: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) slammed at town hall event,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was blasted over her voting record on sending weapons and aid to Ukraine. AOC was confronted by protesters during a sparsely attended town hall event in New York City on Wednesday.

A man is heard on video telling Ocasio-Cortez, ""You voted to send arms and weapons to Ukraine!""

In May, AOC and all Democrats – including all of the ""Squad"" members – voted in favor of sending $40 billion in aid to Ukraine following the invasion by Russia.

During the ""Legislative Victories & Opportunities for Constituents"" town hall event, the man then asked why Ocasio-Cortez doesn't leave the Democratic Party like former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard.

On Tuesday, Gabbard announced she was departing the Democratic Party because it is an ""elitist cabal of warmongers who are driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue and stoking anti-white racism, who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms that are enshrined in our Constitution."" Gabbard also declared that the Democratic Party is ""dragging us closer to nuclear war.""

The man said Gabbard left the Democratic Party ""because they’re a bunch of war hawks.”

""You ran as an outsider,"" the man said. ""Yet you've been voting to start this war in Ukraine. You've been voting to start a third nuclear war with Russia and China.""

He asked, ""Why are you playing with the lives of American citizens?""

Another man chimed in, ""You voted to mobilize and send money to Ukrainian Nazis.""

He yelled, ""You're a coward!""

The man questioned how AOC could be a ""progressive socialist"" while voting to send American funds to Ukraine.

He screamed during the town hall event held in the Bronx, ""You have done nothing!""

The man declared, ""Tulsi Gabbard has shown guts while you have shown cowardice.""

""I believed in you and you became the very thing you sought to fight against,"" the alleged supporter said. ""That's what you've become. You are the establishment.""

He continued, ""And you are the reason why everybody will end up in a nuclear war, unless you choose to stand up right now and denounce the Democratic Party.""

The man ranted, ""We could be in a nuclear war at any minute, and you continue to fund it. That's what's going on.""

AOC refused to address the man's claims, but she did call him ""rude."" He retorted, ""You're the liar here. Nobody has held you accountable.""

The man concluded, ""And it is time for you to stand up and realize that what you've been saying has been lies. Let your conscience come through for once.""

One of the protesters shared a screenshot of an email he allegedly sent to Ocasio-Cortez in 2018, in which he was hopeful that the up-and-coming New York politician would assist him in a dispute with his landlord.

At the time of publication, AOC – who is extremely active on social media – has yet to address being confronted about her voting record on funding Ukraine.

Regarding the war between Russia and Ukraine, Ocasio-Cortez has never mentioned the conflict on her massively popular personal Twitter account with more than 13.5 million followers. On her much less popular government Twitter account, she has mentioned the conflict three times – the last being in March.

""As Ukraine fights against the Russian invasion, we have a moral obligation to assist any way we can,"" AOC tweeted on March 28. ""The Ukraine Comprehensive Debt Payment Relief Act would work to support the immediate suspension of Ukraine’s debt payments, help coordinate comprehensive debt relief, and more.""

In April, Ocasio-Cortez voted against the Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act. The bill that passed in the House gives the president the power to ""seize and confiscate assets belonging to any sanctioned foreign person whose wealth is derived through support for or corruption related to the regime of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""

In January 2020, Ocasio-Cortez proclaimed that ""war is a class conflict.""

""The rich and powerful who open war escape the consequences of their decisions,"" AOC tweeted. ""It’s not their children sent into the jaws of violence. It is often the vulnerable, the poor, & working people – who had little to no say in conflict – who pay the price.""

Previously, AOC declared that ""the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable.""

""Activists take that discomfort w/ the status quo & advocate for concrete policy changes,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in December 2020. ""Popular support often starts small & grows. To folks who complain protest demands make others uncomfortable... that’s the point.""

Editor's note: Due to a typo, the original version of this story incorrectly identified Ocasio-Cortez as (R-N.Y.) rather than (D-N.Y.).

Alveda King rips Obama for politicizing John Lewis funeral,"Former President Barack Obama delivered the eulogy at the funeral of John Lewis in Atlanta on Thursday. While paying tribute to the civil rights pioneer at the famed Ebenezer Baptist Church, Obama utilized the widely-viewed platform to take jabs at President Donald Trump.

""As we sit here, there are those in power who are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities…even undermining the postal service in the run-up to an election that's going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don't get sick,"" Obama said of mail-in voting, which Trump has been vehemently against.

""George Wallace may be gone, but we can still witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons against peaceful demonstrators,"" Obama said, referring to the pro-segregation Democratic governor of Alabama in the 1960s.

Dr. Alveda King, the niece of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., ripped Obama for politicizing the Lewis funeral service.

""Well, I guess we should have expected that the Left, including President Obama, would take that occasion for a political moment,"" King said during an interview on Fox News' ""Fox & Friends."" ""They'll grab at any opportunity, that's to be understood.""

""I have chosen not to politicize the death of congressman Lewis, but to remember him as a peaceful, nonviolent warrior, and encourage everyone to resolve our conflicts peacefully,"" King said of Lewis, who at the age of 23 was a keynote speaker at 1963's March on Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his powerful ""I Have a Dream"" speech.

""However, President Obama, with word play, took us back to the 1960's, and that was a time when segregation was still on the books, segregation was still legal, and those in power, some of them were trying to enforce that and keep that,"" King added. ""Today, when the National Guard goes in, sent by the president for example, or the state troopers, they're trying to protect the people of America in every community and to save lives and protect people. There is a totally distinct difference.""



""Also implying without calling any names, he was very clever not to call any names, saying that there was an effort to undermine the voting process,"" King said. ""You know, actually President Trump is saying, people, please pay attention, we do want you to vote, use your absentee ballots, go to the polls.""

""He's even encouraged, you know, people to be poll watchers and poll workers and that kind of thing. President Trump is not trying to suppress the vote,"" she continued. ""As a matter of fact, you can see in my community, I'm telling everybody, make sure you vote, register to vote, pastors and leaders, encourage your people to vote. We do want people to vote safely and we need the voting process to be fair, and so to politicize the funeral of a peaceful warrior, I mean, I guess they grabbed at an opportunity to be political.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/airbnb-continues-ban-on-israeli-rentals-in-west-bank,2020-08-02
Commentary: Alyssa Milano made herself look like a fool yesterday. Don't let the same thing happen to you.,"I know what you're thinking: Stop the presses, a liberal Hollywood celebrity made a fool out of herself. Push past that first instinct to roll your eyes and dismiss this as Hollywood being Hollywood.

You see, it's exactly that dismissive instinct that led Alyssa Milano to say something so profoundly lazy and dishonest in the first place.

I'm referring here to Milano's tweet about — what else? — the Covington Catholic High School teens who have been at the center of an insane media firestorm since a misleading video was posted on Twitter over the weekend. The video appeared to show a group of white teenagers — including some in MAGA hats — surrounding and confronting Native American activist Nathan Phillips.

The pile-on was quick. Internet users across the political spectrum condemned the kids as racist and disrespectful. After the full context — which showed that the kids were the victims of racism and bigotry and not the perpetrators of it — many media figures and celebrities either apologized, retracted, or deleted their tweets.

And so we come to Alyssa Milano, who decided instead to go with ... this:

Let's not forget—this entire event happened because a group of boys went on a school-sanctioned trip to protest against a woman's right to her own body and reproductive healthcare. It is not debatable that bigotry was at play from the start.

— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) January 21, 2019

There's a lot that's wrong with this tweet, including the open petulance involved with basically saying, ""These high school kids might not have been guilty of what I was accusing them of, but they're guilty of SOMETHING so I'm not sorry."" Alyssa Milano is 46, and the Covington kids are teenagers, but she's the one who has failed to learn to apologize like an adult in this scenario.

The part I want to focus on, however, is the part where Milano casually dismisses the entire pro-life position as ""bigotry."" I don't have to explain to this audience what is wrong with this deliberately insulting dismissal of the sincerely held political beliefs of roughly half of all Americans. I do, however, want to remind all of us that we are all in perpetual danger of falling into the same trap Milano finds herself in.

Milano's tweet yesterday wasn't good or excusable, but it was an exemplar of a fairly common reaction for human beings. We all (obviously) believe that our own conclusions are correct, and that they are the result of proper thinking applied to facts. Therefore, anyone who disagrees with me must be either stupid or evil. When confronted with someone who is manifestly not a moron, the assumption must be that the person is blinded by evil — usually bigotry of some sort.

Milano isn't nearly alone in this. In fact, the whole human race is guilty of it to some degree. As psychologist Jonathan Haidt proposed in his book ""The Righteous Mind,"" humans have an instinctive, evolutionary response to ideas that conflict with our own. That response is sadly not self-reflection, but rather digging in and assuming bad motives/bad thought processes on the part of our opponent.

Haidt argues, plausibly, that humans simply do not have the time or mental energy to reach every conclusion in our lives through a process of honest reflection and search for truth. Instead, we make snap judgments and decisions, and then proceed to dig in and entrench ourselves in our positions. Even in cases where we tend to think, ""Well, I believe this way because I've really studied the issue,"" usually we have actually just adopted a position and then sought out a lot of reading material that agreed with the position we already hold. In today's world, there's no shortage of books that will agree with you no matter what you think.

Alyssa Milano dismissed the sincerely held beliefs of most people who read this website as being both stupid and evil — which, after all, is what bigotry is. The temptation to respond in kind can be overwhelming. In fact, that seems to be what a lot of people are doing. But what, in the final analysis, does that accomplish?

We are moving through perilous times as a country. Bonds that held us together through some extremely difficult times appear more frayed than they ever have been in our history. The fundamental shared assumption that most of our fellow Americans are people of good will and patriotism has almost completely evaporated, and that is more dangerous to our survival than any external threat we face, by far.

If we all go through life assuming that everyone who disagrees with us politically is stupid and/or evil — as opposed to merely someone who has different ideas about what's good for the country — then our national experiment is already doomed and we should just pack it in now.

The basic antidote to this endless cycle of escalating hatred and anger in our political discourse is a very simple question: ""What if I'm wrong?"" It's a question that we should all be willing to ask ourselves about everything we think or believe. Sadly, it's one we almost never do ask ourselves, because it's uncomfortable. It provokes a natural response of self-defense described by Haidt: ""Of COURSE I'm not wrong, you must not know how much I've studied about this!""

And yet, in those quiet moments of sobriety when we aren't angry at a political opponent, we would all concede that of course we aren't always right. Of course we all often make mistakes. It's easy to concede that point generally; it's much harder to do it specifically when you're in the middle of a discussion with someone who believes something that's completely opposed to everything you believe.

But we should all try it, at least sometimes. ""What if I'm wrong?"" Or, if it makes you more comfortable, ""What, other than stupidity or malice, could be leading this person I'm arguing with to believe the way they do?""

Being willing to answer these questions might be the one thing that can save this country.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-town-hall-video-aoc,2019-01-22
Alyssa Milano says masks 'will protect you more than an AR-15 will' — immediately gets roasted,"Progressive actress Alyssa Milano recently tried to persuade ""anti-maskers"" to wear face coverings to guard themselves from the coronavirus by arguing that the small pieces of cloth offer greater protection than AR-15s.

""Anti-maskers are the same people who think they need an AR-15 for 'protection,'"" the anti-gun activist and frequent critic of conservatives scoffingly tweeted on Tuesday, adding, ""LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK: A MASK WILL PROTECT YOU *MORE* THAN AN AR-15 WILL.""

Milano's argument is sensible enough, right? Masks in all likelihood have a better shot of warding off the coronavirus than guns do. After all, wearing a face covering is currently thought to help limit the spread of certain infectious diseases and is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic.



Except, literally no one thought that AR-15s were useful for preventing the spread of viral illnesses. So as is patently obvious, Milano was just trying to use the anti-mask movement as an opportunity to take a pot shot at gun-owning Americans.

She got torched

Soon after posting, Milano was roasted for her nonsensical apples-to-oranges comparison.

After all, in the same way that guns don't offer much protection against tiny viruses, cloth face coverings won't do much to protect someone in the event their home is invaded by armed intruders.

""Those tools are for very different kinds of threats,"" tweeted Washington Free Beacon reporter Stephen Gutowski in response. ""I own both AR-15s and KN-95s. I don't see any conflict in that whatsoever.""

""Surely I'm not the only person in America who believes wearing a mask helps reduce virus spread and firearms protect from those who wish you harm,"" Washington Examiner reporter Kimberly Ross added.

""Uh, they could theoretically both protect you against different things,"" another Twitter user wrote. ""Is there a reason you think these two things are mutually exclusive? Or related in any logical way at all?""

Another Twitter user said, ""I guess you can strangle bad guys with your mask.""

Still another commenter challenged Milano to a duel, writing, ""I get an AR-15 and she gets a mask.""

Justin Amash just stepped down from the Freedom Caucus — here's why he did it,"Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) said on Monday that he had stepped down from the Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative members of Congress, after a conflict about his support of impeachment.

""I have the highest regard for them and they're my close friends,"" Amash told CNN.

""I didn't want to be a further distraction for the group,"" he added.

Amash became the first Republican member of Congress to support the impeachment of President Donald Trump after tweeting about his reading of the Mueller report, where he concluded that the president was guilty of obstruction of justice.

He attended the House Freedom Caucus board meeting on Monday and told the other members he would be stepping down.

""It was a positive meeting,"" said Amash. ""It wasn't negative.""

Amash had expressed frustration at the direction of the group after the election of Trump in 2016. He was one of the founding members of the Freedom Caucus, and has touted his Tea Party credentials when Trump supporters questioned his loyalty to conservatism.

""I haven't changed, I am who I said I was,"" Amash said to a Trump supporter in March during his town hall event.

""I am a principled constitutional conservative who has stayed consistent regardless of whether we have President Obama in office, or President Trump,"" he added.

Amazon employee accused of killing pregnant mother of 3 in company parking lot,"A Minnesota man has been arrested and charged with killing a heavily pregnant mother of three in the parking lot of the Amazon facility where he worked, reports claim.

Just before 7 p.m. on Sunday evening, police received a call about a woman who had been shot inside a car located in the parking lot of an Amazon Fulfillment Center in Lakeville, Minnesota, about 25 miles south of Minneapolis. When Lakeville police arrived, they found the victim and immediately transported her to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she died of an apparent gunshot wound.

Though police have not officially confirmed her identity, family has come forward to claim that the victim was Kyla O’Neal, a 31-year-old mother of three who was nine months pregnant with her fourth child at the time of her death. O'Neal was scheduled to be induced sometime this week.

""She was so ready to bring him in this world,"" the family stated. ""She had everything packed. His diaper bag was packed and ready for the big day. All his bassinets and car seats and everything was set and ready.""

Police said that medical staff were able to deliver the baby alive that evening, and the family claims that the newborn boy is ""fighting."" However, details regarding the baby's condition are currently unavailable.



Police have taken into custody the man they believe is responsible for the death of the boy's mother. Donte Rapheal McCray, 32, was arrested in connection to the shooting, though various law enforcement sites seem to give conflicting reports about the nature of his alleged crime. The website for the Dakota County Jail, where McCray is currently housed, claims that he has a pending charge of second-degree manslaughter and culpable negligence creating unreasonable risk, as does a Jan. 9 statement from Lakeville PD.

However, an accompanying court document indicates that he is suspected of second-degree murder. McCray ""did cause the death of a human being with intent to effect the death of that person or another, but without premeditation and at the time of offense, the Defendant or an accomplice did use or possess a firearm,"" the order of detention filed on Jan. 10 reads in part.

KARE has reported that, last summer, a judge ordered McCray not to possess a firearm because of a previous conviction, though the nature of that conviction is unknown.

Amazon has confirmed that McCray was an employee at the facility where the incident occurred, and several news reports indicate that McCray is the father of at least one of O'Neal's four children. It is unknown whether he is the father of the baby boy delivered on Sunday.

""Obviously, we’re all hoping the baby is doing well and is able to survive and thrive,"" said police Cmdr. William Gerl, ""and that will be a miracle and great news if that happens.""

McCray could face other charges as well, depending on what happens with the boy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alyssa-milano-masks-ar-15s,2023-01-10
American Green Berets caught by surprise when US-trained Guinea troops launch coup on their day off,"The Biden administration has suspended military assistance to the African country of Guinea after U.S.-trained Guinean special operations forces used their day off to instigate a coup.

No U.S. forces were involved in the overthrow of Guinean President Alpha Condé on Sept. 5, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday during a press conference.

""We obviously share the U.S. government's condemnation of this coup in Guinea,"" Kirby told reporters. ""We're carefully reviewing the situation on the ground for any potential impacts on our military assistance. Until that review is complete, there's going to be no further training or support to the Guinean armed forces.""

According to U.S. Africa Command spokeswoman Bardha S. Azari, American Green Berets had begun teaching Guinean special operators in July about small unit tactics, tactical combat casualty care, language training, and the Law of Armed Conflict, Task and Purpose reported.

During this time, U.S. forces had met with Guinean Col. Mamady Doumbouya, who has now declared himself the ruler of the country after overthrowing the government.

Doumbouya had approved activities between U.S. and guinean special operations forces.

Apparently, 100 Guinean special operators left their base and drove four hours to the country's capital, Conakry, to launch the coup without the U.S. special forces team being aware of the situation because ""Sept. 5 was considered a down day for both forces.""

A New York Times report suggested that U.S. troops were asleep when the Guinean forces left the base, but the Pentagon would not confirm that report.

A video posted on social media started rumors that U.S. forces were involved in the coup. The video, first reported by Stars and Stripes, shows crowds shouting ""freedom"" and ""the Americans"" in French as three U.S. soldiers in vehicles drove by. One Green Beret in the video smiles at the crowd and shakes hands with people as the vehicle proceeds through the crowded streets.

U.S. Africa Command clarified that the soldiers were provided a security escort to the embassy in Conakry and were not participants in the coup.

""The U.S. government and military are not involved in this apparent military seizure of power in any way,"" AFRICOM said. ""The United States strongly condemns these actions in Guinea and any attempts at forceful seizures of power or unconstitutional actions.""

The military leaders of the coup met with Guinean political, religious, and business leaders Tuesday to discuss the formation of a new government, Reuters reported.

In an address to the nation, Doumbouya warned the leaders to ""not repeat the errors of the past."" He and the other soldiers who led the coup said they overthrew the old government because of poverty and corruption and because Condé, the ousted president, had altered the country's constitution to stay in power for a third term.

But the coup was condemned by the U.S. and by Guinea's allies in the region.

""The military seizure of power is inconsistent with U.S. military training and education,"" Kirby said Monday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/amash-leaves-the-freedom-caucus,2021-09-14
American intelligence says that Russia will invade Ukraine as Western allies scramble to find a diplomatic solution,"The United States has intelligence that Russian commanders received orders to proceed with an invasion of Ukraine, CBS News reported.

CBS News host, Margaret Brennan said, “The president was very clear that he is convinced by U.S. intelligence that this invasion will happen, that President Putin [has] decided to do it. How was he that certain?”

CBS News correspondent David Martin responded by saying, “The intelligence says that Russian troops have actually received orders now, to proceed with the invasion. So, not only are they moving up closer and closer to the border into these attack positions, but the commanders on the ground are making specific plans for how they would maneuver in their sector of the battlefield.”

Martin said that the Russian forces are doing “everything that American commanders would do once they got the order to proceed.”

On Friday, President Joe Biden told reporters that he was “convinced” Russian leadership had decided to invade Ukraine and that he expected Russian forces to invade Ukraine in the “coming days.”

Previously, Ukrainian leadership said that Russia was working to destabilize Ukraine from within to create circumstances that would justify an invasion.

Oleksiy Danilov, Ukraine’s top national security adviser, said that a military invasion would be too costly for Russia given the size of Ukraine’s military and the Ukrainian people’s will to fight.

Danilov also speculated that West continuing to pressure Russia would cause Russian leadership to shy away from conventional means of warfare and pursue a series of intense cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and economic pressure.

However, as tension in the region continues to escalate, the Russian military announced that it would be conducting military drills involving the country’s strategic nuclear forces.

A spokesman for the Kremlin said that Vladimir Putin would watch the drills from the Defense Ministry’s situation room and supervise the practice missile launches in person.

Moscow continues to deny that it has any plans to invade Ukraine and demands that the United States and NATO allies withdraw their military forces from territories near Russia and make legally binding commitments that Ukraine will not join NATO. Leadership in Washington and Brussels refuse to meet these demands.

The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, expressed that he was interested in meeting with Putin so that they could come to a diplomatic consensus that would end the ongoing conflict.

On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris met with European leaders in Munich, Germany, to discuss the conflict and strategize with Western leaders on how they might deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Amnesty International's USA director says Israel 'shouldn't exist as a Jewish state',"Nonprofit human rights group Amnesty International's USA director, Paul O'Brien, told an audience Wednesday that Israel ""shouldn't exist as a Jewish state"" and argued that most American Jews want the country to be ""a safe Jewish space"" based on ""core Jewish values.""



O'Brien, who is not Jewish, made the comments at a Women's National Democratic Club lunch event, speaking in front of about 20 people in person and another 30 virtual attendees, Jewish Insider reported. He was discussing a recent report published by his organization that accused Israel of ""apartheid"" in its treatment of Palestinians. The purpose of the report was to ""collectively change the conversation"" regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, O'Brien reportedly said.

Addressing support for Israel among American Jews, O'Brien rejected the results of a 2020 survey conducted by the Ruderman Family Foundation that found that eight in 10 Jewish Americans identify as ""pro-Israel"" and two-thirds feel emotionally ""attached"" or ""very attached"" to the world's lone Jewish state, according to Jewish Insider.

“I actually don’t believe that to be true,” O'Brien reportedly said of the survey results. “I believe my gut tells me that what Jewish people in this country want is to know that there’s a sanctuary that is a safe and sustainable place that the Jews, the Jewish people can call home.”

He argued that American Jews want ""a safe Jewish space"" rather than a Jewish state. ""I think they can be convinced over time that the key to sustainability is to adhere to what I see as core Jewish values, which are to be principled and fair and just in creating that space,” O'Brien reportedly said.

Jewish Insider interpreted these remarks as an argument for the ""one-state solution"" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, noting that the pro-Israel community rejects such arguments as ""a cover for the dissolution of a Jewish state.""

O'Brien affirmed that Israel ""shouldn't exist as a Jewish state,"" according to Jewish Insider, although he added that ""Amnesty takes no political views on any question, including the right of the State of Israel to survive.""

“The right of the people to self-determination and to be protected is without a doubt something that we believe in, and I personally believe that,” O'Brien reportedly said. But he added, “We are opposed to the idea — and this, I think, is an existential part of the debate — that Israel should be preserved as a state for the Jewish people.”

Amnesty International, a nonprofit international human rights group, has consistently criticized Israel and in its 2022 report accused the Jewish nation of maintaining ""an institutionalized regime of oppression and domination of the Palestinian population for the benefit of Jewish Israelis."" The report was slammed by Israel's foreign ministry, which said it ""absolutely rejects all the false allegations"" and accused Amnesty of regurgitating ""lies, inconsistencies, and unfounded assertions that originate from well-known anti-Israeli hate organizations.""

""The report denies the State of Israel's right to exist as the nation state of the Jewish people. Its extremist language and distortion of historical context were designed to demonize Israel and pour fuel onto the fire of anti-Semitism,"" Israel's foreign ministry said in a statement.

The Palestinian government, on the other hand, embraced the report and said it was a ""detailed affirmation of the cruel reality of entrenched racism, exclusion, oppression, colonialism, apartheid, and attempted erasure that the Palestinian people have endured.""

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration rejected the claim that Israel has committed apartheid through its actions towards the Palestinians.

""We think that it is important as the world’s only Jewish state that the Jewish people must not be denied their right to self-determination, and we must ensure there isn’t a double standard being applied,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters in February.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/american-green-berets-guinea-troops-coup-day-off,2022-03-11
"'An unnecessary crisis': Pennsylvania Republicans raise alarm after more than 240,000 unverified ballots sent to voters who aren't required to produce IDs","Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania expressed concern this week about a possible strain on the integrity of elections in the state. In an Oct. 25 letter to acting Secretary of the Commonwealth Leigh Chapman, 15 Republican legislators noted that over 240,000 ballots have been sent out to voters whose identities have not been verified.

Unverified ballots and ID mismatches

According to Verity Vote, a group committed to analyzing issues of election integrity, Pennsylvania not only allows people to vote without IDs but allows people to register to vote without verification of identity or residency.

Verity Vote noted that a 2018 directive from the Pennsylvania Department of State ""instructed counties to register applicants even if the applicant provided invalid identification or no identification."" This directive has proved problematic.

In their letter to Chapman, which relies in part on information included in Verity Vote's Monday report, Republican lawmakers wrote, ""Due to the 2018 Directive from your office instructing counties to register voters without verification of identity, the need to verify the identity and eligibility of mail and absentee ballot applicants is even more critical to the integrity of our elections.""

The lawmakers noted that in a September 14 state government committee hearing, Deputy Secretary Jonathan Marks testified that counties are responsible for ID verification prior to counting a ballot. However, the Pennsylvania Department of State was said to have later notified counties that ID verification takes place before a ballot is sent to an applicant.

As a result of this conflicting information about verification responsibility, ""conscientious election workers could unknowingly accept and count ballots for which no verification had ever occurred.""

The lawmakers claimed that the 240,000-plus unverified ballots constitute a ""staggering"" amount that ""must be set aside and not counted for the 2022 General Election unless the voter produces ID.""



The Republicans requested that the Department of State ""immediately issue a directive to all counties informing them of the requirement to set those ballots aside and not pre-canvass, canvass, or count any of them unless and until the applicant provides a valid form of identification.""

It is not acceptable, the lawmakers contended, that counties ""fix"" non-matching identification.

Granted the possible severity of the threat to the election's integrity, the legislature must be provided ""with a complete list of all the names and voter IDs for all the applications"" where SSN4 identifiers provided did not match with the Social Security Administration's records.

Furthermore, they asked that the relevant guidance be corrected to reflect Marks' testimony or account for ""the false information provided under oath.""

'An unnecessary crisis'

Verity Vote stated that the ""impact of this issue on the 2022 General Election cannot be overstated ... The ramification of this defective process is that tens of thousands of people would have to show up at a county election office to present ID to comply with the law rather than the trivial process of correcting at the time of entry.""

The report accused the Department of State of creating ""an unnecessary crisis by deferring verification,"" pushing ""this responsibility onto county election officials [and] making it nearly impossibly to verify the identity of the ballot requester.""

Among the consequences Verity Vote said can be expected are: the rejection of tens of thousands of ballots; the acceptance of tens of thousands of unverified ballots in contravention of the law; and litigation of this policy, potentially delaying the final results.

Just the News reported that Phill Kline, director of the Amistad Project, an election integrity nonprofit, underscored how problems that impacted the 2020 presidential election are now being repeated.

""The left has refused to abide by common-sense procedures, laws, and rules that make it easy for legitimate voters to vote and difficult for fraudulent voters and people to commit fraud,"" said Kline.

State Rep. Frank Ryan (R), one of the 15 Republicans who wrote to Chapman, told the Daily Signal that a 2019 state audit indicated the secretary of the commonwealth's office was ""uncooperative and had an unreliable system for keeping election records under its Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors system.""

Ryan said, ""No one is saying this determines who wins and loses ... We are just saying the database is so broken it needs to be fixed.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/american-intelligence-says-that-russia-will-invade-ukraine-as-western-allies-scramble-to-find-a-diplomatic-solution,2022-10-28
"Gov. Andrew Cuomo claims journalists advise him 'all the time,' a claim that raises serious ethical concerns","New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) admitted Monday that journalists — other than his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo — routinely give him advice, triggering questions about the ethical implications of journalists cultivating cozy relationships with a powerful politician.

What did Cuomo say?

While speaking on Long Island, the scandal-embattled Democratic governor defended fielding advice from his brother, Chris — who did not previously disclose he was advising his governor brother — and revealed journalists advise him ""all the time.""

""I had conversations with my brother. I always have conversations with my brother because he's my brother and he's my best friend,"" Cuomo said, in response to the New York Post.

""Obviously, he was aware of what was going on and I talked to him about it, and he told me his thoughts. He always tells me his thoughts. Sometimes I follow them, sometimes I don't,"" he added, before claiming, ""He was not covering the story. He had recused himself from the story.""

That's when Cuomo admitted his brother is not the only journalist advising him.

""But I talk to journalists about situations all the time and they tell me their thoughts and their advice,"" Cuomo said.

Cuomo, however, did not identify the journalists who purportedly advise him, nor did he disclose which news outlets employ them.

What are the ethical implications?

Cuomo's admission suggests there are journalists regularly violating media ethics, either by actively working in politics through advising Cuomo or by engaging in a conflict of interest.

Tom Jones of the journalism institute Poynter noted, ""It seems fairly evident that journalists helping politicians is crossing a line.""

In fact, the Society of Professional Journalists' code of ethics says, ""Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived. Disclose unavoidable conflicts,"" while the Associated Press advises its employees, ""Editorial employees are expected to be scrupulous in avoiding any political activity, whether they cover politics regularly or not.""

Was Chris Cuomo disciplined?

Despite the blaring conflict of interest, CNN did not discipline Cuomo for not disclosing to CNN viewers that he was advising Gov. Cuomo regarding his sexual harassment scandal.

The Washington Post first reported on Cuomo's ethical blunder.

""Chris has not been involved in CNN's extensive coverage of the allegations against Governor Cuomo — on air or behind the scenes,"" CNN said in a statement. ""In part because, as he has said on his show, he could never be objective. But also because he often serves as a sounding board for his brother.""

""However, it was inappropriate to engage in conversations that included members of the Governor's staff, which Chris acknowledges,"" the statement added. ""He will not participate in such conversations going forward.""

For his part, Chris Cuomo only apologized for putting his CNN colleagues ""in a bad spot,"" but did not apologize to CNN viewers for not disclosing the fact that he was advising his brother.

""I understand why that was a problem for CNN,"" Cuomo said. ""It will not happen again. It was a mistake, because I put my colleagues here, who I believe are the best in the business, in a bad spot. I never intended for that. I would never intend for that. And I am sorry for that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/amnesty-international-usa-director-israel-should-not-exist-as-jewish-state,2021-05-25
Former NY Governor Andrew Cuomo wants taxpayers to pay for his private legal defense in sexual harassment case,"On Wednesday, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Letitia James after she denied his request to have the state pay for his private legal defense in the sexual harassment lawsuit against him. In his lawsuit against James, Cuomo argued that according to state law, his legal fees must be covered since the allegations ""occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his public employment or duties.""



""Sexually harassing young women who work for you is not part of anyone's job description,"" a spokesperson for the New York attorney general's office replied in a statement on Thursday, Reuters reported. ""Taxpayers should not have to pony up for legal bills that could reach millions of dollars so Mr. Cuomo's lawyer can attack survivors of his abuse.""

In response to the denial, Cuomo's attorney Rita Glavin said, ""James's denial of Governor Cuomo's request for counsel was arbitrary, capricious, contrary to the plain text of the statute, biased, personally and politically conflicted.""

James released a report last year containing the results of a five-month independent investigation. James stated, ""The independent investigation has concluded that Governor Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and in doing so violated federal and state law.""

Following the investigation results, Cuomo resigned from office in August 2021.

In March, Cuomo visited a New York church and gave a speech in which he stated, ""I resigned as governor, the press roasted me, my colleagues were ridiculed, my brother was fired.""

Andrew Cuomo insisted that he and his brother, Chris Cuomo, were the victims of ""cancel culture."" He stated that the ""political sharks"" came after him because they ""smelled blood.""

Despite Cuomo's confidence that certain political figures had it out for him, the former governor somehow managed to evade any criminal charges. The last prosecutor to investigate the allegations against Cuomo stated that there was no legal basis to pursue the case.

Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said, ""The report has been reviewed by five separate district attorneys and every single one has declined to move forward based on it — it was nothing more than a political document and holds no legal weight. Their political games continue.""

A New York state trooper filed a lawsuit against Cuomo in February. The trooper, who has chosen to remain anonymous, accused Cuomo of sexually harassing at least 11 women between 2013 and 2021.

One of Cuomo's former top aides, Melissa DeRosa, was also listed in the lawsuit. According to Cuomo's petition, she too requested to have her private legal fees covered by the state, and her request was accepted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/an-unnecessary-crisis-pennsylvania-republicans-raise-alarm-after-more-than-240000-unverified-ballots-sent-to-voters-who-arent-required-to-produce-ids,2022-08-12
Andrew Cuomo statement on sexual harassment accusations,"Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo finally addressed the sexual harassment accusations against him by two women. The governor denied the allegations by his two accusers, and defended himself by saying, ""Some of the things I have said have been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation.""

""I never intended to offend anyone or cause any harm,"" the statement released on Sunday evening read.

""At work sometimes I think I am being playful and make jokes that I think are funny,"" Cuomo said. ""I do, on occasion, tease people in what I think is a good natured way.""

""I have teased people about their personal lives, their relationships, about getting married or not getting married,"" he continued. ""I mean no offense and only attempt to add some levity and banter to what is a very serious business.""



This could be a reference to the allegations by his second accuser, 25-year-old Charlotte Bennett, who claims that Cuomo asked her if she was romantically involved with someone and if she was monogamous during her relationships.

Cuomo, 63, said he had intended to be a mentor for Bennett.

""I now understand that my interactions may have been insensitive or too personal and that some of my comments, given my position, made others feel in ways I never intended,"" Cuomo stated.

He then gave an apology to anyone who ""misinterpreted"" him, ""I acknowledge some of the things I have said have been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation. To the extent anyone felt that way, I am truly sorry about that.""



Cuomo said he ""never inappropriately touched anybody"" and ""never propositioned anybody."" He added, ""I never intended to make anyone feel uncomfortable.""

Bennett told the New York Times, ""He also asked me in the same conversation if I had ever been with an older man.""



During a discussion about tattoos, Cuomo allegedly suggested that Bennett get the ink on her buttocks so people couldn't see the tattoo if she wore a dress.

Lindsey Boylan, the first woman to accuse Cuomo of sexual harassment, alleged that the governor kissed her on the lips without consent, touched her legs, joked about playing strip poker, and the harassment went on for years.

""These are allegations that New Yorkers deserve answers to,"" Cuomo said on Sunday. ""That's why I have asked for an outside, independent review that looks at these allegations.""

Last week, Cuomo hand-picked former U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones to carry out the independent investigation into the allegations, but backtracked on Sunday after blowback. Jones was a former law partner to one of Cuomo's closest advisors, Steve Cohen, which could be seen as a conflict of interest.

Cuomo released a new statement saying that New York State Attorney General Letitia James (D) and the chief judge of the court of appeals, Janet DiFiore, would jointly select an ""independent and qualified lawyer in private practice without political affiliation to conduct a thorough review and issue a public report.""

""We had selected former Federal Judge Barbara Jones, with a stellar record for qualifications and integrity, but we want to avoid even the perception of a lack of independence or inference of politics,"" the statement said. ""The work product will be solely controlled by that independent lawyer personally selected by the Attorney General and Chief Judge.""

James issued her own statement on the independent investigation.

""The state's Executive Law clearly gives my office the authority to investigate this matter once the governor provides a referral,"" James said. ""While I have deep respect for Chief Judge DiFiore, I am the duly elected attorney general and it is my responsibility to carry out this task, per Executive Law. The governor must provide this referral so an independent investigation with subpoena power can be conducted.""

As TheBlaze reported, numerous Democrats have called for an independent investigation into the allegations against Cuomo, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/andrew-cuomo-journalists-advise-all-the-time,2021-03-01
Florida commission finds probable cause that Democrat Andrew Gillum committed ethical violations,"An ethics complaint against Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for governor in 2018, is moving forward. The Florida Ethics Commission on Friday found probable cause that Gillum allegedly accepted gifts during on out-of-town trips with lobbyists and vendors and failed to report them, the Tallahassee Democrat reported.

What are the allegations?

Gillum is accused of soliciting and accepting gifts, according to his attorney Barry Richard. The gifts related to ""including rental accommodations in Costa Rica, a boat ride to see the Statue of Liberty and tickets to see the Broadway musical 'Hamilton' in 2016,"" CNN reported. Gillum traveled to Costa Rica in May 2016 and New York City in August 2016.

Florida law bans state officials from accepting gifts worth more than $100.

Gillum's attorney maintains there is conflicting testimony regarding what happened. He also said the allegations hang ""on a very thin thread.""

In October 2017, Tallahassee businessman Erwin Jackson named Gillum in his effort to ""expose corrupt state politicians.""

""I am relieved that with the help of the FBI these politicians will be held accountable for their self-serving and criminal actions,"" he wrote in an email to CNN.

Gillum was also subject to an FBI investigation during his campaign for governor. Republican Ron DeSantis won that race in November.

The FBI investigation was concerned with whether out-of-town developers influenced city planning projects. According to Gillum, the FBI has informed him that he is not considered the focus of the investigation.

Gillum did not attend Friday's hearing, but ""will definitely be attending the evidentiary hearing and he will be testifying at it,"" Richard reportedly said.

What's next?

An initial announcement about the hearing's findings is expected Wednesday. Then, Richard plans to request a public evidentiary hearing. Gillum is not considering a settlement, his attorney said.

""He will not settle,"" Richard told CNN. ""He actually welcomes the public hearing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/andrew-cuomo-sexual-harassment-lawsuit,2019-01-26
Andrew Yang condemns Hamas terrorists; AOC denounces him as 'utterly shameful',"New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang condemned Hamas terrorists for attacking Israel and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) called him ""utterly shameful"" in response.

Yang, an entrepreneur and former presidential candidate, tweeted his support for the Israeli people ""who are coming under bombardment attacks"" on Monday.

""The people of NYC will always stand with our brothers and sisters in Israel who face down terrorism and persevere,"" he added.



One NYC woman who did not always stand with Israel was Ocasio-Cortez, who was offended that Yang would offer his support to Israelis while he was scheduled to hand out groceries to Muslims celebrating the end of Ramadan, their religious season.

""Utterly shameful for Yang to try to show up to an Eid event after sending out a chest-thumping statement of support for a strike killing 9 children, especially after his silence as Al-Aqsa was attacked,"" she tweeted on Tuesday.

Yang told reporters that the organizers of the event asked him to cancel his appearance.

Hamas fired numerous rockets into Israel from the Gaza Strip after violence erupted between Palestinian protesters and police in Jerusalem. The Israelis retaliated with airstrikes on military targets in the Gaza. Palestinians have reported that as many as 20 people died in the airstrikes, including some children.

On Tuesday, violence spilled into the streets of several Israeli cities where Palestinians and their supporters attacked Jews, their homes and their businesses. The mayor of the town of Lod said the attacks were similar to those on Kristallnacht, when Jews were attacked in Nazi Germany.

Skirmishes between the supporters of Israel and those of the Palestinian cause erupted in New York City as well.

Andrew Yang caves to leftist outrage over his tweet condemning Hamas terrorists,"New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang appeared to apologize for a tweet condemning the terrorist attacks by Hamas militants on Israel after public outrage by the left and some of his own supporters.

""I'm standing with the people of Israel who are coming under bombardment attacks, and condemn the Hamas terrorists,"" said Yang in a tweet on Monday.

Yang, who is one of the front-runners in the mayoral race, was harangued by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) about the tweet on Tuesday but by Wednesday he acquiesced and cited many other detractors in his apology.

""I spoke to a group of volunteers for the campaign yesterday, some of whom have been with me for years. Many of them were upset with my recent tweet expressing solidarity with the people of Israel in conjunction with the violence in the region this week that has claimed the lives of innocents and children on both sides,"" said Yang in the lengthy statement posted to Twitter.

""They felt that my tweet was overly simplistic in my treatment of a conflict that has a long and complex history full of tragedies. And they felt it failed to acknowledge the pain and suffering on both sides. They were, of course, correct,"" he continued.

""I mourn for every Palestinian life taken before its time as I do for every Israeli,"" he continued. ""Suffering and pain and violence and death suffered by anyone hurts us all. All people want to be able to live in peace. We all ways that for ourselves and our children.""

Despite the clarification by Yang, many of his detractors were still unhappy that he did not condemn Israel in his new statement.

""The most telling part of @AndrewYang's erasure of Palestinian human rights, is he even used his apology to to say he's choosing sides. And that side is Israel,"" responded one critic on Twitter.

Yang wasn't the only mayoral candidate to have public relations troubles this week. Two candidates were mocked and ridiculed after they severely underestimated the cost of housing in NYC during a candidate interview.

Anthony Fauci net worth increased $5 million during pandemic,"Dr. Anthony Fauci's household net worth nearly doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a nonprofit government watchdog.

Open the Books – a government watchdog group – revealed that the household net worth Fauci and his wife increased by $5 million during the pandemic years.

Fauci and his wife, Christine Grady, saw their net worth jump from $7.6 million on Jan. 1, 2019, to more than $12.6 million on Dec. 31, 2021.

""During the ongoing pandemic year of 2021, the Fauci’s household income, perks and benefits, and unrealized investment gains totaled $2,832,876 — including federal income and benefits of $903,497; outside awards and royalties totaling $1,019,205; and $910,174 in investment gains,"" Open the Books reported.

Fauci made $456,028 in 2021 as the director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Fauci was paid $3.7 million between 2010 and 2020, according to financial disclosures.

Fauci allegedly is given 44 days of paid time off because he has been a federal employee for more than 55 years.

Fauci's wife – who is the chief at the National Institutes of Health's Clinical Center's Department of Bioethics – made $238,970 in 2021, according to Open the Books. Grady has reportedly been paid about $1.6 million in cash compensation since 2015.

Open the Books reported, ""Disclosures show $910,174 in gains within the Fauci stock, bond, and money market portfolio during 2021 – in 2020, the portfolio gained $794,369. The total value of Dr. Fauci’s investment account was $10,271,626 and his wife’s investments totaled another $2,405,887, as of 12/31/2021.""

A January 2021 Open the Books report found that Fauci is the highest-paid employee of the federal government.

Fauci – President Joe Biden's medical adviser – will reportedly receive the largest retirement package in U.S. government history.

""Our auditors at OpenTheBooks.com estimate Dr. Fauci’s annual retirement would exceed $350,000. Thereafter, his pension and benefits would continue to increase through annual cost-of-living adjustments,"" the group stated in December 2021.

""While Dr. Fauci has been a government bureaucrat for more than 55 years, his household net worth skyrocketed during the pandemic,"" Open the Books CEO Adam Andrzejewski told Fox News. ""Fauci's soaring net worth was based on career-end salary spiking, lucrative cash prizes awarded by non-profit organizations around the world, and an ever-larger investment portfolio.""

""Despite becoming a figure of controversy, the system has rewarded Dr. Fauci handsomely,"" Andrzejewski added. ""For example, he is the top-paid federal employee, his first-year golden parachute retirement pension is the largest in federal history, and he's accepting $1 million prizes from foreign non-profits.""

Open the Books reported in May that NIH scientists were given more than $350 million in royalties by third parties between fiscal years 2010 and 2020.

Open the Books noted, ""Because those payments enrich the agency and its scientists, each and every royalty payment could be a potential conflict of interest and needs disclosure.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/andrew-yang-caves-to-leftist-outrage-over-his-tweet-condemning-hamas-terrorists,2022-09-30
"Anti-Israel statement from Vanderbilt U. student gov't weeps for Palestinians — and predictably fails to mention 'Hamas,' 'rocket attacks,' or 'terrorism'","Vanderbilt University's student government was called out for issuing a decidedly anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian statement over the weekend in the wake of the recent ceasefire after nearly two weeks of deadly fighting between the warring factions.

What are the details?

The unsigned statement is curiously titled ""In Solidarity with Students"" — but given the weight of the overall words, it seemed clear that not every student was created equal in the eyes of the college's student government.

While it makes a passing reference about extending ""support and consolation to Israeli students also affected by this crisis"" and that ""there is no place for antisemitism or anti-Jewish sentiment of any kind"" on campus, the vast majority of the two-page statement is passionately anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian — and fails to even mention the words ""Hamas"" or ""terrorism"" or the thousands of rocket attacks the Jewish state endured.

The most blatantly anti-Israel sections of the statement are found on the second page where Vanderbilt's student government catalogs death and destruction by Israel's ""occupying forces"" and uses phrases such as ""indigenous Palestine,"" ""targeting Muslim Palestinians during the holy month of Ramadan,"" ""ethnic cleansing,"" and ""inhumane and cruel acts of war, supremacy, and genocide.""

Hillel had something to say

In the wake of the student government statement, Vanderbilt's Hillel group put together a response on its own Instagram page — and the campus' Jewish organization was not happy.

""Vanderbilt Hillel strongly condemns the recently released, biased statement from Vanderbilt Student Government,"" Hillel's statement begins. ""Despite VSG's claim to denounce antisemitism, their statement contributes to the continued erosion of Jewish students' sense of safety at Vanderbilt and has unleashed a torrent of offensive comments online.""

The Hillel statement goes on to say that Jewish students are being ""targeted for harassment and abuse for their Jewishness, Zionism, and support of Israel as a Jewish state"" and are left feeling ""unwelcome and threatened"" on campus. The statement also urged Vanderbilt to help student leaders especially to learn ""the ways that anti-Israel activism becomes antisemitism.""

What did Vanderbilt have to say?



The school made note on its website of the competing social media statements without mentioning specific student groups and encouraged peaceful, restrained interactions in regard to the volatile topic.

""Some student organizations on our campus have posted statements on social media about this issue that have prompted heated debate and discussion, marked by at times offensive and inflammatory rhetoric. Student organizations do not speak for the university or the overall Vanderbilt community.

Antifa targets vaccine mandate protest; Boston police clash,"Antifa targeted a vaccine mandate protest in Boston Common on Sunday. The situation turned violent as members of the far-left militant group clashed with protesters against vaccine and mask mandates.

The ""Super Happy Fun America"" organization — a Massachusetts-based political organization ""focusing on defending the American Constitution, opposing gender madness, and defeating cultural Marxism"" — held an anti-vaccine mandate rally at 12 p.m. on Sunday. The objective of the event was to ""resist vaccine passports, face diapers, mass layoffs, and unconstitutional mandates.""



Several Antifa-linked organizations, including ""Green Monster Antifa"" and ""Solidarity Against Hate - Boston,"" organized a counter-protest. The Antifa groups vowed to make sure the Super Happy Fun ""know where Boston stands"" and to get them the ""hell out of town.""

To demonstrate against the protest against government-mandated vaccines made and profited by big pharma, the Antifa mob held communist flags with the faces of Chairman Mao, Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Lenin, and Karl Marx. There was also a ""Death to fascists"" sign.

The counter-protest included a brass band to drown out the speakers railing against vaccine and mask mandates by the government.

Within an hour of the protest starting, the situation escalated into violence. WBTS-TV reporter Monica Madeja shared video of the violent clashes.

Boston police officers dressed in riot gear moved in to the area to quash the conflict.

By 2 p.m., the area was cleared out.

Boston Police officer Stephen McNulty told Fox News, ""Two arrested after opposing sides clashed at today's scheduled event and planned counter-protest on the Boston Common. BPD assets included officers in protective equipment.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/anthony-fauci-wife-net-worth-retirement,2021-11-08
Antifa goes after female MMA fighter who took down anti-Trump agitator at flag wave for veterans,"Antifa — the masked, black-clad leftists who claim they're ""anti-fascist"" but repeatedly have been caught on video ganging up on and beating up just about anybody who stands in their way — are going after MMA fighter Tara LaRosa.

LaRosa, as you likely recall, said a ""violent"" woman started a fight at a Portland, Oregon, flag wave for veterans Sunday — and the MMA fighter used her jiujitsu skills to pin the woman to the sidewalk until police arrived.

What is Antifa up to now?

The Twitter account of Long Beach Antifa called LaRosa a ""violent white nationalist,"" and pointed out to pay sites Cash App and Square that she's using them for charity — and wondered if Cash App and Square will ""take action"" against the MMA fighter.

LaRosa took screenshots of the tweets and asked a question of her own:

“So, let me get this straight... I break up a fight, saving one of their people from taking serious damage... And Antifa tries to deplatform me from yet another site? Awesome,"" she tweeted.



LaRosa's Cash App link in her Twitter profile was still online Wednesday, Fox Business said, adding that Cash App and Square didn't comment to the cable network.

What's the background?

LaRosa livestreamed the flag wave on an overpass above Interstate 84 when the physical altercation started between the woman and a female from LaRosa's group, the members of which were wearing ""Make America Great Again"" hats — the iconic symbol of President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign — and insignias for the controversial Proud Boys.

Here's a clip showing LaRosa on top of the woman, who pleaded with LaRosa to get off her and called herself a ""professor."" (Content warning: Language):

Others with LaRosa told the woman on the ground that ""you assaulted someone,"" and ""you're going to jail."" The woman complained that she couldn't breathe.

As LaRosa relented, she told the woman, ""If you get up, don't attack anybody.""

""I just got done having brunch with my friends,"" the woman is heard saying, after which she accused LaRosa's group of ""antagonizing the city I live in.""

""Stop f***ing trying to fight; we're not here trying to fight,"" LaRosa is heard saying after the woman moved away and sat with her back to overpass fence.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

""You don't know what Donald Trump is!"" the woman yelled. ""I don't agree with Trump!""



'Violent woman got violent'

LaRosa put her cellphone away amid her livestream when she took down the woman. After the incident, she pulled her cellphone out and showed her interaction with police.

A ""violent woman got violent,"" LaRosa said, explaining that ""I pulled her off using jiujitsu techniques ... I keep people safe; that's what I do.""

LaRosa told police that her group was on the overpass, facing passing cars and waving flags, when the woman approached them from behind and noticed their insignias and repeatedly said ""f*** Proud Boys."" The woman then attacked a female from the flag-waving group, LaRosa said, and that's when the MMA fighter stepped in. LaRosa said the woman bit her breast. No arrests were made, and police said there were conflicting accounts of the dust-up.

Anything else?

Fox Business said LaRosa, 41, was a past MMA champion and is among the female MMA pioneers of the sport. She last fought in May 2015, the outlet said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/anti-israel-vanderbilt-student-government,2019-11-14
AOC and Bernie Sanders try to block Biden admin's arms sale to Israel — all while the US' top Middle East ally is bombarded by Hamas terrorists,"Hamas has been bombarding Israel with rockets over the last several days in its latest efforts to violently challenge the United States' top ally in the region. Over the last week and a half, Hamas terrorists have fired more than 4,000 rockets at Israel, the nation's air force said, according to the Associated Press.

As Hamas rockets continued to rain down on Israeli communities, left-wing Democrats in the U.S. Congress were spending their time trying to stop President Joe Biden from selling arms to Israel that the nation could use to defend itself against terrorism.

What happened?

The Biden White House approved a $735 million sale of weapons to Israel, the Washington Post revealed Monday. These weapons include JDAMs, or Joint Direct Attack Munitions, which, Fox News said, are tail kits that convert ""dumb"" bombs into precision-guided missiles. Analysts believe JDAMs have been instrumental in the recent cross-border conflict with Hamas.

According to the Post, the administration notified Congress of the planned sale on May 5, five days before recent hostilities began. The declaration is required under law, and lawmakers have 15 days to object with a nonbinding disapproval resolution.

In the U.S. House of Representatives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has been leading the charge to kill the arms deal, along with known anti-Israel Democratic Reps. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.), who called the potential sale ""appalling.""

AOC, along with Tlaib and Rep. Mark Pocan, introduced a resolution Wednesday to block the arms sale.

In a statement on the resolution, the democratic-socialist lawmaker said, “For decades, the U.S. has sold billions of dollars in weaponry to Israel without ever requiring them to respect basic Palestinian rights. In so doing, we have directly contributed to the death, displacement and disenfranchisement of millions,"" the Post reported.

And she took to Twitter to claim that the move was all about protecting human rights and allege that Israel has been targeting civilian and media sites.

""The United States should not be rubber-stamping weapons sales to the Israeli government as they deploy our resources to target international media outlets, schools, hospitals, humanitarian missions and civilian sites for bombing,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""We have a responsibility to protect human rights.""

Israel has said that JDAMs have been used for the Gaza airstrikes and in other similar situations in order to avoid harming civilians, which is the opposite of what Hamas has done with its indiscriminate bombing of Israeli cities.



On the U.S. Senate side, avowed socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he plans to introduce a similar resolution Thursday to stop the weapons sale, the Post reported.

""At a moment when U.S.-made bombs are devastating Gaza, and killing women and children, we cannot simply let another huge arms sale go through without even a Congressional debate,"" Sanders tweeted.

""I believe that the United States must help lead the way to a peaceful and prosperous future for both Israelis and Palestinians,"" he continued in a follow-up tweet. ""We need to take a hard look at whether the sale of these weapons is actually helping do that, or whether it is simply fueling conflict.""

Though the Sanders resolution will likely get an up-or-down vote, its fate is uncertain, the Post said. Should it get the 51 votes needed for passage, it would still need to pass the House, which AOC and her ilk would likely support it.



The president, however, would have the power to veto the resolution. If he did, both congressional chambers would need to rally two-thirds of their respective bodies to overturn the veto.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/antifa-boston-police-vaccine-mandate-protest,2021-05-20
"AOC distanced herself from Bernie Sanders' campaign after alleged conflicts over immigration rhetoric, Joe Rogan","New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) appeared to be a huge boost to the democratic socialist's presidential campaign — but shortly before the Iowa caucuses, the relationship between the two like-minded politicians cooled off, HuffPost reported.

Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) were competing for the Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement, and she came out in favor of Sanders in October when he was fading somewhat in the polls and recovering from a heart attack that threatened his candidacy.

Iowa issues: Between October and late January, Ocasio-Cortez spoke for Sanders at 15 large rallies, including crucial events in Iowa while Sanders was in Washington, D.C., for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.



Problems surfaced after a Jan. 25 rally in which Ocasio-Cortez gave an entire speech on Sanders' behalf without mentioning his name once. She also encouraged people to work against immigration authorities on behalf of illegal immigrants. HuffPost reported that Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir told Ocasio-Cortez he didn't like her advocating for open noncooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, although Shakir has denied such communication.

Joe Rogan conflict: Sanders picked up another high-profile endorsement during that same late January period, when popular podcast host Joe Rogan indicated that he'd be voting for Sanders.



That endorsement was controversial in progressive circles, because Rogan has said some decidedly non-progressive things about transgender people — specifically that biological men who transition to become transgender women should not be able to compete in mixed martial arts fights against biological women.

Still, Sanders' campaign chose to embrace and publicize Rogan's endorsement — and Ocasio-Cortez was reportedly unhappy with that decision.

Ocasio-Cortez backs away: After a Jan. 26 event in Iowa, Ocasio-Cortez didn't campaign for Sanders for more than two weeks before showing up in New Hampshire, although a source familiar with the situation told HuffPost ""it was like pulling teeth"" to make that happen.



In the next month after that Feb. 10 New Hampshire appearance, Ocasio-Cortez reportedly turned down numerous requests from the Sanders campaign to speak for him in Nevada and South Carolina. Former Vice President Joe Biden's big wins in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday allowed Biden to take control of the primary from Sanders.

AOC endorses Maloney primary opponent,"Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has endorsed state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, a candidate challenging Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) in the Democratic primary in the state's 17th Congressional District — Maloney is the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

""I'm running for Congress to challenge inaction and political cowardice. New Yorkers deserve fierce champions in Washington, and that’s why I’m so proud to receive the endorsement of one of the bravest fighters I know: @AOC,"" Biaggi tweeted.

""I respect Rep. Ocasio-Cortez and have worked with her on a number of policy matters, including as a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. But, on her endorsement, we are going to have to agree to disagree,"" Maloney said in a statement, according to reports. ""This election comes down to voters in NY-17, and I am honored to have received overwhelming support locally, including endorsements from nearly 40 elected leaders and Democratic Party committees.""



Ocasio-Cortez had previously criticized Maloney's plan to run in the Empire State's new 17th District, a move that would have pitted Maloney directly against fellow New York Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones, though Jones ultimately opted to seek election in another district. The New York Times noted that while Maloney resides in the state's new 17th District, that region is largely represented by Jones.

""Given the resources that he has at his helm, it creates a conflict of interest,"" Ocasio-Cortez said last month, according to Politico — the congresswoman said that if Maloney opted to run in a primary against a fellow Democratic lawmaker, he should relinquish his DCCC responsibilities.



The outlet reported that Ocasio-Cortez described Maloney's behavior as ""particularly shameful as a member of Democratic leadership, especially as the leadership of the DCCC, who asks all of us to make sacrifices in one way or another, who asks progressives to make sacrifices on their stances in order to preserve a majority.""



Democrats are heading into the 2022 midterms with an unpopular president at the helm — President Joe Biden has been underwater on his job approval numbers in various polls for a long time. The election cycle also comes as Americans are getting soaked by soaring inflation, and gas prices have been skyrocketing.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-bernie-sanders-block-israel-arms-sale,2022-06-08
Ocasio-Cortez gets into a Twitter feud with progressives over union vote at Amazon facility,"Democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York got into a Twitter feud against former congressional candidate Krystal Ball over accusations that she was not really fighting for progressives.

Ocasio-Cortez was celebrating the successful vote to unionize an Amazon facility in Staten Island, New York, when Ball side-swiped her with the criticism that she didn't do enough to help the effort to unionize.

""Here’s the guy who organized the union drive talking about how you left them high and dry. These are your constituents and you couldn’t be bothered to show up until they’re on the cusp of victory,"" replied Ball with a video of a union organizer criticizing Ocasio-Cortez.

Ocasio-Cortez fired back at Ball.

""The warehouse isn’t in my district and maybe you should look at a map before claiming so,"" she tweeted. ""One scheduling conflict aside, we have requested oversight investigations into Amazon, met with Amazon workers in the Woodside warehouses, and more. Hope you do more due diligence next time.""

When Ocasio-Cortez was challenged on her excuses by a reporter, she added another excuse.

""Security was an issue as well. 2021 included a lot of high level threats on my life, which limited what activities I was able to do, especially those outside. The combination of that + when we are able to get resources/time to secure them creates scheduling + logistical conflicts,"" she responded in another tweet.

The video Ball posted was an interview on her show with a union organizer in Staten Island accusing Ocasio-Cortez and the other members of ""the Squad"" of ignoring their effort.

""You don't have time to visit the Amazon workers but you have time to wear a 'Tax the Rich' dress while you're around the richest a**holes in the f***ing country? C'mon,"" said co-host Kyle Kulinski.

""Yeah, you don't have time to actually go speak truth to power with Jeff Bezos, but you have time to cosplay with a bunch of fancy people in a dress,"" Ball added.

Krystal Ball unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Congress in 2010 in Virginia and later became a political commentator on the far-left. The Staten Island vote was the first successful vote to unionize workers at an Amazon facility.

"AOC says many people in the US hate women, and she sometimes thinks somebody like her could not become president","Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told GQ that many individuals in the U.S. hate women and that she sometimes thinks that somebody like her could not be elected president.

""Sometimes little girls will say, 'Oh, I want you to be president,' or things like that,"" the progressive lawmaker said when questioned about whether she thought that she or a person like her could ever lead the nation, according to the outlet. ""It's very difficult for me to talk about because it provokes a lot of inner conflict in that I never want to tell a little girl what she can't do. And I don't want to tell young people what is not possible. I've never been in the business of doing that,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

""I hold two contradictory things [in mind] at the same time. One is just the relentless belief that anything is possible,"" the congresswoman said. ""But at the same time, my experience here has given me a front-row seat to how deeply and unconsciously, as well as consciously, so many people in this country hate women. And they hate women of color. People ask me questions about the future. And realistically, I can't even tell you if I'm going to be alive in September. And that weighs very heavily on me. And it's not just the right wing. Misogyny transcends political ideology: left, right, center. This grip of patriarchy affects all of us, not just women; men, as I mentioned before, but also, ideologically, there's an extraordinary lack of self-awareness in so many places. And so those are two very conflicting things. I admit to sometimes believing that I live in a country that would never let that happen.""



""Could Obama have gotten elected without the kind of financial support that he had?"" she questioned, indicating that her position against Wall Street would represent a significant obstacle in her path, according to the outlet. ""I don't know.""

Ocasio-Cortez, who has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2019, is not currently old enough to serve as president, but shortly before the 2024 presidential election she will turn 35 — at that point, she will meet the minimum age requirement for the presidency as stipulated by the Constitution.

""I try to think about how I can be most effective and, honestly, to this point, I have not come up with an alternative that I have found more effective than what I'm doing at the present moment,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, according to GQ.

Ocasio-Cortez makes another controversial statement about Israel — and the US too,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is facing more criticism over controversial comments where she said that some communities, including those in the United States, had ""no choice"" but to riot.

She made the comments during a radio show on New York's Hot 97 on Tuesday while discussing the conflict over the state of Israel.

""Once you have a group that is marginalized,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, ""once someone doesn't have access to clean water, they have no choice but to riot.""

She then extended her comments to include other communities, including some in the United States.

""I'm not even talking about Palestinians,"" she added. ""I'm talking about communities in poverty in the United States, I'm talking about Latin America, I'm talking about all over the world.""

Some on social media remarked that it was tone-deaf for the Democratic socialist to be sympathizing with rioting after her comments were quoted in the manifesto of an Antifa domestic terrorist who attacked ICE detention centers.

She went on to claim that ""social destabilization is what happens when people do not have a plan or feel like there's no vision for their future.""

Ocasio-Cortez was criticized on Tuesday for voicing agreement with a radio host who blamed the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis on ""white supremacist Jews.""

AP distorts Florida anti-CRT bill to imply DeSantis wants to 'shield whites' from 'discomfort',"A spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) slammed the Associated Press after a report misleadingly claimed an anti-critical race theory bill is intended to ""shield whites from 'discomfort.'""

Leading with the headline, ""Florida could shield whites from ‘discomfort’ of racist past,"" AP writer Brendan Farrington claimed that a bill supported by DeSantis ""would prohibit public schools and private businesses from making white people feel 'discomfort' when they teach students or train employees about discrimination.""

But the only excerpt of the bill quoted in the AP article makes no mention of people of any color. It states, ""An individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex. An individual should not be made to feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race.”

The bill, S.B. 148, is titled ""Individual Freedom"" and was introduced by Republican Sen. Manny Diaz, a Hispanic lawmaker. Diaz told the AP that his bill is intended to make sure that no group of people is singled out on the basis of their skin color and blamed for the sins of the past.

“No individual is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously, solely by the virtue of his or her race or sex,” Diaz said. “No race is inherently superior to another race.”

Diaz was referring to tenets of critical race theory, a worldview that claims most laws and systems in America were historically rooted in the racist oppression of black people and other marginalized groups. Formulated by legal scholars in the 1970s as a response to perceptions that the civil rights movement did not sufficiently advance equality, CRT holds that racism is systemic in America's institutions and that white people who support those institutions are complicit in perpetuating the oppression of blacks and other minorities.

Conservatives reject this worldview, arguing that it substitutes race conflict for traditional Marxist class conflict to define white people as an oppressor class and everyone else as a victim class to justify programs for wealth redistribution. Republican politicians and conservative activists have proposed laws to ban critical race theory concepts from being taught in schools, while preserving the teaching of U.S. history.

Diaz's bill prohibits the teaching of collective guilt for members of any race. While that appears to be a response to critical race theory's claims about white people perpetuating racism, the text of the bill protects all people from being told they are collectively guilty of sins because of the color of their skin. It is not a bill to protect ""white people"" from feeling discomfort by talking about racism or the historic discrimination against non-whites in America.

In fact, the bill explicitly requires that schools teach ""the history of African Americans, including the history of African peoples before the political conflicts that led to the development of slavery, the passage to America, the enslavement experience, abolition, and the contributions of African Americans to society.”

But left-wing pundits seized on the AP report to attack Florida Republicans. MSNBC host Joy Reid falsely claimed Florida was ""literally legislating white people’s psychic comfort.""

""To reiterate: it’s about to be ILLEGAL IN FLORIDA TO MAKE WHITE PEOPLE SAD. Fix it Jesus!"" she lied.

Responding to the AP's distortion of the Florida bill, DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw blasted the report, calling the outlet ""American Pravda"" and accusing the AP of ""implying that [DeSantis] is a white supremacist.""

She also claimed that Farrington lied by writing that DeSantis' office did not respond to a request for comment after Democratic state lawmaker Sen. Shevrin Jones, who is black, told the AP DeSantis has adopted ""racist rhetoric on critical race theory"" and claimed the bill was a solution to a ""problem that doesn't exist."" Jones also said the governor's policies are racist.

DeSantis communications director Taryn Fenske shared a screenshot of Farrington's request for comment, in which the reporter told the governor's office that he asked Jones if Jones thinks DeSantis ""is racist"" and then asked for a comment. The email had no greeting, no deadline to respond, and didn't even include a professional signature.

Fenske's response was, ""I just want to clarify — that you, without any context, asked a sitting State Senator if the Governor of Florida is a racist, while on the clock, being paid by the Associated Press?""

Her response was not quoted in Farrington's article.

The article was later updated to say, ""The governor’s spokeswoman reiterated comments DeSantis made at a news conference last month in which he referred to the late civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-people-hate-women-president,2022-01-19
AP fires writer after Republican college group unearths her anti-Israel political activities,"The Associated Press faced bitter outrage from the left after the news agency fired a writer over anti-Israel political activities unearthed and publicized by a Republican college group.

Emily Wilder was a member of Students for Justice in Palestine at Stanford University and joined efforts to host a cartoonist who has been accused of employing offensive anti-Semitic tropes.

The Stanford College Republicans discovered the tweet where Wilder said she was hired by AP in April and led a campaign against her. Although many in the journalism world defended Wilder, by Thursday she was fired from her job.

Some in the mainstream media expressed outrage at the firing. Glenn Kessler of the Washington Post said the AP should have guided Wilder instead of caving to the ""Twitter mob.""

""Amazing how quickly a talented young reporter's career can be snuffed out by a Twitter mob that decided to feign outrage over some college tweets,"" he tweeted.



The AP says in its social media policy that employees should avoid ""any postings that express political views.""

The policy statement adds that AP staffers need to ""be aware that opinions they express may damage the AP's reputation as an unbiased source of news. AP employees must refrain from declaring their views on contentious public issues in any public forum and must not take part in organized action in support of causes or movements.""

The firing of Wilder comes at a time when the AP is facing questions about its presence in a building in the Gaza Strip where Hamas militants were also housed. That building was later targeted by an Israeli airstrike during its deadly conflict with Hamas.

""We are not surprised that Emily Wilder, a livid Anti-Israel Activist and Students for Justice in Palestine Leader at Stanford, has just been hired by the Associated Press as a new correspondent, especially in light of recent revelations regarding the Associated Press' ties to Hamas,"" said a spokesman for the Stanford College Republicans to The Federalist.

Arizona appeals court blocks enforcement of abortion ban,"On Friday, an Arizona appeals court ruled with Planned Parenthood to halt the enforcement of a statewide abortion ban. The decision means that abortions up to 15 weeks are temporarily legal in the state.



Last month, Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson lifted a 1973 injunction against a 1901 law that banned abortion in Arizona. The September ruling paused abortion statewide in nearly all cases, except when the mother's life was at risk.

Republican Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who pushed for the judge's ruling to lift the injunction, applauded the decision.

""We applaud the court for upholding the will of the legislature and providing clarity and uniformity on this important issue,"" Brnovich wrote on Twitter. ""I have and will continue to protect the most vulnerable Arizonans.""

Pro-abortion advocates criticized the judge for reinstating ""a Civil War-era law"" created before Arizona became a state.

Planned Parenthood of Arizona requested an appeal of Johnson's ruling, arguing that the judge should have considered the many laws restricting and regulating abortion that have been passed since the injunction. Sarah Mac Dougall, an attorney for the organization, stated that the 1901 law should be limited so it does not conflict with laws passed after it.

The Arizona Court of Appeals judges agreed with Planned Parenthood. Presiding Judge Peter J. Eckerstrom wrote, ""Arizona courts have a responsibility to attempt to harmonize all of this state's relevant statutes.""

""Today's decision provides a desperately needed sense of security for both our patients and providers,"" said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ""We can now breathe a sigh of relief and serve patients. While the fight isn't over, for now, Arizonans will once again be able to make their own decisions about their bodies, health care decisions, and futures.""

Last month, a 15-week abortion ban went into effect in Arizona. The law was signed by Governor Doug Ducey in March, who said that the ban takes precedence and will not be impacted by the court's Friday decision. Before the 15-week law, abortion was legal in Arizona up to 24 weeks of pregnancy.

According to the Arizona Department of Health Services' yearly reports, the 15-week ban would impact only 5% of abortions performed in the state. The past three yearly reports showed that there are approximately 13,000 abortions performed statewide each year.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ap-distorts-florida-anti-crt-bill-to-imply-desantis-wants-to-shield-whites-from-discomfort,2022-10-09
"Arizona Democrat Katie Hobbs opposes week-based abortion restrictions, denies that late-term elective abortions happen","Arizona Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs said that politicians should not be involved in a woman's decision to obtain an abortion, articulating a de facto no-restrictions position that her Republican opponent Kari Lake has called ""extremist.""

Hobbs, who is currently Arizona's secretary of state, gave an interview to CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, during which host Major Garrett her asked her whether she supports a 15-week ban on abortion.

The Democratic candidate said she opposes the 15-week ban and accused Lake of misrepresenting her position on abortion.

""I don't support the 15-week ban. But let me just say that Kari Lake is entirely misconstruing my position on this issue. You and I both know that late-term abortion is extremely rare, and if it's being talked about, it's because something has gone incredibly wrong in a pregnancy,"" Hobbs said.

She then denied that late-term elective abortions happen. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 992 surgical abortions and 159 medical abortions after 13 weeks of pregnancy in Arizona in 2019. Fewer than 1% of abortions are performed after 21 weeks' gestation, the CDC says.



""A doctor is not going to perform an abortion late in a pregnancy just because somebody decided they want one. That is ridiculous, and she's saying this to distract from her incredibly extreme position,"" Hobbs claimed.



She also asserted that if Lake wins, Arizona will have ""government-mandated forced births.""



But when Garrett pressed her on whether there should be any week restrictions on abortion, she would not answer the question.

""Abortion is a very personal decision that belongs between a woman and her doctor. The government and politicians don't belong in that decision. We need to let doctors perform the care that they are trained and take an oath to perform,"" Hobbs said.

""So, if an Arizona voter were to conclude from your previous answer that you do not favor any specific week limit on abortion, would they be correct?"" Garrett asked.

Hobbs replied, ""I support leaving the decision between a woman and her doctor and leaving politicians entirely out of it.""

Lake appeared on ""Face the Nation"" before Hobbs and said regarding abortion that as governor she would enforce the law, although what the law says is currently being debated in court.



Arizona originally banned abortion in 1864, but that long-standing law was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. In March, Gov. Doug Ducey (R) signed a new 15-week abortion ban into law. After the court overturned Roe in June, the dueling abortion laws came into conflict, and abortion providers sued to block the 1864 near-total ban from taking effect.

Watch:



Kari Lake, Arizona's Republican gubernatorial candidate, says ""we have a crisis on our border"" youtu.be

Lake said that Ducey's 15-week abortion law takes precedence and said she would follow that law if elected governor. She has previously called the older law ""a great law"" and said she would support a fetal heartbeat law that would ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.

“I am a woman, I’m a mother. I'm all for women's health care — I come from a large family, seven sisters I have — of course I want women's health care. This has moved beyond health care,” Lake told Garrett. “We're not giving women choices. I’m for giving women true choices. And when they walk into an abortion center, they're only given one choice.

Arizona Governor Doug Ducey visits Taiwan to secure a semiconductor manufacturing plant in the state,"Arizona Governor Doug Ducey traveled to Taiwan on Tuesday to meet with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen to discuss a multibillion-dollar semiconductor manufacturing deal.



Arizona is set to build a $12 billion Phoenix plant for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., reported the Associated Press. TSMC announced last year that it would be investing $3.5 billion in the new U.S. factory.

Intel Corp. announced in March 2021 that it would fund two additional Arizona semiconductor factories. The company has been manufacturing in the state since 1980 and plans to invest another $20 billion in the additional facilities.

Governor Ducey and Arizona's Chamber of Commerce president and head of economic development were the latest U.S. officials to visit Taiwan, despite repeated warnings from China. Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb traveled to the self-governing island last week to strengthen foreign relations and discuss the processor chip industry.

Semiconductors are crucial for nearly all electronics, such as smartphones, computers, high-tech weapons systems, medical devices, and vehicles. In December 2021, Reuters reported that TSMC produced more than 90% of the world's processor chips.

The semiconductor industry was invented in Silicon Valley, but Taiwan now dominates the market. According to Fast Company, Intel produced nearly 40% of the world's output of processor chips in the 1990s.

U.S. officials are now prioritizing semiconductor manufacturing in the country. In July, Congress passed a law offering more than $52 billion in grants and other aid to the processor chip industry. The CHIPS Act would also provide a 25% tax credit to those who invest in U.S. factories.

State officials nationwide are vying for semiconductor factories in their communities to boost local economies and strengthen the country's technology independence.

In addition to the two factories breaking ground in Arizona, Intel also announced a $20 billion investment in an Ohio chip factory.

Samsung Electronics revealed that it would build a new $17 billion facility in Austin, Texas.

In response to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's previous visit to Taiwan in August, China began running live-fire military drills off the island's coast. On Tuesday, President Tsai Ing-wen told troops to remain calm despite the ongoing threats, ABC News reported. The president stated, ""The more provocative enemy soldiers are, the more stable we need to be. We will not allow those on the opposing banks to manufacture a conflict with an inappropriate excuse.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-appeals-court-blocks-enforcement-of-abortion-ban,2022-08-30
"Arizona is 'taking action,' defying Biden administration and refusing to take down improvised border wall","On October 14, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation demanded that Arizona remove the double-stacked, razor-wire-wreathed shipping containers that Arizona installed along gaps in the U.S.-Mexico border wall near Yuma as a means to help stem the flow of criminal noncitizens into the country. On Tuesday, Arizona refused.

The BOR, a federal agency under the U.S. Department of the Interior, noted that the Department of Homeland Security as well as Customs and Border Protection had awarded contracts to fill in the gaps of the border area located on BOR lands near Morelos Dam. It indicated additional contracts would soon be awarded.

Jacklynn Gould, the regional director of the BOR, expressed concern about a potential conflict between Arizona, which already got the job done, and prospective contract awardees. She also demanded that the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs ""cease further placement of shipping containers on federal or Indian trust lands.""

Gould stated that the ""unauthorized placement of those containers constitutes a violation of federal law and is a trespass against the United States.""

The Ducey administration placed the containers in order to address the trespass of 2,150,639 illegal aliens into the U.S. so far this year.

The BOR director suggested that the encroachment by DEMA's shipping containers constitutes a ""trespass"" that is ""harming federal lands and resources and impeding Reclamation's ability to perform its mission.""

In a letter sent to the BOR on October 18, DEMA director Allen Clark stated, ""Arizona has not seen any action by the federal government. ... The containers will remain in place until specific details regarding construction are provided.""

Clark wrote, ""The myriad of federal agencies that claim jurisdiction on the southern border but do nothing to prevent the public nuisance caused by illegal immigration and criminal activity that exploits the open border is quite frustrating to those that live, work and recreate on that border and in our state.""

""States like Arizona ... cannot rely on the federal government to ensure its security,"" said Clark.

The letter also contended that the regulation cited by the BOR didn't actually prohibit Arizona's actions and that the state had a guaranteed right, under Article IV, section 4 of the Constitution, to protect and defend itself.

Ducey’s communications director, C.J. Karamargin, indicated that the BOR's demand is a ""nonstarter.""



""We've been hearing for months now that (the Biden administration) was planning to do something and they've done nothing,"" said Karamargin. ""So while they're talking about it and writing letters, we're actually taking action.""

Karamargin also reiterated that the Ducey administration believes ""it's well within Arizona's rights to take this action.""

Ducey tweeted, ""The Border Barrier Mission is working. Arizona is protecting its citizens. Why the federal government won’t is beyond belief.""

Ducey signed a bill into law on June 30 that would finance the construction of a wall along the Arizona border with Mexico.

$335 million in state funds was directed to ""construct and maintain a border fence, purchase or install border security technologies, and to pay associated administrative costs."" An additional $209 million was allocated to fund ""border-related enforcement.""



President Joe Biden halted construction of the southern border wall when he took office. Only after Arizona took the initiative this summer to buttress American sovereignty did the Biden administration announce that it would complete the border wall near the Yuma sector.



In the meantime, the Republican-led state got to work on shoring up border security.

On August 12, Ducey declared, ""Arizona has had enough. We can't wait any longer. The Biden administration's lack of urgency on border security is a dereliction of duty.""

Ducey indicated that he would fortify gaps in the state's border, using 60 double-stacked 8,800-pound shipping containers, all reinforced with concertina wire at the top. DEMA did just that, successfully plugging the gaps in the border barrier with nearly 130 containers, all double-stacked, linked together, and welded shut, filling 3,820 feet of gaps.

The containers cost the state only $6 million.

In September, Ducey said, ""It's our responsibility to protect our citizens and law enforcement from this unprecedented crisis. With the resources and manpower in the right places, our Border Patrol and law enforcement will be better equipped to do their jobs well and prevent cartels from exploiting our communities. That’s exactly what our barrier mission will do.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-democrat-katie-hobbs-opposes-week-based-abortion-restrictions-denies-that-late-term-elective-abortions-happen,2022-10-20
Associated Press reporter canned over erroneous report suggesting Russia had launched a missile into a NATO country,"An award-winning Associated Press reporter got the boot on Monday after claiming that a ""senior U.S. intelligence official"" had said Russia fired a missile into Poland. Before the AP offered a correction, 35-year-old James LaPorta's report — containing an erroneous suggestion with potentially catastrophic and nuclear repercussions — was widely circulated, generating panic and stoking geopolitical tensions.

The facts

On Nov. 15, Russia launched a brutal missile barrage targeting energy infrastructure in western Ukraine. During the attack, Ukrainian air defenses reportedly fired an errant missile into Poland.

The resultant explosion rocked the Polish village of Przewodów, just five miles away from the Ukrainian border. Two farm workers were killed.

NATO, Polish, and American leaders suggested shortly after the explosion that it was not a direct Russian attack.

Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch told Poland's TVN24 channel days later that there ""are many indications that one of the (Ukrainian) missiles used to shoot down a Russian missile missed the target. Its self-destruct system did not work, and this missile unfortunately led to a tragedy.""

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called the claim that the explosion was Ukrainian-caused a ""conspiracy theory.""

Fake news, real consequences

Hours after the incident, the Associated Press issued a news alert co-bylined by LaPorta and reporter John Leicester, which stated, ""A senior U.S. intelligence official says Russian missiles crossed into NATO member Poland, killing two people.""

A Russian attack on Poland would have been sufficient to trigger articles 4 and 5 of the NATO charter, potentially putting the U.S. into direct conflict with the nuclear power.



The Washington Post noted that the AP report had been sent to and seen by thousands of news outlets. News organizations frequently reprint reports from the AP.

CNN firmed up the narrative, reporting that Poland ""confirms a Russian-made missile"" was behind the explosion. CNN reportedly omitted any mention of how the Ukrainian military also uses Russian-made weapons.

Fox News and the Daily Mail similarly carried the AP reporter's suggestion, the former running a piece entitled, ""Russian missiles cross into NATO member Poland, kill 2: senior US intelligence official,"" and the latter stating, ""'Russian bombs' kill two in POLAND.""

CBS Evening News tweeted ""RUSSIAN MISSILE STRIKE: Two Russian missiles crossed over the Ukrainian border into Poland, a NATO country, killing two civilians.""

Extra to cable news channels and print news organizations spreading the erroneous information, social media influencers began banging the drums of war on the basis of the AP report, signaling that Russia's war on Ukraine had finally spilled out into a NATO country.

For instance, Irish writer Jennifer Cassidy advanced the AP's claim to her 167,000 or more Twitter followers:

Although it is unclear whether he spoke out on the basis of the AP report, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a forceful statement, saying, ""Russian missiles hit Poland, the territory of our friendly country. People died.""

Were LaPorta's news alert true, then millions of people would have been promptly informed of the facts of the matter. Unfortunately, that was not the case.

Retraction

After having updated the initial report several times, the AP indicated that a new assessment from three U.S. officials ""contradicts information"" in the original article. Shortly thereafter, the article was reportedly taken offline.

The AP issued a retraction later that day, writing: ""In earlier versions of a story published November 15, 2022, The Associated Press reported erroneously, based on information from a senior American intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity, that Russian missiles had crossed into Poland and killed two people. Subsequent reporting showed that the missiles were Russian-made and most likely fired by Ukraine in defense against a Russian attack.""

On Nov. 21, LaPorta, a former U.S. Marine who served in Afghanistan, was fired. Co-byliner Leicester reportedly is still working at the AP.

An AP spokesman did not comment on LaPorta's firing, but told the Daily Beast that the ""rigorous editorial standards and practices of The Associated Press are critical to AP’s mission as an independent news organization. To ensure our reporting is accurate, fair and fact-based, we abide by and enforce these standards, including around the use of anonymous sources.""



Customarily, the AP ""requires more than one source when sourcing is anonymous,"" with an exception when a source is an authoritative figure who ""provides information so detailed that there is no question of its accuracy.""

The Washington Post reported that LaPorta had received and shared the alleged U.S. intelligence official's tip in an electronic message around 1:30 p.m. on Nov. 15.

One editor asked whether to issue an alert on the basis of LaPorta's tip or to seek ""confirmation from another source and/or Poland?""

A second editor said she ""would vote"" for publishing an alert, noting she couldn't ""imagine a U.S. intelligence official would be wrong on this.""

Although this exchange may suggest wider culpability, the Post reported on the basis of an anonymous source at the AP that LaPorta allegedly told his editors that a senior manager had already vetted the source of his tip, even though that manager had not reviewed the missile story.

AP spokesman Lauren Easton indicated there will likely be no discipline for any AP editor.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-governor-visits-taiwan,2022-11-22
At least one Democratic senator thinks Hunter Biden is a relevant witness,"As Democrats push for witness testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, at least one Democrat thinks the Senate should hear from another relevant witness: Hunter Biden.

After hearing from the House impeachment managers and Trump's defense team, both of whom referred to Biden heavily in their opening arguments, West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin believes partisanship should be put aside in search of the complete truth.

""I think so, I really do. I don't have a problem there because this is why we are where we are,"" Manchin told MSNBC when asked if Biden was a relevant witness. ""Now I think he can clear himself, what I know and what I've heard, but being afraid to put anyone that might have pertinent information is wrong, no matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican.""

There is no denying that Biden's activities in Ukraine are central to impeachment. One of the articles of impeachment asserts that Trump abused his power to coerce Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Hunter's father, Joe Biden.

That sought-after investigation concerned Hunter's appointment to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and whether Joe Biden used his status as vice president and Ukraine point man to protect Hunter and Burisma from anti-corruption investigations.

Trump's defense team argues that seeking such an investigation, even if it carries some personal political benefit to the president, also serves a public interest because there were serious concerns about a potential conflict of interest involving the Bidens.

The House impeachment managers, led by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), spent a significant portion of their opening argument claiming that there was no corruption by the Bidens in Ukraine, and that Trump's desire for an investigation was purely for his political benefit.

The Senate will likely vote Friday on whether or not to call new witnesses such as Bolton or Hunter Biden to testify in the trial.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-is-taking-action-defying-biden-administration-and-refusing-to-take-down-improvised-border-wall,2020-01-29
"Atlanta baseball game turns deadly: 2 dead, 4 wounded, including 6-year-old child","A baseball game in Atlanta turned deadly over the weekend when an argument quickly escalated into violence.

At around 7 p.m. local time, police were called to Dunbar Recreational Center inside Rosa L. Burney Park on the southwest side of the city. When police arrived, they found several victims who had been shot, including a 6-year-old child. All six victims were taken to the hospital.

A man in his 30s, whom friends later identified as Rashad Rogers, later succumbed to his injuries.

""I know that he is a father and his kids are going to miss him, so we want to make sure that this doesn’t happen to any other father or child,"" said Kimberly Dukes, a friend of Rogers who was not present at the incident.

Reports Sunday night claimed that the other five wounded victims were in stable condition. However, April Sparks, a 33-year-old woman who was also taken to the hospital that night, passed away on Monday.

A 6-year-old girl was taken to the hospital in critical condition. There have been no updates on her condition.

Atlanta Deputy Chief Charles Hampton Jr. spoke to reporters about the shooting incident.

""What we know so far is that there was some type of baseball, softball game ongoing, and some type of argument ensued and next thing you know, there was an exchange of gunfire,"" Hampton said.

The Miami Herald has reported that there was another shooting incident later that same evening about a half-mile away from Burney Park. Though police are still investigating, they believe that the two shootings may have been connected.

In the wake of all the bloodshed, police are asking people to resolve their disagreements peacefully and not to resort to violence.

""As we’ve said countless times,"" Hampton said, ""we’re just asking the citizens just to find a way to resolve conflict without weapons. We’re just asking people to step away, we’re asking people just to let bygones be bygones.

""Any time that we have any tragedy like this – any death is a tragedy – then as we have kids that are also involved … this is not a place for gunplay. So, we’re just asking everyone to leave the guns at home.""

Police are searching for a man they believe may be involved in the baseball park shooting, and they have released photos of the suspect, images which may have been captured at the park. However, no arrests have yet been made.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/associated-press-reporter-canned-over-report-suggesting-russia-had-launched-a-missile-into-a-nato-country,2022-08-09
Atlanta Mayor blames Georgia reopen early for violent crime,"Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has blamed the current violent crime spike in her city on Georgia's Republican governor reopening too early. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp refuted those claims and told Bottoms to look at her party's ""anti-police agenda"" for the surge in violent crime.

Homicides in Atlanta are up 58% compared to 2020, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which noted that there were 157 homicides in a ""historically deadly 2020,"" the most in more than two decades. In June, murders and shootings are up 40%. All while Atlanta's police force ""remains more than 400 officers under its authorized level."" There were 200 police officers who quit the force in 2020, and another 75 cops left since the start of the year.

The crime has gotten so out of control that one Atlanta neighborhood wants a divorce from the city because they believe the police are underfunded.

Bill White, chairman and CEO of the Buckhead City Committee, told Fox News, ""We filed our divorce papers at the city of Atlanta — and our divorce is final. We have two bills in the Georgia legislature dropping in January to decide this referendum ballot.""

On Friday, MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle asked Bottoms about the violent crime spike, which the Atlanta mayor has previously called a ""COVID crime wave.""

""Remember in Georgia we were opened up before the rest of the country, even before the CDC said that it was safe for us to open, so our night clubs and our bars remained open so we had people traveling here from across the country to party in our city,"" Bottoms replied.



Bottoms then seemed to contradict herself in her next statement, where she said violent crime is up in cities across the country, including in Democrat-controlled states that only recently opened back up this month.

""If it were an Atlanta issue alone then I'd know that there was something that we weren't getting right… but I'm talking to mayors and hearing from mayors in cities and large urban areas, we're all experiencing this which means that we all have to work together to find a solution to this gun violence that is gripping our nation,"" Bottoms told Ruhle.

Gov. Kemp responded to Bottoms' implications that he was at fault for the violent crime surge in her city, and told her to look inward about the rising crime rate.

""According to the mayor, rising crime in our capital city is everyone's fault but her's,"" Kemp fired back on Twitter. ""Getting Georgians back to work, back to school, and back to normal didn't lead to more crime. The left's anti-police, soft-on-crime agenda is to blame.""



""That's why I worked alongside the General Assembly to increase penalties for dangerous street racing and committed additional funding for state law enforcement officers to assist in crime suppression efforts in Atlanta,"" the Republican governor of Georgia said. ""Keeping our families safe will remain my top priority.""

Bottoms also blamed the coronavirus pandemic and access to guns for Atlanta's crime crisis.

Bottoms said that ""COVID left a lot of people battered and bruised, not just physically but also emotionally,"" which led to an increase in personal disputes between people who have an ""inability or an unwillingness to simply resolve conflict with words.""

""Until we deal with the systemic issues of gun violence in this country, how easily young people, people with mental illnesses can access guns in this country, I'm afraid that this will not be the last summer that we are having this conversation,"" Bottoms told the left-wing cable network.

Bottoms admitted that law enforcement officers are leaving the police force in droves.

""But law enforcement across the nation has really had a difficult time retaining and attracting people into law enforcement,"" Bottoms said. ""What we're seeing right now in Atlanta, people who are eligible for retirement in previous years perhaps would have considered staying on the force a bit longer, people are leaving the force, and again, this is not just happening in Atlanta, it's happening across the country.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/at-least-one-democratic-senator-thinks-hunter-biden-is-a-relevant-witness,2021-06-20
Frustrated Atlanta cops lament young woman killed over a bowling ball: 'This is truly an atrocity',"A young woman in Atlanta, Georgia, lost her life this week as a result of an argument over a bowling ball, police said, describing the incident as an ""atrocity.""

According to WSB-TV, officers responded to reports of shots fired outside the Metro Fun Center in southwest Atlanta just before 11 p.m. on Thursday night. When they arrived, they discovered the body of a 31-year-old woman later identified as Lakevia Jackson.

Jackson had reportedly been attending a celebration at the amusement venue — which includes a bowling alley, arcade, and roller skating rink, among other entertainment options — when she got into an argument with an unidentified man.

The argument reportedly escalated and spilled into the parking lot, where the man is believed to have opened fire on Jackson, killing her, WAGA-TV reported.

Lt. Ralph Woolfolk, who commands the department’s homicide unit, lamented the senseless tragedy in conversation with reporters Thursday.

""This is truly an atrocity,"" Woolfolk said, not mincing words. ""We talk about conflict resolution time and time again, and once again this is an escalated dispute in which a young lady has lost her life over a bowling ball.""

Police only have one suspect in the case, but as of Friday morning, he had not been identified. The incident was reportedly captured by surveillance video and investigators spent Thursday night collecting ballistic evidence and speaking to witnesses on the scene to piece together what happened.



""We will find the person who’s responsible. You know who you are. Go ahead and turn yourself in. We assure you that we will bring you into custody,"" Woolfolk said.



The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted that about 41% of homicides in Atlanta this year have resulted from disputes that escalated to gunfire. Homicides are also up in the city since the start of the year.

Law enforcement officials have begged city residents to stop the violence. Just this week, Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton urged residents to put their guns down, suggesting that police presence alone is unable to keep up with the crime.

""Even if we had cops on every street, some of these instances we would not be able to prevent,"" Hampton reportedly said during a press conference Tuesday. ""We need people to be human beings, treat one another with love and respect, put the guns down, and resolve these conflicts peacefully.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/atlanta-baseball-game-turns-deadly-2-dead-4-wounded,2022-03-18
Atlanta fire captain suspended without pay for rushing into burning house to save 95-year-old woman,"A Georgia fire captain has been suspended from his job because he ran inside a burning house to rescue a 95-year-old woman.

Yes, you read that correctly.

Atlanta Fire Captain Daniel Thomas Dwyer was suspended without pay this week because he broke ""protocol"" when he heroically rushed into the burning home of 95-year-old Sally Skrine last June, WXIA-TV reported.

Apparently, Dwyer was supposed to wait for his fire crew before attempting to save Skrine's life.

WXIA obtained Dwyer's disciplinary report, which states, ""You entered the structure without your crew members which is in immediate conflict with no freelancing, accountability and maintaining crew integrity.""

Paul Gerdis, the head of the fire union, told WAGA-TV that Dwyer made a ""split-second"" decision to enter the burning home because the intensity of the blaze significantly decreased the survival chances of any occupants. Gerdis said Dwyer's suspension ""sends the wrong message.""

Unfortunately, Skrine was unable to survive her injures.

Dwyer will be suspended without pay for four days and will be able to return to work on Feb. 19, WXIA reported. He is appealing the decision.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/atlanta-bottoms-blames-crime-kemp,2020-02-11
"Australian TV host brutalizes Biden for being 'determined to weaken' America, 'emboldening' enemies","Sky News Australian host James Morrow blasted President Joe Biden over the weekend, hammering Biden for being ""determined to weaken America's standing, her military, and emboldening her and our enemies.""

Speaking in a monologue on Anzac Day — Australia and New Zealand's version of Veterans Day — Morrow said Biden is ""making a mockery"" of America and its allies.

""Today is Anzac Day, when we commemorate all those who made the ultimate sacrifice fighting for our freedoms and fighting very often side by side with soldiers from the United States,"" Morrow began.

""Which is why today, it is so depressing to look at what is happening to the U.S. under Joe Biden, who seems, for whatever reason, determined to weaken America's standing, her military, and emboldening her and our enemies, making a mockery of a century's worth of shared sacrifice,"" he continued.

Morrow went on to bash Biden for his ""green eco warrior posturing"" — citing Biden being the only person on a virtual meeting with world leaders to wear a face covering — which he predicted would only embolden American enemies.

""The Biden administration's push to go green and force its friends and allies like Australia to do the same, even as China is allowed to keep emitting and growing willy-nilly, is also going to weaken America's ability to project power around the world,"" Morrow said. ""And that's bad news for all of us.""

""Now, as enemies circle, Biden is also proposing making cuts in real terms to America's national defense budget, and yet the biggest so-called improvements to the U.S. military under Biden have involved, yes, making sure that the Special Operations Command has a chief of diversity, though even that blew up like a Wile E. Coyote booby trap when it was revealed that the new inclusion czar spent his spare time comparing [Former President Donald] Trump to Hitler on Twitter,"" Morrow continued.

Biden 'weakening' US military with 'green push' as enemies circle www.youtube.com

The result of projecting weakness, according to Morrow, is that China and Russia will exploit such weaknesses.



I gotta say, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] must be quaking in their boots … or more likely laughing. Because, ever since Biden took office, both men have been seeking to cause instability and probe Biden and his weaknesses, which go a lot further than just being unable to string together a coherent sentence. China is looking increasingly muscular when it comes to Taiwan, while Russia is conducting an unprecedented military buildup on the borders of Ukraine, actions which, whether they lead to actual conflict or not, have already raised the prospect of how Biden will or will not respond.

But former President Donald Trump understood this phenomenon, which is why American allies welcomed Trump projecting strength.

""Now, Donald Trump, for all his flaws, understood that thugs like Xi and Putin spoke in the language of force and that, as bullies, they would be goaded by weakness,"" Morrow said. ""As Trump's former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted the other day, quote, 'Strength deters bad guys, weakness begets war.'""

He added, ""As we honor the sacrifices of the Anzac Day fallen, let us hope that Biden learns this lesson to avoid more such sacrifices in the future.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/atlanta-cops-bowling-ball-murder,2021-04-26
Babylon Bee CEO blasts Facebook for demonetizing page because of Monty Python-inspired joke about Democratic senator,"The Christian satire website, The Babylon Bee, is once again the target of Big Tech censors as Facebook demonetized its page for posting an article satirizing Hawaii Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono's comments during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.

Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon said Facebook demonetized the Bee's page in social media posts Tuesday, claiming that a post referring to a ""Monty Python"" joke was flagged for violating Facebook's community standards.

""So after a manual review, Facebook says they stand by their decision to pull down this article and demonetize our page. I'm not kidding. They say this article 'incites violence,'"" Dillon posted. ""It's literally a regurgitated joke from a Monty Python movie!""

The Bee satire, titled ""Senator Hirono Demands ACB Be Weighed Against A Duck To See If She Is A Witch,"" jokes about Hirono believing Barrett to be a witch based on the judge's ""perfect recall and no notes"" while undergoing questioning during her hearing.

""Oh, she's a witch alright, just look at her!"" a fictional quote from Hirono said. ""Just look at the way she's dressed and how she's so much prettier and smarter than us! She's in league with Beelzebub himself, I just know it! We must burn her!""

This fictionalized, satirical Hirono then suggests that Barrett be weighed against a duck to determine if she is in fact a witch.

""In addition to being a Senator, I am also quite wise in the ways of science,"" the fake joking quote said. ""Everyone knows witches burn because they are made of wood. I think I read that somewhere. Wood floats, and so do ducks — so logically, if Amy Coney Barrett weighs as much as this duck I found in the reflection pool outside, she is a witch and must be burned.""

The duck joke is borrowed from this scene from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"":

Monty Python Duck Clip www.youtube.com

According to Dillon, Facebook pulled down the article, claiming the joke about burning Barrett was an incitement to violence.

""In what universe does a fictional quote as part of an obvious joke constitute a genuine incitement to violence? How does context not come into play here?"" Dillon wrote. ""They're asking us to edit the article and not speak publicly about internal content reviews. (Oops, did I just post this on Facebook?)""

He continued, pointing out Facebook's hypocrisy, ""A Black Lives Matter leader said that if change doesn't happen, they'll 'burn down this system.' That's allowed on Facebook. You can quote it. You can link to it. But a Monty Python joke about burning a witch at the stake? That's incitement to violence.""

Dillon announced that the Bee will not edit the article to get its Facebook page's monetization reinstated.

The Blaze has reached out to Dillon for additional comment but not yet received a response.

The Babylon Bee has had previous conflicts with Big Tech and media companies.

Satirical pieces published on its website have been fact-checked by USA Today and Snopes.

In August, Twitter temporarily suspended the Bee's account without warning, prompting the website's supporters to begin a #FreeTheBee campaign to end the suspension. After outcry, the account was restored and a spokesman for Twitter told Fox News the account ""was mistakenly caught in a spam filter.""

The Babylon Bee bills itself as ""the world's best satire site, totally inerrant in all its truth claims. We write satire about Christian stuff, political stuff, and everyday life.""



They direct readers to take all complaints about their satire to God.

Baltimore mayor announces that mental health ‘counselors’ — instead of police — will be sent to some 911 calls,"Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) has announced a new pilot program that will direct some 911 emergency calls to mental health professionals in lieu of notifying law enforcement officials.

What are the details?

According to a report from WJZ-TV, 911 dispatchers in the city receive about 36 emergency mental health calls a day.

Those calls will now go to dedicated mental health counselors trained in conflict resolution.

""Think about the sheer number of hours that our police officers are actually out dealing with something that they're not trained to do, versus being out there going after someone who's committed an armed carjacking,"" Scott reasoned.

Last week, The Baltimore Sun reported that the program — 911 Diversion Pilot — ""aims to connect callers with the most appropriate resources and responses for their needs.""

The outlet cited a 2015 study from the Treatment Advocacy Center that found ""people with untreated mental illness were more likely to die during an altercation with police officers than those without mental illness.""

During a Friday news conference, Scott said, ""This pilot is not about defunding the police, but rather acknowledging that police department cannot tackle violent crime, our fire department cannot tackle public health and mental emergencies — and everything else.""

When will the program start?

The new program, the station reported, is set to start in June and will reportedly not cost the city any further monies as the city is said to possess existing contracts with all nonprofit organizations providing the counselors' care and participation in the new program.

Baltimore resident Denise Mack says that the violence has to stop.

Baltimore 'Safe Streets' director Dante Barksdale fatally shot in the head while visiting housing project,"Dante Barksdale, an anti-gun violence activist who worked as the director of Baltimore's Safe Streets program, is dead after being shot in the head.

According to the Baltimore Sun, Safe Streets outreach workers ""mediate disputes in the hopes of de-escalating conflicts.""

""They also lead public education campaigns and work closely with faith-based organizers and community members — and explicitly not with police — to steer young people away from violence,"" the paper reports ""The program has been hailed as one of the city's most effective crime-fighting tools.""

What are the details?

According to a Monday report from the New York Post, Barksdale was visiting a local public housing project when an as-yet unidentified gunman opened fire and struck him in the head.

Barksdale, who worked as the director for the city's Safe Streets campaign for more than a decade, was rushed to nearby Johns Hopkins Hospital early Sunday morning, where officials pronounced him dead.

The Baltimore Sun also reported that Barksdale a few weeks earlier had delivered winter coats to families at the very same housing project where he lost his life.

A police spokesperson told the Post, ""The investigation is ongoing and we have no further updates to provide at this time.""

In a statement, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said that Barksdale was the ""heart and soul"" of the Safe Streets program and that the tragic news broke his heart.

""[Barksdale's] death is a major loss to Safe Streets, the communities they serve, and the entire city of Baltimore,"" he said. ""Dante's work saved lives. This is a sobering reminder of how dangerous this frontline work is.""

He added, ""I will not let those who chose to violently take his life dampen the light of his work.""

James Timpson, a former program leader, said, ""His life was dedicated to preventing this type of stuff from happening. Nobody can believe that this happened.""

Any people with information on the shooting are encouraged to call police at (410) 396-2100.

Michael Harrison, Baltimore's police commissioner, said that Barksdale's work was instrumental to spreading a message of hope in the community.

“His work in outreach, mediating conflicts and reducing gun violence in our city was invaluable and he embodied a message of redemption and peace to the many young people of our city,"" Harrison said.

City Council President Nick J. Mosby said that Barksdale — an ""exceptional man"" — was a personal friend.

""For the last decade, Dante Barksdale used his life to save others by preventing gun violence on our streets and confronting Baltimore's horrendous cycle of violence that traumatizes families and entire communities,"" Mosby said. ""And he beat a myriad of odds to do it. ... He had an outsized impact on Safe Streets through his masterful conflict mediation skills, the passion he demonstrated in his commitment to peace and his steady presence in reducing crime on behalf of this city he absolutely loved.""

AG Bill Barr appoints John Durham as special counsel in order to protect investigation into Crossfire Hurricane from Joe Biden,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr appointed John Durham as a special counsel in order to protect the investigation into ""Crossfire Hurricane,"" the probe into the Trump campaign by the FBI during the 2016 election.

The revelation was made to the Associated Press on Tuesday amid continuing rancor over the results of the 2020 election and allegations of voter fraud.

""I decided the best thing to do would be to appoint them under the same regulation that covered Bob Mueller, to provide Durham and his team some assurance that they'd be able to complete their work regardless of the outcome of the election,"" Barr told the AP.

He went on to clarify that the investigation had begun with a broad focus but had narrowed so that it ""really is focused on the activities of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation within the FBI.""

A special counsel can be fired only by the attorney general for specific causes, including misconduct, dereliction of duty, or a conflict of interest, and that dismissal would have to be documented in writing.

Critics of the Crossfire Hurricane operation allege that officials under the former Obama administration abused their investigatory powers in order to pursue charges against Trump campaign officials out of political interest.

Barr's admission came almost simultaneously with a statement from Barr saying that the Department of Justice had not uncovered evidence of voter fraud that would have overturned the results of the election.

""To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,"" Barr said in the statement, appearing to refer to the claims of massive voter fraud by attorney Sidney Powell in several states.

""There's been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results,"" Barr said. ""And the DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven't seen anything to substantiate that.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) praised the appointment of Durham in a statement on Twitter.

""I completely concur with Attorney General Barr's decision to appoint Mr. Durham as special counsel regarding matters related to the Department of Justice and FBI's conduct in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation,"" Graham tweeted.

""To restore credibility to the Department of Justice and FBI after this disgraceful episode, people have to be held accountable – either through criminal prosecution or administrative action,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/baltimore-mayor-announces-that-mental-health-counselors-instead-of-police-will-be-sent-to-some-911-calls,2020-12-01
BBC altered alleged rape victim's quotes to avoid 'misgendering' her trans biological male attacker: Report,"The British Broadcasting Company is under fire after staff complained that the news agency altered a rape victim's quotes to avoid ""misgendering"" her biological male transgender attacker's pronouns, according to the Times London.

The paper reported that the BBC's diversity team made the ""unethical and disrespectful"" decision to change a rape victim's quotes in an October 2021 article about lesbian women who feel pressured to have sex and relationships with biological men who present as transgender women.



In the article, one lesbian victim recounted her experiences with a transgender woman who physically forced her to have sex with him after a date and allegedly threatened to ostracize her if she refused.

She discussed the horrifying experience with the BBC using ""he"" and ""him"" pronouns; however, the news agency changed those pronouns to ""they"" and ""them"" upon publication. The BBC's style guide reportedly dictates that writers use an individual's preferred pronouns in their reporting.

""[They] threatened to out me as a terf and risk my job if I refused to sleep with [them],"" the alleged victim's altered quote reads. ""I was too young to argue and had been brainwashed by queer theory so [they were] a 'woman' even if every fibre of my being was screaming throughout so I agreed to go home with [them]. [They] used physical force when I changed my mind upon seeing [their] penis and raped me.""

According to the Times, the decision was hotly contested at the time, as several senior journalists and other staff argued that altering the pronouns conflicted with BBC's responsibility to produce accurate and unbiased reporting.

""They were originally all male references but the woke bros at the news website wanted to make them female because of misgendering,"" a source reportedly told the Times, adding, ""It's quite shocking. I can't think of any other situation where we would change the words of an alleged rape victim.""

Following its publication, the article quickly became subject to a massive number of complaints. More than 20,000 people, including members of the BBC's staff, reportedly signed an open letter accusing the story of being ""deeply flawed"" and ""incredibly dangerous,"" the Daily Mail reported.

The BBC issued a statement following an ECU ruling on the article last year, stating in part: ""While the ECU ruling today rightly confirms the focus of the article was a legitimate area for journalistic scrutiny, it is also a reminder that the precision of our language and the caveats we place around third-party research are very important in our journalism, particularly when covering topics of highly polarised debate. In the light of the ECU ruling, the BBC has now made some amendments to the story to reflect where we got things wrong.""

However, in the article's latest version, the altered quote with its ""they"" and ""them"" pronouns remains.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/baltimore-safe-streets-director-fatally-shot-in-the-head-while-visiting-housing-project,2022-05-31
"Bear tears through campers' tent, terrorizes mother and daughter","A black bear was euthanized after it attacked two people while they were tent camping in Great Smoky Mountains National Park on Sunday.

What are the details?

According to a report from ABC News, a family of five was visiting the park and came face to face with a black bear after it tore into the family's tent at approximately 5:20 a.m. local time.

The bear then proceeded to attack the mother and her 3-year-old daughter, leaving them with superficial head wounds. The family's father was eventually successful in scaring the bear away from the campsite and rushed the injured to a nearby medical facility for treatment. Park rangers quickly placed the immediate area on lockdown until the bear could be located and contained.

The park service in a statement said that it was able to capture the bear and put it down due to its apparent risk to humans. The bear, authorities said, appeared to have been ""food-conditioned,"" which is said to have prompted the animal to invade the family's tent.

“The bear weighed approximately 350 pounds, which is not standard for this time of year, suggesting the bear had previous and likely consistent access to non-natural food sources,” Lisa McInnis, chief of resource management, said in the statement provided by the park. “In this incident, the bear was likely attracted to food smells throughout the area, including dog food at the involved campsite. It is very difficult to deter this learned behavior and, as in this case, the result can lead to an unacceptable risk to people.”

The outlet reported that the black bear is the second of its kind to have been euthanized in June due to being fed — and becoming accustomed to — human food. Authorities encourage campers to make all necessary precautions to properly store food while in the parks.

""According to park officials, human-bear conflicts peak in late May and June when natural foods such as berries are not yet available,"" the outelt reported. ""As a result, bears are attracted to the smell of food in the park’s developed areas, including campgrounds and picnic areas.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/barr-special-counsel-durham-obama,2022-06-15
Belarus is preparing to invade Ukraine and provide support to its Russian allies,"Belarus is preparing to deploy troops into Ukraine in support of the country’s Russian allies.

A Biden administration official said that Belarusian leadership could order the deployment of forces into Ukraine as early as Monday, the Washington Post reported.

The official said, “It’s very clear Minsk is now an extension of the Kremlin.”

The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has allowed Russian troops to conduct military drills and store supplies within his country.

On Saturday, Ukrainian and Russian leadership agreed to hold peace talks along the Ukrainian-Belarusian border. Lukashenko’s planned invasion of Ukraine will, naturally, complicate these planned talks.

The Belarusian opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, recently called for sanctions against Lukashenko and the Belarusian regime.



Newsweek reported that Tsikhanouskaya referred to them as “accomplices of Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine.”

A Ukrainian government official told CNN that the Ukrainian government had intelligence indicating that Belarus is ready “to maybe participate directly” in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The official said that the Belarusian government is allowing Russia to use Belarus to enter Ukraine, “in addition to allowing Russians to use their territory as well as letting them cross the border.”

However, as of now, according to a senior U.S. defense official, the American government has not seen Belarusian troops “being readied to move into Ukraine” or “that they are moving or are in Ukraine.”

Anticipating Belarus’ participation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration suspended all operations in the American embassy in Belarus.

The State Department also encouraged non-emergency employees and family members of American diplomats to vacate the U.S. embassy in Russia.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, “The U.S. Department of State has suspended operations at our Embassy in Minsk, Belarus and authorized the voluntary departure (‘authorized departure’) of non-emergency employees and family members at our Embassy in Moscow, Russia. We took these steps due to security and safety issues stemming from the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces in Ukraine.”

Over the weekend, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine intensified as Russian officials threatened to drop the International Space Station on the United States and its allies and Putin ordered the Russian military to put its nuclear deterrence forces on high alert.

Putin blamed rhetoric and posturing from NATO allies and thoroughgoing economic sanctions against Russia for why he put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bbc-altered-rape-victim-quotes-transgender-pronouns,2022-02-28
"Ben & Jerry's bows to anti-Israel activists, won't sell ice cream in 'Occupied Palestinian Territory'","Ben & Jerry's, the politically activist Burlington, Vermont-based ice cream company, released a statement Monday announcing that its ice cream would no longer be sold in ""Occupied Palestinian Territory"" belonging to Israel.

""We believe it is inconsistent with our values for Ben & Jerry's ice cream to be sold in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT),"" the company said, referring to the West Bank and East Jerusalem, ancestral Israeli territory that Palestinians claim is illegally occupied by the Jewish state.

The announcement was posted on the company's Twitter account and is the first social media post Ben & Jerry's issued in nearly two months. According to the Boston Globe, Ben & Jerry's social media page went silent in May after pro-Palestinian activists started a campaign to pressure the company into disavowing its ties to Israel following a the outbreak of renewed violence in the Gaza Strip.

At the time, Hamas terrorists targeted Israeli civilians with rocket attacks, and Israeli Defense Forces responded with airstrikes in Gaza. Over 11 days of violence, more than 230 Palestinians were killed, including 65 children, and at least 12 Israelis died, including two children. The disparity can attributed in part to the success of Israel's Iron Dome defense system, which protects Israeli citizens from Palestinian rockets, and also in part to Hamas hiding military targets behind civilian shields.

Outraged pro-Palestinian activists demanded that Ben & Jerry's speak out against Israeli violence, observing that the company has a long track record of being outspoken for other progressive causes including LGBT rights, voting rights, campaign finance reform, and racial issues.

A local Vermont group, Vermonters for Justice in Palestine, criticized the company for being silent on the conflict and for licensing a factory in Israel, which produces and distributes ice cream throughout the country, including in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The license agreement was ""born out of a friendship between Ben & Jerry's cofounder Ben Cohen and Israeli businessman Avi Zinger in the 1980s"", the Globe reported.

In 2013, Vermonters for Justice in Palestine (VTJP) prepared a report for Ben & Jerry's executives that documented how the company distributed ice cream in ""Occupied Palestinian Territory,"" but it went unnoticed.

""We've tried to appeal to them based on their mission of love, peace, equality. But they ignored us,"" said Wafic Faour, who led VTJP's Ben & Jerry's campaign. ""Now, public opinion is changing, especially due to the younger generations who have taken to social media and protests and come to our aid. They can no longer ignore us.""

Monday's statement from Ben & Jerry's acknowledges the partnership with an Israeli licensee and commits to making changes.



""We have a longstanding partnership with our licensee, who manufactures Ben & Jerry's ice cream in Israel and distributes it in the region. We have been working to change this, and so we have informed our licensee that we will not renew the license agreement when it expires at the end of next year,"" the company said.



""Although Ben & Jerry's will no longer be sold in the OPT, we will stay in Israel through a different arrangement. We will share an update on this as soon as we're ready,"" the statement concluded.

Reacting, the anti-anti-Semitism group StopAntisemitism.org criticized Ben & Jerry's for kowtowing to the radical Boycott, Divestment, Sanction (BDS) movement against Israel.

""Ben and Jerry's fails to realize BDS refers to ALL of Israel as occupied Palestinian territory,"" the organization tweeted. ""Do they honestly think appeasing these bigots will help anything?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bear-attack-great-smoky-mountains,2021-07-19
Ben & Jerry get stumped when asked why they sell ice cream in Georgia and Texas but not Israel,"Asked a simple question about their principles in practice, the progressive activist co-founders of Ben & Jerry's ice cream were stumped and admitted they don't know why the company won't sell ice cream in parts of Israel but will sell it in red states like Texas or Georgia.

Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield no longer own the Ben & Jerry's ice cream brand, but the company still stands up for progressive politics. When the company announced in July it would stop selling ice cream in the West Bank, in protest over Israel's claim to the territory, the two 70-year-old entrepreneurs cheered that controversial decision.

In a recent interview on ""Axios on HBO,"" reporter Alexi McCammond asked: ""If you disagree with the Israeli government policy, why not just stop sales completely?""

""Well, I disagree with the U.S. policy,"" answered Cohen. ""We couldn't stop selling in the U.S.""

""Now, I think it's fine to be involved with a country, to be a citizen of a country, and to protest some of the country's actions. And that's essentially what we're doing in terms of Israel. We hugely support Israel's right to exist, but we are against a particular policy,"" he said.

Axios on HBO: Ben & Jerry's founders on sales in the Occupied Palestinian Territory www.youtube.com

But when McCammond asked why their principles matter in Israel but not here at home, Cohen was at a loss for words.

""You guys are big proponents of voting rights. Why do you still sell ice cream in Georgia? Texas — abortion bans. Why are you still selling there?"" she asked.

""I don't know,"" Cohen said with a laugh, after a long pause. ""It's an interesting question. I don't know what that would accomplish. We're working on those issues, of voting rights. ... I think you ask a really good question. And I think I'd have to sit down and think about it for a bit.""

After McCammond pressed on Texas' abortion restrictions, Cohen said: ""By that reasoning, we should not sell any ice cream anywhere. I've got issues with what's being done in almost every state and country.""

""One thing that's different is that what Israel is doing is considered illegal by international law. And so I think that's a consideration,"" Greenfield chimed in.

Of course, the progressive left considers what Texas and other states with abortion restrictions have done to be illegal under the Supreme Court's interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, but everyone in those states can still buy ""Half Baked"" flavor ice cream at the local grocery store.

After Ben & Jerry's stopped ice cream sales in the West Bank, four U.S. states announced legal action against parent company Unilever for violating anti-Israel boycott laws.

Greenfield denied to ""Axios on HBO"" that Ben & Jerry's and Unilever are boycotting Israel ""in any way.""

Unilever, which purchased Ben & Jerry's in 2000, is reportedly a major purchaser of tomato paste from state-owned factories in the Xinjiang region of China, which the U.S. State Department has called out for ""horrific abuses"" of human rights there, including forced labor.

The question remains, why is Israel singled out by Ben & Jerry's when anti-progressive policies and totalitarian governments exist all over the world and you can still buy their ice cream in those places? The co-founders don't know.

"Benjamin Netanyahu warns of new 'pernicious' form of antisemitism, reveals behind-the-scene details of Middle East peace deals with Donald Trump, being 'disrespected' by Barack Obama in wide-ranging G","Israel Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu touched on several important topics in a new interview with Glenn Beck. Netanyahu warned there is a new ""pernicious"" form of antisemitism, gave behind-the-scene details of the Middle East accords, spoke on the dangers of Iran, and revealed how he plans to deal with the Russian invasion of Ukraine when he returns to power in Israel.

Netanyahu warns of a new kind of antisemitism

With the current controversies surrounding NBA player Kyrie Irving and rapper Kanye West making headlines, Beck told Netanyahu, ""People don't seem to know what an antisemite is."" He then asked Netanyahu to define what an antisemite is.

""Well, I think it's the opposition to Jews period as a collective body and desire to do away with Jewish people,"" Netanyahu said. ""The culmination of that is obviously Hitler, but there are men who have been smaller Hitlers in history, who don't care about individual Jews, they don't differentiate. Antisemites are just anti-Jews.""

He added, ""But I would say that antisemitism today, has taken on a pernicious new form because you know it's not fashionable to say you're an antisemite.""

Beck chimed in, ""If you know anything about Israel, the point of Israel is so they can live, so you could just live.""

Netanyahu replied, ""The real purpose of the Jewish state is, first of all, to defend the lives of Jews who are subjected to this unforgiving and undiscerning hate.""

""We paid a horrendous price of massacres and displacements and exiles and pogroms and murder and ultimately Holocaust,"" he continued. ""If Israel wasn't strong, we would have been destroyed many times over.""



Netanyahu on being 'mistreated and disrespected' by Barack Obama

Netanyahu was promoting his new memoir titled ""Bibi: My Story.""

In the book, the former Israeli prime minister revealed that he was ""mistreated and disrespected"" by Barack Obama when he was president.

Netanyahu said Obama ""took the gloves off"" during their first White House meeting in 2009.

""With staff present, he made it clear that the U.S. would not tolerate further stalling or obstructions in the peace process, leaving no doubt which party he thought was responsible for such things,"" Netanyahu wrote in his new memoir.



The Times of Israel reported, ""Netanyahu says he felt the president engaged in 'a premeditated shock-and-awe' effort to make clear that past pressures on Israeli leaders on issues pertaining to the Middle East conflict 'would pale in comparison to the ones that would be applied to me.'""

""The prime minister of Israel was being treated as a minor thug in the neighborhood,"" the book read.



Obama allegedly instructed Netanyahu in private, ""I expect you to immediately freeze all construction in the areas beyond the 1967 borders. Not one brick!""

Obama then purportedly boasted, ""You know, people often underestimate me. But I come from Chicago, where I had to deal with tough opponents.""

Without providing much detail, Netanyahu said, ""He then said something out of character that shocked me deeply,"" only cryptically describing the message as ""unmistakable,"" ""offensive,"" and ""highly disturbing.""

The memoir stated, ""The prime minister of Israel was being treated as a minor thug in the neighborhood. It was this sense that the elected leader of a proud four-thousand-year-old nation was being mistreated and disrespected that got me back on my feet. 'Mr. President,' I said slowly, 'I'm sure that you mean what you said. But I am the prime minister of Israel, and I’ll do whatever I need to do to defend my country.'""

Beck asked Netanyahu to elaborate on how Obama ""mistreated and disrespected"" him, but he said he'll save that antidote for a second book.

Recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel

Then-President Donald Trump allegedly asked to speak to Netanyahu about the potential threats of violence if the United States recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Netanyahu told Trump, ""I said, 'Look, I don't see it and my intel guys tell me the same thing, but I'll tell you if there is a danger, it'll be directed first against us, and we're willing to you know, take the brunt of any attack, but frankly I just don't see it.'""

""Anyway he decided luckily or gratefully that he would declare Jerusalem as Israel's capital and of course nothing of the kind that was described happened,"" he said.

Netanyahu said the move was a ""great moment,"" and Trump ""punctured this myth and frankly finally punctured this lie"" that Jerusalem couldn't be recognized as the capital of Israel.

How Netanyahu and Trump helped bring peace to the Middle East

Netanyahu said that he approached Trump with four peace treaties ""ready for the taking.""

""I suggested that he come with an aircraft carrier to the Red Sea in the Middle East, invite me and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, and others,"" he said.

Netanyahu said Trump was ""not convinced initially,"" but Trump came around after a few years.

Netanyahu said the American contribution to the peace deals was ""essential,"" ""stellar, and important to finish seal the deal.""

The incoming Israeli prime minister said, ""More will be coming.""

Netanyahu on the global dangers of the war in Ukraine

Netanyahu told Beck about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, ""Well I think everybody sees that something could unravel and if it unravels it could go to a place that could jeopardize the peace of the world in an unprecedented way, really especially the slippery slope of tactical nuclear weapons and so on so.""

Israel's relationship with Russia

Netanyahu said Russia's alliance with Turkey and Iran is ""not good,"" but said Israel's relationship with Russia has ""actually changed"" and ""in many ways for the better.""

""We have a complex relationship, a nuanced relationship with Russia, yet what I said before – this question of the possible unraveling of Ukraine into a global catastrophe – is something that should occupy every leader and anybody who can contribute to preventing this or somehow ending this tragedy should do so,"" he declared.

How to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear threat

Regarding Iran obtaining nuclear weapons, Netanyahu stressed, ""The only way you could stop Iran from becoming nuclear is through crippling economic sanctions coupled with a credible military threat. If you don't have that no deal that you sign we sign – which they'll violate promptly – will make any difference we talk about.""

How America and Israel are similar

Netanyahu remarked, ""I think that the case of America and Israel, we were both founded on an ideal. Our idea was to return to the promised land, and your idea was to create a new promised land of liberty.""

Former NFL star Benjamin Watson steamrolls 'pro-choice pastor' Sen. Raphael Warnock: 'A pastor knows the value of human life',"Former NFL star Benjamin Watson hit out at Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), the Georgia lawmaker who prides himself on being a ""pro-choice pastor.""

What are the details?

Watson, an outspoken Christian and proponent of the pro-life movement, issued a snappy response after Warnock tweeted about women's rights.

Warnock, pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, tweeted, ""As a pro-choice pastor, I've always believed that a patient's room is way too small for a woman, her doctor, and the United States government.""

Warnock made the remarks on the 49th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision.

Clearly taken aback by the lawmaker's tweet, Watson fired back, ""Is a patient's room too small for a child as well? 76% of women in those rooms say they would prefer to parent if circumstances were different.""

""A Pastor knows the value of human life,"" he thundered. ""A Senator knows how to support mother AND child. Sir, you know better. Stop being scared.""

Watson later added that Christians need to beware of people who emphasize their ""position in the church before stating what THEY have always believed NOT what God's word says.""

“They’ve sacrificed moral credibility to accrue power and used their religious position as cover for an agenda. It doesn’t have to be this way,” he pointed out.

What else?

In December 2020, a coalition of at least 25 black pastors rallied against Warnock, slamming him for supporting abortion.

In an open letter, the pastors said that they felt ""compelled to confront"" the reverend for what they said were his ""grave errors of judgment"" and a ""lapse in pastoral responsibility.""

A month earlier, Warnock tweeted that he would ""always fight for reproductive justice,"" and shortly after that, Warnock said he believed the ""right"" to abortion is a product of ""human agency and freedom.""

A portion of the letter read:

As a Christian pastor and as a black leader, you have a duty to denounce the evil of abortion, which kills a disproportionate number of black children. Your open advocacy of abortion is a scandal to the faith and to the black community.



Abortion is fundamentally in conflict with the plain reading of the Bible. The Bible clearly teaches that human life is created by God beginning at conception.



As Psalm 139 proclaims: ""You knitted me together in my mother's womb. I praise you, for I am wonderfully and fearfully made."" What human being could possibly have the right to blot out an innocent life that God has wonderfully and fearfully made? Abortion prematurely thwarts God's providential and loving plan for a promising human life.



And by terminating an innocent unborn life in the womb, abortion directly violates the seventh commandment: ""Thou shalt not kill.""

Bernie Sanders' campaign accused of unfair labor practices in complaint,"The presidential campaign of Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders has been hit with a National Labor Relations Board complaint alleging unfair labor practices, according to Bloomberg Law.

The complaint comes while the campaign is already dealing with some conflict and bad publicity over unionized campaign workers demanding $15 per hour minimum wage, something Sanders advocates for publicly but was not paying his campaign staff.

What's the news?

The complaint was filed anonymously on July 19 to the NLRB. The full charges have not been publicized yet, but they reportedly include illegal interrogation of employee(s), retaliation against staff, unlawful discharge of an employee, modifying a labor contract, and engaging in illegal discipline.

As a result of the complaint, the NLRB will begin a preliminary investigation to see whether the accusations have any validity. If they do, the investigation will move forward, and if they don't, the charges will be dismissed.

So far, neither the union representing Sanders' campaign staff, nor the Sanders campaign has commented on this situation.

The Sanders campaign became the first to unionize in March, with campaign staff voting to join the United Food and Commercial Workers.

Why does it matter?

Sanders, who sits in a somewhat tenuous position among the Democratic primary frontrunners, did not need this kind of controversy.

He's sold himself as a champion of a higher minimum wage, and then it came out that he wasn't paying his staff that same higher minimum wage. Then, his solution was to cap their hours so that their pay would average $15 an hour.

He has run as a champion of workers' rights, and now he's being accused of some very serious labor violations. Even if the NLRB finds the accusations to be without merit, this is probably going to hover over his campaign at least long enough for other Democratic presidential hopefuls to take some shots at him in the media and/or during the next set of debates.

With Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on his heels for second place behind Joe Biden, Sanders will need to come ready to play some defense next week.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/benjamin-netanyahu-antisemitism-trump-obama-glenn-beck,2019-07-24
Bernie Sanders predicts the Democratic Party could be 'wiped out' in the 2022 midterm elections,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent lawmaker who caucuses with Democrats, warned the Democratic Party this week what will happen if Democrats do not improve American lives now that they control the White House, House, and have effective control over the Senate.

What did Sanders say?

Sanders predicted the Democratic Party will be ""wiped out"" in the 2022 midterm elections if they squander their opportunity to improve American lives.

""Given all that we face, now is not the time to think small. It is time to think big, very big,"" Sanders said on Thursday, according to McClatchy reporter Francesca Chambers.

""With Joe Biden as president and Democrats controlling the House and Senate for the first time since 2010, we will be judged on what we deliver for the American people in their time of need. The people want action, not excuses,"" Sanders explained.

""And let me be very clear. I have zero doubt that unless we significantly improve the lives of the American people this year, Democrats will get wiped out in the 2022 midterm elections,"" Sanders predicted. ""That is what happened when Democrats had the House, the Senate and the presidency under Bill Clinton in 1994 and that is what happened under Barack Obama in 2010.""

""Politicians and media focus a great deal on drama, personality and conflict,"" Sanders added. ""That's how they define politics. That is not my view. Politics is nothing more complicated than delivering policy that positively impacts the lives of working families.

Of course, Sanders' vision of what policies are beneficial significantly diverge from the majority of Americans. Sanders is a self-declared ""democratic-socialist,"" who advocates for European-style socialism.

Indeed, Sanders said this week that he would use his power in the Senate to implement as much of his big government agenda as possible while Democrats control Congress.

Sanders wrote in an essay for CNN:

The Senate's 60-vote threshold to pass major legislation has become an excuse for inaction. But let's be clear: We have the tools to overcome these procedural hurdles. As incoming Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I will use a process known as budget reconciliation that will allow us to pass comprehensive legislation with only 51 votes.

What's the history of Dem control?

Democrats have a poor history of leveraging control in Washington.

In fact, the last two times that Democrats had control of the White House and Congress — after Bill Clinton's election in 1992 and Barack Obama's election in 2008 — Democrats gave up control in the next national election

The 1994 midterm elections were particularly bad for Democrats; they lost control of the Senate, House, a net loss of 10 governorships, and numerous state legislatures. The 2010 midterm elections were equally as bad — coming amid the Tea Party movement — though Democrats managed to retain control of the Senate until the 2014 midterm elections.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/benjamin-watson-steamrolls-raphael-warnock-abortion,2021-01-23
"Despite attacks, Bernie Sanders surges to big lead in key early state, New Hampshire poll shows","Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has jumped out to a sizable lead in a key early primary state, despite heightened attacks from his competitors and former nominee Hillary Clinton, according to a WBUR-FM poll.

The new poll shows Sanders leading all primary candidates in New Hampshire by double figures, and a 14-point increase by Sanders from December to January suggests his campaign may still be gaining momentum.

WBUR's poll has Sanders at 29 percent, followed by former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 17 percent, former Vice President Joe Biden at 14 percent, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) at 13 percent.

The only two other candidates who qualified for the January debate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Tom Steyer, are at 5 percent and 2 percent, respectively.

Last month, Sanders was third in this same poll at 15 percent, trailing Buttigieg (18 percent) and Biden (17 percent).

Sanders has become a target this month. Before the January debate, anonymous sources leaked a story to CNN that Sanders told Warren in 2018 that a woman could not win the 2020 presidential election. Sanders has denied saying that, while Warren maintains that he did.



Warren confronted Sanders after the debate and accused Sanders of calling her a liar on national television. Sanders accused her of the same. It's unknown who is telling the truth, but the conflict has broken down a long-standing truce between the two candidates who have been friends, and who are ideologically similar.

This week Clinton torched Sanders harshly critical comments attacking his likability and the allegedly toxic culture perpetuated by Sanders, his staff, and his supporters.

""He was in Congress for years,"" Clinton says of Sanders in a Hulu documentary to be released in March. ""He had one senator support him. Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician. It's all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.""

Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke calls Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu 'racist',"Beto O'Rourke, a Democratic candidate for president, condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling the Israeli leader ""racist.""

What are the details?

O'Rourke, a former Texas Democratic U.S. representative, made the remarks Sunday during a campaign stop at the University of Iowa. He made the remarks in response to a voter who asked about the ongoing conflict in the Israeli region.

The former lawmaker explained that Netanyahu is but an obstacle to U.S.-Israeli relations in addition to being racist.

""That relationship — if it is to be successful — must transcend partisanship in the United States, and it must be able to transcend a prime minister who is racist, as he warns about Arabs coming to the polls, who wants to defy and prospect for peace as he threatens to annex the West Bank, and who has sided with a far-right, racist party in order to maintain his hold on power,"" O'Rourke said.

He also went on to point out that he did not believe Netanyahu even ""represents the true will of the Israeli people"" or their interests in the U.S-Israel relationship.

His solution? A two-state component to broker peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis.

""We must be able to transcend [Netanyahu's] current leadership to make sure that that alliance is strong, that we continue to push for and settle for nothing less than a two-state solution, because that is the best opportunity for peace for the people of Israel and the people of Palestine,"" he insisted. ""It is the best opportunity for the full human rights of everyone who is living in that region.""

What else?

Netanyahu is hoping to win a fifth term as prime minister in Tuesday's general election.

Beto O'Rourke says he would knock down border wall in El Paso if he could,"Former congressman Beto O'Rourke said Thursday that if he had the power, he would take down the border wall separating his home city of El Paso, Texas, from Ciudad Juarez, one of the most dangerous cities in Mexico.

O'Rourke was asked the question by MSNBC's Chris Hayes, days after Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw posed the question to O'Rourke on Twitter.

""@BetoORourke should answer a simple question tonight with respect to the border debate: If you could snap your fingers and make El Paso's border wall disappear, would you?"" Crenshaw wrote. ""Because this DHS graph shows that when the wall was built, illegal crossings dropped significantly.""

Hayes relayed the question to O'Rourke, who previously represented El Paso in the U.S. House of Representatives.

""If you could, would you take the wall down now? Knock it down?"" Hayes asked.

""Yes, absolutely. I would take the wall down,"" O'Rourke replied, without hesitation.

It's not clear how the residents of El Paso would feel about that decision, but it's probably safe to say many of them would be uncomfortable with the idea of an open border between their city and Juarez. O'Rourke said he believes a referendum to tear down the wall would pass in El Paso.



While many Democrats have framed the border wall debate in terms of abstract conceptions of morality, for the people of El Paso, a wall is a matter of public safety.

More than 1,000 people were murdered in Juarez in 2018, up from 636 in 2017 and 470 in 2016.

The increase in violence in Juarez is attributed to gang conflicts over drug sales and smuggling operations—also two good reasons to have a wall in the city.

As Crenshaw noted in his tweet, illegal border crossings in El Paso decreased significantly once the border wall was constructed.

Things are so bad in Juarez right now that last month the U.S. Consulate in Juarez alerted U.S. personnel to avoid police stations in the city because of a continuing series of coordinated attacks against law enforcement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bernie-sanders-surges-to-big-lead-in-key-early-state-poll-shows,2019-02-15
Biden hit with avalanche of mockery after Stacey Abrams blames scheduling snafu for her absence from his voting rights speech in Georgia,"President Joe Biden (D) was mocked and ridiculed on social media after Stacey Abrams missed his pivotal speech in Georgia on voting rights and blamed a scheduling mistake for her absence.

Biden announced in his speech Tuesday, that he was fully backing the campaign to end filibuster rules in the Senate in order to overcome Republican opposition to partisan voting rights legislation. Despite the speech being touted as a very important moment for the administration, Abrams was unable to attend the speech, prompting many to wonder if it was a snub of the president.

When Biden was asked by a reporter Tuesday if he was insulted by her absence at his speech, he rejected the insinuation that Abrams had purposely snubbed him.

""I'm insulted you asked the question!"" Biden joked.

""I spoke to Stacey this morning,"" he added, ""we've got a great relationship, we got our scheduling mixed up, I talked with her at length this morning. We're all on the same page and everything's fine.""

Some mainstream media reporters were skeptical at the excuse Abrams gave for skipping the speech.

“As for the Stacey Abrams absence, it does not seem plausible that they simply mixed up their schedules on this event, it's too important,” said John Harwood of CNN.

""Politicians show up with presidents when they have 52% approval ratings, politicians don't show up with presidents when their approval ratings may be in the 30s in a state,"" said Joe Scarborough on MSNBC.

""It is extraordinary that the president and VP are going to Georgia to talk about voting rights and the most prominent Democrat and prominent voting rights groups in the state have decided not to attend,"" said Willie Geist on MSNBC.

Critics of the Biden administration also pounced on the story to mock Biden.

""The 'conflict' is that Stacey Abrams wants to be governor, but Georgia voters think that Joe Biden's record is a disaster,"" tweeted Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas.

""That Stacey Abrams can’t even be bothered to attend Biden’s speech about the allegedly extinction-level threat to our democracy emanating from GOP election bills tells you all you need to know about where this latest WH push is headed—absolutely nowhere,"" replied Rich Lowry of National Review.

""A sign of how unpopular Joe Biden is. Even radicals like Stacey Abrams don't want to associate with Biden — embarrassing,"" responded Kelly Loeffler.

"Biden addresses Afghanistan catastrophe: 'The buck stops with me,' but it's also Trump's fault","President Joe Biden on Monday said he ""squarely"" stands behind his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan after the Taliban wrested control of the country from the U.S.-backed government Sunday.

In a speech delivered from the East Room of the White House, Biden said his national security team has been ""closely monitoring"" the situation on the ground in Afghanistan. He acknowledged that what the world witnessed in the past few days was the ""rapid collapse"" of the Afghani government and military to Islamist Taliban militants and blamed Afghanistan leaders for being incapable of or unwilling to fight a civil war on their own.



""Our mission in Afghanistan was never supposed to have been nation-building. It was never supposed to be creating a unified, centralized democracy. Our only vital national interest in Afghanistan remains today what it has always been: preventing a terrorist attack on American homeland,"" Biden said.

""As president, I am adamant we focus on the threats we face today in 2021, not yesterday's threats,"" he added.

The president defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, but offered few words about the disastrous way the U.S. withdrawal has unfolded.

""I stand squarely behind my decision,"" said Biden. ""After 20 years, I've learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces.""

The president's speech on the situation in Afghanistan was initially unplanned. Biden was spending time away from public view at Camp David when the Taliban took control of Afghanistan on Sunday. He was expected to remain at the presidential retreat but cut his time there short to return to the White House and deliver remarks on the horrific events taking place in Kabul as the U.S. continues evacuation efforts.



The only public image of Biden released during this time was a photo the White House published Sunday showing the president at an empty conference room table holding a video meeting with his national security team.

Biden changed his schedule amid mounting pressure from Democrats and Republicans to address the unfolding catastrophe in Afghanistan. The president was hammered by both sides for being silent as the U.S. failed to fully evacuate thousands of Afghani interpreters and others who had assisted U.S. personnel for decades during the war against the Taliban.

""Why is Joe Biden hiding?"" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) asked Sunday. ""He should immediately address the nation and answer for the catastrophic situation in Afghanistan. Conference calls between cabinet secretaries and senators don't cut it in a crisis.""

""There's no way to hide it. The situation in Afghanistan is another shame on this admin,"" Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas) said. ""Withdrawal was never going to be easy but it didn't need to come to this. The US must do everything in its power to help our partners & allies to safety & protect our national security.""

White House officials have publicly admitted that the administration was caught off-guard by the speed with which the Taliban seized control of Kabul after U.S. forces began withdrawing on Biden's orders. A U.S. intelligence report leaked to Reuters last week estimated that the Taliban could capture Kabul within 90 days. But by Sunday, Taliban soldiers seized the presidential palace and overthrew the Western-backed government. Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani was forced to flee the country.

The Afghanistan military, which received decades of training from U.S. forces, collapsed ""more quickly than we anticipated,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN Sunday.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan echoed Blinken's comments on Monday, telling NBC's ""Today,"" ""It's certainly the case that the speed with which cities fell was much greater than anyone anticipated, including the Afghans, including many of the analysts"" watching the situation.

In response, the Biden administration ordered a total of 6,000 U.S. troops to return to Afghanistan to secure evacuation and withdrawal efforts from incursions by Taliban militants. Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of U.S. Central Command, met face to face with Taliban leaders Sunday in Doha, Qatar, to inform them that interference with U.S. evacuation efforts at the airport in Kabul would be met with force.

Desperate Afghani citizens have swarmed the Hamid Karzai International Airport seeking to board U.S. military flights and flee the country. Horrific videos posted to social media show the airport in utter chaos, with people clinging to departing U.S. aircraft and falling to their deaths after the planes took off.

The chaos forced U.S. troops to temporarily suspend evacuation efforts and fire warning shots to dissuade the crowd from surging at departing flights. Witnesses told Reuters that at least five people were killed at the airport as hundreds tried to force themselves onto U.S. aircraft. A U.S. official said said the military fired shots into the air in an attempt to scatter the crowd. It's unclear whether the victims died by gunfire or by stampede.

Several former Obama administration officials have come forward to publicly criticize Biden's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker said Sunday the Biden's administration had ""a total lack of coordinated, post-withdrawal planning"" and called the deteriorating situation a ""self-inflicted wound.""

David Petraeus, who served as CIA director under President Obama, said in an interview that the Taliban's conquest of Afghanistan was ""disastrous"" and ""catastrophic"" for the world.

""This is an enormous national security setback and it is on the verge of getting much worse unless we decide to take really significant action,"" he warned.

Biden on Monday insisted that his national security team was ""clear-eyed about the risks"" of leaving Afghanistan, which included the possibility that the Taliban would overrun the Western-backed government, but he argued that continued U.S. military presence in the country wouldn't have made a difference since the government in Afghanistan couldn't stand on its own.



""Afghanistan's political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight,"" Biden said.

""If anything, the developments of the past week reinforced that ending U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan now was the right decision. American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves,"" he added.



""We gave them every tool they could need. We paid their salaries,"" Biden continued. ""We gave them every chance to determine their own future. We could not provide them the will to fight for that future.""

The president also laid blame on his predecessor, President Donald Trump, for negotiating a deal with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan in the first place. He said the choice he faced was to follow through with withdrawal or escalate the conflict in Afghanistan by sending thousands of U.S. troops into the nation's third decade of war.

""American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves,"" Biden declared.



Addressing his critics, he asked, ""How many more generations of America's daughters and sons would you have me send to fight Afghanistan's civil war when Afghan troops will not?""

Concluding, Biden accepted ""my share of responsibility"" for what is happening in Afghanistan.

""I am president of the United States of America, and the buck stops with me,"" he said.

""I'm deeply saddened by the facts we now face, but I do not regret my decision to end America's war fighting in Afghanistan,"" the president added. ""I cannot and will not ask our troops to fight on endlessly in another country's civil war.""

After delivering his speech, Biden exited the East Room without taking questions from reporters. The White House announced that he will return to Camp David.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/beto-orourke-says-he-would-knock-down-border-wall-in-el-paso-if-he-could,2021-08-16
Biden admin unveils Title IX rules intended to get transgender athletes back in girls' sports,"The U.S. Department of Education on Thursday released its long-awaited overhaul of Title IX rules, undoing one of the major achievements of the Trump administration under former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments Act prohibits sex discrimination at educational institutions that receive federal funding. Under the Biden administration's proposed rule change, the definition of ""sex"" would be expanded to include sexual identity and gender orientation, which proponents say would prevent discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in schools.



The Biden administration would also roll back several Trump-era due process protections for students accused of sexual harassment. When DeVos was education secretary, she released a rule that permitted those accused of sexual misconduct greater opportunity to defend themselves during Title IX proceedings.

The rules, which were controversial at the time, required that alleged ""sexual harassment"" had to be ""so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school’s education program or activities"" in order to trigger Title IX proceedings.

Due process advocates praised the Trump administration for ensuring that colleges and universities give those accused of sexual harassment a fair opportunity to defend themselves during live hearings and cross-examination. But critics said the rules made it harder for victims of sexual assault to seek justice against the person who violated them.

""Over the last 50 years, Title IX has paved the way for millions of girls and women to access equal opportunity in our nation's schools and has been instrumental in combating sexual assault and sexual violence in educational settings,"" Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said Thursday.

""As we celebrate the 50th Anniversary of this landmark law, our proposed changes will allow us to continue that progress and ensure all our nation's students – no matter where they live, who they are, or whom they love – can learn, grow, and thrive in school. We welcome public comment on these critical regulations so we can further the Biden-Harris Administration's mission of creating educational environments free from sex discrimination and sexual violence,"" he added.

A potential consequence of the Biden administration's new Title IX rules is that schools that do not allow gender dysphoric male athletes to compete on women's sports teams could lose federal funding.

The Biden administration is setting up a conflict with 18 states that have enacted laws prohibiting men who identify as women from playing in girls and women's sports leagues.

DeVos called the new rules ""a bridge too far"" in an interview with Fox News Thursday.

""That they would attempt to expand the definition of biological sex through a rulemaking process, it really is a bridge too far,"" she said. ""And I hope that, and I trust that many people will raise their voices if what is rumored to be true actually unfolds.""

""They're also getting a ton of pushback from people who are concerned about protecting women's sports in particular, and protecting the very important due process protections that we ensured were a part of the whole Title IX requirements for how institutions must handle these issues,"" she added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-abrams-filibuster-voting-snub,2022-06-23
Biden administration approves massive weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and UAE,"The State Department on Tuesday approved two arms deals to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — deals that could be worth over $5 billion combined.

According to the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the weapons are meant to “defend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s borders against persistent Houthi cross-border unmanned aerial system and ballistic missile attacks.” Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have faced recent attacks from the Houthi rebel movement in Yemen.

The sales include $3 billion for Patriot missiles for Saudi Arabia, designed to protect the country from rocket attacks by the Houthis, and $2.2 billion for high-altitude missile defense for the UAE, the AP reports.

In its notice informing Congress of the sale, the State Department maintained that “the proposed sale will improve the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s capability to meet current and future threats by replenishing its dwindling stock of PATRIOT GEM-T missiles.”

Regarding the UAE, the State Department claimed the sale would “support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of an important regional partner.”

The sales come on the heels of President Joe Biden’s visit to the Middle East last month, during which he met with multiple leaders in Saudi Arabia. Biden had previously vowed to “end U.S. support for offensive operations in Yemen.” While this approval is for defensive weapons, critics and opposing lawmakers are likely to question the United States’ continued role in the Yemeni War.

The situation in Yemen remains tenuous, with the warring sides recently agreeing to renew a two-month truce. The U.N. estimated that by the end of 2021, the conflict in Yemen would have caused over 377,000 deaths, with 60% of them the result of hunger, lack of health care, and unsafe water. The U.N. Development Program estimates that more than 370,000 people have died due to the war.

Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the Biden administration was discussing the possibility of lifting of its ban on sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia. The country has long been a major recipient of American-made weapons. According to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Saudi Arabia accounted for 23% of all U.S. weapon sales between 2017 and 2021.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-addresses-afghanistan-catastrophe,2022-08-03
Biden administration offers temporary protected status to Venezuelans living illegally in US,"The Biden administration has offered temporary protected status to Venezuelan nationals illegally residing the U.S., a decision that could make more than 300,000 aliens safe from deportation until September 2022.

What are the details?

Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas announced Monday that Venezuelans who can show residence in the U.S. as of Monday, March 8, may apply for temporary protected status and employment authorization documents for 18 months. The agency added that ""for their own health and safety, individuals should not believe smugglers or others claiming the border is now open. Due to the pandemic, travel and admission restrictions at the border remain in place.""

The news release explained:

This designation is due to extraordinary and temporary conditions in Venezuela that prevent nationals from returning safely, including a complex humanitarian crisis marked by widespread hunger and malnutrition, a growing influence and presence of non-state armed groups, repression, and a crumbling infrastructure. TPS can be extended to a country with conditions that fall into one, or more, of the three statutory bases for designation: ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters, or extraordinary and temporary conditions.

""""The living conditions in Venezuela reveal a country in turmoil, unable to protect its own citizens,"" Mayorkas said in a statement. ""It is in times of extraordinary and temporary circumstances like these that the United States steps forward to support eligible Venezuelan nationals already present here, while their home country seeks to right itself out of the current crises.""

A senior official told reporters ahead of the statement that the decree impacts roughly 320,000 people, CBS News reported, noting that fees associated with the application process cost $545.

What's the background?

The outlet reported:

Republican and Democratic administrations have sought to isolate the increasingly authoritarian government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has managed to hold on to power despite a political challenge mounted by Juan Guaidó, who the U.S. and other Western countries have recognized as the country's legitimate interim president.

In 2019, President Donald Trump hit Maduro with a complete economic embargo, and so far, the Biden administration ""is in no rush to lift sanctions,"" according to the White House.

The Daily Caller pointed out that Trump ""never handed down a TPS designation for Venezuela, but deferred all deportations for Venezuelans living in the country for 18 months during his final days in office.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-admin-unveils-title-ix-rules-that-get-transgender-athletes-back-in-girls-sports,2021-03-08
"Biden administration set to ship 3,000 troops to Eastern Europe to protect NATO allies from Russia","The United States is preparing to deploy around 3,000 troops to Eastern Europe as Russia continues growing its military presence along the border of Ukraine.

NBC News reported that in the coming days, roughly 1,000 American soldiers who are currently stationed in Germany will be repositioned to Romania to support American forces already in the country.

John Kirby, the Pentagon’s press secretary, said that the reinforcements are part of a Stryker infantry unit that is “designed to deploy in short order and move quickly.”

Kirby stated, “This force is designed to deter aggression and enhance our defense capabilities and frontline allied states, and we expect them, as I said, to move in coming days.”

He also said that the United States will be moving an additional force of about 2,000 troops from the United States to Europe “in the next few days.” Most of these troops will be stationed in Poland.

Kirby continued, “Collectively, this force is trained and equipped for a variety of missions — to deter aggression and to reassure and to defend our allies.”

It is believed that these troop movements are “not permanent” and that the United States will reassess the situation as it continues to evolve.

Last week, President Biden committed to stationing American troops in NATO countries, saying, “I’ll be moving troops to Eastern Europe in the NATO countries in the near term.”

Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, “We are ready, capable, and prepared to uphold our obligation under treaty to NATO. An attack against one NATO ally is an attack against all.”

Differentiating these reinforcements from the 8,500 troops placed on “heightened alert” for potential military conflict with Russia by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Kirby noted that these forces “are not going to fight in Ukraine. They are going to maintain robust defense of our NATO allies.”

A senior official within the Biden administration said, “At the president’s direction and following Secretary [Lloyd] Austin’s recommendation, the Department of Defense will reposition certain Europe-based units further east, forward deploy additional U.S.-based units to Europe, and maintain the heightened state of readiness of response forces to meet these commitments.”

The 8,500 troops placed on “heightened alert” have not yet been given deployment orders.

Two weeks ago, when this decision was announced, Kirby said, “I want to reinforce that as of now, the decision has been made to put these units on high alert and higher alert only.”

Currently, Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops along the borders of Ukraine, and its leadership believes that its Western adversaries are not taking its demands seriously.

Biden administration to use federal funds to finance foreign mining operations after killing American mines,"To satisfy climate alarmists' desire that American streets be crowded only with so-called zero-emission vehicles, rare earth minerals must be extracted. The Biden administration, caving to pressure from activist groups, would prefer those minerals to be largely sourced abroad, where regulations are lax and potential environmental consequences are out of the American public's view.

Axios reported that the Biden administration is not just seeking to acquire lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, and other resources required in the manufacture of EVs from outside the U.S. but is seeking to help finance foreign mining projects with federal funds.



What are the details?

Jose Fernandez, undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment, told Axios that the Biden administration is considering funneling federal funds into ""around a dozen"" mining projects outside of the U.S., potentially through the Mineral Security Partnership.

The MSP was established in June to ""ensure that critical minerals are produced, processed, and recycled in a manner that supports the ability of countries to realize the full economic development benefit of their geological endowments.""

The end use of these ""critical minerals"" are so-called clean technologies like EVs and solar panels.

Among the MSP's member states are Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Korea, the U.K., and the U.S.

MSP partners are poised to provide projects around the world with debt financing, guaranteed loans, and other forms of financial support in hopes of increasing and securing stable supply of critical minerals while also limiting reliance on Chinese resources.

According to Axios, federal funds will be made available through the Export-Import Bank and the Development Finance Corporation, which is already backing a Brazilian nickel mining project.

Fernandez suggested that ""we're going to need an exponential amount of rare earths and critical minerals, above what we have today.""

To that end, the Biden administration will raise ""the level of investment ... in a way that benefits these countries and would be sustainable.""

To whom is it a benefit?

Since President Joe Biden took office, he has been under immense pressure from environmentalist groups to kill domestic mining projects.

Biden's Department of the Interior killed two mineral leases for Antofagasta Plc's Twin Metals copper and nickel mine in Minnesota back in January.

Biden also caved to a demand by Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and others to block a federal land exchange for the Rio Tinto/BHP Group Resolution joint venture, which planned to produce an estimated 40 billion pounds of copper over a 40-year stretch.

Concerning the administration's capture by climate activists, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) said, ""These 'not-in-my-backyard' extremists have made clear they want to lock up our land and prevent the mining of minerals.""

Having locked up American resources, the Biden administration has sought to furnish environmentalists' dream of a greener America with foreign minerals, reported Reuters.

While some of these minerals will be sourced from Canada — a USMCA nation that shares with America an integrated electricity grid, the world's only binational military command, and similar regulatory standards — the Biden administration and the MSP apparently won't hesitate to aid projects in compromised nations farther abroad.



For instance, at the ministerial meeting of the MSP in September, Secretary of State Antony Blinken cited a graphite mine in Balama, Mozambique, as an MSP success story. Blinken suggested that local conflict in the human rights-challenged nation was averted by employing hundreds of local workers in the mine and raising millions of dollars in community development.

Deantha Skibinski, executive director of the Alaska Miners Association, told Alaska Business that it need not be an either/or decision but that American projects should nevertheless be prioritized.

""Production of minerals from allied nations isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as the projections on demand are so staggering it really may be an ‘anywhere we can get supply’ situation,"" said Skibinski, ""but we should look to produce minerals in America first, where we know that mining is conducted with the highest environmental, labor, and safety standards in the world, and the economic and community benefits can be realized by our citizens.""

Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) similarly noted that ""we need to be forming alliances with our friends around the world,” but funding foreign projects at Americans' expense and disadvantage was “horrific.”

Axios indicated that Republicans like Westerman are not particularly keen on funneling taxpayer funds via multinational groups to foreign powers with dubious labor, environmental, and regulatory records.

Instead, upon assuming control of Congress in the new year, House Republicans intend to help boost American production of lithium, copper and other EV materials.

Westerman said, ""We need to step up our mining activities if we're going to have an electrified economy.""

Reuters reported that GOP leaders have also promised to cut the mining permit review timeline in half.

In addition to supporting American mineral extraction and refinement, Republicans are also setting about addressing the Biden administration's war on domestic mineral extraction.



A GOP aide to the House Foreign Affairs Committee told Axios, ""As soon as we get into the majority, we will be getting pretty deep into it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-offers-temporary-protected-status-to-venezuelans-living-in-us-illegally,2022-12-12
"Biden statement on Afghanistan evacuation, Taliban marches on Kabul","President Joe Biden, who is on a scheduled vacation at Camp David, issued a statement Saturday afternoon regarding the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan. Biden announced he would deploy 5,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan to evacuate personnel as the Taliban marches towards Kabul.

""Over our country's 20 years at war in Afghanistan, America has sent its finest young men and women, invested nearly $1 trillion dollars, trained over 300,000 Afghan soldiers and police, equipped them with state-of-the-art military equipment, and maintained their air force as part of the longest war in US history,"" Biden said in the update on the tumultuous withdrawal.

He then defended his withdrawal from Afghanistan that was initiated by former President Donald Trump, ""One more year, or five more years, of US military presence would not have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country. And an endless American presence in the middle of another country's civil conflict was not acceptable to me.""

""When I came to office, I inherited a deal cut by my predecessor—which he invited the Taliban to discuss at Camp David on the eve of 9/11 of 2019—that left the Taliban in the strongest position militarily since 2001 and imposed a May 1, 2021 deadline on US forces,"" Biden claimed, placing blame on Trump.

""Shortly before he left office, he also drew US forces down to a bare minimum of 2,500,"" Biden continued.

""Therefore, when I became President, I faced a choice—follow through on the deal, with a brief extension to get our forces and our allies' forces out safely, or ramp up our presence and send more American troops to fight once again in another country's civil conflict,"" Biden stated. ""I was the fourth President to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan—two Republicans, two Democrats. I would not, and will not, pass this war onto a fifth.""



Biden, who is scheduled to be at Camp David until Wednesday, had planned on withdrawing from Afghanistan on Aug. 31, but the speed at which the Taliban has captured provinces and major cities has muddied the waters.

The Taliban has conquered Herat, Kandahar, and Mazar-e-Sharif, the country's second, third, and fourth-largest cities. The Taliban control about 24 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, according to the Associated Press.

The Taliban captured all of Logar province on Saturday, which is about 50 miles south of Kabul. Local reports say the radical Islamist group has reached the Char Asyab district, only 7 miles south of the Afghan capital.

Despite the withdrawal and the Taliban rampaging across the Middle Eastern country, Biden warned the fundamentalist Islamic group ""that any action on their part on the ground in Afghanistan, that puts US personnel or our mission at risk there, will be met with a swift and strong US military response.""

A U.S. defense official informed Reuters that the 5,000 troops designated to assist in the evacuation include 3,000 troops already approved, 1,000 that are already in Kabul, and 1,000 newly approved troops from the 82nd Airborne.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-set-to-ship-3000-troops-to-eastern-europe-to-protect-nato-allies-from-russia,2021-08-14
Ocasio-Cortez lashes out at Joe Biden for declaring that Israel has a right to protect itself from rocket attacks,"President Joe Biden issued a statement declaring that Israel had a right to defend itself from rocket attacks and many on the left immediately recoiled in horror, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

Israel has been bombarded by dozens of rocket missile attacks for several days while violence from supporters of the Palestinian cause has erupted against Jews in several Israeli cities.

On Wednesday, Biden defended Israel after speaking via telephone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

""Israel has the right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory,"" Biden said to reporters.

""My hope is that we'll see this coming to a conclusion sooner than later,"" he added.

That support for Israel was reflected in the White House official readout of the call with Netanyahu, which said that Biden reiterated his ""unwavering support for Israel's security and for Israel's legitimate right to defend itself and its people, while protecting civilians.""

Ocasio-Cortez immediately excoriated Biden for the statement.



""Blanket statements like these w/ little context or acknowledgement of what precipitated this cycle of violence - namely, the expulsions of Palestinians and attacks on Al Aqsa - dehumanize Palestinians & imply the US will look the other way at human rights violations. It's wrong,"" said Ocasio-Cortez in a tweet.

""By only stepping in to name Hamas' actions - which are condemnable - & refusing to acknowledge the rights of Palestinians, Biden reinforces the false idea that Palestinians instigated this cycle of violence,"" she added.

""This is not neutral language,"" she concluded. ""It takes a side - the side of occupation.""

Others on the left condemned Biden for voicing support for Israel.

""What a shameful, terrible statement,"" said columnist Wajahat Ali. ""Biden could have condemned Hamas, attacks on civilians, and affirmed Israel's right to exist, and also condemned Israel for forced evictions, escalating tensions at Al Aqsa, Gaza strikes, the killing of Palestinian children, and, you know, continuing illegal settlements.""

Ocasio-Cortez used similar language to berate New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang into acquiescing to her demands after he issued a tweet of support for Israel.

At last count, at least 65 people in the Gaza Strip had died from the latest conflict, while about 6 had died in Israel, according to Reuters.

Biden approval sinks to record low in NPR poll taken before Russia invaded Ukraine,"A majority of Americans believe President Joe Biden's first year in office was a ""failure,"" according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.

Support for the president has dropped to the lowest level recorded by the survey, with Biden holding just a 39% overall approval rating with U.S. adults. His overall approval rating is slightly better with registered voters, though still at a dismal 40%. The president's overall disapproval rating is at 55% with both groups.

A 56% majority of both U.S. adults and registered voters rate the president's first year in office as a failure, the survey found. Only 39% said it was a success.

These crushing poll numbers come as Americans are expressing widespread dissatisfaction with how Biden is performing on the economy, the pandemic, and with foreign policy. Most survey respondents, 54%, said Biden is not fulfilling his campaign promises, and 52% said he has done more to divide the country than unite it, even though uniting the country was a central theme of Biden's 2020 campaign for the White House.

On the issues, Biden receives just 36% approval for his handling of the economy and 47% for his handling of the pandemic. A plurality of 37% of registered voters say inflation should be the top priority for Biden right now, as consumer prices have increased at the largest rate in 40 years over the past year.

Other important issues rank far behind inflation, with the pandemic being the top concern for 12% of registered voters, voting laws for another 12%, and foreign policy and violent crime each for 10%.

Foreign policy is a rising concern for Americans with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Importantly, this poll was conducted between Feb. 15 and Feb. 21, before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. When this poll was taken, 50% of U.S. adults said they disapproved of how Biden was handling the situation, while only 34% approved.



A pitiful 30% of respondents said they think the U.S. is headed in the right direction.

""These are sort of rock-bottom numbers,"" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, in a statement. ""It's about as low as you're going to see him.""

NPR identified three key groups that Biden is struggling with that explain his disastrous poll numbers: Independents, suburban voters, and the Democratic base.

Only 29% of self-identified independents approve of Biden's job performance. An astonishing 64% of independents disapprove of Biden, more than double the percentage that approve. It's a far-cry from the support Biden held in 2020, when he won the presidency with majority support from independents.

As for suburban voters, just 38% approve of the president, a decrease of 11 percentage points from December. Biden has seen a double-digit decrease in support from suburban women over the past two months alone, down to 45% from 57%.

The president is also suffering from a lack of intense support from Democrats. Only 14% of U.S. adults strongly approve of Biden's performance, a worse rating than President Donald Trump had at any time during his presidency, according to NPR.

Credit Biden's souring approval with his supporters to the 50-50 U.S. Senate. Major initiatives like the Build Back Better social spending package and a federal overhaul of U.S. elections have been stymied by lack of support in the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to overcome a filibuster.

The only major pieces of legislation advanced under Biden's tenure have been a coronavirus relief package, called the American Rescue Plan, and a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill. Those achievements are decidedly not enough to make up for Biden's failure to ""shut down"" the coronavirus pandemic, the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, and ongoing supply chain issues and rising prices.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-afghanistan-troops-taliban-kabul,2022-02-25
"Biden climate official sanctioned by science body; accused of putting 'thumb on the scales for friends and family,' using outdated data in paper","On August 16, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) announced it would bar White House climate official Jane Lubchenco from participating in its publications and activities for five years.

This announcement comes months after House Reps. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), Stephanie Bice (R-Okla.) and Jay Obernolte (R-Calif.) wrote to President Joe Biden suggesting that Lubchenco's actions ""may violate the Administration's principles of scientific integrity,"" making ""her current leadership role very troubling.""

According to Axios, the NAS reiterated that Lubchenco violated its code of conduct.

Having edited a paper entitled, ""A global network of marine protected areas for food,"" written by her brother-in-law Steven Gaines (with whom she had collaborated several times previously), she violated the science body's conflict-of-interest policy.



Retraction Watch reported that in April, University of Hull marine scientist Magnus Johnson wrote to the editor of the NAS' official journal, noting Lubchenco's family relationship with Gaines: ""It seems a little dubious to have a paper edited by an author who is closely aligned with authors on it? I know it can be tricky to find true independence in the upper layers of international science but surely Dr Lubchenko [sic] should have at least declared an interest?""

This was not Lubchenco's only policy violation, however.

The article she edited with and for her brother-in-law claimed that a global network of marine protected areas (MPAs) could improve future fisheries' stocks — an initiative suggested to be ""driven more by geopolitics than conservation"" in the Yale School of the Environment's E360.

The authors alleged that by ""strategically expanding the existing global MPA network to protect an addition 5% of the ocean could increase future catch by at least 20%."" However, supporting this claim were antiquated data and ""biologically impossible assumptions.""

According to the NAS journal's editor in chief, May Berenbaum, this error ""cast doubt over the outcome of the peer review process, ultimately leading to the retraction of this paper,"" which occurred on October 6, 2021.

House Republicans claimed in their February 10 letter to Biden that Lubchenco ""violated the very principals of peer review and conflicts of interest she has identified as crucial to Federal scientific integrity.""

She had, after all, led the development and publication of the 2022 report ""Protecting the Integrity of Government Science.""

Axios reported the founder of the American Accountability Foundation's Thomas Jones said in a statement: ""The American people deserve leaders in the White House who don’t use their positions of influence to put their thumb on the scales for friends and family.""

Earlier this year, Jones wrote to Eric Lander, Biden's top science adviser who resigned as director in February after an internal report found he had demeaned staff. In the letter, Jones suggested that ""Dr. Lubchenco's continued service in the White House would rightly give the American people the impression that the rules only [sic] apply to the powerful, and the rules of scientific integrity need not be followed if you are prominent and powerful.""

Lubchenco, appointed last year by Joe Biden, currently serves as deputy director for climate and environment in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. She also is co-chair of the White House's Scientific Integrity Task Force. She previously served in the Obama administration as director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Editor's Note: This article has been amended to correct a misspelled name in paragraph nine. The original article listed the name as Mary Berenbaum. The name has since been corrected to May Berenbaum.

Biden says corruption claims against Hunter Biden are 'totally discredited.' But that's not true.,"Joe Biden claimed during Tuesday's presidential debate that scrutiny surrounding his son's financial dealings with Russian interests has been ""totally discredited.""



But that's not exactly true.

What did Biden say?

About halfway through the chaotic debate, President Donald Trump homed in on Hunter Biden and scrutiny surrounding his work in Ukraine and Russia during the Obama administration, for which he was paid handsomely. Biden's critics have suggested the financial payments are evidence of corruption and a conflict of interest while Biden was vice president.

Trump asked, ""While we're at it, just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow's wife gave your son $3.5 millions of dollars. What did he do to deserve it?""

""None of that is true; it's been totally discredited,"" Biden responded.

When Trump attempted to rebut, debate moderator Chris Wallace, an anchor at Fox News, continually interrupted Trump and gave Biden the floor.

What are the facts?



Last week, Senate Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee and the Finance Committee released a joint report leveling new, serious allegations against Hunter Biden.

The report detailed more than a dozen ""key findings"" that connect Hunter Biden's time on the board of Burisma in Ukraine to possible corruption, aiding Moscow's disinformation efforts, and even hindering U.S. foreign policy.

One of those ""key findings"" was that ""Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.""

As TheBlaze reported:

Baturina is a Russian businesswoman and the country's only frail billionaire. Her riches came when her husband, the late Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, orchestrated a number of municipal contracts with her company. Luzhkov was fired in 2010 by then-President Medvedev over corruption allegations, the report says.



Baturina wired $3.5 million to Hunter Biden's investment firm for a ""consulting agreement,"" the committee states.

The investment firm in question, Rosemont Seneca Thornton, was ""co-founded by Hunter Biden that was incorporated on May 28, 2013 in Wilmington, Del.,"" the Senate report explained. The firm is apparently an offshoot of another firm, Rosemont Seneca, which was co-founded by Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz, stepson of John Kerry, who at the time of the transaction of Baturina was serving as secretary of state.

The Senate report cited ""confidential document 6"" as proof of the financial transaction.

Hunter Biden's lawyer, George Mesires, told PolitiFact that the Senate report is not true. ""Hunter Biden had no interest in and was not a co-founder of Rosemont Seneca Thornton, so the claim that he was paid $3.5 million is false,"" he said.

However, PolitiFact noted that Mesires refused to show documents to corroborate his claim that Biden was not associated with Rosemont Seneca Thorton.

Senate Republicans provided no definitive proof to substantiate their claims, though many of the supporting documents are cited in the report as ""confidential.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-approval-sinks-to-record-low-in-npr-poll-taken-before-russia-invaded-ukraine,2020-09-30
Biden FCC nominee previously described Fox News as 'state-sponsored propaganda',"Gigi Sohn, who has been nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as a commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), previously referred to Fox News as ""state-sponsored propaganda"" and said that the outlet has had a detrimental impact on American democracy.

""For all my concerns about #Facebook, I believe that Fox News has had the most negative impact on our democracy. It's state-sponsored propaganda, with few if any opposing viewpoints. Where's the hearing about that?"" she tweeted in October 2020.

When GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri asked Sohn whether she is biased against Fox News, Sohn emphasized that past comments she made about the outlet came in the context of hearings as well as media reports.

Sohn said that her ""opinions as a public interest advocate will have no bearing on how I behave as a policymaker,"" in the event that she is confirmed as commissioner of the FCC.

Blunt Questions FCC Nominee Gigi Sohn About Fox News Tweets, Locast Lawsuit www.youtube.com

She told Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas that her tweets about Fox News were issued in the context of a hearing in which blame for misinformation was rightfully being attributed to Big Tech.

Sohn told Cruz that she has ""also been critical of liberal stations as well.""



She said that she spent years working with ""conservative cable channels"" in order ""to get them carriage on cable systems when those systems would not carry them.""

America News Network President Charles Herring has issued a statement in support of Sohn.

""I'm fully aware of Gigi's personal views, yet I'm even more knowledgable on her strong belief and advocacy for diversity in the programming lineup, especially in news, regardless of conflicts with her personal views,"" Herring said in the statement.

Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy has also backed the nomination: ""While I don't always agree with the nominees on many policy matters, Newsmax fully supports the Commission's mandate to promote diversity, localism and competition in the marketplace,"" Ruddy said in a statement, according to Axios. ""Newsmax believes both nominees are committed to that mandate.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-climate-official-sanctioned-by-science-body,2021-12-02
Biden kills an hour with TikTok 'influencers' brought to DC to receive Democrat marching orders,"Eight people were flown to Washington, D.C., this week to meet with President Joe Biden. Their stated purpose was neither to bolster border security nor to address inflation but rather to utilize the Chinese-controlled social media app TikTok to help Democrats hold on to and secure more power.



Crystallizing public opinion

The Washington Post reported that a handful of so-called influencers, including Nia Sioux, Mona Swain, Vitus Spehar, Kat Wellington, and Mattie Westbrouck, were flown for free to D.C., where they met with Biden, former president Barack Obama, and leaders of both the Democratic National Committee and House Democrats' campaign committee.



Streaming their experiences, the influencers toured the Supreme Court and received a private tour of the Capitol.

The penultimate stop on their whirlwind visit was a news conference where the 79-year-old president claimed the COVID-19 mRNA booster ""is going to be required"" before sitting down to receive one himself.

Finally, in a detour planned directly by the White House, the influencers received an hour more of Biden's time than Americans along the southern border have received in person since he took office.

In the Oval Office, Biden reportedly explained why he got into politics and why the healthy young streamers should get COVID-19 mRNA boosters. He then walked them around the West Wing.

22-year-old Westbrouck, who has over 10.2 million followers on TikTok, said, ""It felt like a little room tour but by the president.""

Though Spehar, the host of the TikTok news channel ""Under the Desk News,"" said Biden ""didn't mention the election or voting,"" the influencers had already received their marching orders by the time they had reached the Oval Office.

High-level Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee staffers instructed the influencers on how they could best serve the interests of the party in the midterm election. The Post indicated that DCCC staffers highlighted key districts in battleground states where the influencers' help was required and could be used to great effect.

Obama, like Biden and other Democrats, impressed upon these prospective agents of the state how important it was that the Democrats win in the midterms.

""I genuinely think it's a scary time for people who can get pregnant and won't be able to have rights to an abortion,"" said 21-year-old Nia Sioux, who has 8.3 million followers. ""I will be talking about my stance on that, and I will have more information in [my] social media content.""

Kat Wellington, 24, similarly found the Democrat immersion trip activating. She said, ""This trip helped me make the push to use my platform for that. I don't want to be afraid to share my genuine beliefs about politics, even if it's going to upset some people.""

Rob Flaherty, the White House director of digital strategy, told the Post, ""We know people listen to trusted messengers, and as an increasing number of young people turn to Instagram, TikTok and other platforms for news and information, we need to engage with the voices they trust directly.""

Shelby Cole, deputy mobilization officer at the DNC, underscored the need for Democrats to exploit the reach of content creators to engage ""young voters to remind them of the stakes in this election and how to make a plan to vote.""

Vaccines and votes

In recent years, the Biden administration has invested a great deal of time and energy into leveraging TikTok to achieve its political ends.

Earlier this month, Judicial Watch obtained evidence of an extensive media campaign executed by the Biden administration aimed at driving up acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. While records revealed the administration had colluded with establishment media, major corporations, and various institutions to advance its vaccine narrative, its messaging strategy also relied heavily upon social media influencers.

For instance, the Biden administration noted its intention to request ""major TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram influencers to create videos of themselves being vaccinated and start a special campaign of funny and/or musical videos about being vaccinated to encourage others to create content and post.""

The documents acquired through Judicial Watch's freedom of information lawsuit also revealed the administration's belief that in order to capture the minds of young people, it would have to ""target endemic content creators, with a particular focus on Youtube, and TikTok.""

17-year-old Ellie Zeiler was one of those paid by the Biden administration to push vaccines as part of the so-called ""influencer army."" Although just a high school student, Zeiler was useful to the administration because she had over 10 million followers.

Owing to influencers' perceived utility, they are often given preferential treatment.

TheBlaze noted last week that it's difficult to schedule an interview with Biden. He has only agreed to 28 interviews since taking office. Transsexual fetishist Dylan Mulvaney managed, however, to secure an exclusive interview with the president, which aired on Sunday. Mulvaney is a TikTok user with 8.3 million followers.

Mulvaney was assigned priority, like the influencers invited to the White House this week, in part because the interview was able to deliver more eyeballs than the traditional media networks that Democrats have long depended upon, such as CNN, which frequently has trouble seizing even the interest of 600,000 viewers.

The Biden administration has used influencers to supplement its establishment media support since the beginning. The Washington Post reported that in 2020, TikTok for Biden assembled a collective of over 500 Tiktok users to endorse Biden.

In the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, top White House and National Security Council staffers met with influencers. Forbes reported that in March, persons whose only qualifications were comfort using a phone and access to a big audience were briefed on the war and prompted to disseminate the White House's narrative to their followers.

Compromised apparatchiks

While Democrats are relying more and more on TikTok influencers for strategic and governmental functions, they do so despite warnings that the platform is compromised in more than one way.

TikTok has censored conservative speech and artwork, such as rapper Bryson Gray's ""Let's Go, Brandon"" song, as well as content flagged as unacceptable by foreign dictators. Earlier this year, the platform banned the founder of the pro-life group Live Action and barred the group from posting ads.

Fox News Digital reported that a whistleblower indicated the Chinese government, which controls TikTok, has been using the app to ""suppress minorities, censor freedom of speech and mask human rights violations.""

In addition to being used to selectively silence certain groups and amplify the voices of others — such as those anointed on trips to the White House — TikTok is a security threat.

A report released last week accused TikTok's parent company ByteDance of planning to use the location data it collected on the app to track and monitor American citizens. The company is also being accused of seeking to gather users' personal and private information without their consent.

This week, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) said, ""Donald Trump was right on TikTok years ago ... If your country uses Huawei, if your kids are on TikTok ... the ability for China to have undue influence is a much greater challenge and a much more immediate threat than any kind of actual armed conflict.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-corruption-claims-hunter-discredited,2022-10-27
"Biden laughs when asked about federal investigation against his son, calls Rudy Giuliani a 'thug'","The months-long impeachment crusade against President Donald Trump may be over, but the underlying questions about the Bidens and their actions in Ukraine still remain. However, Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden doesn't seem too worried about the prospect of a federal investigation into the matter.

During an interview on ""CBS This Morning"" Monday, cohost Anthony Jacobs informed the the elder Biden that the Justice Department is taking in information about Hunter Biden's work for a natural gas company in the Ukraine — which occurred while his dad was vice president — from Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.

""[Sen.] Lindsey Graham [R-S.C.] told CBS News the Justice Department is vetting information from Rudy Giuliani about about your son's work in Ukraine,"" Jacobs asked. ""Are you concerned a federal investigation may be launched?""

Biden began chuckling at the first mention of Giuliani's name and continued laughing as Jacobs repeated his question a second time, before his demeanor transformed into a more serious one as he gave the answer, ""No.""

""Look, I expect, I expect Trump to do the same exact thing he's been doing,"" the former vice president elaborated.

""Why has he been attacking me from the beginning, why did he risk — and he should have been impeached — why did he risk getting convicted by going to a foreign leader to say, 'You don't have to get me anything on Biden, there's nothing to get, just tell me you're going to investigate him so I can hurt him,'?"" Biden added, echoing a Democratic impeachment allegation about the president's motives in dealing with Ukrainian officials last year. ""Have you ever seen a sitting president as concerned about a single nominee, in trying to stop a nominee?""

When asked a follow-up on whether or not Hunter is ""fair game,"" Biden responded, ""I don't think our sons are fair game at all. No one has said he's done anything wrong except the thug, Rudy Giuliani. Come on, Rudy Giuliani?""

Graham told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that he had spoken with Attorney General William Barr and that Barr told him the Justice Department had set up a ""process"" for Giuliani to turn over information he'd gathered in Ukraine so that it could be vetted for accuracy.

Graham explained, ""We're to make sure that Hunter Biden's conflict of interest is explored because it's legitimate. How could Joe Biden really fight corruption when his son sitting on the Burisma board?"" He also said that vetting information coming out of Ukraine was critical because of the possibility of Russian misinformation.

On Monday morning, Barr said that there is a process to take in and look over information on Ukraine from Giuliani as well as others, but that the department would proceed very cautiously in doing so.

""As I did say to Sen. Graham, we have to be very careful with respect to any information coming from Ukraine,"" Barr cautioned at a DOJ press conference. ""There are a lot of agendas in the Ukraine, there are a lot of cross-currents, and we can't take anything we receive from the Ukraine at face value.""

Barr explained that the department has set up an ""intake process in the field so that any information coming in about Ukraine could be carefully scrutinized by the department and its intelligence community partners"" and the same ""is true for all information that comes to the Department related to the Ukraine, including anything that Mr. Giuliani might provide.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-fcc-nominee-previously-described-fox-news-as-state-sponsored-propaganda,2020-02-10
"Biden claims military advisers never told him to keep troops in Afghanistan, but multiple reports say otherwise","President Joe Biden now insists his top military commanders never advised him to keep a contingent of troops in Afghanistan, despite multiple reports claiming the contrary.

The word clash comes as the militant Taliban regime wrests control over Afghanistan with alarming speed, leaving Afghan residents fearful for their lives and scores of American citizens trapped in the nation's capital awaiting evacuation.

What are the details?

During an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Wednesday, Biden repeatedly denied claims that he ignored advice from top military brass to maintain some level of military presence in the country.

Here's the transcript of the relevant portion of the interview:

STEPHANOPOULOS: But your top military advisers warned against withdrawing on this timeline. They wanted you to keep about 2,500 troops.



BIDEN: No, they didn't. It was split. Tha — that wasn't true. That wasn't true.



STEPHANOPOULOS: They didn't tell you that they wanted troops to stay?



BIDEN: No. Not at — not in terms of whether we were going to get out in a timeframe all troops. They didn't argue against that.



STEPHANOPOULOS: So no one told — your military advisers did not tell you, ""No, we should just keep 2,500 troops. It's been a stable situation for the last several years. We can do that. We can continue to do that""?



BIDEN: No. No one said that to me that I can recall.

In the aftermath of the Taliban takeover, Biden has defended his decision to go through with a foreshadowed total withdrawal by noting that ""chaos"" was inevitable.

What's the background?



But Biden's claims fly in the face of multiple reports claiming otherwise, as the resulting fiasco in Afghanistan has left many demanding answers on how the Biden administration was so ill-prepared.

The Wall Street Journal first reported in April — before reiterating this week — that Biden ""overruled"" top military brass in ordering the total withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, an event that directly preceded the Taliban's rapid takeover of the Middle Eastern country.

Here's how the Journal put it:

In contrast to the numerous Trump policies he reversed, he opted to carry out Mr. Trump's deal with the Taliban instead of trying to renegotiate it. In so doing, he overruled his top military commanders: Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East; Gen. Austin Scott Miller, who led NATO forces in Afghanistan; and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Citing the risks of removing American forces to Afghan security and the U.S. Embassy, they recommended that the U.S. keep 2,500 troops in Afghanistan while stepping up diplomacy to try to cement a peace agreement.

Politico added at the time that Vice President Kamala Harris played a ""key role"" in the withdrawal decision.

What else?



The conflicting accounts are the latest controversy for the Biden administration amid a rapidly deteriorating situation in Afghanistan that has garnered criticism and outrage from both sides of the aisle.

Republican scrutiny of Biden's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal was to be expected. But the crisis has also generated a surprising level of backlash from members of the president's own party.

Democrats turned on the Biden administration this week, vowing to launch investigations into the withdrawal and calling the situation a ""disaster"" and a ""catastrophe.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-kills-an-hour-with-tiktok-influencers-brought-to-dc-to-receive-democrat-marching-orders,2021-08-19
'What this poll says is that President Biden and Democrats are headed for a catastrophic election': Biden earns abysmal 40% job approval in NBC News poll,"A recent NBC News poll of adults indicates that President Joe Biden's job approval rating is deeply underwater, with 55% who disapprove of his job performance compared to just 40% who approve of it. While 42% strongly disapprove of the job Biden is doing, 16% strongly approve, 13% somewhat disapprove, and 24% somewhat approve.

A whopping 63% disapprove of how the Biden is dealing with the economy, while only 33% approve.

And while 52% disapprove of how Biden is handling the Russia-Ukraine war, only 41% approve. The poll also found a dearth of confidence in the president on this issue: While 44% expressed having ""Very little confidence"" in the president's ability to react to the conflict and manage the crisis, 27% had ""Just some confidence,"" 16% had ""Quite a bit of confidence,"" and 12% had ""A great deal of confidence.""

Earlier this month, Biden issued an executive order to prohibit the importation of crude oil and other products into the U.S. from Russia. The poll found that 79% agree with the move by the U.S. to block Russian oil, even if it produces higher fuel prices.

The poll, which was carried out March 18 to 22, does not bode well for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterm elections as the party aims to maintain control in Congress.

Among registered voters, 46% would prefer for the election to result in a GOP-controlled Congress, while 44% would prefer for the election to result in a Democrat-controlled legislature, a close split which falls within the margin of error.



""What this poll says is that President Biden and Democrats are headed for a catastrophic election,"" Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinions Strategy said, according to NBC News — the outlet noted that McInturff carried out the survey along with Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates.

Biden skips Notre Dame commencement after abortion backlash,"President Joe Biden is skipping the University of Notre Dame's 2021 commencement on Sunday. Biden, the second Roman Catholic president, was invited but said he couldn't attend due to a scheduling conflict, according to the Catholic News Agency . Had Biden attended the ceremony, he would have received an honorary degree from the school. Instead, finance executive and trustee of the university Jimmy Dunne will address the graduates.

The president forgoing the ceremony at the prestigious institution breaks a 20-year tradition of either the president or the vice president attending the Notre Dame commencement in their first year in office. President George W. Bush gave the commencement address in 2001, President Barack Obama delivered the address in 2009, and Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the ceremony in 2017, according to Fox News. Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump did not address Notre Dame's commencement. It was not clear if Notre Dame invited Vice President Kamala Harris.

Despite being invited, Biden would not have been welcomed by everyone at Notre Dame. There were over 4,300 ""members of the Notre Dame community"" who signed a petition to urge Notre Dame president Rev. John Jenkins not to invite Biden to the commencement because of the president's pro-abortion policies.

The petition said the students and alumni of Notre Dame are ""dismayed by the pro-abortion and anti-religious liberty agenda of President Joe Biden.""

The petition reads, ""Catholic institutions should not honor those who act in defiance of our fundamental moral principles.""

""He rejects Church teachings on abortion, marriage, sex and gender and is hostile to religious liberty,"" the petition says of the president. ""He embraces the most pro-abortion and anti-religious liberty public policy program in history.""

The petition lists Biden's actions that ""threaten grievous harm to the Church, Notre Dame, Catholics and other persons of faith, and the unborn,"" including funding of Planned Parenthood and the ""Equality Act.""

In January, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops denounced Biden over his stance on abortion, marriage, and gender.

""I must point out that our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender,"" José Horacio Gomez said of Biden. ""Of deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-military-advisers-afghanistan-withdrawal,2021-05-23
Biden now admits his administration is negotiating payments to illegal immigrant families that were separated at the border,"After several days of confusion and conflicting messages, President Joe Biden now admits that his administration is, in fact, negotiating payments to the families of illegal immigrants who were separated at the border under previous administrations.

News broke last week that the Biden administration was contemplating a settlement that would pay around $450,000 per person to immigrant families that were split up at the border as a result of the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance policy"" on illegal immigration. Although families were also separated at the border under the Bush and Obama administrations, it is not clear whether the contemplated settlements would encompass those families as well.

The settlements, which were initially reported by the Wall Street Journal, could have ended up totaling close to $1 million per family, and may have varied according to the circumstances of each family, meaning they could have been smaller in some cases. Administration officials who spoke to the Wall Street Journal noted that the figures were still being negotiated and could have changed before being finalized.

The payments were widely criticized in light of the current economic climate in the United States, which has seen many families struggling with historic levels of inflation and high gas prices. Many critics also pointed out that news of the settlements would likely encourage more illegal immigration in the midst of the ongoing border crisis, which has seen a historic surge in illegal immigration during the first year of Biden's presidency.

Biden was asked about the program by Fox News' Peter Doocy on Wednesday, and angrily denied that any such settlements were being negotiated. Doocy asked, ""As you were leaving for your overseas trip, there were reports that were surfacing that your administration's planning to pay illegal immigrants who were separated from their families at the border up to $450,000 each, possibly $1 million per family. Do you think that that might incentivize more people to come over illegally?""

Biden responded angrily, ""If you guys keep sending that garbage out, yeah. But it's not true.""





Biden's angry denial was immediately condemned by the ACLU, which was involved in negotiating some of the settlements with the immigrant families. Furthermore, multiple media outlets immediately confirmed the Wall Street Journal's reporting.

In a Thursday statement, Deputy White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tried to walk back Biden's claims, saying that the administration was ""perfectly comfortable"" with settlements, but was merely disputing the price tag. Jean-Pierre then said Department of Justice officials had relayed to families of the illegal immigrants in question that $450,000 per person was too high, thus also confirming the WSJ's reports as to the price tag that was being discussed at the time.

On Saturday, Biden was asked to provide clarification, and finally personally acknowledged that his administration is, in fact, negotiating these payments. Further, Biden insisted that these families deserve ""some kind of compensation,"" apparently for having gone through what some portion of illegal immigrant families have gone through and accepted as a risk for the last twenty years when they illegally cross the border.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-nbc-news-poll-job-approval,2021-11-06
Top Biden official admits he 'can't make any guarantees' Afghan troop withdrawal won't empower terrorists,"National security adviser Jake Sullivan admitted Sunday the Biden administration cannot guarantee that withdrawing United States troops from Afghanistan will not create another power vacuum that emboldens terrorist groups like the Islamic State.

Biden announced last week that he would formally withdraw all U.S. personnel from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, 2021, the 20th anniversary of the infamous terror attacks on U.S. soil.

Currently, there are about 2,500 U.S. troops stationed in Afghanistan, along with 1,000 special forces personnel.

What is the background?

After U.S. forces successfully defeated al Qaeda in Iraq, then-President Barack Obama ordered the full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011.

The move is now seen as a strategic failure, likely creating a power vacuum that allowed ISIS to exponentially grow in the destabilized region.

Army officer Ryan N. Mannina explains:

[T]he [Obama] administration mishandled the withdrawal of US forces in 2011, leaving the Sunnis vulnerable and the Iraqi security forces (ISF) unprepared to take responsibility for the country's security. Almost simultaneously, a civil war broke out in Syria. The remnants of AQI—under a new name, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS or the Islamic State)—exploited the conflict to renew their jihad and rebuild their combat power. Iraq's Sunni minority—alienated and abandoned—began fighting back against oppression by the Maliki government. In 2014, the Sunnis welcomed ISIS back into Anbar province and helped them seize nearly a third of Iraq's territory, establishing the physical caliphate ISIS had always dreamed of building.

What did Sullivan say?

Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sullivan admitted that he ""can't make any guarantees"" that Biden's troop withdrawal will not result in another power vacuum that will be exploited by terrorists.

""I can't make any guarantees about what will happen inside the country. No one can,"" Sullivan said.

""All the United States could do is provide the Afghan security forces, the Afghan government, and the Afghan people resources and capabilities, training and equipping their forces, providing assistance to their government,"" he continued. ""We have done that, and now, it is time for American troops to come home and the Afghan people to step up to defend their own country.""

Though Sullivan did not provide details, he explained the U.S. has the capabilities to ""suppress the terror threat"" in Afghanistan without having U.S. personnel stationed there, but reiterated that Biden has ""no intention"" of sending troops back to Afghanistan.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-notre-dame-commencement-abortion,2021-04-19
Biden's incoming press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called Fox News 'racist',"President Joe Biden's new press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, called Fox News a ""racist"" network in early 2020, adding to a growing list of controversial statements she's made that are now being scrutinized as she prepares to take over for Jen Psaki.

On March 15, 2020, Jean-Pierre was a guest on MSNBC's ""AM Joy,"" hosted by Joy Reid. She was part of a panel featuring Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin and former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele that discussed Fox News' coverage of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.



In a clip Jean-Pierre shared on Twitter, she accused Fox News of being ""racist.""

“Fox News was racist before #coronavirus, they are racist during coronavirus, and Fox News will be racist after the coronavirus,” she wrote.

According to a transcript of the program pulled by Mediaite, Reid brought up how Tucker Carlson referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese coronavirus,"" asserting that Fox hosts were following President Donald Trump's lead in labeling it a ""foreign"" virus to stir up ""xenophobia.""

Jean-Pierre went on to say that ""xenophobia and racism"" have always been a part of virus outbreaks and that ""the stigma sometimes is more dangerous than the actual virus.""

She then accused Fox News of spreading ""misinformation"" and stoking racism.



""Fox News was racist before coronavirus, they are racist during the coronavirus, Fox News will be racist after the coronavirus. So there is nothing new here. I think the difference is they are all in on being state TV for Donald Trump, and so they will continue to give the misinformation,"" Jean-Pierre said in the clip.

""The danger is, so yes, you have Asian-Americans right now whose lives are seriously in danger. And, you have their own viewers who can now, the ones who are 60 and older who are watching, this is a health crisis that we’re in, this is a global pandemic, as the WHO have said, and they’re putting their lives in danger,"" she said.

The comments raise questions about how Jean-Pierre will maintain a working relationship with Fox News reporters once she takes over for White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who will step down Friday.

She also faces questions over other controversial statements she's made, including a false assertion that the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia was ""stolen"" by Republican Brian Kemp.

Jean-Pierre also faces ethical questions concerning her long-term romantic relationship with CNN national correspondent Suzanne Malveaux. The two live together in Washington D.C. and are raising an adopted 7-year-old dautghter.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-now-admits-his-administration-is-negotiating-payments-to-illegal-immigrant-families-that-were-separated-at-the-border,2022-05-10
Biden shields Ukrainians in US from deportation with temporary protection during war,"The Biden administration will temporarily shield tens of thousands of Ukrainians in the United States from deportation and grant them work permits for as long as they are unable to return to Ukraine because of the ongoing war with Russia, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday.

According to the agency, any Ukrainian resident in the U.S. who has been here since March 1 or earlier is eligible for Temporary Protected Status for a period of 18 months. Ukrainians who arrived in the country after March 1 are ineligible for this designation, DHS said in a release.

The federal government's action comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine by land, air, and sea in what has become one of the largest wars in Europe since World War II. President Joe Biden strongly condemned Russia in his State of the Union address earlier this week, calling the attack ""premeditated and unprovoked.""

The president detailed economic sanctions the U.S. and European allies have placed on Russia in his address, and promised additional aid to the Ukrainian people during this conflict. He also announced that Russian flights would be cut off from American air space to ""squeeze"" the Russian economy as punishment for Putin's war.

Biden's administration has determined that the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine and ""extraordinary and temporary conditions"" will prevent Ukrainian nationals in the U.S. from returning home safely. The TPS designation for Ukrainians in America will grant them access to work permits and enable them to remain in the U.S. after their visas expire, for as long as the status lasts.

""Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,"" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a written statement.

Earlier Thursday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced that it had paused deportation flights to Ukraine due to the ""ongoing humanitarian crisis,"" Reuters reported.



Since the war began, more than 1 million Ukrainians have fled their country seeking refuge in European nations to the west. Half a million of these refugees are children, according to UNICEF, which said this could be the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, CNN reported.



U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said Thursday, ""I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one.""

""International solidarity has been heartwarming. But nothing -- nothing -- can replace the need for the guns to be silenced; for dialogue and diplomacy to succeed. Peace is the only way to halt this tragedy,"" Grandi added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-official-afghan-troop-withdrawal-empower-terrorists,2022-03-04
Biden backs slavery reparations study as part of 'comprehensive action to address systemic racism that persists today',"President Joe Biden supports studying whether descendants of enslaved people in the United States should receive reparations. White House press secretary Jen Psaki revealed that the reparations study would be part of the Biden administration's ""commitment to take comprehensive action to address the systemic racism that persists today.""

""He certainly would support a study of reparations,"" Psaki said at the White House briefing on Wednesday. ""He understands we don't need a study to take action right now on systemic racism, so he wants to take actions within his own government in the meantime.""

In January, Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (Texas) reintroduced H.R. 40, which would establish a commission to examine the practice of slavery in America for more than 200 years. The study would determine what remedies for past slavery can be put in action, including possible financial payments from the U.S. government to descendants of slaves. The bill has 162 co-sponsors, all of whom are Democrats.



The bill, titled ""Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act,"" states:

To address the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery in the United States and the 13 American colonies between 1619 and 1865 and to establish a commission to study and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations for the institution of slavery, its subsequent de jure and de facto racial and economic discrimination against African Americans, and the impact of these forces on living African Americans, to make recommendations to the Congress on appropriate remedies, and for other purposes.

On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties held a virtual hearing to discuss H.R. 40.

""White nationalism and police-community conflict are just part of the long legacy of anti-Black racism that has shaped our nation's laws, institutions, and societal attitudes,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said in his opening remarks at the hearing. ""That racism and division hold back our country's long-standing efforts to carry out what the Preamble to our Constitution says it is designed to do — to form 'a more perfect union.'""

""Reparations in the context of H.R. 40 are ultimately about respect and reconciliation—and the hope that one day, all Americans can walk together toward a more just future,"" Nadler stated.

""We believe in determination, and we believe in overcoming the many bad balls that we have been thrown; we've caught them, and we've kept on going. That is not the point of H.R. 40,"" Lee said during the hearing, as reported by the Hill. ""Now more than ever, the facts and circumstances facing our nation demonstrate the importance of H.R. 40 and the necessity of placing our nation on the path to reparative justice.""

Before Lee reintroduced H.R. 40, the late Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) first introduced a bill calling for a study into possible slavery reparations in 1989, and it was reintroduced every session until Conyers' retirement in 2017.



Last year, President Biden told the Washington Post, ""We must acknowledge that there can be no realization of the American dream without grappling with the original sin of slavery, and the centuries-long campaign of violence, fear, and trauma wrought upon black people in this country.""



In February 2019, Kamala Harris said she supports slavery reparations.

Americans overwhelmingly oppose reparations. A Reuters/Ipsos poll from June 2020 found that only one in five respondents agreed the U.S. government should use ""taxpayer money to pay damages to descendants of enslaved people in the United States.""

As for the cost of reparations, one study estimated a price tag between $5.9 trillion and $14.2 trillion.

CNBC reported on another study in August, ""A meaningful program to eliminate the existing Black-White wealth gap requires an allocation of between $10 trillion and $12 trillion, or about $800,000 to each eligible Black household.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-s-incoming-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-called-fox-news-racist,2021-02-18
Biden says US will intervene if China invades Taiwan,"President Joe Biden has announced that the United States will militarily intervene if the People's Republic of China decides to invade Taiwan, according to reports.

What are the details?

During a Monday press conference in Tokyo, Biden said that the United States military will help Taiwan defend itself against China if necessary.

A reporter asked the president, ""You didn't want to get involved in the Ukraine conflict militarily for obvious reasons. Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?""

""Yes. That's the commitment we made,"" Biden responded while delivering in remarks alongside Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

The president added that China should not take Taiwan ""by force.""

""[It] is just not appropriate,"" he said.

A White House spokesperson told Fox News that the Biden administration's One China policy ""has not changed.""

""As the president said, our policy has not changed,"" the spokesperson said. ""He reiterated our One China Policy and our commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself.""

Fox News noted that America's ""One China policy"" states that the U.S. recognizes the People's Republic of China as the ""sole legal government of China, but only acknowledges, without endorsing, Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China.""

What else?

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that he was unhappy with and opposed to Biden's remarks.

""China has no room for compromise or concessions on issues involving China’s core interests such as sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Wang said.

In October, Biden issued similar remarks and said that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, to which a ministry spokesperson warned, ""No one should underestimate the strong resolve, determination, and capability of the Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. China has no room for compromise.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-shields-ukrainians-in-us-from-deportation-with-temporary-protection-during-war,2022-05-23
Biden praises Rep. Rashida Tlaib after she confronts him on Israel – and he mispronounces her name three times,"President Joe Biden's attempt to heap praise on Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich,) during his speech at a Ford factory was undermined by his inability to pronounce her name correctly despite trying three times.

Biden was visiting the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, on Tuesday when he made the remarks. He appeared to call the controversial far left congresswoman ""Rashid"" instead of her name, ""Rashida.""

""Rashid, Tlaib, where's Rashid?"" said Biden during the speech.

""I tell you what, Rashid, I want to say to you that I admire your intellect, I admire your passion, and I admire your concern for so many other people. And from my heart, I pray that your grandmom and family are well, I promise you I'm gonna do everything to see that they are, in the West Bank,"" he added.

""You're a fighter and God thank you for being a fighter,"" Biden said as the audience applauded.

The comments came after Tlaib confronted Biden on the tarmac of Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport about the mounting death count in the military conflict between Palestinians and Israel.

Biden angered many on the far left when he said in a statement on Wednesday that Israel had a right to defend itself against the rocket attacks being fired from the Gaza Strip.

Tlaib responded angrily by pointing out that Biden's statement made no mention of the Palestinians at all.

""How many of my colleagues are willing to say the same, to stand for Palestinian human rights as they do for Israel? How many Palestinians have to die for their lives to matter?"" she said in a speech on the floor of Congress.

Tlaib is the only Palestinian-American representative in Congress. She has been accused of using anti-Semitic themes that allude to the complete removal of the state of Israel.

Biden tries to hit Trump on religious freedom. The administration he served in tried to force nuns to pay for birth control.,"Former Vice President Joe Biden says that we need a president who respects religious freedom, but the administration where he held the No. 2 position came under repeated fire for violating that fundamental right.

In a short social media ad released Wednesday, Biden is seen talking with a man who thanks him for making remarks against President Donald Trump's so-called ""Muslim ban,"" which is the travel suspension the administration placed on multiple countries due to national security concerns.

Biden responds that he ""was against it from the beginning"" and calls the policy ""ridiculous."" A message then wipes over the screen, saying, ""We need a president who respects religious freedom.""



While the religious freedom-based criticisms on the travel ban have indeed been widespread, the Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that the administration's policy was ""expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices"" and noted that the text of the proclamation ""says nothing about religion.""

But if Biden really does want to make religious freedom a campaign issue, he's probably going to have a lot to explain from his past job as Barack Obama's vice president.



After all, Biden's message may come as ironic to those who remember the Obama administration's yearslong legal fight against the Little Sisters of the Poor over the Obamacare contraception mandate, where the administration Biden served in tried to force an order of Catholic nuns — in addition to other religious organizations — to pay for birth control despite their religious beliefs to the contrary.

And in addition to the contraception mandate, other Obama administration actions took considerable criticism from religious freedom advocates.

In the waning days of the last administration, Andrew Walker and John Wester of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission pointed out several different Obama-era actions that conflicted with the conscience rights of traditional believers, many of which were over matters of sexual orientation and transgender policy. These ranged from an executive order affecting the hiring practices of federal contractors to the administration's attempt to affect transgender bathroom policies in public schools.

""Religious conservatives are often portrayed as angry aggressors in the culture war,"" the two wrote at National Review. ""Nothing could be further from the truth, as evident in the case of the Obama administration's progressive assaults upon religious liberty. The Obama administration determined religious freedom to be a worthy sacrifice on the altar of progressivism.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-taiwan-military-china,2020-01-30
Biden announces US war in Afghanistan will end ahead of schedule by Aug. 31,"The U.S. war in Afghanistan will officially be over by the end of August, President Joe Biden announced in remarks delivered Thursday. The president gave an update on the status of U.S. troop withdrawal, which is proceeding ahead of schedule.

""Our military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on Aug. 31. The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritizing the safety of our troops as they depart,"" Biden said.

Last April, Biden pledged to withdraw the remaining 3,500 troops from the war-torn nation, bringing an end to a 20-year-old military conflict.

""As I said in April, the United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan — to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and deliver justice to Osama bin Laden, and to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from becoming a base from which attacks could be continued against the United States. We achieved those objectives. That's why we went,"" Biden said.

""We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build,"" he added. ""And it's the right and the responsibility of Afghan people, alone, to decide their future and how they want to run their country.""

The president said that U.S. forces have trained and equipped 300,000 Afghan soldiers to maintain control of the country after American troops have withdrawn and emphasized that the federal government will continue to provide funding for the Afghan military to maintain its air force.

Biden made clear that he will resist calls for continued military intervention in Afghanistan despite the gains Taliban fighters have made as the U.S. exited the region. In just the last week, the radical Islamic terrorist group has taken control of 10% of the country, according to the Foundation fo Defense of Democracies, a nonprofit group that is monitoring the conflict in the Middle East. The foundation's analysis found that the Afghan government only controls 20% of the country, with the rest disputed.

Earlier this week, NBC News reported that the Taliban had seized containers full of weapons and military hardware from the Afghan military after U.S. forces left. The weapons were taken from the Sultan Khil military base in a province near Kabul and included 900 guns, 30 light tactical vehicles and 20 army pickup trucks. Reports indicate that some Afghan military posts have surrendered to advancing Taliban forces without putting up a fight.

Republicans have hammered Biden for leaving Afghanistan prematurely.

""It is not in America's interest for the Taliban to take over Afghanistan. If the Taliban takes over part of Afghanistan, I fear that al Qaeda and ISIS will reemerge, and we will be paving a way for another 9/11,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters Tuesday.

Last month, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) criticized Biden's plans for withdrawal as ""reckless"" and ""hasty,"" warning that ""the threats we face from terrorism and tyranny have not been defeated.""

But Biden said 20 years of experience fighting in Afghanistan has demonstrated that continued U.S. military presence there for another year or even for six more months is unlikely to improve the situation.

""How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters and sons are you willing to risk?"" Biden asked, addressing his critics. ""I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.""

As the United States completes its military withdrawal, Biden committed to evacuating thousands of Afghan translators and their families who assisted the U.S., promising to expedite their emigration to the United States. He also said the U.S. will continue to provide humanitarian support for Afghanistan, including defending the rights of women and girls.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-tlaib-rashida-name,2021-07-08
"Biden denies reality, won't commit to using US troops to extract Americans from Kabul despite Taliban beating US citizens","Facing intense criticism from all sides over the incompetent effort to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies out of Afghanistan, President Joe Biden addressed the nation Friday to give an update on the evacuation effort.

The president said that nearly 6,000 troops were deployed on the ground in Kabul and have secured the airport and enabled international flights out of the country to resume. He would not commit, however, to using U.S. troops to go into Kabul and extract Americans who have not been able to reach the airport. In fact, he claimed that there was ""no indication"" American citizens were having trouble reaching the airport, a claim that is not based in reality.

""This is one of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history. And the only country in the world capable of projecting this much power on the far side of the world, with this degree of precision, is the United States of America,"" Biden boasted.



""We've already evacuated more than 18,000 people since July and approximately 13,000 since our military airlift began on August the 14th. Thousands more have been evacuated on private charter flights facilitated by the U.S. government,"" the president said.

""The United States stands by its commitment to these people,"" Biden added.

Flights from the Kabul airport were briefly paused on Friday after a facility in Qatar where refugees were being transported for processing reached capacity. But Biden said that flights out of Afghanistan had resumed by the time he began speaking, as his administration had worked to set up a new space where refugees could be processed in Bahrain.

The president reiterated that the U.S. government does not know exactly how many Americans were in Afghanistan when evacuation efforts began. He said his administration was working to count how many Americans have been evacuated and how many remain.

""We're going to do everything, everything that we can to provide safe evacuation for our Afghan allies, partners, and Afghans who might be targeted because of their association with the United States,"" Biden said.

""Let me be clear: Any American who wants to come home, we will get you home,"" Biden promised, before hedging expectations. ""Make no mistake: This evacuation mission is dangerous. It involves risks to our armed forces and its being conducted under difficult circumstances. I cannot promise what the final outcome will be or that it will be without risk of loss, but as commander-in-chief I can assure that I will mobilize every resource necessary and as an American I offer my gratitude to the brave men and women of the U.S. armed forces who are carrying out this mission.""

The president said his administration is in ""constant contact"" with the Taliban to ensure the safe passage of Americans to the airport. Answering a question from a reporter, Biden said there was ""no indication"" that any American with a U.S. passport has not been able to get to the airport safely.

ABC News Senior Correspondent Ian Pannell, reporting from the ground in Afghanistan, said Biden's claim is ""just totally not"" what is happening.

""Last night on 'World News' we had American citizens who had exactly that experience. They tried to get to the airport, they had waved their American passports ... they were beaten by the Taliban with the rubber fan belt from a vehicle,"" Pannell said.

Reports indicate that the Taliban has also been blocking Afghans from reaching the airport, breaking their commitments to the U.S. The Biden administration said Thursday it was aware of ""congestion"" around the airport hampering evacuation efforts, an interesting way to describe Taliban soldiers using gunfire to disperse crowds of people.



Facing demands to go get the trapped Americans, Biden would not commit to sending U.S. troops into Kabul to extract U.S. citizens who have not been able to reach the airport, as British and French forces have done for their citizens.

The president vowed that any attack by the Taliban on U.S. forces working to secure the evacuation of American citizens ""will be met with swift and forceful response.""



Biden also said that he's been in contact with international leaders and that there will be a G7 summit next week to discuss ongoing evacuation efforts.

He also dismissed criticisms from the international community, saying there's ""no question of our credibility from our allies around the world,"" despite the fact that the U.K. Parliament voted Wednesday to hold Biden in contempt for his handling of the situation in Afghanistan.

""There'll be plenty of time to criticize and second-guess when this operation is over. But now, now I am focused on getting this job done,"" Biden said.

Biden's remarks, follow several days of chaos at the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, where thousands of desperate refugees and American citizens have sought flights out of the country to flee the radical Islamist regime that came to power on Sunday. Biden's administration has lagged in approving visas for evacuees, and horrific images and videos have surfaced showing Afghans clinging to departing U.S. military aircraft and falling to their deaths after they failed to secure passage aboard.

Administration officials said Thursday that 7,000 people had been evacuated from Kabul since Sunday, with 5,200 American troops on the ground in Afghanistan assisting and providing security at the airport. Those American troops were joined by 600 Afghan security forces soldiers, who have proven willing to continue the fight against the Taliban.

Defense Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters Thursday that the U.S. is capable of airlifting between 5,000 and 9,000 out of Afghanistan each day, but so far been unable to do so because the bases where refugees are taken for processing have reached capacity and an unknown number of Americans who want to be evacuated are unable to reach the airport.

Asked how many Americans are still in Afghanistan, Kirby said, ""I don't know.""



In his first remarks on the situation Monday in Afghanistan, Biden defended his decision to withdraw U.S. forces from the conflict there, asserting that ""there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces.""



Biden said that his national security team had been ""clear-eyed about the risks"" of leaving Afghanistan, though just one month prior Biden assured the American people that it was ""highly unlikely"" that the Taliban would take control of the country.

The president blamed Afghanistan's political leaders for giving up the fight and fleeing the country and the Afghan military for collapsing unexpectedly. But U.S. intelligence officials had warned that a rapid collapse of the Afghan military and government was imminent, warnings that were seemingly ignored. NBC News reported that multiple military officials had wanted to begin evacuating vulnerable Afghans as early as May, but were prohibited from doing so.

The president argued that he did not order an evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies sooner to avoid triggering a ""crisis of confidence"" in the Western-backed Afghan government. Biden also said Monday that Afghan civilians were at fault for the evacuation debacle because they ""did not want to leave early.""

In a Wednesday interview with ABC News, Biden said that the current situation was unavoidable.

""The idea that somehow, there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing — I don't know how that happens,"" Biden said.

He reiterated this point on Friday.

""If we had decided 15 years ago to leave Afghanistan, it would have been really difficult. If we decided five years ago, if we continued the war for another decade and tried to leave — there's no way in which you'd be able to leave Afghanistan without there being some of what you're seeing now,"" Biden said.

""But what we've done so far is we've been able to get a large number of Americans out, all our personnel at the embassy out, and so on. And thank God, so far, knock on wood, we're in a different position.""

The president was scheduled to go to his home in Wilmington, Delaware, Friday to continue a vacation that was interrupted by the crisis in Afghanistan. Biden postponed his departure to give his speech and will instead return to vacation on Saturday, remaining in Delaware through the weekend.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-tries-to-hit-trump-on-religious-freedom,2021-08-20
Bill Clinton has some advice for Donald Trump on how to handle impeachment,"Former President Bill Clinton, the only living president to have endured impeachment, advised President Donald Trump via a CNN interview not to let impeachment hinder legislative progress.

Clinton was impeached in 1998 for perjury and obstruction of justice, and acquitted in 1999 by the Senate. He said despite the conflict between himself and Congress, those two years were still productive.

""Well, my answer is, look at how much we got done in 1998 to 1999,"" Clinton said. ""And even in '97. We had very productive actions in all three years.""

So, Clinton said, President Trump should allow his legal team to handle impeachment while he focuses on improving the country.

""My message was — would be — look, you got hired to do a job,"" Clinton told Jake Tapper. ""You don't get to — every day's an opportunity to make something good happen. And I would say, 'I've got lawyers and staff people handling this impeachment inquiry and they should just have at it. Meanwhile, I'm going to work for the American people.' That's what I would do.""

Legislative progress has stalled in Washington while everyone's attention is focused on the House impeachment inquiry, which just commenced with public hearings Wednesday and will continue at least through next week, after weeks of private witness depositions.



Clinton called in to CNN to discuss a recent shooting at a Los Angeles-area high school that occurred as Clinton was set to receive an award for his work on gun control. After mass murders in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas in August, the political environment seemed right for progress on the issue of guns, but nothing has happened.

Attorney General William Barr said President Trump is still interested in making progress on gun control, but blamed impeachment for derailing those efforts.

Clinton said that was no excuse, saying he ""just kept working"" with Congress even while impeachment was in progress.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-war-in-afghanistan-end-august-31,2019-11-14
Bill Maher blasts leftists who try to rewrite history to 'control the present' narrative: 'Being woke is like a magic moral time machine',"""Real Time"" host Bill Maher on Friday's episode blasted leftists who attempt to rewrite history in order to ""control the present"" narrative — a concept known as ""presentism.""

Maher explained that presentism ""means judging everyone in the past by the standards of present. It's the belief that people who lived 100 or 500 or 1,000 years ago really should've known better.""

What are the details?

Maher noted that American Historical Society President James Sweet ""caught hell"" from leftists over an essay of his in which he criticized presentism — and then went to bat for Sweet by dismantling woke pronouncements leftists typically make to prop up their morality as compared to people of the past.

He touched upon slavery as an example: “Everybody who could afford one had a slave — including people of color. The way people talk about slavery these days, you’d think it was a uniquely American thing that we invented in 1619. But slavery throughout history has been the rule, not the exception.”

Maher added that Africans gathered other Africans to sell to slave traders and ""kept their own slaves"" as well.

""Humans are not good people,"" he quipped.

Maher added that ""the capacity for cruelty is a human thing, not a white thing. That's the truth, even though it doesn't jibe with the current narrative. But in today's world, when truth conflicts with narrative, it's the truth that has to apologize. Being woke is like a magic moral time machine where you judge everybody against what you imagine what you would have done in 1066, and you always win.""

He added that presentism is “just a way to congratulate yourself about being better than George Washington because you have a gay friend, and he didn’t. But if he was alive today, he would, too; and if you were alive then, you wouldn’t.""

Maher also pointed out a 2019 movie ""The Aeronauts"" — about scientists who broke the record for the highest balloon altitude. While both scientists who broke the record were men, Maher noted that in the movie the scientists were portrayed by a man and a woman.

When asked why that change was made to the historical record, the director replied that ""representation is important,"" Maher told his audience.

Megyn Kelly agreed with Maher's presentism assessment, saying that he ""nails it"":

"Bill Maher says punishing the Russian people in response to the Ukrainian invasion is 'not fair,' says it would be 'racist' if Russians 'weren't white'","On Friday, late night television host Bill Maher took to the air to lambast people who are using the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine to condemn and ostracize Russian people who are not involved in any way with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war.

Fox News reported that Maher asked the panelists on his eponymous talk show “Real Time with Bill Maher,” “Do you think we’re, um, lumping the Russians too much with their government?”

He said, “I feel like in this country what we’re doing now, everything Russian is bad an every Russian is bad.”

“First of all, it’s not fair,” Maher continued, “If they weren’t white, I feel like we’d call that racism, you know. To lump everybody together – not every, I mean a lot of the Russian people don’t know what’s going on.”

One of Maher’s guests, GOP pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, suggested that the anti-Russian sentiment has spilled over and “gone way too far” after mentioning how Alexander Malofeev, the 20-year-old Russian piano prodigy, had his Canadian engagements canceled because of his Russian heritage.

Author Max Brooks, another of Maher’s guest panelists, said that the global ostracization of the Russian people is “unwise.”

He said, “What we were very smart about doing in World War II is, we knew the war was going to come to an end. And we knew that if we punished all Germans the way we did after World War I, we would back them into a corner.”

“So we crafted the narrative that ‘You Germans are led astray by Hitler,’” he continued, “because we knew, even if in some cases it wasn’t true, you know, we said to the average Nazi, you still got to run to the post office.”

Brooks, son of comedic legend Mel Brooks, said, “We have to think, we cannot back the Russians as an entire ethnic group into a corner. If we can separate Putin from the Russians in general, then we don’t only have a victory, we have a post-war plan.”

Maher, an avowed liberal-Democrat, has been considerably outspoken about the American government’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

He criticized both the Democratic and Republican parties for making the conflict into partisan mess.

Maher said, “Don’t make World War III about you. Watching the reactions to war in Ukraine these past few weeks, it’s become obvious that America in this age suffers acutely from a particular disease of the mind, which is: Everything proves what we already believed and everything goes back to thing we already hate.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-clinton-advice-for-donald-trump-on-how-to-handle-impeachment,2022-03-19
"Bill Maher hammers liberals who say masculinity is always toxic. 'Real Time' host praises males defending Ukraine, points out how 'the world still needs grown-ass men.'","Bill Maher laced into liberals who attack men for having supposed ""toxic masculinity."" The ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" host used Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and men taking up arms to defend Ukraine from the Russian invasion as examples of how masculinity can be anything but toxic.

""If there's one thing we've learned from the crisis in Ukraine, it's that everyone loves, and the world still needs, grown-ass men,"" Maher began his rant.



Maher noticed that American women are obsessing over Zelenskyy, who the New York Post and Forward labeled as a ""sex symbol"" earlier this month. Maher stressed that progressives can't consider Zelenskyy a sex symbol while also denouncing masculinity as toxic.

The liberal talk show host jokingly hypothesized, ""Could it be that as much as women may want to create the perfect man there's always going to be a little bit of toxic mixed in with our masculinity and no amount of training will turn us into your favorite 'Twilight' character.""



""Masculinity is like coffee even when you decaffeinated, there's still a little caffeine in there,"" Maher quipped.

""Now there's certainly no denying that there has been a lot of toxicity associated with men throughout history, oceans of brutality, all of which is horrible, and some of which is why our species still exists on earth,"" Maher acknowledged.

""There are brave women fighting in Ukraine, but the images of people fleeing all seem to be women and children while every able-bodied man in Ukraine is sticking around to fight and maybe die,"" Maher noted. Ukraine has prohibited most Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 from fleeing the country, forcing them to defend against the Russian invasion.

""It's not always a great advantage being a man and toxic though we may be,"" he proclaimed. ""We do sometimes come in handy.""



""Turns out after 200,000 years, there's still a lot of 'Another tribe is coming to kill us.' And when that happens, you want a little big d*** energy,"" Maher said of military conflicts.

Maher remarked that for years he has been told that ""women just want a man who listens"" and ""won't try to fix their problems. He dared, ""Put that to the test sometime. Go over to her house tomorrow and fix her radiator. I bet she loves it.""

""When there's a noise downstairs, someone has to go into the dark and most women still want a man to do it,"" Maher joked. ""And if he doesn't, or can't or won't, it's not sexy.""

The HBO host shared a study that American adults having sex hit a 30-year low. He highlighted a study that one in four adults in the U.S. haven't had sex in the past year. Maher also pointed out how sperm counts of U.S. men have been drastically declining over decades.

Maher questioned the manlihood of today's American male, and suggested it could be because of the constant lecturing about toxic masculinity.

""It's the result of having it drilled into us in recent years that masculinity is itself toxic and scary and unevolved,"" he proposed. ""And women don't like it and the ones who think they do they really don't. And if you think you do, you're wrong, too.""

""Even the act of just asking a girl out is now seen by many younger people as overly aggressive,"" he said. ""There's a feeling that the attributes traditionally characteristic of men are inherently problematic. Which sounds a lot like men are born wrong.""

Maher lashed out at the Obama administration for using a man who became known as ""pajama boy"" to try to ""sell Obamacare to a skeptical nation.""

Maher ridiculed the marketing of Obamacare, ""This is what they put out as an image of the perfect man. The only thing he loves more than affordable health insurance is his therapy cat and 'Emily in Paris.' That ad might as well say, 'Ask your doctor if chemical castration is right for you.'""



Regarding the ""pajama boy"" campaign, there was a Politico opinion piece at the time titled: ""Pajama Boy, An Insufferable Man-Child.""

""You could win the battle and lose the war if you harangue men into becoming less like us and more like you,"" Maher stated.



""Women aren't attracted to these girly men they've created,"" Maher declared. ""The guy you whipped into total sensitivity isn't sexy to you anymore.""

Maher joked, ""There's a special place in a woman's heart for a man who learns to suppress his masculinity, it's called the 'friendzone.'""

Maher then lambasted men for ""sulking"" and ""complaining"" about not being able to be with a woman.

""Girls don't want to have sex with you unless you put in a little effort,"" Maher exclaimed. ""So put in a low effort. Yes, stupid lazy f***s.""

‘Black Hawk Down’ mission vets hit back at Rep. Ilhan Omar’s criticisms,"Veterans of the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu are hitting back at 2017 criticisms that surfaced earlier this week from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) that appeared to attack their role in the conflict.

As reported by Conservative Review's Jordan Schachtel, a 2017 tweet from Somali-American Omar said, ""he forgets to also mention the thousands of Somalis killed by the American forces that day!"" in response to a post commemorating the loss of 19 U.S. service members during the two-day operation. She added the hashtag ""#NotTodaySatan.""

""In helping her tribe, we had to eliminate those who were bad,"" former U.S. Delta Force operator Kyle Lamb told the Washington Examiner in response to Omar's criticisms. ""She should be thankful we were there to help her people.""



United States forces were in Somalia as part of United Nations peacekeeping efforts in 1993 when they were attacked by Somali militiamen. The original mission was to ensure that food aid sent to the struggling country would not be hijacked before it reached the people it was supposed to feed.

Eighteen U.S. personnel died in the main battle, and one was later killed by a mortar round. Two U.S. Black Hawk helicopters were shot down in the firefight, leading to the title of the 1999 book and 2001 major motion picture that immortalized the efforts of elite fighters in Task Force Ranger during the battle.

""I really am offended, truly offended, by her comment and her thought that thousands were killed by us,"" retired Army Ranger Col. Danny McKnight told the outlet. ""Not true. Not true at all.""

A 1997 story at the Philadelphia Inquirer estimates that around 500 Somalis died throughout the course of the battle.

McKnight also explained to the Examiner that the Battle of Mogadishu wasn't just a single fight, contrary to what was implied in Omar's tweet. In reality, there were multiple confrontations between U.S. and Somali forces.

""We had six fights before we ever got to number seven, which is the one known as 'Black Hawk Down,'"" he said. ""I think [Omar's] idea was that there was really one that just took place.""

Omar's comments were unearthed by the Investigative Project on Terrorism. The full story can be found here.

""As a nation, we and our political leadership should be proud of what we did there,"" pilot Mike Durant, who was beaten and captured after his Black Hawk was downed in the fighting, told IPT. ""We put our most precious resource on the line to help starving people. In return, my friends' remains and those of my comrades were dragged through the streets.

""I do not hold all Somalis accountable for the actions of a few,"" Durant added, ""but I certainly take issue with the remarks of Congresswoman Omar.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-maher-says-punishing-the-russian-people-in-response-to-the-ukrainian-invasion-is-not-fair-says-it-would-be-racist-if-russians-weren-t-white,2019-04-26
Black Lives Matter nominated for Nobel Peace Prize,"The Black Lives Matter movement has been nominated for the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize by Petter Eide, a Norwegian member of Parliament, who represents the Socialist Left Party.

""I find that one of the key challenges we have seen in America, but also in Europe and Asia, is the kind of increasing conflict based on inequality,"" Eide said, as reported by The Guardian. ""Black Lives Matter has become a very important worldwide movement to fight racial injustice. They have had a tremendous achievement in raising global awareness and consciousness about racial injustice.""

""They have been able to mobilize people from all groups of society, not just African-Americans, not just oppressed people, it has been a broad movement, in a way which has been different from their predecessors,"" Eide stated.

The Black Lives Matter movement spread to more than 2,000 cities in over 60 countries, according to the New York Times.



By June 22, 2020, less than a month after the police-involved death of George Floyd, the Washington Post estimates that police made 14,000 arrests in 49 cities during protests, which began on May 26.

Nine people were killed while participating in BLM protests in 2020, according to The Guardian.



Following the summer of riots and American cities being burned, support for protests against police brutality dropped, according to a poll taken in September.

The protests and riots that raged for months following the George Floyd death reportedly caused unprecedented damage. An Axios report stated that last summer's riots were the ""most expensive in insurance history.""



""The protests that took place in 140 U.S. cities this spring were mostly peaceful, but the arson, vandalism and looting that did occur will result in at least $1 billion to $2 billion of paid insurance claims — eclipsing the record set in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of the police officers who brutalized Rodney King,"" the report claimed.

The Black Lives Matter organization was founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. The Black Lives Matter organization was created by Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi, and Patrisse Cullors.

In 2015, Cullors admitted that she and Garza are ""trained Marxists.""

""Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers. We are trained Marxists,"" Cullors said during an interview. ""We are super-versed on, sort of, ideological theories.""



The Black Lives Matter organization now has a global network of more than 40 chapters.

Swedish industrialist and inventor Alfred Nobel, who the award is named after, explained the qualifications for winning the Nobel Peace Prize in his will:

""The said interest shall be divided into five equal parts, which shall be apportioned as follows: /- - -/ one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.



All of my remaining realizable assets are to be disbursed as follows: the capital, converted to safe securities by my executors, is to constitute a fund, the interest on which is to be distributed annually as prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind. The interest is to be divided into five equal parts and distributed as follows: one part to the person who made the most important discovery or invention in the field of physics; one part to the person who made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who, in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction; and one part to the person who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses.""

This year, the deadline to submit a nomination is Feb. 1. In March, the committee narrows down the field to a shortlist. The winner is chosen in October, and the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony is scheduled for Dec. 10, 2021.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-maher-toxic-masculinity-ukraine-zelenskyy,2021-01-29
Black pastors call out Rev. Raphael Warnock for supporting 'systemic racism of abortion',"A coalition of more than 25 black pastors — mainly from Georgia — recently called out Democratic Senate candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock over his support for abortion ahead of the Peach State's Jan. 5 runoff elections.

In a letter obtained by Fox News and sent last Friday, the pastors said they felt ""compelled to confront"" the reverend after he recently made public comments supporting abortion, which they said represented ""grave errors of judgment and a lapse in pastoral responsibility.""

In November, Warnock tweeted, ""I will always fight for reproductive justice."" Then in another tweet, he said, ""I'm a pro-choice pastor, and I believe that a hospital room is way too small for a woman, her doctor, and the United States government.""

The tweets followed an earlier public statement the reverend made during a podcast interview in which he argued that abortion is an exercise of ""human agency and freedom"" and is ""consistent with"" his beliefs as a minister.

Warnock, who serves as senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, an Atlanta church where both Martin Luther King Jr. and his father once pastored, is challenging Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler (Ga.) for one of the two Senate seats up for grabs in Georgia.

In the letter, the pastors charged Warnock to reconsider his position based on biblical grounds and instead turn to denounce the evil practice:

As a Christian pastor and as a Black leader, you have a duty to denounce the evil of abortion, which kills a disproportionate number of Black children. Your open advocacy of abortion is a scandal to the faith and to the Black community.



Abortion is fundamentally in conflict with the plain reading of the Bible. The Bible clearly teaches that human life is created by God beginning at conception. As Psalm 139 proclaims:""You knitted me together in my mother's womb. I praise you, for I am wonderfully and fearfully made."" What human being could possibly have the right to blot out an innocent life that God has wonderfully and fearfully made?



Abortion prematurely thwarts God's providential and loving plan for a promising human life.And by terminating an innocent unborn life in the womb, abortion directly violates the seventh commandment: ""Thou shalt not kill."" God demands that every faithful Christian protect and uphold the sanctity of innocent human life, at every stage of life. Supporting abortion represents a serious abdication of and a transgression against that responsibility, just like the disrespect of the poor, the disabled, or the elderly.

Later in the letter, the pastors also entreated Warnock to change course over the devastation that abortion has wreaked on the black community. They pointed out that the abortion movement was begun with the premise of racism and white supremacy and today continues to disproportionately harm black Americans.



""Can you in good conscience defend abortion, knowing that abortion kills 474 Black babies forevery 1000 live births?"" the pastors asked.

""For all of the above reasons, we entreat you to reconsider your public advocacy for abortion,"" they concluded. ""We implore you to uphold the Biblical defense of life and to fight against the systemic racism of abortion.""

It's not the first time that Warnock has been confronted over his support for abortion. Last week, former NFL coach Tony Dungy questioned Warnock's faith over the issue.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/black-hawk-down-vets-hit-back-at-ilhan-omar,2020-12-15
Black police chief fired after black leaders — including state senator — were charged with conspiring to damage Confederate monument,"The police chief of Portsmouth, Virginia, was fired Monday after two months on paid administrative leave following a controversy in which police charged local black leaders — including a state senator — with conspiring to damage a Confederate monument during a protest in June, WAVY-TV reported.

What are the details?

At the June 10 protest in Portsmouth, demonstrators damaged Confederate statues as part of a nationwide wave of racial justice protests in the wake of George Floyd's death — and one Portsmouth demonstrator was seriously injured after a toppled, beheaded statue fell on his head.

In August, city police charged Democratic state Sen. Louise Lucas — Virginia's most senior black legislator — and 18 other plaintiffs, including a school board member and members of the local NAACP chapter and the public defender's office, with conspiracy to commit a felony and injury to a monument in excess of $1,000, NBC News reported.

Greene, who is black, said Lucas and others ""conspired and organized to destroy the monument as well as summon hundreds of people to join in felonious acts,"" the network added.

NBC News, citing the police version of events in a probable cause summary, reported that Lucas was with a number of people who were shaking cans of spray paint, and she told police they were going to vandalize the statues ""and you can't stop them ... they got a right, go ahead!""

More from WAVY:

We asked Greene whether she would argue there were political and city leaders that wanted the monument to be defaced, to which she nodded her head ""yes."" We also asked whether she believed they didn't want her to pursue charges in connection with the monument vandalism — also a ""yes.""

But on Monday, the charges against Lucas and the other black leaders were dismissed.

The Portsmouth Commonwealth Attorney's Office said there was ""no proper evidence"" to support the charges that the plaintiffs' actions ""rise to the level of felony destruction of property or conspiracy,"" NBC News reported, citing a dismissal motion.

A judge also questioned why police went around local prosecutors to bring charges, the network said, adding that city leaders questioned Greene's involvement in the Confederate protest investigation due to an unspecified conflict of interest. Local activists and clergy leaders called for her resignation or firing, NBC News added.

The dismissal drew praise from Democrats who condemned the charges, the network said:

More from NBC News:

Lucas' office could not immediately be reached for comment. The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk reported that she said dismissal of the case ""gives people hope"" that ""when they come to these courtrooms that they will be treated in a fair and just manner, even though you may have a rogue police department who intends to criminalize the justice system against people like me.""

WAVY said Greene was placed on leave in September with pay — and then on Monday she was fired. A city spokeswoman declined to tell NBC News if Greene's firing was connected to the charges filed against Lucas and that other black leaders.

Prior to her firing, which took place during a 15-minute meeting, Greene told the station her hope was for ""full reinstatement, because I did nothing wrong.""

After the meeting she confirmed to WAVY that she ""was terminated, and I am one less badge and one less gun"" — and that she wasn't given any explanation for her firing or given severance pay. The station said Greene has young children and an elderly parent, and a fund has been set up to help with her expenses.

What happened after the chief's firing?

Greene held a news conference after the firing and said she'd file a wrongful termination lawsuit against the city, WAVY reported.

""I believe I was wrongfully terminated for upholding the law and being retaliated against for sticking to my sworn oath that I swore to serve and protect my citizens, community and keeping my officers safe,"" she said, according to NBC News.

"Purported BLM activists near Ma’Khia Bryant death scene have ominous message for cops: ‘You shoot us, we shoot you’","Purported Black Lives Matter protesters are reportedly threatening to shoot police officers in an ""eye for an eye"" move following the officer-involved fatal shooting of 16-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant.

What are the details?

The Daily Caller reported Friday that Black Lives Matter protesters rallied in the streets of Columbus, Ohio, following the teen's death.

In a video, the news organization explained that a video posted to Twitter shows a group of protesters threatening to kill police officers.

""We're not gonna sit here and just sit around while you shoot and kill us and go back to the suburbs,"" an unidentified male can be heard saying. ""We're sick ... maybe it needs to be an eye for an eye.""

Members of the crowd responded in agreement, yelling ""Yeah!""

The speaker added, ""They shoot us, we shoot them! You shoot us, we shoot you!""

The video, shared by Twitter user TheElefentGamer, was captioned, ""BLM activists call for assassinations of police in response to the Columbus shooting of an armed teenager.""

The video has been viewed more than 10,000 times at the time of this reporting.

What else?

Kiara Yakita, founder of the Black Liberation Movement Central Ohio, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the officer's use of force was unjust because he didn't attempt to de-escalate the situation.

""When I saw the bodycam, I noticed the difference in how they police. When it comes to black people, they do not like to deescalate,"" Yakita said. ""The reaction seems to be to fear black people who are in conflict and to just try to violently stop them.""

""There's not many questions asked, there is hardly any time spent trying to identify who's the victim, who's the aggressor, who's the person who even called us here for help in the first place,"" she added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/black-pastors-raphael-warnock-abortion,2021-04-23
Black Lives Matter protesters intimidate police union leader at his house by beating effigy of his journalist wife with a bat,"Videos captured Black Lives Matter protesters gleefully beating an effigy of a journalist with a bat like a piñata because she's married to a police union leader.

The startling incident occurred Saturday near Minneapolis.

The protesters demanded the resignation of Minneapolis Police Officers Federation President Bob Kroll and then hoisted up a piñata with the visage of his wife, Liz Collin, who is a news anchor at WCCO-TV.

Video of the incident was posted to social media by protesters proud of their intimidating behavior, but was later deleted.

Protesters were joined by CAIR leaders and John Thompson, a Democrat campaigning for State House in Minnesota. Thompson accused Kroll of being a member of the Ku Klux Klan in a vitriolic tirade outside of Kroll's home.

The protesters cheered when a man with a bat beat both of the piñatas made up to look like Kroll and his wife.

Image Source: YouTube screenshot

The back of the caricature of Collin had a quote denying that her marriage to a police union leader meant she could not report the news objectively.

""Is it a conflict of interest for me to be a journalist married to the Minneapolis police union boss?"" she asked. ""My answer: No.""

According to BMTN, Kroll has been the subject of numerous protests since the death of George Floyd in late May. Activists see his tenure as the police union leader as a barrier to addressing systemic problems within the Minneapolis Police Department.

Condemnation

WCCO-TV anchor Jason DeRusha condemned the action in a statement to BMTN.

""Protest. Complain. Advocate. Speak out. Picket my station again! But making a piñata out of a journalist and beating it is disgusting, offensive and sad. This is where we are? That all of these intelligent people thought this was ok?"" he said.

Former Minnesota GOP Deputy Chair Michael Brodkorb also criticized the rancorous behavior in a tweet.

""The violent destruction of an effigy of a Minnesota journalist - @lizcollin - by protesters standing in the driveway of her home needs to be immediately denounced by the @mnspj and other journalists,"" Brodkorb said.

""This behavior is dangerous, harassing, and threatening,"" he added.

AOC said detained migrants were forced to drink from toilets—Border Patrol tells a different story,"Conflicting accounts of the conditions at Texas immigrant detention facilities have emerged in the wake of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's visit with other members of Congress on Monday.

The lawmakers visited facilities in El Paso and Clint, Texas, and Ocasio-Cortez's tweets and comments about the experience have stirred controversy.

One of issues is her claim that a detainee told her that Customs and Border Protection agents have forced them to drink out of toilet bowls.

""Officers were keeping women in cells w/ no water & had told them to drink out of the toilets,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.

Daily Mail political editor David Martosko pointed out that the toilets in CBP facilities are typically connected to sinks that dispense ""potable water,"" and wondered ""if 'drinking from the toilet' meant drinking from an attached sink marked 'potable water.'""

Ocasio-Cortez confirmed the toilet style indeed included the sink, but then said that sink was not working, so Border Patrol told detainees to drink from the bowl.

Ocasio-Cortez wasn't the only one who left the facility believing migrants were being ordered to drink from the toilet.

All this discussion of what kind of toilets are in the facility might be irrelevant, if the information given to Washington Examiner reporter Anna Giaritelli is true.



""This is what happened with the migrant & drinking water from toilet,"" a Border Patrol agent told Giaritelli. ""She wanted water. Didn't know how to use the faucet in the cell and drank from the toilet. She never told AOC that we made her drink from the toilet. AOC, of course, changed it. ... This was when she was apprehended and brought into the facility.""

Customs and Border Patrol announces discovery of longest tunnel ever dug into United States territory,"Underground tunnels traversing international boundaries usually conjures up images of Israel's security threats from Hezbollah infiltrations tunnels on their northern border. However, the latest revelation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) demonstrates that we are just as threatened by tunnels being dug into our territory by the Mexican drug cartels, even if the ""conflict"" is more subtle.

Wednesday, CBP announced the discovery of the largest tunnel ever dug into U.S. territory, measuring a total 4,068 feet from the Mexico-California border, with a total length of 4,309 feet. ""While subterranean tunnels are not a new occurrence along the California-Mexico border, the sophistication and length of this particular tunnel demonstrates the time-consuming efforts transnational criminal organizations will undertake to facilitate cross-border smuggling,"" said Cardell T. Morant, acting special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) San Diego.

According to the CBP news release, the tunnel originated in an industrial area of Tijuana. They discovered the suspected exit of the tunnel in a warehouse in Otay Mesa, California, when they found hundreds of sandbags covering up the breach point last August.

The tunnel, which is now being destroyed, is approximately 5 1/2 feet tall and 2 feet wide and was dug roughly 70 feet below the surface. It contained much of the sophistication of the Hezbollah tunnels in Israel – with ""an extensive rail/cart system, forced air ventilation, high voltage electrical cables and panels, an elevator at the tunnel entrance, and a complex drainage system.""

While CBP made it clear that the cartels constructing tunnels under our border is nothing new, what is concerning is how they've advanced in technology while the efforts to counter them do not seem to have improved. Our government still views the border with a law enforcement lens rather than with a national security mindset to secure a perimeter the way the Israelis do both at their norther and southern borders. It is something that will need a great deal of attention from DHS and potentially the Pentagon, as the expanded border wall forces the cartels to increasingly rely on other methods for smuggling.

""The sophistication of this tunnel once again validates the Mexican cartel's capabilities far exceed U.S. law enforcement's ability to stop them,"" said Jaeson Jones, a retired Texas Department of Public Safety captain, in an interview with TheBlaze. ""The construction of a tunnel that exceeds 70 feet below ground and stretches ¾ of a mile into the United States demonstrates the multifaceted capabilities of the cartels today and the national security threat they pose to our nation.""

Jones, who used to manage the daily operations of the Texas Rangers' Border Security Operations Center (BSOC), has been a vocal advocate for the State Department to designate the cartels as terrorists and treat them with more of a national security mindset.

""U.S. law enforcement may attempt to shine a light on the fact that this tunnel was discovered in the first place,"" lamented Jones. ""However, even after almost six months of a federal task force investigation, no one has been arrested and no narcotics have been seized. What did they get for it? A hole in the ground. Once again, this validates the need for national defense capabilities and authorities to protect the nation against the cartel threat. This cartel tunnel only highlights the immediate need to designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and treat our defense against them the way we would Hamas or Hezbollah.""

Jones noted that tunnels have been more of a problem in California than Texas because the Texas soil makes it hard for tunnels to be built without collapsing.

The retired border expert, who often appears on the Lou Dobbs show to discuss the cartels, expressed frustration that our government seems to view these tunnels as ""just about drugs.""

""These people are also engaged in dangerous weapons along with the drugs that foments so much violence on both sides of the border,"" warned Jones.

""The authorities that are required to deal with this problem are within the national defense apparatus. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) uses tunnel-detection technology across the world. We need all those national defense capabilities at our own border to detect these things earlier.""

A recent study has shown that the number of drug-associated deaths in America per year might be 2.2 times the amount of officially drug-coded deaths, topping 140,000 a year. In addition, to the drug deaths, much of the violence in cities like Chicago is fueled by cartel activities or the transnational gangs associated with them, according to DEA's most recent annual threat assessment.

The fact that in just one fiscal year ICE lodged detainers on foreign nationals subject to 2,500 homicide charges or convictions demonstrates the point that so much violence gets back to the border and cartel activity. It might not be a black-zone conflict like it is with Israel and Hezbollah or Hamas, but the gray-zone conflict with the cartels is driving a ""substantial portion"" of the violence we are seeing in Chicago.

In 2006, a super-majority of Congress passed the Secure Fence Act, which required the secretary of homeland security to ""take all actions"" necessary within 18 months of passage to ""achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States."" Section 2(b) of the bill defined ""operational control"" as ""the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.""

Where are we today?

""Fourteen years later, with the continued law enforcement mindset being applied to a national security problem, our government will continue failing to achieve the goal of border security,"" warned Jones.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/blm-pinata-protest-union-journalist,2020-01-30
British PM Johnson offers 3 million Hong Kong citizens refuge in the UK to hit back at China,"U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that his country will offer 3 million Hong Kong residents refuge and a path to citizenship in the United Kingdom in retaliation to China's new national security law, which effectively ends autonomy in the city.

According to Business Insider, Johnson told the House of Commons Wednesday that the law is in violation of the Sino-British joint declaration, which was signed by the U.K. and China in 1984.

The new law, which was met with global opposition, outlaws ""foreign interference"" and cracks down on pro-democracy demonstrations within the city. On Wednesday, it was put into effect as police arrested nearly 200 Hong Kong residents after thousands participated in a rally against the legislation.

Under the U.K. order, Hong Kong citizens eligible to apply for a British national overseas passport, along with their dependents, will be able to seek 5 years of limited right to remain in the U.K. — that number amounts to about 3 million.

After their 5-year stay and an additional year of settled status, arrivals will be eligible to apply for full U.K. citizenship.

""The enactment and imposition of this national security law constitutes a clear and serious breach of the Sino-British joint declaration,"" the prime minister told Parliament. ""It violates Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and is in direct conflict with Hong Kong basic law. The law also threatens the freedoms and rights protected by the joint declaration.

""We made clear that if China continued down this path we would introduce a new route for those with British national overseas status to enter the U.K., granting them limited right to remain with the ability to live and work in the U.K. and thereafter to apply for citizenship — and that is precisely what we will do now,"" he added.

According to BBC, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said there would be no limit on numbers or quotas, telling members that the U.K. ""will not look the other way on Hong Kong"" and ""will not duck our historic responsibilities to its people.""

Pro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong sounded the alarm over the new law last month, saying it marked the end of the ""one country, two systems"" agreement between Beijing and the autonomous city.

Soon after, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo agreed, officially declaring that with the imposition of the new law, Hong Kong could no longer be considered autonomous.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/border-patrol-says-aoc-got-it-wrong-about-detained-migrants-being-forced-to-drink-from-toilets,2020-07-01
San Francisco archbishop bars Speaker Nancy Pelosi from Holy Communion,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has been barred from receiving Holy Communion in the Archdiocese of San Francisco because of her increasingly ""extreme"" position on abortion, Archbishop Salvatore J. Cordileone announced Friday.

In a ""letter to the faithful,"" the archbishop wrote that after repeated attempts to speak with Pelosi and persuade her to adhere to the Catholic Church's teaching that life begins at conception and abortion is a sin, he has determined to place her under public church discipline.

""Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi’s position on abortion has become only more extreme over the years, especially in the last few months,"" Cordileone wrote. ""Just earlier this month she once again, as she has many times before, explicitly cited her Catholic faith while justifying abortion as a 'choice,' this time setting herself in direct opposition to Pope Francis.""



He quoted a statement Pelosi made to the Seattle Times earlier this month in which she fumed over the leaked draft Supreme Court majority opinion that would uphold Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban and overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.



“The very idea that they would be telling women the size, timing or whatever of their family, the personal nature of this is so appalling, and I say that as a devout Catholic,” Pelosi said. “They say to me, ‘Nancy Pelosi thinks she knows more about having babies than the Pope.’ Yes I do. Are you stupid?”

""After numerous attempts to speak with her to help her understand the grave evil she is perpetrating, the scandal she is causing, and the danger to her own soul she is risking, I have determined that the point has come in which I must make a public declaration that she is not to be admitted to Holy Communion unless and until she publicly repudiate her support for abortion 'rights' and confess and receive absolution for her cooperation in this evil in the sacrament of Penance,"" the archbishop announced.

""Please know that I find no pleasure whatsoever in fulfilling my pastoral duty here. Speaker Pelosi remains our sister in Christ. Her advocacy for the care of the poor and vulnerable elicits my admiration. I assure you that my action here is purely pastoral, not political,"" he said, asking faithful Christians to continue to pray for her.

The announcement that Pelosi would be denied communion is the culmination of a years-long conflict between the speaker, a self-described devout Catholic, and her archbishop on the abortion issue.

Last year, Cordileone issued a missive condemning ""the evil of abortion"" and suggesting that an ""erring Catholic"" who continues to support abortion rights after being confronted by their pastor must be temporarily excluded from communion.

Pelosi has said that overturning Roe would be an ""abomination"" and that should the Supreme Court do so, it would be ""one of the worst and most damaging decisions in modern history."" She and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have led Democrats in support of a radical abortion bill that would wipe out state pro-life laws and dramatically expand abortion access by codifying Roe into federal law.

Shepard Smith announces his departure from Fox News,"Fox News anchor, managing editor, and senior correspondent Shepard Smith announced Friday that he would be leaving the network after 23 years.

What are the details?

Smith, 55, made the announcement at the end of his newscast, saying it would be his final sign-off at the network where he rose through the ranks for more than two decades.

""Recently, I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News and begin a new chapter,"" the veteran journalist said. ""After requesting that I stay, they graciously obliged. The opportunities afforded this guy from small town Mississippi have been many. It's been an honor and a privilege to report the news each day to our loyal audience in context and with perspective, without fear or favor.

""I've worked with the most talented, dedicated, and focused professionals I know and I'm proud to have anchored their work each day,"" he continued, adding, ""I will deeply miss them.""

Smith closed his statement by saying, ""Even in our currently polarized nation it's been my hope that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter — that journalism and journalists will thrive.""



Fox News President Jay Wallace issued a statement confirming the move, telling The Hollywood Reporter, ""Shep is one of the premier newscasters of his generation and his extraordinary body of work is among the finest journalism in the industry. His integrity and outstanding reporting from the field helped put Fox News on the map and there is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair or elation through his masterful delivery.""

""We are proud of the signature reporting and anchoring style he honed at Fox News, along with everything he has accomplished here during his monumental 23-year tenure,"" Wallace continued. ""While this day is especially difficult as his former producer, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network.""

Anything else?

News of Smith's unexpected departure came as a shock to many, The Hill reported, but the outlet noted that ""the anchor has repeatedly drawn the ire of President Trump after pushing back on various remarks from the president"" and ""Smith has also been at odds with some members of the opinion side of Fox News in recent weeks.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boris-johnson-hong-kong-uk,2019-10-11
Brutal video shows cops accosting tiny elderly man during Freedom Convoy protests. His ‘crime’? ‘I just gave the trucker a thumbs-up and a honk’,"Video captured the moment Canadian police handcuffed a 4'10"" 78-year-old great-grandfather during the Freedom Convoy for reportedly daring to honk his horn.

What are the details?

Video captured the moment an unnamed officer approached the man, who was sitting inside his vehicle on the side of the road.

According to a report from the Toronto Sun, 78-year-old Gerry Charlebois was driving near the main Freedom Convoy protest in Ottawa when he saw a trucker.

Charlebois said he honked his horn and showed the trucker the thumbs-up hand gesture out of respect for the ongoing protests.

“I meant no harm,” Charlebois told the outlet. “I just gave the trucker a thumbs-up and a honk.”

Honking, however — as the officer in the video made painfully clear — is not permitted and, in Charlebois' case, resulted in a $118 bylaw ticket for ""unnecessary noise.""

“I was in shock,” Charlebois recalled of the moment he realized he was being pulled over. “When (the police) pulled me over, he told me I was in trouble for honking the horn. ... He just p***ed me off when he said that about the honking. It upset me.""

What happened then?

In the video, which has been widely viewed across various social media platforms, the officer can seen demanding that Charlebois provide identification.

Charlebois then exits his vehicle in order to retrieve his wallet from the back of his minivan to comply with the officer's demands, but things deteriorate from there.

A bystander can be heard heard off-camera demanding the officer stop badgering the elderly man and advising Charlebois to refuse compliance.

Charlebois, who appears to be confused or conflicted at this point, then appears to walk away from the officer, prompting the officer to grab the elderly man by his arm, twisting it behind his back in a hold.

The elderly man then falls hard onto one knee as the officer — along with a second responding officer — handcuffs him.

What else?

Charlebois' family said that their loved one didn't deserve the officer's rough treatment.

“He’s just 4-foot-10,” his son Steve told the Sun. “He wouldn’t hurt anybody.”

His other son, Gerald, added, ""I find it disgusting. There was no need to be so rough with him.""

Charlebois said he suffered several abrasions and contusions as a result of the detainment.

“I’m so sore,” he told the outlet, showing off cuts and bruises across his arms, hands, shoulder, and knee. “It hurts so much.”

Canadian journalist Joe Warmington shared footage of the exchange and tweeted, ""I spoke with him. He’s in pain. He’s 4 foot 10. A retired janitor with 11 grandkids, 4 great grandkids. If this disgraceful treatment of a 78 year old for honking his horn and a thumbs up to a trucker is acceptable to @JustinTrudeau @fordnation @JimWatsonOttawa no one is safe.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/breaking-san-francisco-archbishop-bars-speaker-nancy-pelosi-from-holy-communion,2022-02-09

The WHO says ‘burnout’ is now an official medical condition with 3 warning signs,"The World Health Organization has classified ""burnout"" as a clinical medical condition.

Wait, what is burnout?

As defined by the WHO, ""burnout"" is work related and is ""a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.""

The WHO explains that burnout has three components: feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and reduced professional efficacy.

The organization warns that burnout ""refers specifically to phenomena in the occupational context and should not be applied to describe experiences in other areas of life.""

Well. OK. Am I at risk for burnout?

According to Business Insider, physicians are at very high risk for experiencing burnout when compared to other American workers. Other high-stress professions are also at risk for experiencing burnout.

That doesn't necessarily mean that other American workers not in high-risk positions are exempt from experiencing burnout, however.

A CNN report explains that American psychologist Herbert Freudenberger coined the term ""burnout"" in 1974, and notes that severe cases of burnout often stem from depression.

So what are the 3 big things to look for?



Feeling exhausted, depleted, or otherwise completely worn down;

Increased mental and cognitive distance from your job, including feeling vastly negative and cynical about your job; and

A significantly reduced quality of work.

What are the risk factors for burnout?

According to Joe Robinson, a work-life balance trainer and speaker, there are six risk factors for burnout.

Work overload

Lack of control

Insufficient reward

Absence of fairness

Community

Conflicting values

California cancels high school sports until at least December,"The California Interscholastic Federation announced Monday that high school sports won't begin in the state until at least December because of COVID-19, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The announcement delays football, girls volleyball, cross country, boys water polo, girls golf, girls tennis, and field hockey until the winter or spring.

""This is the best possible plan we have with what's going on to give students an opportunity to participate,"" Vicky Lagos, commissioner of the Los Angeles City Section, said, according to the Times. ""There are going to be issues in terms of facilities and multiple-sport athletes, but this is the best scenario for the most people. I have confidence the schools and coaches will work it out among themselves. My take from coaches is they want the opportunity to participate and be with the kids.""

The new calendar means the football season will end in April, and basketball, baseball, and softball will all be concluding postseason championships in mid- to late-June.

The schedule will create numerous complications for athletes who are usually able to participate in multiple sports with little overlap or conflict, such as football and basketball, or football and track, for example. Coaches who are normally able to coach both boys and girls volleyball will have to make other arrangements.

Most California schools will start the academic year with online instruction, until they meet the strict guidelines set by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) that would allow them to reopen for in-person classes. Schools can't reopen in-person until their county has been off of a statewide monitoring list for rising COVID-19 infections for 14 days.

Currently, 31 out of California's 58 counties are on the monitoring list, leaving a majority of schools without the option to hold classes in-person to start the year.

Whenever schools can reopen in California, students third grade and above will be required to wear masks, and younger students will be encouraged, but not required, to wear a face covering of some kind.

Schools that have more than 5% of students sick will be forced to close, and districts with 25% or more schools closed within a two-week period will be forced to shut down.

The state reportedly is better prepared for online instruction than it was in the spring, when teachers were overwhelmed by the challenge of balancing their own home lives with teaching students through an unfamiliar method, and when some students didn't have access to the technology necessary to participate.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/burglar-armed-with-gun-enters-house-but-homeowner-has-gun-too-and-intruder-doesnt-make-it-out-alive,2020-07-21
"California fundraiser: Gavin Newsom is 'undeniably, unequivocally' running for president","A California fundraiser closely linked to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom told TheWrap that after the midterm elections, Newsom ""absolutely is going to announce that he is running for the presidency once Biden announces that he is not running.""

President Joe Biden recently cast doubt on whether he would seek reelection. In an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" which aired on September 18, the 79-year-old suggested that while he had previously indicated he would run again, ""it's just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen.""

A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll indicated that 54% of Americans disapprove of the president and that his favorability was dropping among Democrats as well as with Republicans.

A recent New York Times/Siena College poll found that 64% of Democrat voters would prefer someone other than Biden, the oldest president in American history, to run in 2024. The number of voters under the age of 30 keen on fresh blood is far higher, figuring at 94%.

High inflation, a disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, an unprecedented border crisis, and a long list of scandals together may dog Biden in the 2024 presidential race, in addition to the looming prospect of impeachment by a Republican-controlled House or removal via the 25th Amendment.

""Undeniably, unequivocally,"" said the fundraiser of Newsom's intentions. ""No ifs, ands or buts. He will run if Biden does not.""

A Los Angeles philanthropist entrenched in the Democratic Party similarly suggested that Newsom will run should Biden bow out.

Newsom survived a recall election in 2021, with 61.9% voting to keep him, and advanced from the Democratic primary on June 7 of this year. He once again faces a general election on November 8, this time facing Republican Brian Dahle, against whom he is expected to win.

Nevertheless, the California governor has recently been looking outside his state and making national plays for attention.

Newsom recently targeted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a potential opponent in the 2024 presidential election. On September 16, he challenged DeSantis to a debate, promising to bring his hair gel, which the Florida governor indicated had been ""interfering with his brain function.""

Newsom has also been advertising his California's fetal abattoirs in Republican-controlled states. Some of his billboards in Indiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, and elsewhere read ""You do not need to be a California resident to receive abortion services.""

In addition to serving as invitations to exterminate the unborn in his state, he indicated his rationale was that ""the people that support my candidacy support this.""

Newsom has also launched television ads, including one in Florida castigating DeSantis and former President Donald Trump, which stated ""Freedom, it's under attack in your state ... Republican leaders, they're banning books, making it harder to vote ... even criminalizing women and doctors.""

TheWrap reported that in addition to sending out feelers, Newsom may also be setting up the network and financial backing he would need for a presidential run. Over the summer, he reportedly spoke to a number of political consultants with minds to national elections.

Like Vice President Kamala Harris, Newsom has also recently been networking with deep-pocketed influencers and fundraisers. He met with Heather Podesta, a lobbyist and Democratic fundraiser, claiming he did so to support the Democratic Governors Association.

The Democratic field in 2024 may be populated with familiar faces, such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Sen. Bernie Sanders (Va.), and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.

If Newsom runs, he may also contend with Vice President Kamala Harris, who has indicated that Biden ""has been very clear that he intends to run again. And if he does, I will be running with him proudly.""

According to a recent Harvard Harris Poll, 50% of respondents found Harris unfavorable, whereas only 37% found her favorable.

Newsom's America

Newsom remains popular in California despite overseeing an energy crisis, an epidemic of fires, high crime, and markedly diminished freedoms.

Owing largely to state Democrats' energy policies, California's electric grid is highly unstable. The state relies heavily upon solar and renewable energy, although routine strains on the grid have prompted Newsom to keep California's last nuclear plant open.

Despite the government's antipathy for fossil fuels, the state has also had to burn more gas in recent years and ration electricity to avoid a recurrence of the rolling blackouts that left hundreds of thousands of residents in the dark for hours and days at a time in 2020.

Massive swaths of federal and nonfederal land have been consumed in California wildfires over the past several years. Although Newsom has argued that climate change is the culprit, he has been accused of transforming his state into ""a tinderbox waiting for a spark"" and of having ""failed to take care of forestry management in California.""

Minority Leader of the California State Assembly James Gallagher told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that the Newsom administration's refusal to stand up to ""big special interests in California [like] the Sierra Club,"" who don't want any trees cut, ""is the cause of these fires and is leading to people dying.""

As destructive as the wildfires have been, crime in Newsom's California has proved exceedingly more lethal. The chances of becoming a victim of a violent crime in the state are 1 in 227, and the likelihood of becoming a victim of a property crime is 1 in 47.

In 2021, there were 2,361 murders in California, setting the violent crime rate up to 466.2 per 100,000 from 437 the previous year. At the same time that murders were on the rise, arrests were falling, from 2,812.3 per 100,000 people in 2020 to 2,606.3 per 100,000 last year.

The streets are not only home to worsening violent crime. According to the California Health Care Foundation, as of 2020, there were at least 255,000 homeless persons in the state, up significantly from previous years.

The Public Policy Institute of California estimated there were at least 2.3 million illegal aliens living in California as of 2019, composing approximately 6% of the population.

Although Newsom has suggested in his messaging to voters in red states that their freedoms are under attack, California ranks #48 overall in the Cato Institute's ""Freedom in the 50 States"" index of personal and economic freedom.

William Ruger, vice president for research and policy at the Charles Koch Institute, and Jason Sorens, director of the Center for Ethics in Society at Saint Anselm College, authored the libertarian think tank's report, which stated, ""California is one of the least free states in the country, largely because of its long-standing poor performance on economic freedom.""

The report indicated that under Newsom, ""California is one of the highest-taxed states in the country ... one of the worst states on land-use freedom,"" home to the weakest gun rights in the country, and its freedoms have ""weakened consistently over time.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/burnout-is-now-an-official-medical-condition,2022-09-20
"California leaks gun owners' names, home addresses in massive privacy breach","California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Monday released private information on thousands of gun owners Monday in a major breach of privacy.

The California Department of Justice launched its 2022 Firearms Dashboard Portal Monday to ""improve transparency and information sharing for firearms-related data."" However, the website went live with publicly accessible files that included identifying information on Californians who hold concealed carry permits.

The leaked files included the gun owner's full name, home address, date of birth, and date their concealed weapons permit was issued, the Reload reported. It also showed the type of permit issued, indicating if the permit holder is a judge or member of law enforcement.

A database for Los Angeles County contained 244 judge permits, according to the Reload. These files contained the personal information of each permit holder. Additionally, there was data on seven custodial officers, 63 people with a place of employment permit, and 420 reserve officers.

Overall, 2,891 people in Los Angeles County with standard concealed carry licenses had their personal data compromised in the leak, the Reload reported.

Video reviewed by the outlet reportedly showed that the databases published by California's Department of Justice were easily downloaded from the website.



Posts on social media first called attention to the data leak. A Reddit thread posted by user lokiriver on Monday described how information on firearms safety certificates was also leaked, which included dates of birth and driver's license numbers belonging to gun owners.

As of Tuesday, California's firearms dashboard has been taken down and an error message appears when users attempt to visit the website.

""We are investigating an exposure of individuals’ personal information connected to the DOJ Firearms Dashboard. Any unauthorized release of personal information is unacceptable,"" the California Department of Justice told TheBlaze.

""We are working swiftly to address this situation and will provide additional information as soon as possible,"" the DOJ press office said.



In a press release announcing the launch of the firearms database, Attorney General Bonta said ""transparency"" is important to build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

“As news of tragic mass shootings continue to dominate the news cycle, leaving many with feelings of fear and uncertainty, we must do everything we can to prevent gun violence,"" Bonta said. ""One of my continued priorities is to better provide information needed to help advance efforts that strengthen California’s commonsense gun laws. Today’s announcement puts power and information into the hands of our communities by helping them better understand the role and potential dangers of firearms within our state.”

The press release said the California DOJ would ""balance its duties to provide gun violence and firearms data to support research efforts while protecting the personal identifying information in the data the Department collects and maintains.""



Gun rights activists with the California Rifle & Pistol Association blasted the data breach and told the Reload they were considering legal action against the state.

“Vindictive sore loser bureaucrats have endangered people’s lives and invited conflict by illegally releasing confidential private information,” Chuck Michel, CRPA president, said. “CRPA is working with several legislators and sheriffs to determine the extent of the damage caused by DOJ’s doxing of law abiding gun owners. Litigation is likely.”

California school district website tells kids that 'attacking whiteness is not enough' — and immediately deletes when it hits the fan,"A Riverside, California, school district drew criticism after its official website promoted an essay with a decidedly racialist stance.

What are the details?

According to the Federalist, the essay — titled ""Decentering Whiteness"" — is written by authors Jeff Hitchcock and Charley Flint.

In the essay, the authors state that ""attacking whiteness is not enough"" when it comes to dismantling white supremacy and noted that it takes all walks of life to cut down whiteness.

The report added that the district referenced the essay at least three times throughout the website, under subsections including ""Professional Learning,"" ""Community Engagement,"" and ""Culture and Climate.""

All references at the time were reportedly found under the webpage's Equity, Access, and Community Engagement resources page.

All instances pointing to the essay, however, have been scrubbed from the site at the time of this reporting.

The removed document, the Federalist reported, condemned whiteness and explained tactics for whiteness itself to be ""made more marginal.

“Decentering whiteness, as we envision it, is a collective process that can take place in organizations, sectors of society, personal lives, etc., over periods of days, months, years and generations,"" a portion of the document read. The document also encourages people to assume that ""whiteness, and race, always structures our experience.""

""[S]imply attacking whiteness is not enough to accomplish this goal [of deconstructing whiteness],"" the document continued. ""Assaults on whiteness, depending on their nature, may have the effect of confirming and solidifying the central position of whiteness in American society.""

The Federalist added, ""Perhaps most sinister, 'Decentering Whiteness' clearly sought to encourage racial division and even racial conflict, calling on a multiracial coalition to 'displace' whiteness. It read 'It will take a multiracial effort to displace whiteness, one that includes people from all racial/cultural groups.'""

What else?

Communications director Diana Meza told the outlet that the district was in the process of ""updating the Equity, Access & Community Engagement Google site and landing page.""

""The page should be back up soon,"" Meza added when reached for comment about the inexplicable disappearance of ""Decentering Whiteness"" references.

Bari Weiss rips cancel culture on Real Time with Bill Maher,"Former New York Times opinion editor Bari Weiss ripped cancel culture and had some parting shots at her former employer during her appearance on ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" on Friday.

""We're used to criticism. Criticism is kosher in the work that we do,"" Weiss told Bill Maher. ""Criticism is great. What cancel culture is about is not criticism. It is about punishment. It is about making a person radioactive. It is about taking away their job.""

""The writer Jonathan Rauch [of The Atlantic] called it social murder. And I think that's right,"" she said.

""It's not just about punishing the sinner. It's not just about punishing the person for being insufficiently pure,"" Weiss explained. ""It's about this sort of secondary boycott of people who would deign to speak to that person or appear on a platform with that person.""

""And we see just very obviously where that kind of politics gets us,"" she continued. ""If conversation with people that we disagree with becomes impossible, what is the way that we solve conflict? It's violence.""



""That's an enormous problem because what it's meant is the collapse of moderates,"" the former Times writer said. ""It's meant the collapse of the center and the retribalization of this country and the whole deal with this country, the reason that it's exceptional with all of its flaws is because we depart from history.""

""We say that clannishness, tribalism, that we can overcome that, that there's something bigger than lineage or kin or the political tribe we belong to,"" she said on the HBO talk show. ""And I think what we're seeing right now, and it's a very scary moment, is a kind of returning to the mean of history. And I think it is up to us to defend the ideas that made this country unique and a departure of history.""

Weiss said that ""politics has come to supplant religion,"" where people on the right see President Donald Trump as a ""deity,"" and people on the left who believe ""anything less than defunding the police or abolish the police to choose the issue of the day, makes you something like a heretic.""

Weiss resigned from The New York Times last month with a scathing public letter to publisher A.G. Sulzberger. Weiss wrote that her ""forays into Wrongthink have made me the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views."" She alleges that coworkers called her a ""Nazi and a racist,"" making for a ""hostile work environment.""

""Still other New York Times employees publicly smear me as a liar and a bigot on Twitter with no fear that harassing me will be met with appropriate action,"" she wrote. ""Showing up for work as a centrist at an American newspaper should not require bravery.""

Weiss also talked about her fiery departure from the New York Times, and provided some criticisms of the newspaper of record.

""The reason that Twitter is the assigning editor of The New York Times is because the printing press isn't the printing press anymore. It's because the printing press is in each one of our pockets,"" Weiss said.



""To do our job well, writers and editors, we need to have a level of bravery and thick skin and fearlessness,"" she said. ""And when you're living in fear of an online mob, you know, all it takes is a dozen people to repeat a lie about you — that you're a racist, that you're a transphobe, that you're a bigot — for that lie to become true and that's extremely dangerous.""

This week's episode of ""Real Time"" also featured Harper's Magazine columnist Thomas Chatterton Williams, who was one of 150 liberal writers, journalists, and academics who signed an open letter calling for an end to cancel culture. Others who signed the open letter include Weiss, ""Harry Potter"" creator J.K. Rowling, philosopher Noam Chomsky, and feminist Gloria Steinem.

""What strikes me about it is the pushback is coming from liberals and almost everyone who signs this letter ... is a liberal!"" Maher said. ""Bari, the fact that you -- they call you a centrist or right-winger! I mean, if a hip, millennial, Jewish bisexual girl living in San Francisco is not a liberal ... who is these days?""



""What we're trying to say with the letter – and what Thomas did in forming it – was saying what's happening now with this growing culture of illiberalism is different from criticism,"" Weiss stated.

Williams said that ""cancellation"" isn't about ""bringing down elites back to Earth"" but instead causes an ""onlooker effect"" that has ""a chilling and stifling and narrowing influence on all of our behaviors.""

'To those who have tried to assassinate my character: I love you': Candace Cameron Bure responds to backlash after saying network 'will keep traditional marriage at the core',"Actress Candace Cameron Bure has issued a statement explaining that she loves everyone, including people who attack her online and attempt to smear her character.

Bure recently came under fire after telling the Wall Street Journal that Great American Family, a media network she is involved with that produces family-friendly content, will focus on traditional marriage.

When asked whether she anticipates the cable channel featuring homosexual couples as leads in holiday films, Bure said no, according to the outlet. ""I think that Great American Family will keep traditional marriage at the core,"" Bure said, according to the Journal, which reported that the actress is the chief creative officer of Great American Family.

""It's certainly the year 2022, so we’re aware of the trends,"" Great American Family CEO Bill Abbott said. ""There's no whiteboard that says, 'Yes, this' or 'No, we'll never go here.'""

Hilarie Burton Morgan accused Bure and Abbott of being bigots and called them both ""disgusting.""

Bure issued a lengthy statement responding to the uproar about her comment regarding Great American Family content.

""All of you who know me, know beyond question that I have great love and affection for all people,"" Bure said in the statement. ""It absolutely breaks my heart that anyone would ever think I intentionally would want to offend and hurt anyone.""

The actress said that she loves everyone, including those who besmirch her.

""I am a devoted Christian. Which means that I believe that every human being bears the image of God. Because of that, I am called to love all people, and I do. If you know me, you know that I am a person who loves fiercely and indiscriminately. My heart yearns to build bridges and bring people one step closer to God, to love others well, and to simply be a reflection of God's huge love for all of us,"" Bure noted.

""To the members of the media responsible for using this opportunity to fan flames of conflict and hate, I have a simple message: I love you anyway. To those who hate what I value and who are attacking me online: I love you. To those who have tried to assassinate my character: I love you. To everyone reading this of any race, creed, sexuality, or political party, including those who have tried to bully me with name-calling, I love you,"" she said in the statement.

""I have long wanted to find a home for more faith-based programming. I am grateful to be an integral part of a young and growing network. I had also expressed in my interview, which was not included, that people of all ethnicities and identities have and will continue to contribute to the network in great ways both in front of and behind the camera, which I encourage and fully support,"" Bure noted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-school-district-website-tells-kids-that-attacking-whiteness-is-not-enough,2022-11-17
"Caravan migrant makes it across border, gives birth in U.S.","A Honduran woman who traveled with a migrant caravan from her home country to the U.S. border successfully entered the country illegally and gave birth to her child on U.S. soil, according to KNSD-TV.

The mother is 19-year-old Maryury Serrano Hernandez. She left Honduras on Oct. 17 with her husband and son and was taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol on Nov. 26.

The family attempted to cross illegally because they said they didn't feel safe in Tijuana, where many of the locals are not happy about the thousands of migrants awaiting asylum in their city.

Hernandez was taken to the hospital the next day after reporting stomach pains, and her child was born the next day in a San Diego hospital — and is a U.S. citizen by birthright. She said she felt ""like a criminal"" while resting in the hospital, closely watched by CBP agents.

Now, the family of four has been released into the United States as they wait for their asylum request to be heard by a judge. An American woman they connected with through a migrant rights non-profit has agreed to house them.

Hernandez said giving birth to her son in the U.S. was a ""big reward"" for the long and difficult journey.

""Thank God she did her part, but there were times we stayed until the last [of the caravan],"" her husband, Miguel, said.

This family's story is an example of what many migrants hoped for when they set out on the weekslong journey to the United States — to get across the border into the U.S., request asylum, and be allowed to wait for their hearing in the United States.

When they got to the border, however, they were made to wait in Mexico, where their presence has been a source of conflict with Tijuana residents who have to find a place for them. Migrants may have to wait months before their asylum claims are heard, and some have opted to turn and go back home rather than wait in a hostile environment in Mexico.

It's also an example of what President Donald Trump said he wanted to prevent by ending birthright citizenship via executive order, something legal scholars disagree on whether he has the authority to do.

"Catholic priest becomes transgender woman, leaves priesthood: 'I've still got God's support ... I can feel that'","Alisha Cacace often felt like a female trapped in a male's body, BarcroftTV reported.

The 37-year-old who hails from Basingstoke in England grew up in a Catholic family and — despite the internal gender conflict — decided to enter the priesthood as an adult, the outlet said.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

""God calls you and you like and love it, and you then experience it, you look more into it, deeper into it,"" Cacace told BarcroftTV. ""The deeper you look the more prayer you do, the better you feel. My whole life was devoted to the church.""

'The best thing I've ever done was change over'

The outlet said Cacace visited an LGBT bar with a friend and saw how happy the people were there.

""I knew I was a female trapped in a male's body from a very young age; I was just pushing it to one side,"" Cacace added to BarcroftTV. ""Seeing others happy was great, and that really set a spark off in my mind.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

And with that, ""after six years of struggling"" with gender identity, Cacace came out as transgender and left the clergy, the outlet said.

""Once you face that fear and do it, you feel a lot better in yourself,"" Cacace told BarcroftTV. ""The best thing I've ever done was change over; I don't think I could ever kind of go back.""

The former priest has been on hormone replacement therapy for a year and has never been happier, the outlet added.

'I've still got God's support'

And while Cacace kept priestly garments, BarcroftTV said there was no consideration of remaining a priest.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

""I'm kind of out of that frame of mind of being a clergy member and into the frame of mind of being a transgender girl and focusing on the new life,"" Cacace added to the outlet

But even as a transgender woman, Cacace regularly practices the Catholic religion, BarcroftTV said.

""I've still got God's support, definitely still have God's support. I can feel that,"" Cacace also told the outlet. ""I'm at that point in my life where this is my life.

CBS rejects medical marijuana Super Bowl ad,"CBS will not permit a medical marijuana company to run an ad during the upcoming 2019 Super Bowl.

Super Bowl LIII, which will feature the Los Angeles Rams against the New England Patriots, is set for Feb. 3 in Atlanta.

What are the details?

According to USA Today Sports, Acreage Holdings said it created a 60-second ad spot and pitched it to CBS for consideration to run during the Super Bowl.

The company — which grows, processes, and dispenses marijuana for medical use — said that the ad featured three individuals who used medical marijuana and detailed how the drug positively impacted their lives.

This isn't the first time Acreage Holdings has made headlines: In 2018, the company added former House Speaker John Boehner (R) to its board.

Acreage Holdings told USA Today that CBS rejected the ad, however, saying that the network does not currently accept such ads.

A CBS spokesperson told the outlet, ""CBS will not be accepting any ads for medical marijuana at this time.""

Acreage Holdings President George Allen said that he's not shocked that CBS denied the company's ad proposal.

""We're not particularly surprised that CBS and/or the NFL rejected the content,"" Allen said. ""And that is actually less a statement about them and more we think a statement about where we stand right now in this country.""

Allen said that it was a feat to maintain a balance in respecting the ""complex fabric of state and federal policy, much of which conflicts.""

What is the ad about?

Harris Damashek, the company's chief marketing officer, said that the proposed advertisement was really more of a ""public service announcement"" rather than an advertisement.

""We're not marketing any of our products or retail in this spot,"" Damashek explained.

The outlet reported that the 60-second ad featured a young boy from Colorado who used medical marijuana to stop his daily debilitating seizures. The ad also featured a New York state man who opted to use medical marijuana instead of opioids after a back surgery 15 years ago wreaked havoc on his life. Also, the ad featured a California military veteran who uses the drug to combat pain after losing a portion of his leg during service.

The ad calls for U.S. citizens to phone their state representatives and senators to call for uniform change in the state and federal legality of medical marijuana.

The ad has yet to be posted online, but Damashek said once it is refined, it will be out there for public consumption.

""[W]e anticipate and look forward to getting the message out far and wide,"" Damashek added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/caravan-migrant-makes-it-across-border-gives-birth-in-u-s,2019-01-22
CDC director admits hospitals have monetary 'incentive' to inflate coronavirus death count,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Robert Redfield admitted last week that American hospitals may have monetary incentive to inflate coronavirus death counts.

During a hearing by the House Oversight and Reform Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis on Friday, Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.) asked whether hospitals have ""perverse incentive"" to inflate COVID-19 fatality numbers.

Shockingly, Redfield admitted that they do.

""I think you're correct in that we've seen this in other disease processes, too,"" Redfield said.

""Really, in the HIV epidemic, somebody may have a heart attack but also have HIV — the hospital would prefer the [classification] for HIV because there's greater reimbursement,"" he explained. ""So, I do think there's some reality to that.""



""When it comes to death reporting, though, ultimately, it's how the physician defines it in the death certificate, and … we review all of those death certificates. So I think, probably it is less operable in the cause of death, although I won't say there are not some cases,"" he continued. ""I do think though [that] when it comes to hospital reimbursement issues or individuals that get discharged, there could be some play in that for sure.""

Debate has raged over whether coronavirus deaths are being counted accurately, and various studies have found conflicting conclusions.

More from the Washington Examiner:

A Yale study concluded that the overall coronavirus death toll in the United States is a ""substantial undercount"" of the actual number; White House coronavirus response team member Dr. Deborah Birx suggested in May that deaths are being overcounted by 25%.



There appear to be cases where the opposite has happened. An investigation in Florida found that several deaths were wrongly attributed to the virus, including the case of a man who died from a gunshot wound to the head.



The CDC's website lists over 3,700 coronavirus deaths characterized as ""intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning and other adverse events."" In Texas, more than 3,000 people were recently removed from the overall coronavirus count because they were never actually tested but considered ""probable"" cases.

Still, it may never be possible to get an accurate count of deaths or cases, considering not everyone who contracts the disease is tested.

Indeed, antibody tests continually show that a significant portion of the population has likely contracted COVID-19, yet never knew they had the virus.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/catholic-priest-becomes-transgender-woman-leaves-priesthood,2020-08-02
CDC director warns COVID 'just a few mutations' away from rendering vaccines ineffective while defending restrictions,"Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, claimed Tuesday that COVID-19 is ""just a few mutations"" away from rendering COVID vaccines completely ineffective.

The suggestion caused some to warn of a ""feedback loop"" of unending COVID-related restrictions.

What did Walensky say?

While speaking with media to defend the CDC's updated guidance that fully vaccinated Americans who live in regions with high transmission rates of COVID-19 should wear face masks, Walensky suggested COVID-19 may become so genetically mutated that current vaccines may no longer be effective against it.

Walensky was responding to a question about why vaccinated people should have to wear face masks to protect Americans who choose not to become vaccinated.

""Your point is well taken about those who have made the choice to not get vaccinated and the amount of virus that is circulating in this country right now,"" Walensky began. ""So for the amount of viruses circulating in this country, largely among unvaccinated people, the largest concern that I think we in public health and science are worried about is that virus and the potential mutations away we are from a very transmissible virus that has the potential to evade our vaccine, in terms of how it protects us from severe disease and death.

""Right now, fortunately, we are not there. These vaccines operate really well in protecting us about severe forms of severe disease and death,"" she continued. ""But the big concern is that the next variant that might emerge, just a few mutations potentially away, could potentially evade our vaccine.""

""So vaccinated people need to mask because of hypothetical future mutations? Seriously I used to roll my eyes when people would say s**t like 'they just want to control you,' but how the f*** else do you interpret this trend?"" Noam Blum of Tablet Magazine reacted.

""There is a self-reinforcing feedback loop that will applaud the rationale and ignore the contradictory messaging. But this statement is in conflict with itself, and no amount of table pounding will resolve it,"" conservative writer Noah Rothman said.

Anything else?

The messages coming from Walensky are, indeed, confusing.

During an interview Wednesday on CNN, Walensky said the vaccinated can infect the vaccinated, yet maintained the spike in cases has been caused by unvaccinated people. She also essentially endorsed vaccine passports, saying they ""may very well be a path forward.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cbs-rejects-medical-marijuana-super-bowl-ad,2021-07-28
"'Young Turks' host Cenk Uygur rails against Biden for reportedly planning to not prosecute Trump: 'Who are you going to unify with, QAnon?'","Cenk Uygur, founder and host of ""The Young Turks,"" bitterly blasted former Vice President Joe Biden after Biden reportedly said that he hopes to avoid any attempt to prosecute President Donald Trump.

According to a recent NBC News report, multiple sources close to Biden's team say he's reluctant to launch an investigation into Trump, worrying that such a move will increase the growing divide between American Democrats and Republicans.

What are the details?



In a video published Tuesday, Uygur said, ""The historical context all led to the conclusion that Biden was going to do this. The Obama-Biden administration, as soon as they got into office, said, 'We look forward, we don't look backwards.' Well, that's a great relief to all the criminals, because all the crimes are in the past, not in the future. ... That's why Obama didn't hold Bush and Cheney accountable for breaking several laws, including torture and warrantless wiretapping.""

Uygur added, ""Who are you going to unify with, QAnon? Fifty percent of the Republican Party believes that the Democratic Party is led by child molesters. Fifty percent. And who leads the Democratic Party now? Joe Biden does. So, he's like, 'I want to unite with the people who called me a child molester.' Why would you do that? That makes no sense at all.""

Ana Kasparian, ""Young Turks"" co-host, added, ""If you care about protecting our democratic processes, which Donald Trump has worked very hard to dismantle, wouldn't you want to look into that? Wouldn't you want to investigate that? They're trying to steal the election from Biden right now as we speak. But no — we've got to unify. As if that's ever going to happen.""

Uygur pointed out that Biden is only shooting himself in the foot if he opts to avoid conflict with Trump, whom Uygur says has a ""death lock"" on the minds of Republicans:

Is it going to work? That if Biden just wants to move on from Trump, that Trump will go, 'Oh, OK, yeah, sure, let's move on,' and then all the Republicans in the country will say, 'Oh, no, we don't care about Trump any more, even though he can decide unilaterally whether we win or lose our primaries, whether we keep our power or not?' [Trump] hasn't lost that power at all. Ninety-three percent of Republicans voted for him, and he has an absolute death lock on their minds. It's not the Republican Party — it's the Trump Party. Wakey, wakey, Joe Biden. Trump is not going to go away.

Chao responds to Trump's 'Coco Chow' attacks,"Trump-era transportation secretary Elaine Chao has issued a statement addressing the repeated attacks of former President Donald Trump, who has been calling her ""Coco Chow.""

""When I was young, some people deliberately misspelled or mispronounced my name. Asian Americans have worked hard to change that experience for the next generation,"" Chao said in a statement, according to Politico. ""He doesn't seem to understand that, which says a whole lot more about him than it will ever say about Asian Americans.""

Chao, who is the wife of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), served as transportation secretary during most of Trump's White House tenure but resigned on the heels of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

In a message to colleagues announcing her resignation, Chao wrote, ""Our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the President stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed. As I'm sure is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.""

In posts on Truth Social, Trump has referred to Chao as McConnell's ""domineering, China loving BOSS, I mean wife, Coco Chow"" and as the senator's ""China flagrant boss, Coco Chow.""

""Does Coco Chow have anything to do with Joe Biden’s Classified Documents being sent and stored in Chinatown?￼"" Trump asked in another post. ""Her husband, the Old Broken Crow, is VERY close to Biden, the Democrats, and, of course, China. He gives them all whatever they want!""

Politico reported that Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said via a statement that Trump's criticism focuses on Chao's family's possible financial conflicts, but not on the issue of race.

""People should stop feigning outrage and engaging in controversies that exist only in their heads,"" Cheung said, according to the outlet. ""What’s actually concerning is her family's deeply troubling ties to Communist China, which has undermined American economic and national security.""

Dave Chappelle will join 'Netflix Is a Joke' Fest despite LGBTQ controversy,"Dave Chappelle is having no problems finding work since the release of his Netflix special ""The Closer,"" and it doesn't seem he will be having the trouble any time soon, as his next gig was just announced.

""Netflix Is a Joke"" is a huge comedy festival that will play some of the biggest venues in Los Angeles and feature some of the biggest names in comedy today.

The festival had been initially scheduled for March 2, 2020, but had to be rescheduled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The new dates for the festival are now set for April 29-May 8, 2022.

Along with Chappelle, the event will feature such big names as Kevin Hart, Jamie Foxx, Bill Burr, Amy Schumer, Gabriel Iglesias, David Letterman, Sebastian Maniscalco, Jerry Seinfeld, and a host of other comedians.

""We were so disappointed to postpone the event last spring and our line-up of comedians can’t wait to bring much needed laughs to audiences in LA and around the world on Netflix,"" said Robbie Praw, Netflix's stand-up and comedy formats director, to Deadline.

Since the release of Chappelle's latest special, ""The Closer,"" back in October, the world-famous funnyman has been the subject of some controversy, accused of being anti-LGBTQ. This same controversy appeared to cause some internal conflict within the staff at Netflix, which resulted in the firing of an employee who allegedly leaked confidential data pertaining to ""The Closer"" and organized an employee walkout in protest of Chappelle following accusations that the comedian was ""homophobic"" and ""transphobic.""

The accusations and controversy surrounding Chappelle and the LGBT community have not affected his relationship with the streaming service. Netflix CEO Tim Sandros defended Chappelle in a company memo, calling him ""one of the most popular stand-up comedians today"" and saying, ""As with our other talent, we work hard to support their creative freedom.""

Chappelle's headlining of the ""Netflix Is a Joke"" festival seems to be evidence that the platform is sticking by Chappelle and its commitment to work with him.

In addition to the Netflix gig, Chappelle just wrapped up a tour promoting his film ""Dave Chappelle: Live in Real Life."" The film was directed by Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert, according to Deadline.



Tickets for the event will be on sale starting December 10, 2022.

The performances will be filmed to stream on Netflix at a later date, according to Deadline.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cenk-uygur-rails-against-biden-prosecute-trump,2021-12-07
Charlottesville replaces Thomas Jefferson birthday celebration with holiday recognizing slave emancipation,"With the city still feeling the after-effects of the violent Unite the Right rally in 2017, the Charlottesville, Virginia, city council voted Monday to discontinue its annual celebration of Thomas Jefferson's birthday, according to the Associated Press.

Instead, the city will replace the April 13 holiday with a March 3 holiday to recognize the emancipation of enslaved African-Americans, calling it ""Liberation and Freedom Day.""

March 3 ""commemorates that day in 1865 when Gen. Phillip Sheridan's troops rolled through town and found a population that was majority African American—and although emancipation for most of them probably didn't occur on that day, it was the opening salvo for a lot of Charlottesvillians' freedom,"" according to Hawes Spencer, a reporter from Charlottesville.

The elimination of Jefferson's holiday is notable for the city, as the founding father and author of the Declaration of Independence founded the University of Virginia, which is located in Charlottesville.

Although Jefferson holds an esteemed and essential place in American history, public sentiment has increasingly turned against public recognition of historical figures who owned slaves or who fought for the Confederate States of America in the Civil War.

In Charlottesville in 2017, much of the conflict during the protests centered on whether or not Confederate monuments should be removed from public display.

The city council voted 4-1 to eliminate the Jefferson celebration.

""Thomas Jefferson already has 365 holidays and I do think that is the case here in Charlottesville,"" said councilman Wes Bellamy, according to WHSV-TV. ""You literally can't go anywhere within our city without hearing or seeing a reminder of Thomas Jefferson.""

""Doing away with Thomas Jefferson's birthday doesn't do away with the history,"" another councilor, Kathy Galvin, said. Galvin was the only ""no"" vote. ""That birthday is still here. What he has done in the past is there.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chao-responds-to-trump-attacks,2019-07-03
Univ. of Chicago activist group advises students not to call the cops when they witness someone stealing,"Activists at the University of Chicago are hoping to abolish the local police department by instructing students not to alert law enforcement when crimes are committed.

UChicago United, a coalition of activist groups at the university, wrote in its annual ""Dis-Orientation"" guide that ""a fundamental step to the abolishment of the police is the abolishment of the practice of calling the police.""

""When we call the police, we are perpetuating the notion that there is no other alternative but to rely on them to resolve a wide range of conflicts or handle emergencies they are not trained to address,"" the coalition said, adding that calling the police can often have ""dangerous consequences.""

According to the activists, some of the emergencies that police are not trained to handle are theft and harassment.



In a compiled list of ""tips"" for de-escalating situations, the activists advise students in this way:

1. Pause and assess: Let's say you see someone stealing. Are you or anyone around you in any danger? Don't prioritize defending private property ... over ensuring people's safety. If no one is in danger, move on. Are you experiencing fear or discomfort? It's important to distinguish between being genuinely concerned for your well-being and feeling uncomfortable. It is also equally important to identify if these feelings of discomfort are a result of prejudice or internal biases.



2. Communicate: If someone around you is disturbing others or having a crisis, ask them if you can speak to them in a private setting to prevent the situation from escalating. Ask them if they are okay and whether there is anything you can do to help ...



3. Ask for help: Sometimes we aren't able to handle a situation on our own, and that's ok ... Is there someone around that you and the person you are with can both trust to handle the situation without calling the police? ...

Elsewhere in the booklet, UChicago United suggests that it has become ""increasingly clear"" that police in America ""serve to protect only the most rich and privileged"" and ""terrorize the most vulnerable and marginalized.""

But it's not just the police that terrorize minorities and serve the wealthy, the university itself is ""a racial-capitalist, imperialist, colonial, heterosexist institution that is guided by white supremacist curriculum and and need to accumulate capital — no matter the cost.""

According to its Facebook profile, UChicago United is a ""coalition of multicultural student organizations formed to make the University of Chicago campus more inclusive for students of marginalized backgrounds and identities.""

Chicago church of immigrants to hold Memorial Day-themed service this Sunday in defiance of state's harsh lockdown orders,"A Chicago church plans to hold a Memorial Day-themed service this Sunday in defiance of the state's lockdown orders.

Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church, which held services last Sunday despite Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker's stay-at-home order, will host a service again this Sunday in support of religious freedom.

Pritzker recently announced a plan to reopen the state, but the plan banned churches with over 50 people from gathering until there is a vaccine, highly effective treatment, or elimination of any new cases — criteria that could take more than a year.

Preaching during the service will be HIS Church Pastor Brian Gibson, who last week launched ""Peaceably Gather,"" an initiative that calls on religious institutions nationwide to safely reopen for worship gatherings. Also joining the service will be local pastor Joseph Wyrostek, who leads Metro Praise International Chicago's Belmont Cragin neighborhood.

In a video announcing his attendance at the service, Gibson said, ""We picked this church because this is a church of immigrants ... an immigrant community that came to America looking to escape a totalitarian government.

""They come to America, [and] what do they find?"" asked Gibson rhetorically. ""They found more restriction, they find religious targeting. They find that the Walmart, the Lowe's, and the liquor stores can all be open, but the church can't.

""The one thing that separates us from nations without freedom is our Constitution,"" Gibson said at the video's opening.

Peaceably Gather | Memorial Day Promo youtu.be

Since the start of the outbreak, churches and other religious institutions across the country have been in conflict with state and local leaders who have ordered worship gatherings to cease in order to combat the spread of the coronavirus.



Last month, Attorney General William Barr warned state and local leaders in a statement to be careful not to violate the constitutional rights of Americans to assemble and worship while enforcing social distancing measures.

Later in April, Barr instructed federal prosecutors to specifically ""be on the lookout"" for such constitutional violations, adding that ""the Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis.""

In a news release, Peaceably Gather said that thousand of churches around the country have joined the movement to safely reopen since the launch of the effort.

Chicago cops pull over internal affairs chief's car; niece behind wheel reportedly says 'My auntie’s probably your boss' after passenger tries ditching 84 heroin packets,"When Chicago police on Feb. 1 pulled over a Lexus belonging to Yolanda Talley, their new chief of internal affairs, Talley wasn't in the vehicle — but her niece was, along with a male passenger who tried to ditch 84 packets of heroin valued at $6,300, the Chicago Sun-Times reported, citing police records and a source familiar with the investigation.

What's more, Talley's niece — who was behind the wheel — told cops ""my auntie’s probably your boss,” the source noted to the Sun-Times.

What else?

The traffic stop in the 500 block of North St. Louis Avenue occurred after officers in a gang investigations unit targeting drug sales spotted a man in a black mask picking up a bag near a black SUV and entering the passenger side of a four-door silver Lexus, the paper said in a previous story, citing a police report.

Officers said they stopped the car because the driver failed to use a turn signal, the Sun-Times said, adding that the passenger tossed a baggie containing 84 pink packets of heroin out of the window. Police said they recovered about 42 grams of heroin worth about $6,300, the paper said.

Police arrested the passenger — 34-year-old Kenneth Miles — for possession of a controlled substance, a felony, the paper said. But Talley’s niece was let go because there wasn’t clear evidence linking her to the heroin, the source told the Sun-Times.

Court records indicate that Talley's niece lives with Miles, the paper said, adding that he's a reputed member of the Traveling Vice Lords street gang and that court records show he has a lengthy criminal record that includes seven drug-related convictions.

Miles on Feb. 1 was free on bail in connection to a separate felony case for allegedly selling fentanyl, the Sun-Times said, adding that the Cook County sheriff’s office said he was being held in jail without bail.

In addition, Miles reportedly provided police with bad information that led to a botched raid at the home of Anjanette Young in 2019, WGN-TV reported, citing sources and police records.

The Civilian Office of Police Accountability in November published a report recommending suspensions for seven officers involved in the raid, the station said, adding that City Council in December approved a $2.9 million settlement in Young’s lawsuit stemming from the raid.

What happened to the car?

Following conversations between high-ranking police officials, a decision was made not to impound Talley's car, even though that's the routine procedure for cars stopped during narcotics arrests so they can be searched for guns and drugs, the paper said.

With that, officers drove Talley’s Lexus back to the block where the arrest took place and returned the keys to her niece, the source told the Sun-Times.

One day after the traffic stop, involved officers were taken off the street for training with no further explanation, the Sun-Times said, adding that the source said it was apparent “punishment.”

“This was in direct response to this incident,” the source also noted to the paper, adding that all the officers are expected to return to normal duty next week.

The Sun-Times — citing a high-ranking police official — also reported that pulling those officers from the street is a decision that only could have come from Superintendent David Brown, First Deputy Superintendent Eric Carter, or Chief Ernest Cato.

Still, the source added to the paper that “knowing what we know, I don’t think Chief Yolanda Talley had any idea what was going on with her car.""

What did Chicago police have to say about it all?

Police spokesman Don Terry said Tuesday that the incident involving Talley’s car has been referred to the city’s office of the inspector general in order to avoid a conflict of interest due to Talley's role as chief of internal affairs, which involves investigating misconduct allegations against other officers, the Sun-Times said.

The paper added in its initial story that Talley didn't respond to its email seeking comment. Terry declined to answer its questions, the Sun-Times also said.

Talley was promoted to chief of internal affairs in December, the Sun-Times said, adding that prior to that she was deputy chief of recruitment and retention and a deputy chief in charge of district commanders on the South Side.

The paper said Talley’s been a rising star in the department and that many police sources have indicated they believe she's being groomed for an even higher position, such as first deputy superintendent — the No. 2 spot in the department — if Carter retires.

Here's Talley in a CPD video titled ""Be the Change,"" aimed at police recruitment, which was posted to YouTube prior to her promotion to internal affairs chief:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-activists-do-not-call-police,2022-02-23
Chicago pastor claims the mayor sent armed police in unmarked cars to bang on the church doors Sunday: It was ‘like the Soviet-styled KGB’,"Chicago Pastor Courtney Lewis said he was in the middle of delivering a sermon to his congregation Sunday when he heard loud banging on the church doors. It was the police sent by the city's Democratic Mayor Lori Lightfoot.

Lightfoot had allegedly dispatched officers in three squad cars along with two unmarked vehicles in order to shut down the service at Cornerstone Baptist Church, Lewis claimed in a letter of grievance to U.S. Attorney John Lausch.

""Like the Soviet-styled KGB they knocked on our locked doors,"" Lewis said, noting that the church refused to let them in.

""The only thing she hasn't done yet is beat the doors down and arrest our members,"" he added.

Religious institutions in Illinois are still barred from gathering in groups of over 10 people under the state's strict reopening plan. But churchgoers in the state believe their constitutional right to freely gather and worship is being unfairly burdened. Several churches, including Cornerstone Baptist have begun holding services again in defiance of the state and local orders.

""Mayor Lightfoot is defiant of the [U.S.] Constitution and our freedom to worship,"" Lewis wrote in the letter.

The pastor told Todd Starnes' radio show that when the officers banged on the door, the men of the church were instructed not to open them per a safety protocol.

""Thankfully our doors were locked as a normal safety precaution we take each service to protect our members from the escalating gun violence in Chicago,"" he said.

Lewis also told the radio program that an usher who was positioned outside of the church during the service observed the officers approach the building and begin taking pictures. One of the individuals in an unmarked car had reportedly been photographing churchgoers as they arrived at the church.

""The mayor wants to educate everyone into compliance — which means intimidate,"" Lewis told the radio program.

The pastor added that his small congregation has gone above and beyond to maintain health and safety during the coronavirus pandemic, including conducting online services and outdoor services for a time and practicing social distancing requirements. The church is also taking members' temperatures on their way in and not allowing the elderly to attend services.

""We are trying to follow the laws of man as much as reasonably possible but when the laws of man conflict with the laws of God I as a Pastor have a duty to follow the laws of God,"" Lewis wrote in the letter to Lausch, in which he requested ""the assistance of our President and our justice department in correcting the grave miscarriage of the law.""

Last week, Mayor Lightfoot requested that churches wait to hold services until she slowly reopens the city in June. Lightfoot said that she's focused on making sure people can celebrate their faith in a safe way.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-church-peaceably-gather-memorial-day,2020-05-26
Chicago PD releases Jussie Smollett texts with Nigerian brothers involved in hoax hate crime,"Chicago police released text messages and other records related to the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax case, revealing more about the communication the ""Empire"" star had with the Nigerian brothers who were allegedly in on the scheme, according to the Daily Beast.

In the months leading up to the incident, Smollett exchanged texts with Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo seeking to purchase drugs from them, including ecstasy, marijuana, and cocaine. Smollett paid them for the drugs using PayPal and Venmo.

A conspicuous message occurred in January when Smollett texted them ""Might need your help on the low. You around to meet up and talk face to face?""

After that message, Smollett picked up one of the brothers and drove to their apartment. Police say they conducted a practice run of the hoax assault the next morning, and that Smollett told them to call him ""Empire f****t"" and ""Empire n****r"" while beating him up.

Smollett allegedly paid the brothers $3,500 by check and wrote that the check was for a nutrition and fitness program.

The documents released by Chicago PD also detail how uncooperative Smollett was during the investigation, refusing to look at photos of potential suspects and refusing to turn over his phone or submit to DNA testing.

While Smollett's charges for filing a false police report were dropped, the legal fallout from the case continues. The Osundairo brothers are suing Smollett's attorney, Mark Geragos, for defamation.

The city of Chicago is suing in an attempt to get $130,000 back for overtime pay incurred during the investigation. And, a judge is petitioning for the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's handling of the case, including the bewildering decision to suddenly drop all 16 charges against Smollett and potential conflicts of interest due to communications Foxx may have had with the Smollett family and associates.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-internal-affairs-chief-niece-car,2019-05-31
"Chicago Public Schools cave, allow teachers to continue to teach remotely for an additional 48 hours","Chicago Public Schools has failed to follow through on its threat to lock any teachers who refused to report to classrooms on Monday out of their remote learning platform, saying that substantial progress had been made in negotiations with the Chicago Teachers Union and calling for a 48-hour ""cooling off period"" for negotiations to continue.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) has been aggressively pushing teachers in the nation's third-largest school district to return to classrooms and follow a reopening plan that she and the city's health experts all agree is safe. The teachers have refused, wanting to wait until all teachers in the district are fully vaccinated and until the city has set better metrics for opening and closing schools.

When the two sides did not conduct any negotiations on Sunday, Lightfoot ordered all teachers to report to their classrooms on Monday and said that any teachers who refused would be locked out of their virtual learning suites and subject to discipline for being absent without leave. The CTU responded by threatening to call a strike if teachers were locked out of their virtual learning software, a move that would likely be illegal under Illinois law, which prohibits teachers from striking while they are under contract.

However, after negotiations continued Monday, the city appears to have backed down, at least for now. In a joint statement released Monday, Lightfoot and CPS CEO Janice Jackson said, ""We have secured agreement on one other open issue and made substantial progress on a framework that we hope will address the remaining issues. We are calling for a 48-hour cooling off period that will hopefully lead to a final resolution on all open issues.""

The statement indicated that, as a ""gesture of good faith,"" the teachers who refused to show up on Monday would not be locked out of their remote learning suites, at least not through Wednesday. CTU president Jesse Sharkey praised the decision, saying, ""We want to keep working remotely as we bargain an agreement to return to our classrooms safely. And we're one step closer to that goal today, because management has agreed to stay at the table rather than escalating conflict or locking out educators.""

As always, Chicago parents find themselves holding the short end of the stick, as many of them who had prepared to send their children back to classrooms today have now had that pushed back to Thursday, at least.

In an interview with Morning Joe on Monday, Lightfoot praised unions in general and called Chicago a ""union town"" but blasted the CTU specifically, which has been a thorn in the city's side since before the prolonged strike of 2019. ""We have over 40-plus unions in the city of Chicago that serve our workforce. We have labor peace with every single one except two: The right wing leadership of the Fraternal Order of Police, and [the Chicago Teachers Union].""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-pastor-mayor-armed-police,2021-02-02
Chicago Teachers Union on verge of strike for virtual teaching during COVID-19 surge,"Most schools nationwide are supposed to return students to the classroom this week as Christmas break ends. But Chicago teachers could upend the city's plans for in-person learning with a strike over what they say are unsafe working conditions because of a surge of coronavirus cases.

The Chicago Teachers Union will vote Tuesday on whether its more than 25,000 members will refuse to go to work in person on Wednesday and demand that they be allowed to phone in to their jobs virtually. According to WBEZ-FM, 80% of the 8,000 members who attended a CTU virtual town hall Sunday evening did not want to work in person in Chicago Public Schools under current conditions.

The union has been foreshadowing a strike for days. Last week, the union surveyed its members asking if they would ""support a district-wide pause and temporary shift to remote learning."" They also polled members on whether they'd be willing to ""participate in a city-wide work stoppage"" if the union's demands are not met.

Studies have shown that viral transmission for COVID-19 in schools is ""extremely rare"" and that schools can reopen safely. Additionally, virtual learning has been demonstrated to negatively impact student performance, with math and English test scores plummeting in Chicago Public Schools during the pandemic, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.



Classes in Chicago resumed Monday after a two-week break for the Christmas and New Year holidays. City and district officials have vowed to keep schools open with students and teachers physically present in the classroom, potentially putting them in conflict with the union's demands.



“What we have learned from this pandemic is that schools are the safest place for students to be: we have spent over a $100 million to put mitigations in place, most CPS staff members are vaccinated, and we generally see little transmission in school settings,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement Monday.

""Keeping kids safely in school where they can learn and thrive is what we should all be focused on,"" she said.

Chicago Public Schools echoed the mayor's support for in-person learning in a statement also issued Monday. The district warned that ""districtwide, unwarranted and preemptive mass school closures could actually fuel community spread."" CPS also said it has been meeting with union representatives and has ""reiterated that a case-by-case, school-by-school approach is the best way to approach COVID-19 concerns in schools.""

The city is making its case for in-person learning as a surge of COVID-19 hospitalized 6,294 people statewide on Monday, the highest number of hospitalizations since the pandemic began, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.

IDPH also reported a daily average of 23,069 new COVID cases and an average of 59 COVID-related deaths per day.

CPS maintains that safety measures including masking, contact tracing, testing, cleaning, air purifiers, and widespread vaccination are sufficient to protect teachers from serious COVID-19-related illness or death.

However, several issues with the virus test kits provided to parents for their children over winter break have complicated the debate over reopening. WBEZ reported that CPS provided 150,000 at-home testing kits for students. But many parents who tested their children and returned the sample by last week's deadline were told the tests could not be analyzed.

Parents were told via email that the tests could not be processed within the required 48-hour window ""due to weather and holiday related shipping issues,"" WBEZ reported.

Further, more than half of the test results submitted came back as ""invalid."" Of the 35,831 tests completed over the past week, 24,989 were invalid and 18% came back positive, according to CPS' COVID tracker.



On top of the processing problems, CPS said that more than 100,000 of the 150,000 tests made available to parents of schoolchildren were never submitted.

The teachers' union has seized on the testing issues as justification for keeping teachers away from in-person learning. CTU has demanded that the school district require students and staff to present a negative COVID-19 test before attending in-person classes. In the absence of adequate testing, the union wants to switch to remote learning for two weeks.

“Here we are, a year later in the cold in January, performing another remote action, because [CPS] can’t get it right,” CTU Vice President Stacy Davis Gates said Monday.

The union is also demanding high-quality masks for all students and staff and a policy to switch to virtual classes if 20% of a school's staff is in isolation or quarantine for COVID-19.

Chicago Teachers Union stalls HS reopening by telling teachers not to reveal if they've been vaccinated,"The Chicago Teachers Union is continuing to needlessly obstruct the reopening of public high schools in the city by instructing members not to reveal if they have received a coronavirus vaccination or not.

What are the details?

For more than two months, the union has clashed with the city's school system, Chicago Public Schools, over its plan to resume in-person instruction. The union's complaint centered around allegedly inadequate safety protocols, despite the city spending $100 million to make schools coronavirus-safe.

Last month, the district finally opened its doors to tens of thousands of students attending kindergarten through eighth grade after weeks of tense negotiation between the union and CPS. The union originally voted to defy the reopening plan and threatened to strike if any teachers were disciplined for refusing to return to the classroom. As part of its reasoning, the union claimed teachers' vaccination schedules were unsatisfactory.

But now the union is reportedly stalling any further reopening plans by instructing members not to disclose whether they have been vaccinated or not in a survey being circulated to faculty and staff.

According to a report by WBBM-TV, in a letter sent to its more than 20,000 members, the teachers' union advised that members ""wait to respond to [CPS'] vaccination survey.""

""I don't have a problem with people answering this kind of survey,"" insisted CTU President Jesse Sharkey. ""I do have a problem with CPS not bargaining it with us.""

The report noted that as of last week, CPS' vaccination page showed that while 16,500 faculty and staff had been offered vaccinations, only about 4,200 reported receiving the shot.

What else?

Adding to the drama, this week, CPS put forward a plan to open city high schools for in-person instruction on April 19. But, once again, the union pushed back.

""We have no agreement on returning to in-person learning in high schools on any date, nor will there be an agreement until we know our school buildings can reopen safely,"" the union said in a defiant statement.

The union's resistance comes even as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced last month that school reopening should not be conditioned on teacher vaccinations and as much of the country is waking to the idea that a return to in-person instruction is absolutely vital for the health of its children.

Democratic Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has called out the CTU for operating based on political motives.

""When you have unions that have other aspirations beyond being a union, and maybe being something akin to a political party, then there's always going to be conflict,"" she said during an interview with the New York Times.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-public-schools-cave-allow-teachers-to-continue-to-teach-remotely-for-an-additional-48-hours,2021-03-17
China's 'bat woman' Shi Zhengli edited a paper denying evidence for the lab-leak theory without disclosing her contributions,"A top Chinese researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was consulted on and offered edits to an influential 2020 commentary that claimed there was ""no credible evidence"" supporting the lab-leak origin theory of COVID-19, a newly released document reveals.

The researcher, Shi Zhengli, is a prominent virologist at the Wuhan lab, which is facing international scrutiny over concerns that risky coronavirus research performed there may be linked to the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. The commentary, published by Emerging Microbes & Infections in February 2020, was titled, ""No credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of SARS-CoV-2."" The paper was written by Shan-Lu Liu, Linda J. Saif, Susan R. Weiss, and Lishan Su.

A document made public by U.S. Right to Know shows that Shi proposed three noteworthy edits to a draft of the commentary but was never credited by the authors, nor was the potential conflict of interest of having a Wuhan lab scientist contribute to a paper denying the Wuhan lab-leak theory disclosed.

U.S. Right to Know summarizes Shi's edits as follows:

Shi proposed three edits of note. First, she proposed changing the presentation of the number of nucleotides that differed between RaTG13, which was the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 identified at that time, and SARS-CoV-2. The authors wrote this difference was ""greater than 1000 nucleotides."" Shi proposed deleting ""1000"" and replacing it with ""1100"" nucleotides. This edit appears to maximize the presentation of the difference between the two viruses.



Second, Shi proposed deleting a paragraph discussing the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV virus, MA15 (that had been used in Ralph Baric's lab in collaboration with Shi), and how its serial passage had increased viral replication and lung pathology in mice. This appears to be an effort at distancing from the gain-of-function debate surrounding the research done together by Shi, Baric and the EcoHealth Alliance.



Third, Shi edited a statement on bats as natural reservoirs, and civets as intermediate hosts, of SARS-CoV.

Shi's second edit, in which she appears to hide the connection of her work to gain-of-function research — experiments that intentionally make viruses more transmissible among mammals, and particularly among humans — is especially concerning given the controversy surrounding EcoHealth Alliance's funding for gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the early observations of scientists who studied the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thought ""some of the features (potentially) look engineered.""

Among the scientists who raised this possibility were at least two of the authors of the EMI paper. Emails previously released by U.S. Right to Know show the authors privately expressed doubt to each other about its conclusions. Susan Weiss, for instance, wrote to Shan-Lu Liu in a Feb. 16 email expressing her ""doubt"" that the virus was engineered in a lab but nevertheless noted the SARS-CoV-2 virus has a distinctive furin cleavage site that is atypical of related bat coronaviruses.

It should be noted that Liu is the editor-in-chief of EMI and oversaw the publication of the paper. Five days later, Liu wrote back to Weiss, ""Susan, I completely agree with you, but rumor says that furin site may be engineered. Importantly, the virus RNA sequence around the furin site (288 nt), before and after, has 6.6 % differences, but with no amino acid changes at all.""

Weiss in turn responded, ""Henry and I have been speculating- how can that site have appeared at S1/S2 border- I hate to think to [sic] was engineered- among the MHV strains, the cleavage site does not increaser pathogenicity while it does effect entry route (surface vs endosome) . so for me the only significance of this furin site is as a marker for where the virus came from- frightening to think it may have been engineered[.]""

These concerns were not discussed in the paper.

Importantly, Shi was not the only gain-of-function researcher who consulted on the draft. Dr. Ralph Baric, the leading coronavirus researcher in the United States, was asked to provide comments and revisions, which emails show he agreed to do on the condition that he would not be cited ""as having commented prior to submission.""

Baric and Shi had previously collaborated on a 2015 gain-of-function study that received federal funding from the National Institutes of Health and was somehow exempted from an Obama administration moratorium on funding for such research.

Neither Shi's nor Baric's contributions to the EMI paper draft were acknowledged once the commentary was published.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-teachers-union-on-verge-of-strike-for-virtual-teaching-during-covid-19-surge,2021-09-29
China expels American journalists in latest escalation of media war amid the coronavirus outbreak,"The Chinese government revoked the press credentials of American journalists for the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal Tuesday, effectively expelling them from the country.

The journalists will be required to turn in their press cards to the Chinese government within 10 calendar days and will ""not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China, including its Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions,"" according to the announcement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs office.

The country also ordered the journalists from those media outlets — along with voice of America and Time magazine — to ""declare in written form"" information about their operation within the country.

What's the background?

The move is the latest escalation in a media war between the United States and China amid the global coronavirus pandemic.

In the announcement, the Chinese government stated that the expulsion was a necessary retaliation to the U.S. State Department's action last month, which designated five Chinese state media outlets as ""foreign missions."" The designation meant that the outlets would be treated as arms of the Chinese government.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued that the five outlets were ""clearly controlled by the [Chinese Communist Party]"" and that the U.S. was ""simply recognizing that fact by taking this action.""

At the same time, China expelled three Wall Street Journal journalists in response to an opinion piece the outlet published that was headlined: ""China Is The Real Sick Man Of Asia.""

Then in March, the State Department also capped the number of Chinese journalists that could work for the media outlets at 100, which resulted in 60 Chinese nationals having to leave the country.

'Disinformation and outlandish rumors'

The global coronavirus outbreak has heightened the intensity of the conflict of late, as many in the U.S. suspect that China lied for weeks regarding the origin and severity of the novel virus, which began in Wuhan, China, last year.

On Saturday, the State Department ""hauled in"" the Chinese ambassador to the U.S. to confront him over a Chinese official's unsubstantiated claims that the virus was introduced in Wuhan by the U.S. Army.

Then early this week, Secretary Pompeo again lashed out at the Chinese government for pushing the claims.

In a phone call with the Chinese Foreign Affairs office director, Pompeo ""conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States,"" according to a statement from the State Department.

""The Secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat,"" the statement added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-teachers-union-stalls-hs-reopening-over-vaccines,2020-03-17
China reportedly tested hypersonic nuclear-capable missiles not once but twice; weapon likely uses Cold War-era Soviet system,"There was an eye-opening report released this week that in August China launched a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile into space that circled the Earth before cruising down within 24 miles of its target. The report from the Financial Times claimed that U.S. intelligence personnel were caught by surprise by the weaponry.

There is a new report from the Financial Times newspaper alleging that there was not just one launch of a hypersonic glide vehicle, but two different launches of the new hypersonic missile. China reportedly launched two secret hypersonic glide vehicles onboard a Long March rocket — which is operated by the China National Space Administration — on July 27 and on Aug. 13. The rocket ferried the HGVs into low Earth orbit, where the weapons stayed in orbit until they got close to their targets.

The original FT report stated that two U.S. intelligence officials said, ""The test showed that China had made astounding progress on hypersonic weapons and was far more advanced than U.S. officials realized.""

However, there are other reports claiming that the delivery system was technology first introduced by the Soviet Union during the 1960s. During the Cold War-era, the Soviets developed began developing a ""fractional orbital bombardment system"" — or FOBS.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States established a thorough missile defense system to detect any nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles launched from the USSR. To evade America's radar system, the Soviets started developing a missile system that could strike the U.S. from orbit.

The Soviets realized missiles tipped with nukes that were already in orbit at the time of a conflict with the U.S. would have reduced flight time and give the Americans less warning time to react — making the weapons extremely difficult to shoot down.

China appears to have stolen the Soviet's fractional orbital bombardment system, but upgraded the missiles to a hypersonic glide vehicle.

The Congressional Research Center defines hypersonic glide vehicles:

Hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs), like all weapons delivered by medium- and longer-range rocket boosters, can travel at speeds of at least Mach 5, or about 1 mile per second. The key difference between missiles armed with HGVs and missiles armed with ballistic reentry vehicles (i.e., those that travel on a ballistic trajectory throughout their flight) is not their speed, but their ability to maneuver and change course after they are released from their rocket boosters. In addition, although it is not necessary, many concepts for the delivery of HGVs presume that the boosters will launch along a flatter, or depressed, trajectory than standard ballistic missiles, and will release their gliders at a lower altitude of flight.

Hypersonic glide vehicles have no range limit since they are floating in orbit.

ICBMs can fly up to 20 times the speed of sound (Mach 20), or approximately 15,000 mph, compared to HGVs that travel around Mach 5, or approximately 3,800 mph. However, the HGVs are more maneuverable, plus have a lower and flatter trajectory than ICBMs – making them harder to detect by radar systems and giving less reaction time for missile defense systems. Because of the flatter trajectory, it is significantly more difficult to gauge the hypersonic glide vehicle's target location.

Jeffrey Lewis, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine:

An ICBM travels in a really big arc—the apogee (top of the arc) for an ICBM going from Russia to the United States is about 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) above the Earth. The Soviet FOBS entered orbit at a much lower altitude, a few hundred kilometers, which meant it would arrive in the United States about 10 minutes quicker. And since it is impossible to tell where the FOBS will impact until it deorbits, the precise target would have only a few minutes of warning.

YouTube Megaprojects Video Screenshot

Lewis notes that a FOBS attack on the U.S. from the South Pole could be disastrous.

""The system in Alaska wouldn't even see such a missile, let alone have a shot at it, and coverage from U.S. space-based missile warning assets is a little spotty over South America,"" Lewis asserts. ""China could also just build bigger ICBMs to deliver warheads over the South Pole, but orbital bombardment gets those warheads to U.S. soil much faster.""

During a conference in April, Commander of North American Aerospace Defense, General Glen VanHerck, acknowledged the potential danger of a FOBS attack, ""Simply stated, the missiles and delivery platforms now in the hands of our competitors present a significant challenge to our legacy warning and assessment systems and defensive capabilities.""

""Highly advanced cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles, and stealthy delivery platforms provide our competitors with the ability to hold targets in the homeland at risk with conventional weapons,"" VanHerck added.

Secretary of the Air Force, Frank Kendall, warned in September, ""There is a potential for weapons to be launched into space, then go through this old concept from the Cold War called the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System, which is a system that basically goes into orbit and then de-orbits to a target.""

On Wednesday, President Joe Biden said he is concerned about Chinese hypersonic missiles.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week that the Biden administration ""welcomes stiff competition"" when asked about China's hypersonic missile capabilities.

On Monday, Sen. Angus King of Maine stated, ""Hypersonic weapons are strategic game-changers with the dangerous potential to fundamentally undermine strategic stability as we know it. The U.S. cannot lag in this development or allow for blind spots as we monitor the progress of our competitors.""

Lewis points out that the downsides of FOBS include inaccurate reentry from orbit, the amount of resources it takes to get the HGV in orbit, ""plus a nuclear warhead has to carry a small rocket stage to get it back down again, which meant it couldn't carry more than one warhead.""

China is expected to increase military spending in 2022,"China is expected to increase spending on its defense budget in 2022.

The Global Times, a tabloid newspaper owned and operated by the Chinese Communist Party, said, “Ahead of China's announcement of its defense budget for 2022, analysts and observers predict that the country will likely continue to steadily increase its military expenditure, at a rate possibly slightly faster than last year.”

“China enjoys a positive economic development but faces security threats,” the global times continued, “The two factors provide a foundation and need for China to further develop its national defense capabilities to safeguard national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and rightful interest.”

Military experts believe that the Chinese defense budget could grow by as much as 7 percent.

Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military expert, said, “China will likely continue to expand its military expenditure this year, as the defense spending should be closely related to the development of the national economy.”

China has made single-digit increases to its annual defense budget every year since 2016. In 2021, China’s GDP expanded by 8.1 percent marking the fastest growth in the Chinese economy in almost a decade.

“While the economy has been affected by COVID-19, China did well with epidemic prevention and control, and is enjoying a relative healthy economy,” Fu added, “So, it is likely that China will spend more on national defense.”

Many in the West expect China to invade the island nation of Taiwan in the near future. In fact, Chinese President Xi Jinping has made it clear that it is a matter of “when” and not “if” China makes a move on Taiwan.

Chinese leaders have even said that if the United States comes to the aid of Taiwan and affirms the nation’s independence it could lead to military conflict between America and China.

In a recent interview with NPR, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, said, ‘If the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence, it most likely will involve China and the United States, the two big countries, in a military conflict.”

Xi Jinping recently reached out to his counterpart in North Korea, Kim Jong-Un, and called for the two communist countries to come to a “common understanding” as they work to build supportive and friendly relations under “a new situation.”

The increasingly likelihood of Chinese aggression in Asia has prompted Japan to break with its post-WWII pacifistic tendencies and reconsider its approach to national defense.

China threatens US: There will be 'military conflict' if Biden supports Taiwanese independence,"In what could be read as either a warning or a threat, China's ambassador to the United States said Thursday there will be ""military conflict"" between the U.S. and China should the island nation of Taiwan attempt to become fully independent from Xi Jinping's communist regime.

In an interview with NPR, ambassador Qin Gang asserted that Taiwan is ""walking down the road toward independence"" and said, ""If the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence, it most likely will involve China and the United States, the two big countries, in a military conflict.""

While Russian aggression on Ukraine's borders may precipitate war in Eastern Europe, China is taking increasingly aggressive action toward Taiwan under President Joe Biden's watch. Days ago, Chinese warplanes flew through Taiwan's southwestern Air Defense Identification Zone in what was the largest incursion on Taiwanese territory since last October, when China few 38 planes, including bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons, through the ADIZ.



The People's Republic of China has long claimed sovereignty over Taiwan, which is the last foothold of the old pre-communist Chinese government and a democracy. Last year, dictator Xi pledged to ""reunify"" Taiwan with mainland China and ""smash"" any attempts by the island nation to achieve independence from the PRC.



The United States has traditionally supported Taiwan's right to be free of ""force or threat"" from the PRC. President Barack Obama's administration sold $1.83 billion worth of arms to the Taiwanese military in 2015, which was opposed by the PRC. As a candidate for president, Joe Biden said that the U.S. has a ""commitment"" to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack. But since assuming office and talking with Xi, Biden has backed down and said the future of Taiwan is in the country's own hands.

""We are not encouraging independence,"" Biden said in November.

Though Biden has made noncommittal statements about Taiwan, Qin said the region's status remains ""the biggest tinderbox"" in U.S.-Chinese relations. He denied that China wants to pursue war to take control of Taiwan.

""People on both sides of Taiwan Straits are Chinese, so we are compatriots. So the last thing we should do is to fight with compatriots. And we will do our utmost in the greatest sincerity to achieve a peaceful reunification,"" Qin said. ""But ... that Taiwanese authority is working down the road towards independence, emboldened by the United States. So China will not commit to giving up the un-peaceful means for reunification because this is a deterrence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-hypersonic-missile-fobs-weapon,2022-01-28
Chinese couples divorcing in record numbers after being stuck home together due to coronavirus,"After about a month of being stuck at home, some married couples in China are getting fed up with each other. So fed up, in fact, that they're rushing to get divorced, according to Global Times.

Marriage registration offices had been closed for some time, and reopened on March 1. Since then, they've barely been able to keep up with the number of divorce appointments people are scheduling.

""As a result of the epidemic, many couples have been bound with each other at home for over a month, which evoked the underlying conflicts, adding that the office had been closed for a month, therefore the office has seen an acutely increasing divorce appointment,"" one official told Global Times. ""Usually the office would see a wave of divorcement after Spring Festival and the college entrance examination.""

Offices in the city of Xi'an have seen an ""unprecedented"" number of divorce appointments.

Fortunately, not all of these couples who show up for divorce appointments end up going through with it. Some of the requests are impulsive responses to the stress of being quarantined for a long period of time due to the threat of a deadly and highly contagious virus.

Han [an official at a marriage office in Xi'an] said that due to long-time staying at home, the underlying conflicts might emerge and result in impulsive divorces. ""We received some divorce appointments and they regretted it later,"" said Han.



Wang [an official of the registration office in Beilin district of Xi'an] said some young couples even decided to remarry when their divorce certificate is printing.



Han suggested couples be serious and prudent toward their marriage and avoid regret based in impulsive decision-making.

China is still by far the hardest nation hit by the coronavirus, which originated in the city of Wuhan.

Chinese government says NBC 'hurt the dignity and emotions of the Chinese people' by failing to include Taiwan in its map of China during Olympics coverage,"The Chinese government criticized NBC for showing an ""incomplete map"" of the country during its Olympics opening ceremony, an apparent reference to the fact that NBC's map did not include the island of Taiwan or the South China Sea, both of which are disputed territories that are claimed by China.

According to Reuters, as delegations of athletes paraded through the opening ceremonies, NBC broadcast pictorial maps of the countries they represented. When the Chinese delegation was on screen, NBC displayed a map of China that did not include Taiwan or the South China Sea.

The communist government of China does not control the island of Taiwan, which has operated under self rule, but has loudly claimed for years that Taiwan is merely a ""rogue province"" of China, and refuses to have diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes Taiwan's independence. China has also made disputed territorial claims to the South China Sea, which have been the source of significant saber-rattling and near-military conflict over the years with China's neighbors.

The Reuters report notes that the Chinese consulate in New York complained on their Weibo social media platform that the display ""hurt the dignity and emotions of the Chinese people"" and called upon NBC Universal to recognise the serious nature of this problem and take measures to correct the error."" NBC was also criticized for its decision by communist propaganda paper Global Times.

NBC did not immediately return a request for comment to Reuters.

China was also unhappy with the Japanese broadcast of the opening ceremonies. According to the South China Morning Post, the official Japanese broadcast anchor for the ceremonies referred to Taiwan's athletes as being from ""Taiwan,"" rather than from ""Chinese Taipei,"" which is the preferred term of the Chinese government.

This led Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen to praise the Japanese for being ""good neighbors"" for not erroneously referring to them as part of China, and the Chinese government to condemn the Japanese broadcast as being part of a ""dirty political trick.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-threatens-us-there-will-be-military-conflict-if-biden-supports-taiwanese-independence,2021-07-24
"Chinese military engineered mice to test virus, covid origin","The Chinese military reportedly ""engineered mice with humanized lungs"" to test viruses on them in 2019, just months before the coronavirus pandemic erupted. The researchers with the Chinese military studied the humanized lungs to evaluate their ""susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2,"" according to the bombshell report from Vanity Fair, which investigated the origin of coronavirus.

Vanity Fair investigative reporter Katherine Eban released a ""months-long investigation"" into the origin of COVID-19. The investigation includes interviews with over 40 people, hundreds of pages of U.S. government documents, internal memos, meeting minutes, and email correspondence. Eban noted that she found ""conflicts of interest"" including large U.S. government grants ""supporting controversial virology research, known as 'gain-of-function.'"" Eban said the conflicts of interest ""hampered"" the investigation into the coronavirus origins by the United States government.

The report noted there were ""two main teams inside the U.S. government working to uncover the origins of COVID-19: one in the State Department and another under the direction of the National Security Council.""



""No one at the State Department had much interest in Wuhan's laboratories at the start of the pandemic, but they were gravely concerned with China's apparent cover-up of the outbreak's severity,"" Eban wrote. ""The government had shut down the Huanan market, ordered laboratory samples destroyed, claimed the right to review any scientific research about COVID-19 ahead of publication, and expelled a team of Wall Street Journal reporters.""

""You had Chinese [government] coercion and suppression,"" said David Feith of the State Department's East Asia bureau. ""We were very concerned that they were covering it up and whether the information coming to the World Health Organization was reliable.""

Thomas DiNanno, former acting assistant secretary of the State Department's Bureau of Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance, reportedly wrote an internal memo to his staff that State Department officials ""'warned' leaders within his bureau 'not to pursue an investigation into the origin of COVID-19' because it would 'open a can of worms' if it continued.'""

""As the group probed the lab-leak scenario, among other possibilities, its members were repeatedly advised not to open a 'Pandora's box,' said four former State Department officials,"" according to Vanity Fair. ""The admonitions 'smelled like a cover-up,' said DiNanno, ""and I wasn't going to be part of it.""

The Vanity Fair piece noted that Xi Jinping ""announced a plan to fast-track a new biosecurity law to tighten safety procedures throughout the country's laboratories"" on February 14, 2020, which was allegedly a ""surprise"" to the National Security Council.

The NSC zeroed in on one particular study first submitted in April 2020, in which ""11 of its 23 coauthors worked for the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, the Chinese army's medical research institute.""



The 11,000-word Vanity Fair exposé highlighted the study, which purportedly ""engineered mice with humanized lungs"" in 2019 to test viruses on them.

Using the gene-editing technology known as CRISPR, the researchers had engineered mice with humanized lungs, then studied their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. As the NSC officials worked backward from the date of publication to establish a timeline for the study, it became clear that the mice had been engineered sometime in the summer of 2019, before the pandemic even started. The NSC officials were left wondering: Had the Chinese military been running viruses through humanized mouse models, to see which might be infectious to humans?

NSC investigators reached out to other intelligence agencies about the curious research, but they were ""dismissed,"" according to Anthony Ruggiero, the NSC's senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense.

""In one State Department meeting, officials seeking to demand transparency from the Chinese government say they were explicitly told by colleagues not to explore the Wuhan Institute of Virology's gain-of-function research, because it would bring unwelcome attention to U.S. government funding of it,"" Eban wrote.

The article placed a spotlight on Shi Zhengli, the lead coronavirus researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who is known as ""Bat Woman."" Shi Zhengli allegedly received $665,000 from the National Institutes of Health between 2014 and 2019. ""Shi's own comments to a science journal, and grant information available on a Chinese government database, suggest that in the past three years her team has tested two novel but undisclosed bat coronaviruses on humanized mice, to gauge their infectiousness,"" Vanity Fair reported.

Shi has denied that COVID-19 emerged from the WIV lab or that the facility conducts military research.

Dr. Richard Ebright, board of governors professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University, said there are only three laboratories in the entire world that have an ""extensive collection of bat viruses, doing some of the most aggressive research:"" Galveston, Texas; and Chapel Hill, North Carolina; and the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.

Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told Vanity Fair that death threats ""flooded his inbox"" after he dared to say that he believed that the coronavirus pandemic originated from the Wuhan lab and did not evolve naturally.

In April 2020, then-President Donald Trump said he had seen classified information indicating that COVID-19 originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The Vanity Fair article blamed former President Trump for presenting the lab leak theory, which Eban said ""poisoned the waters for anyone seeking an honest answer to the question of where COVID-19 came from,"" and was ""linked to destructive nativist posturing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chinese-couples-divorcing-in-record-numbers-after-being-stuck-home-together-due-to-coronavirus,2021-06-04
'Of course CNN has to cover it': Chris Cuomo addresses sexual harassment claims against his brother Gov. Andrew Cuomo,"CNN anchor Chris Cuomo addressed the sexual harassment claims against Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), his brother, in a short statement on his show after more accusations surfaced.

Cuomo acknowledged that CNN would have to cover the story but that he could not because of his conflict of interest.

""Before we start tonight, let me say something that I'm sure is very obvious to you who watch my show, and thank you for that,"" said Cuomo.

""You're straight with me, I'll be straight with you,"" he added.

""Obviously I am aware of what is going on with my brother. And obviously I cannot cover it because he is my brother. Now, of course CNN has to cover it. They have covered it extensively and they will continue to do so,"" Cuomo continued.

""I have always cared, very deeply, about these issues, and profoundly so,"" he concluded. ""I just wanted to tell you that, there's a lot of news going on that matters also, so let's get after that.""

Here's the brief statement from Chris Cuomo:

The CNN host was besieged online by those pointing out that he didn't abstain from covering his brother before the newest damaging accusations. Some mocked him by reminding him of an embarrassing interview where he held a giant cotton swab to poke fun at his brother.

Guys, guys, you have to understand - he can only cover his brother when he holds the qtip. pic.twitter.com/NmVKCXnjgQ

Gov. Cuomo faced a third accuser on Monday who claimed that he had made unwanted advances at her during a wedding in Sept. 2019. She also was able to produce a photograph capturing their interaction.



The first accusation came from a former aide that said Cuomo had inappropriately touched her and kissed her on the lips without her consent. The second accuser was another former aide who claimed Cuomo had asked her inappropriate questions and appeared to be grooming her for a sexual relationship.

The beleaguered governor has addressed the first two accusers in a statement that denied any inappropriate touching and explained away his allegedly inappropriate comments as harmless ""banter"" that was misunderstood by the objects of his ""playful"" jokes.

Earlier on CNN, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio hammered away at the governor and said that if any of the accusations were confirmed that Cuomo would have to step down from the governorship.

Christian school fires pastoral assistant for petitioning against transgender lessons at her young son's school,"A Christian school in Britain fired a pastoral assistant who posted online her objections to the transgender lessons being taught at her son's Church of England school.



The Farmor's School in Fairford, Gloucestershire, fired Kristie Higgs after she urged her Facebook followers to sign a petition against the government's relationships and sex education, which goes into effect in September 2020. The United Kingdom Department of Education's new guidelines dubbed ""No Outsiders"" would require children as young as 5 to receive LGBT lessons about relationships and gender reassignment.

On Tuesday, a disciplinary panel dismissed the 43-year-old mother, who worked at a separate school from the primary school her young son attended, after it found her guilty of ""gross misconduct"" and ""illegal discrimination,"" the Christian Legal Centre said in a press release.

What did she write on Facebook?

Higgs wrote on her personal Facebook page that children are being brainwashed by educators. She asked other parents to sign the petition that she shared.

""Please sign this petition, they have already started to brainwash our innocent wonderfully created children and its [sic] happening in our local primary school now,"" she wrote, according to a press release the Christian Legal Centre sent to TheBlaze.

""Which means, for example, that children will be taught that all relationships are valid and 'normal,' so that same sex marriage is exactly the same as traditional marriage, and that gender is a matter of choice, not biology, so that it's up to them what sex they are,"" Higgs wrote.

""At the same time it means that expressing and teaching fundamental Christian beliefs, relating to the creation of men and women and marriage, will in practice become forbidden — because they conflict with the new morality and are seen as indoctrination into unacceptable religious bigotry,"" Higgs added.

In a separate post, the mother of two also voiced her objections to a pair of children's books at her son's school which feature LGBT stories. One story is about a boy who wants to wear a dress and the other is about a red crayon that learns it's really a blue crayon.

The panel determined Tuesday that Higgs' comments ""could bring the school into disrepute and damage the reputation of the school,"" according to the press release.



Higgs had worked at the secondary school for six years before her firing. Her employee record was unblemished up to her firing.

Was she fired because of her Christian beliefs?

Higgs, who is challenging her firing, said she believes she was fired because of her Christian faith and beliefs. She is represented by the Christian Legal Centre.



""I have been punished for sharing concerns about Relationships and Sex Education. I hold these views because of my Christian beliefs, beliefs and views which are shared by hundreds of thousands of parents across the UK,"" she said in a statement via Christian Legal Centre. ""My number one concern has always been the effect that learning about sex and gender in school will have on children at such a young age.""

""As soon as the investigation into the posts began I was repeatedly told: 'this is nothing to do with your religion.' That was clearly a legal tactic and of course it has everything to do with my religion,"" she continued. ""I am determined to fight this case and to stand for Christians and all parents across the country who are being silenced for sharing and holding these views.""

The school claims it received a single email complaint about Higgs' comments. The complainant accused the woman of ""posting homophobic and prejudiced views.""

""We concluded that no action was taken because of your religion,"" the disciplinary panel said, according to the Christian Legal Centre. ""The disciplinary occurred for reasons other than your religion.""



""As an inclusive employer, Farmor's school recognizes and protects the statutory rights of its staff,"" the panel said. ""Such rights however are not absolute and we are concerned that you did not demonstrate an appropriate understanding of the school's requirement to respect and tolerate the views of others and to role model such behavior.""

The panel admitted that no damage had occurred to the school because of Higgs' Facebook posts.

""Regarding bringing the school into disrepute … we agree that there is no direct evidence that as a matter of fact that the reputation of the school has been damaged to date,"" the panel said in its decision.

What else?

Muslim parents at a Birmingham school have also protested against the ""No Outsiders"" program, which some have called indoctrination.

""This is nothing but indoctrination of our children,"" Razina Mahmood, 40, told the Sun in an earlier interview. ""You are using our children as an experiment.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chinese-military-engineered-mice-covid-origin-wuhan,2019-04-17
Cities in LA County say they will not enforce a new indoor mask mandate,"As Los Angeles County health officials are expected to announce Thursday whether an indoor mask-wearing mandate will go back into effect, several cities in the county have announced they will not enforce a new mask order.

The cities of Beverly Hills, El Segundo, Pasadena, and Long Beach have each announced they will not enforce an indoor mask mandate if one is implemented.

""My City Council colleagues and I strongly believe the decision to wear a mask should be the choice of the individual and should not be imposed by L.A. County,"" El Segundo Mayor Drew Boyles said in a statement Wednesday. ""Individuals should review the data available and consider their own circumstances and make their own decisions about wearing a mask. Businesses need to consider the various agencies that regulate their businesses as part of deciding how they will react to a potential change to mask requirements.""

The El Segundo City Council voted unanimously against enforcing a new mask mandate in a special meeting Tuesday night.

The Beverly Hills City Council held a similar vote Monday night, determining it would not enforce a mask order, KABC-TV reported. Interestingly, Beverly Hills was among the first cities in L.A. County to adopt an outdoor mask mandate in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Deadline noted.

The cities of Long Beach and Pasadena, which each operate their own independent health departments, also announced Tuesday they will not enforce a county-wide mask mandate.

Rising coronavirus cases in Los Angeles County prompted health officials to entertain the possibility of a renewed mask mandate. Los Angeles County Health Director Barbara Ferrer warned that an indoor mask mandate may be needed to slow the spread of the virus after the county entered the high COVID-19 community level on July 14, based on criteria from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But county government officials are on the record opposing a renewed mask mandate.

Supervisor Kathryn Barger said Monday she does not support a mandatory mask policy.

""I am not questioning the effectiveness of wearing a mask,"" Barger told KABC. ""I'm questioning the effectiveness of making a mandate and telling people that they have to. I think it has an opposite effect and people will choose to defy.""

At Tuesday's county board meeting, Supervisor Janice Han said a mask mandate would be ""very divisive.""

""I honestly believe there are a significant number of the population who are not willing to accept mask mandates at this point,"" Hahn said. ""And many of them, the ones that have contacted me, pointed out that we do have more tools now than we had at the beginning of the pandemic.""

On Wednesday, the county reported 7,316 new cases and 20 new deaths. There are currently 1,280 COVID-19 hospitalizations, and the county had a case positivity rate of 16.2%.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chris-cuomo-andrew-harassment-cnn,2022-07-28
Claire McCaskill caught pushing USPS conspiracy theory in DC with photo of locked mailbox in Seattle,"Former Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill sounded the alarm Monday morning about alleged sabotage of the United States Postal Service in Washington, D.C. The problem was, she was using a picture of a locked mailbox in Seattle that she pulled from someone else's social media account.

McCaskill, who is now an analyst for NBC News and MSNBC, shared the photo with a caption pushing a popular, but unproven theory Democrats have been repeating in recent weeks about President Donald Trump attempting to rig the 2020 election by handicapping the USPS.

""So now they are not hauling them off, just locking them up,"" McCaskill wrote. ""This one is in D.C.""

Other Twitter users quickly pointed out that the same photo had been posted a day earlier by a user who said it was a mailbox in Seattle.

McCaskill later apologized for the misinformation, but said the overall point she was making about the USPS still stood.

What's going on here? Because of the conflict over the use of mail-in ballots for the upcoming election, a lot of people who never paid attention to mailboxes are now paying very close attention to mailboxes. Some of those people are noticing mailboxes being removed or locked, causing them to uncritically assume that the only explanation is Trump sabotaging the USPS so Democrats can't vote by mail.



The USPS didn't just begin locking or moving mailboxes in the lead-up to the election, however. Mailboxes are commonly locked for security purposes, and commonly moved from areas where they may not be getting used enough to justify their presence.

Residents of Burbank, California, recently raised concerns about locked mailboxes outside a local post office. Twitter posts about the situation caused ""Burbank"" to become a trending topic on Twitter, as photos of a row of locked mailboxes were widely shared.

KABC-TV looked into the situation, and found it was not as nefarious as some residents feared:

Eyewitness News reached out to the USPS for an explanation, and an employee said it's common practice for mailboxes outside post offices to be locked on days they are closed in an effort to prevent vandalism.



We noticed the mailboxes can still be accessed from the other side.

The issue of the moment: The USPS issue will likely be around for a while, as states widen access to mail-in voting due to COVID-19, President Donald Trump continues to insist that universal mail-in voting will result in widespread fraud, and House Democrats prepare for congressional hearings about recent cost-cutting changes at USPS.

Report: Clandestine CIA program prepared Ukrainian troops for war with Russia,"In the months leading up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Joe Biden's administration pulled covert Central Intelligence Agency personnel out of the country, including war-zone-hardened agency paramilitaries. The CIA operatives had been there since 2014, training Ukrainian forces in modern warfare tactics, a report from Yahoo News revealed.

Although Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine 36 days ago, the Kremlin's forces have so far been unable to capture the capital of Kyiv or crush the Ukrainian military. The most conservative U.S. estimates believe that more than 7,000 Russian troops have been killed in less than three weeks of fighting, and Ukraine's military claims to have killed at least three Russian generals.

According to half a dozen former intelligence officials who spoke to Yahoo News, the CIA's training is what has helped Ukrainian forces stymie the Russian advance.

After Russia's illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, the U.S. military operated a publicly acknowledged training program for Ukrainian troops in the western part of the country, far from the front lines of a civil war with pro-Russian separatists in the east. But at the same time, the CIA reportedly developed a covert training program on the eastern front in the Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces were directly fighting Russia-backed troops and possibly even Russian soldiers.



The covert CIA training program operated under existing authorities for the CIA and did not require new authorization, according to Yahoo News. CIA paramilitaries trained Ukrainian troops in sniper techniques; taught them how to operate Javelin anti-tank missiles and other equipment; showed them how to evade Russian surveillance; and gave them training to draw out Russian and insurgent forces from their positions, Yahoo News reported.

Former U.S. officials involved with the program believe the training was effective. “I think we’re seeing a big impact from snipers. Especially as Russian forces get bogged down from lack of supplies,” one former senior official said. “I think the training really paid off.”

Yahoo News previously reported in January that the CIA had conducted a secret U.S.-based training program for Ukrainian special operations. The outlet also said that CIA paramilitaries had traveled to eastern Ukraine to assist Kyiv's forces there, but the CIA had denied their programs were offensively oriented.

“The purpose of the training, and the training that was delivered, was to assist in the collection of intelligence,” a senior intelligence official said in January.

That statement now appears to be false.

According to Yahoo News, the CIA paramilitaries sent to Ukraine were given a twofold mission. First, they were ordered to determine how best to train Ukrainian special operations forces to fight the Russian military and separatist forces in the Donbas region. Second, the CIA operatives were told to determine the ""backbone"" of the Ukrainians and assess their willingness and ability to fight.

Former officials acknowledged to Yahoo News that the program carried serious risks. ""Everything we did in Ukraine had a chance to be misinterpreted, and escalate the tensions,” one former official said. The CIA reportedly wanted to avoid a direct conflict with the Russians that could result in a war. Accordingly, the number of personnel initially sent to Ukraine was limited to the ""low single digits,"" Yahoo News reported. They were directed to advise and train, but were instructed not to take part in combat.

However, after President Donald Trump assumed office in 2017, the new administration raised concerns that the CIA's Ukraine mission ""might be too far-ranging,"" according to a former national security official.

“How far can you go with existing covert action authorities?” the official recalled asking. ""If, God forbid, they’ve shot some Russians, is that a problem? Do you need special authorities for that?”

Though the Trump White House was mindful of the risks, the program continued through his presidency and into the Biden administration. It wasn't until it became clear that Russian President Vladimir Putin intended to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine that President Biden pulled all CIA personnel out of the country, Yahoo News reported.

Biden's administration was ""terrified of even clandestine folks being on the frontline"" of Ukraine's war with Russia, a former official said.

Clinton-appointed judge rules in DOJ's favor — Idaho barred from penalizing physicians who perform 'health-saving' abortions,"On August 24, U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill temporarily blocked part of Idaho's law banning most abortions. The preliminary injunction granted by Winmill — who was nominated by former President Bill Clinton — prevents the enforcement of Idaho's law when it conflicts with the 1986 federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The EMTALA purportedly ensures that patients are given adequate emergency medical care. The EMTALA applies specifically to hospitals and physicians that participate in Medicare.

Idaho's partial ban, which goes into effect today, will apply to all abortions but those performed during medical emergencies, and those already permitted under the state's law.

The decision comes as a result of the lawsuit filed on August 2 by the Department of Justice, which alleged that the state's prohibition of most abortions had ""extremely narrow"" exceptions and conflicted with the EMTALA.

Winmill agreed with the DOJ, arguing that Idaho's criminal abortion statute (Code 18-622) ""stands as a clear obstacle to what Congress was attempting to accomplish with EMTLA"" and ""will undoubtedly deter physicians from providing abortions in some emergency situations.""

Under the EMTALA, an ""emergency medical condition"" includes: ""a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity ... such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in"" placing the health of the individual in ""serious jeopardy,"" ""serious impairment to bodily functions,"" or ""serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.""



The Department of Health and Human Services recently issued new ""clarifying guidance"" on the EMTALA, following President Joe Biden's July 8 executive order on reproductive health. The purpose of the guidance was to reaffirm ""that [the EMTALA] protects providers when offering legally-mandated, life- or health-saving abortion services in emergency situations.""

The guidance stipulates that if a pregnant woman ""presenting at an emergency department is experiencing an emergency medical condition as defined by EMTALA, and that abortion is the stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve that condition, the physician must provide that treatment.""



On the matter of enforcement, the guidance specifies that any state actions against a physician who performs an abortion ""in order to stabilize an emergency medical condition"" would be pre-empted by the federal EMTALA statute.

Whereas Idaho's criminal abortion statute (Code 18-622) permits abortions in emergencies where the killing of the child is regarded as lifesaving for the mother (as well as in cases of rape or incest), the language of the EMTALA, as taken up in HHS' new guidance, requires abortions also be permitted in instances where they would be considered ""health-saving.""

Winmill suggested that abortions that are not regarded as lifesaving in one moment may prove lifesaving moments later; that ""it is not always possible for a physician to know whether treatment for any particular condition, at any particular moment in time, is 'necessary to prevent the death' of the pregnant patient.""

Winmill also claimed that Idaho's law would serve as a deterrent to the provision of abortions, suggesting that physicians might be precluded from or delayed in following the letter of the EMTALA law if apprehensive about running afoul of the state's criminal abortion statute. ""Idaho's criminal abortion law is to curb abortion as a form of medical care,"" he wrote, thereby decreasing ""the overall availability of emergency abortion care.""

As a result of this ruling, Idaho is barred from legally, professionally, or financially penalizing any medical provider or hospital for performing emergency abortions that aren't necessarily lifesaving.

This ruling came one day after U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix granted Texas a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the EMTALA as interpreted in HHS' July guidance.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/claire-mccaskill-usps-conspiracy-theory,2022-08-25
CNN's Christiane Amanpour blasted for comparing Trump's term to Nazis' Kristallnacht: 'Disgusting',"CNN International anchor Christiane Amanpour compared President Donald Trump's four years in office to the Nazis' Kristallnacht. After Amanpour made the comparison of President Trump's first term to the campaign of terror against Jewish people in 1938, the CNN International segment from Thursday was characterized as ""despicable"" and ""disgusting.""

""This week 82 years ago, Kristallnacht happened,"" Amanpour said on her interview TV show. ""It was the Nazis' warning shot across the bow of our human civilization that led to genocide against a whole identity and, in that tower of burning books, it led to an attack on fact, knowledge, history and truth.

""After four years of a modern-day assault on those same values by Donald Trump, the Biden-Harris team pledges a return to normal,"" she said as images of wrecked storefronts and a book burning were displayed on her show ""Amanpour."" ""And every day Joe Biden makes presidential announcements about good governance and the health and security of the American people, while the great, brooding figure of his defeated opponent rages, conducting purges of perceived enemies and preventing a transition.""

Kristallnacht, the ""Night of Broken Glass,"" was the two-day onslaught on Jews in Germany that began on the night of Nov. 9, 1938. ""Over 250 synagogues were burned, over 7,000 Jewish businesses were trashed and looted, dozens of Jewish people were killed, and Jewish cemeteries, hospitals, schools, and homes were looted while police and fire brigades stood by,"" according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.



""The morning after the pogroms 30,000 German Jewish men were arrested for the 'crime' of being Jewish and sent to concentration camps, where hundreds of them perished. Some Jewish women were also arrested and sent to local jails. Businesses owned by Jews were not allowed to reopen unless they were managed by non-Jews. Curfews were placed on Jews, limiting the hours of the day they could leave their homes.""

There was a wave of backlash against Amanpour on Twitter.

StopAntisemitism.org reacted to the segment by saying, ""Hey @CNN@camanpour please stop using the horrors of the Holocaust to justify an agenda. Our suffering is not yours to play political ping pong with.""



StopAntisemitism.org is a self-described organization ""that works to hold antisemites accountable and to create consequences for their bigoted actions by exposing the threat that they present to all Americans and showing how their ideologies conflict with American values, morals, and principles.""

The Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council called Amanpour's comparison ""despicable.""

""@camanpour compares verbal fact checking of a POTUS to a Nazi pogrom in which dozens of Jews were murdered. Amanpour uses the book burning of Kristallnacht to reach this comparison thus ignoring the overall deadliness and human cost of the night,"" the Council tweeted.

""This is not the 'typical' comparison of a political figure to Hitler or Nazism which is sadly done too often. @camanpour took a verbal fact checking thing about a politician and compared it to a specific violent and deadly event (Kristallnacht) by the Nazis.""

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said, ""A glimpse of what so many of the people who control large corporations, the media and Hollywood really think. That the over 72 million Americans who voted for Trump are supporters of the modern day equivalent of Nazi's.""

Boris Epshteyn, a strategic adviser for the Trump campaign, wrote, ""DISGUSTING demeaning of the Holocaust by ⁦@camanpour⁩, ⁦@CNN. How far the left goes to wrongfully attack ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ is depraved. Will ⁦@cnn do the right thing?""

Sohrab Ahmari, New York Post opinion editor, replied, ""@camanpour: I'm ashamed to have to count you an Iranian compatriot. This is a grotesque abuse of history, a horrific, ahistorical equivalence-drawing, a shameful cheapening of the Shoah.""

Richochet editor Bethany Mandel told Fox News, ""It's disgusting, though not surprising, that a major media figure would use dead Jews as a way to make a cheap political point.



""It is something progressives have done for a long time, disgracing the memory of those who have passed in the Holocaust in order to make a false accusation against the United States president,"" Mandel continued. ""It seems the only time many people care about anti-Semitism is when they can use it to their political advantage.""

Last week, Amanpour compared Trump to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by saying, ""A reflection on President Trump's comments last night: The last President I covered who refused to accept the vote count in an election was Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran, 2009.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/clandestine-cia-program-prepared-ukrainian-troops-for-war-with-russia,2020-11-13
Many of CNN’s national security analysts have undisclosed ties to oppressive Middle Eastern regime,"Editor's note: This article has been updated with corrections about the employment status of the CNN analysts and with additional information on Juliette Kayyem's status with ICSS. See updates within the original story.

Several of the so-called national security experts at CNN that you see on television every night have direct links to the nation of Qatar, a terror-funding, Islamist enclave in the Middle East that has placed itself on the warpath against America's most important regional allies.

But you would never know about these connections, because none of the CNN regulars disclose their financial and/or institutional ties to Qatar when they appear on the airwaves. And off air, they are also not forthcoming about their Qatar-backed connections. Even when it comes to discussing issues where they have a clear conflict of interest, such as commenting on Israeli, Saudi, or UAE affairs, these CNN regulars have no issue going to bat against Qatar's rivals, while never mentioning that their editorial freedom is restricted or that they are personally compromised.

These four CNN regulars double as Qatar-tied propagandists, but you would never know it if you only watched CNN.

Update: This article originally named all four analysts as ""contributors."" This has been corrected to ""regulars,"" as CNN has responded in email that Ali Soufan and Mehdi Hasan are not paid contributors but guests. This article also stated that two analysts are ""full-time"" employees. CNN states that neither Juliette Kayyem nor Peter Bergen are full-time employees; that phrase has been removed.

Ali Soufan

A CNN regular who was prominently featured in the network's anti-Saudi Arabia documentary, Ali Soufan is the executive director of the Qatar International Academy for Security Studies (QIASS), which is based in Doha and funded by the Qatari regime. Oddly, the leadership roster at the state-controlled Qatari institution is almost identical to his U.S.-based Soufan Group.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Soufan has a ""personal relationship"" with the top leadership of Qatar.

Soufan, like his Qatar-backed colleagues, frequently rails against the Saudis, Qatar's top rival, for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. He has also pushed debunked conspiracy theories about Saudi Arabia hacking into the personal information of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

Mehdi Hasan

CNN regular Mehdi Hasan is a longtime presenter for Al Jazeera, the powerful Doha-controlled state media entity that was the favorite network of deceased al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. Hasan's employer pushes out a steady stream of pro-Islamist, anti-Semitic propaganda. As a state-controlled institution, its founding and continuing purpose is the advancement of Qatar's national interests.

""Mr. Hasan works for al Jazeera, the Qatari-owned media enterprise that advances the interests of the state and its royal family. When he speaks, he's no less a government spokesman than Kellyanne Conway or Sarah Sanders,"" explained David Reaboi of the Security Studies Group in a Washington Times column last week.

""But the government he represents — to millions of unsuspecting American viewers — has long promoted the Muslim Brotherhood, funds the bloodthirsty designated terror group Hamas, has helped al Qaeda and the Taliban fundraise, and is relentlessly hostile to American interests,"" he adds.

Juliette Kayyem

Kayyem, a CNN national security analyst, is (or was; see update below) a board member of the the International Centre for Sport Security (ICSS), a front group controlled by Qatar that is an influence operation to secure and defend Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid. Kayyem has regularly spoken on behalf of the organization and has been a media point of contact for the shadowy group. She has not been forthcoming about the reality that the ICSS is a Doha-controlled institution. A 2015 flyer from the group presents Kayyem as part of a group of ""ICSS spokespeople"" who can answer questions about a forthcoming two-day summit.

The leader of ICSS — which again, claims to be a sports-promoting outfit — is Mohammed Hanzab, who has a background as an intelligence and defense specialist in the Qatari military. Hanzab previously served as the president of Ali Soufan's QIASS.

Kayyem regularly takes to the airwaves to bash Qatar's rivals and has transformed her social media accounts into a one-stop shop for anti-Saudi Arabia talking points. When discussing issues involving Middle East politics, Kayyem does not disclose that she is on the board of a state-run Qatari institution.

Update: CNN has responded in email that Juliette Kayyem is no longer on the ICSS board. Her official biographies at both CNN and Harvard, where she lectures, have been altered. Until publication of this story, both bios said that she was currently a board member. Her Harvard bio now indicates that she was a board member until 2015. CNN's response to CR states that her ""contract"" with ICSS ended several years ago. ICSS tweeted that she joined the board in 2012. If she was on the board from 2012 to 2015, as her Harvard bio now indicates, then she was on it while running for governor of Massachusetts in 2014. The PDF linked above shows that she was on the board at least through October 27, 2015.

CNN let Chris Cuomo give Andrew Cuomo a propaganda platform early on during pandemic. WaPo writer points out Chris' silence now as nursing home scandal grows.,"Everyone remembers CNN's Cuomo & Cuomo Happy Time segments during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic.

Host Chris Cuomo got his cable news bosses to waive the company's yearslong rule preventing him from having his brother, New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, on ""Cuomo Prime Time.""

What resulted was lots of free propaganda time for the governor to share his personal views on the pandemic without facing tough questions about how things were going in his state. As the virus spread across the U.S., the governor was on his brother's show at least 10 times, the Washington Post reported.

No one will forget the governor telling his kid brother that his mom made him come on the show.

Or the clever banter and fake outrage when Little Cuomo interrupted Big Cuomo.

And, of course, we'll always have the giant Q-Tip incident.

Chris Cuomo teases brother Andrew with giant test swab www.youtube.com

While Gov. Cuomo was laughing it up on his brother's cable news show, thousands of people were dying in New York nursing homes.



Those deaths are now the subject of a growing scandal surrounding the governor's office as reports have shown that not only did the governor's office order COVID-positive patients into nursing homes, but also that the governor significantly underreported the number of nursing home deaths by thousands of victims — and that his office purposefully hid the data to blunt pressure coming from the federal level and to avoid bad publicity.

Gov. Cuomo attempted Monday to shift the blame during a news conference, but not even his fellow New York Democrats in Albany are buying it.

So, how has his brother Chris covered the scandal on his CNN show?

He hasn't.

And that fact stood out to Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple.

In his column Wednesday, Wemple pointed out that on the same day that Cuomo the Governor was attempting to blame everyone else for the newest nursing home scandal-related stories coming from his office, Cuomo the Host was ignoring the news:

On his Monday night CNN program, host Chris Cuomo provided an update on the biggest story of the past year. “Now, good news: When it comes to coronavirus, we've had the best week we've seen so far, in terms of getting people vaccinated. And every week since New Year's, the rate has only improved,"" said the host.



Here's an update that he skipped: Just hours before “Cuomo Prime Time"" aired, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo held a news conference to address his state's nursing-home scandal. Under his leadership, the state has shown a staggering lack of transparency regarding the extent of coronavirus-related deaths in New York nursing homes. ...



That story — the hottest on the covid beat on Monday — didn't make the cut on “Cuomo Prime Time."" Perhaps that shouldn't be a surprise: Chris Cuomo and Andrew Cuomo are brothers, and journalists can't reliably cover their brothers.

That familial relationship would be a good explanation for Chris' decision to ignore the latest Andrew news, Wemple said, if it weren't for the fact that he had covered the governor's pandemic reaction repeatedly in what became a two-man routine that drew kudos ""from all over entertainment media.""

Chris himself pointed out that the brother-and-brother ""news"" segments were an unusual break from the ethics of the journalism industry and even admitted that he could not be objective about the governor's efforts.

""Me having you on the show is an unusual thing. We've never really done it. But this was an unusual time,"" Chris told his brother. ""I'm wowed by what you did. And, more importantly, I'm wowed by how you did it.""



Yet, in these unusual times — including now, when the governor is accused of underreporting and then hiding thousands of nursing home deaths that were a result of his orders and then trying to shift the blame — Chris Cuomo can't be bothered to address what's going on in Albany, Wemple noted.

Cuomo's CNN program ""brands itself as a locus of chest-beating integrity and righteousness,"" Wemple pointed out, but its coverage of the governor has been ""asymmetrical"" — ""over-the-top praise when the governor is up; silence when he's down.""

Wemple asked CNN about the discrepancy and received what most critics of the network would consider an unsurprising, hypocritical response:

The early months of the pandemic crisis were an extraordinary time. We felt that Chris speaking with his brother about the challenges of what millions of American families were struggling with was of significant human interest. As a result, we made an exception to a rule that we have had in place since 2013 which prevents Chris from interviewing and covering his brother, and that rule remains in place today. CNN has covered the news surrounding Governor Cuomo extensively.

Wemple noted that the statement is an example of the problem at CNN: ""You can't nullify a rule when your star anchor's brother is flying high, only to invoke it during times of scandal. You just can't.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-amanpour-trump-nazis-kristallnacht-reactions,2021-02-17
CNN catches itself reporting honestly about 'violent protests' in Kenosha — removes 'violent' from chyron,"In a blatant display of left-wing media bias, staffers at CNN altered a chyron mid-report to distort the truth about riots taking place in Kenosha, Wisconsin, following the recent police shooting of 29-year-old black man, Jacob Blake.

During Monday night's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,"" CNN actually displayed an accurate report about the riots, calling them ""violent protests.""

That's right, for a blissful 15 seconds, the truth was actually being reported on CNN, as the chyron read: ""8PM Curfew Ordered After Violent Protests Over Police Shooting Of Unarmed Black Man In Wisconsin.""

But it all vanished in a flash when the network seemingly woke from its truthful haze and swapped in a new chyron — this time sans the word ""violent.""

The Federalist's Tristan Justice was the first to catch the stealth edit and subsequently posted the clip on Twitter for all to see.

What's the background?

Whether the protests have been ""violent"" or not is not exactly something up for debate at this point, as footage of the events unfolding in Kenosha posted on social media show rioters burning and destroying buildings and cars all over the town.

One rioter even pointed a gun directly in the face of Blaze Media host and reporter Elijah Schaffer while he was filming.

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D), who was one of the first to publicly criticize the police officers involved despite no investigation having been conducted, had to deploy the National Guard to help quell the situation.

Among the buildings burned were a state youth correctional facility and a small office furniture store.

According to Daily Caller field reporter Jorge Venture, an entire car lot was also set ablaze.

What else?

Blake was reportedly taken to a Milwaukee hospital following the shooting to be treated for multiple gunshot wounds. He is expected to survive, though his father has signaled that he may be paralyzed from the waist down. But doctors have not confirmed whether the paralyzation is permanent.

The three officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into the matter.

Many, including Democratic nominee Joe Biden, have already concluded that the shooting is an example of ""yet another Black American [becoming] a victim of excessive force."" But there are conflicting reports over whether the force used was unnecessary.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-analysts-tied-to-middle-eastern-regime,2020-08-25
"CNN invited Brett Favre on to discuss kids playing tackle football, then proceeded to grill, berate him about vaccines","NFL legend Brett Favre appeared on CNN to discuss the risks associated with kids playing tackle football, but the network couldn't bear to let the former quarterback leave before grilling him over his stance on vaccines.

What happened?

Favre was making the rounds on the media circuit Tuesday, warning parents about the dangers of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a disease associated with repeated traumatic brain injuries, when he stopped by CNN.

During the appearance, the Hall of Famer, joined by the Concussion Legacy Foundation founder Chris Nowinski, encouraged parents not to let children younger than 14 play tackle football in order to reduce their risk of being diagnosed with the disease.

But CNN anchor Kate Bolduan, it would seem, had ulterior motives for inviting Favre on her show. After engaging in a discussion about CTE for roughly four minutes, Bolduan transitioned into discussing vaccine hesitancy among NFL players.

""Why do you think there is such a struggle among some athletes — especially when people look to them as role models — when it comes to the COVID vaccine?"" the anchor asked Favre.

Favre answered by arguing that there is still a ""great deal of uncertainty"" around the vaccines, noting that ""you hear one thing one day and you hear something totally different the next.""

He added that the emergency use authorization granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is not exactly the lengthy human trial usually required by the agency that many would prefer to review before getting jabbed.

""We're sort of the human trial, if you will, and I think some people are frightened by that,"" he said.

What happened next?



That answer was obviously not good enough for Bolduan, who proceeded to claim that there isn't conflicting information and that the vaccine is ""safe, effective, and needed"" and is a matter of public health.

""Would you urge your current players to get the vaccine? Have you been vaccinated?"" she then asked point-blank.

When Favre responded that he'd ""rather not say one way or the other"" and that it's not his place to say whether others should get vaccinated, Bolduan's eyes lit up in shock. The quarterback went on to note that concerned individuals ought to consult a trusted expert and then make the decision for themselves.

""[So] you don't trust the vaccines?"" Bolduan interpreted Favre's remarks to mean.

At that point, Nowinski jumped in to try and steer the conversation back to CTE, but his effort was fruitless.

Bolduan closed the segment by stating that ""every health official from the top down, from local doctors to the government, to the best scientists in America and beyond, have said that coronavirus vaccines are safe and the only way to make it out of this pandemic.""



She then thanked both guests for coming on to talk about CTE, which she called an important issue, ""just as is the coronavirus pandemic and the vaccines.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-chris-cuomo-andrew-cuomo-nursing-home-scandal-coverage,2021-08-17
CNN panel stumped when analyst exposes media's double standard on Hunter Biden laptop story: 'Hard to ignore',"CNN political commentator S.E. Cupp exposed a double standard in the media on Sunday, and CNN host Brian Stelter could not answer for it.

What happened?

During a discussion on CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" about the controversial text messages of Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Cupp said the media's reaction highlights an awful double standard and rush to judgement.

Case in point? Cupp said look no further than the deliberate suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal.

""The conflicts have been, you know, questioned by everyone, including, like, Sean Hannity,"" Cupp said of Justice Thomas and his wife, adding that ""outrage is warranted"" and that Justice Thomas should be examined to determine whether he has a conflict of interest.

""But,"" Cupp continued, ""you don’t have to look far to find a very similar story that was really ignored by the media and, in fact, called false over and over and over again.""

""That’s the Hunter Biden laptop story,"" she explained. ""Hunter Biden is a relative of a very famous person the way Ginni Thomas is a relative of a very powerful, famous person. My Twitter feed is clogged with blue-check reporters who are instantly believing that there is some tie between Ginni and Clarence, and, you know, the rush to dismiss Hunter as not a relevant story by lots of reporters is hard to ignore.""

CNN 03 27 2022 11 07 28 www.youtube.com

Stelter, however, did not respond to Cupp's observation, instead asking New Yorker staff writer Jane Mayer about Cupp's point. After stumbling over her words, Mayer said there is ""no shortage of legal interest in Hunter Biden,"" referring to Justice Department and IRS investigations.

Cupp fired back, ""Yes, but the legal interest in the Hunter Biden story would make the journalism interest, I think, more warranted.""



In the end, no member of the panel answered Cupp's point. Instead, Stelter transitioned to discussing ""right-wing — these GOP senators come up with culture war arguments"" against Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson during her Senate confirmation hearings last week so that they ""could get booked on Fox [News] that night.""

What is the background?

The media infamously downplayed the Hunter Biden laptop story when it broke in October 2020. First dismissed as Russian disinformation, a claim debunked by then-Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, Twitter and Facebook worked overtime to block the story from being shared on their platforms.

The Bidens, however, never directly denied that the laptop belonged to Hunter; the media simply did their bidding. But last fall, a Politico reporter confirmed the Post's story. Finally, the New York Times admitted this month the authenticity of the emails, confirming what the Post originally reported.

Through uninterested media, President Joe Biden has avoided scrutiny related to the scandal during his presidency. In fact, the Media Research Center reported that NBC News, CBS News, and ABC News have not even mentioned Hunter Biden on their morning or evening broadcasts in more than 250 days.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-edits-chyron-kenosha-rioting,2022-03-28
CNN president Jeff Zucker stuns employees with sudden resignation,"CNN president Jeff Zucker ""stunned"" colleagues on Wednesday by announcing his sudden resignation, writing in a memo that he had failed to disclose a romantic relationship with another senior executive at CNN.

Zucker ends a nine-year tenure as the network's president and chairman of WarnerMedia's news and sports division.

In the memo, Zucker said that his relationship came up during the investigation into disgraced ex-CNN anchor Chris Cuomo's actions to squash the sexual harassment allegations leveled at his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

""As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo's tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years. I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't,"" Zucker said. ""I was wrong.""

""As a result, I am resigning today,"" he wrote.

According to the New York Times, Zucker was referring to Allison Gollust, CNN's executive vice president and chief marketing officer. Gollust acknowledged the relationship in a statement on Wednesday and said she would be remaining at CNN.

“Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,” she said. “Recently, our relationship changed during Covid. I regret that we didn’t disclose it at the right time. I’m incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do everyday.”

Zucker and Gollust are both divorced.

CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said the scandal-ridden organization was ""stunned"" by this development.

Zucker exits CNN amid a dispute with Cuomo, who was fired in December for grossly violating journalistic ethics by helping his brother, the governor, fight sexual harassment allegations throughout 2021. Cuomo has hired Hollywood litigator Bryan Freedman and is suing CNN for $18 million, alleging the company wrongly denied him severance pay.

Cuomo and Zucker reportedly had a close relationship at CNN, and Zucker sought to protect the embattled anchor after it came to light that he was advising his brother. But after the New York attorney general's office revealed that Cuomo had sought to learn about articles being written at other news outlets about his brother, Zucker ended his support and fired the anchor.



There were also allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against Cuomo by a former junior colleague at CNN days before he was fired. Cuomo has denied the allegation.



After firing Cuomo, Zucker claimed that the news about the depth of his involvement with the governor's scandal response came as a surprise. But Cuomo has accused Zucker of having full knowledge of what he was doing, ""including about the details of Mr. Cuomo's support for his brother.""

CNN said in December that Cuomo's claims were ""patently false.""

Complicating the matter of Zucker's exit from CNN is that his girlfriend, Gollust, served as Gov. Cuomo's communications director before becoming executive vice president at CNN. This fact creates all sorts of possible conflicts of interest leading up to Cuomo's eventual termination and now Zucker's resignation.

Meanwhile, CNN ratings continue to plummet, because beyond problems with the network's leadership, its news coverage makes bad TV.

CNN's Brian Stelter says that disgraced host Chris Cuomo might be back on the air as soon as January,"Brian Stelter, host of the poorly-watched CNN show ""Reliable Sources,"" joined fellow CNN host John Berman on the poorly-watched ""New Day"" Wednesday, and suggested that disgraced host Chris Cuomo's ""indefinite"" suspension might be rather brief, indeed.

CNN announced that it was suspending Cuomo ""indefinitely"" on Tuesday pending an investigation into revelations that Chris Cuomo had used his media connections to help his brother, disgraced former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, more than he previously let on.

""I think what’s going on here, it is a little complicated,"" Stelter claimed. ""I think the bottom line is that Cuomo is on the bench, for now, we’re heading into a holiday season. I think it is possible he will be on the bench for several weeks, it is possible he’ll be back in January.""

Chris Cuomo Could Be Back on CNN By January www.mediaite.com





Chris Cuomo and CNN invited a firestorm of criticism when the network allowed Cuomo to host his older brother for a series of softball interviews on the network during the early days of the pandemic, when then-Governor Andrew was still riding high on the erroneous widespread public perception that he was handling the coronavirus pandemic well in New York — so high that many Democratic observers publicly mused that the party might attempt to substitute him as the party's presidential nominee at the national convention. However, even at the time, many media critics of all political stripes warned that the interviews were an obvious ethical lapse on CNN's part due to the inherent conflict of interest presented by allowing an anchor to offer friendly interviews to an immediate family member who was one of the most prominent political figures in the country.

These warnings were eventually borne out when Andrew Cuomo's façade of political invulnerability began to crumble. First, even liberal media organizations began to notice what center-right outlets had been saying from the beginning: Andrew Cuomo's handling of the pandemic was not as great as the public had previously been led to believe. The dam began to crack in January 2021 when the New York Department of Health released a report which accused the governor of deliberately undercounting the number of nursing home deaths in order to hide the effects of his controversial early-pandemic policy, which required nursing homes in New York to accept coronavirus-positive patients. An April report from the New York Times revealed that Cuomo and his aides had gone to far greater lengths than previously known to obscure the death toll in order to blunt public criticism from then-President Donald Trump, who had frequently criticized Cuomo's handling of the pandemic.

Even as this scandal was unfolding, Andrew Cuomo became embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal that would eventually force him to resign his office in disgrace. Beginning in December 2020, a number of women — many of them government employees in New York — began to come forward to accuse Cuomo of inappropriate behavior ranging from inappropriate comments to unwanted touching and kissing, and political retaliation against women who rejected him. Andrew denied all the allegations and New York Attorney General Letitia James began an investigation in February 2021 that would ultimately find that many of the women's claims were substantiated, and would ultimately lead to Andrew's resignation from office.

As these twin controversies unfolded, Chris Cuomo and CNN were widely criticized when Chris announced in March 2021 that ""obviously I cannot cover"" the scandals involving his brother on-air due to the conflict of interest — a consideration that was somehow not obvious when Chris was covering the apparently good news about Andrew in 2020. The embarrassing situation for CNN became infinitely worse when it was revealed in May 2021 that Chris had been acting behind the scenes as an advisor to his brother, helping him to craft public statements that were designed to help him weather the scandal. Chris would concede on-air that this was a ""mistake,"" but was somehow not reprimanded or otherwise punished by the network for the obvious ethical lapse.

Recent documents, however, indicated that Chris's assistance to his brother went well beyond merely offering communications advice, and included using his media contacts and sources to find out information about accusers — information which he then passed to his brother's political team. When this information broke into public view, CNN finally took action and suspended Chris indefinitely on Tuesday.

Stelter's statement perhaps sheds light on one reason that CNN has been so reticent to remove Cuomo from the air, claiming, ""You also have a lot of viewers, though, who love Chris Cuomo and are now ticked off that he’s off the air and want to see him back.""

As CNN has lurched noticeably leftward and become more bizarrely obsessed with cable news competitor Fox News in the last five years, their market share of viewership has suffered drastically. According to the most recent ratings in the all-important age 25-54 demographic, Cuomo's program (859,000 viewers) was obliterated by both of his time slot rivals, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow (1,975,000 viewers) and Fox News' Hannity (3,003,000 viewers). By way of comparison, Cuomo's audience — the largest on CNN — is dwarfed in the key demographic by Louder with Crowder. However, relative to the rest of his network's anemic ratings, Cuomo fared well; his was highest rated program on the struggling network's prime-time lineup.

Co-author of influential natural origins paper says people with ‘conflicts of interest’ shouldn’t investigate COVID-19 origins,"A Columbia University virologist who believes COVID-19 had natural origins says any investigation into the origins of the virus should be conducted by people who don't have ""conflicts of interest.""

Dr. Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, spoke with BlazeTV host Glenn Beck Wednesday about the need for scientific experts to earn the public's trust as they search for the truth about what caused the coronavirus pandemic.

""We don't really understand where this virus came from. We don't know how long it was circulating before we became aware of its presence,"" he told Beck, adding that there is a need for ""transparency in the way investigations are done.""

""And they should be done by people who do not have any real or apparent conflicts of interest,"" Lipkin said. ""Now, for example, I would not be the appropriate person to be engaged to go to China and try to figure out whether or not there was something that was going, that was awry. But there are people who have no conflict of interest. And I think they should be engaged to go in and try to figure out what we can know.""

Honest and transparent investigations into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic have been obstructed by the Chinese government's propensity to lie and hide relevant data from investigators, as well as intense public criticism and censorship of anyone who voiced opinions or asked questions that contradicted the supposed ""scientific consensus"" that the virus occurred naturally. Throughout most of 2020, individuals who put forward the hypothesis that the virus was artificially engineered and/or somehow leaked from a laboratory were ostracized and condemned as conspiracy theorists.

Lipkin is a colleague of Peter Daszak, the president of the nonprofit group EcoHealth Alliance and a vehement critic of the lab-leak origins hypothesis, who has become controversial because of his ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese lab believed by some to have played a role in the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. Daszak recently made headlines for recusing himself from the Lancet COVID-19 Commission's investigation amid questions of his potential conflicts of interest after it came to light that EcoHealth Alliance provided the Wuhan lab with federal funding from the National Institutes of Health.



Lipkin and Daszak have collaborated on research related to discovering new viruses, predicting and preventing pandemics, and other topics in virology. Lipkin is also the co-author of a highly influential March 2020 study that argued features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus strongly suggested that the virus was ""not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus."" His view, like Dazak's, is that the most likely explanation for how COVID-19 came to be is that the virus started in an animal host, evolved to become transmissible to humans, and was widely transmitted at a Wuhan ""wet market"" in late 2019, spreading across the globe from there.

He told Beck that there is ""no evidence"" that the Wuhan lab's chief scientist, Dr. Zhengli Shi, conducted experiments that led to a more transmissible virus. But Lipkin added that there should be international standards for that kind of research, called gain-of-function research, which studies how viruses and bacteria cause infectious disease by artificially manipulating those pathogens.

Lipkin also said there is a growing body of evidence that suggests the virus was outside China as early as October or November 2019, before China reported the first cases of COVID-19.

""Although we became really aware of what was going on in December, in Wuhan, it may have well started earlier, or someplace else,"" said Lipkin. He added that what scientists know for a fact is that it is risky to work with viral samples ""without appropriate bio containment"" and that the wildlife markets in China ""need to be shut down"" because they increase risk of viral outbreak.

Moving forward with an investigation, Lipkin told Beck, scientists need to search for viral samples that precede the Wuhan outbreak, which requires searching laboratories, animals, looking for antibodies in people that would indicate exposure, and thoroughly investigating reports of the virus appearing in places like Milan, Italy, before it was recorded in Wuhan.

Beck pressed Lipkin on the issue of trust, noting that many public health scientists worked to shut down discussion of the lab-leak hypothesis and the mainstream media, motivated by ""hatred for Donald Trump,"" amplified their criticisms.

""There's a lot of politics,"" Lipkin admitted before adding, ""And I have to say that, knowing many of these people as I do, I don't think that it had anything to do with Donald Trump.""

""I think they honestly believed, that they're sincere in their belief, that there was no evidence for a lab leak,"" said Lipkin. ""The problem here is that if you're thinking in terms of criminal law, you say you have to prove something, beyond a shadow of a doubt. That's not what we're dealing with here. Because if you make a mistake, everyone's on the hook, right?""

Colbert takes cheap shots at farmers in cold open mocking their struggles amid trade war with China,"Late night host Stephen Colbert used Thursday night's cold open to mock farmers who are struggling to make ends meet due to the Trump administration's trade war with China.

U.S. farmers who rely heavily on exports to China have felt a squeeze since tariffs have left many of them without enough buyers for their crops.

On ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" farmers' financial woes were set to the tune of ""The Farmer in the Dell"" with some progressively harsher lyrics and a cartoon illustration.

""Tariffs posed by Trump, put the farmers in the dumps

Oh no, the derry-o, the farmer's in a slump.



The farmer lost his wife, she wants a better life

She ran off with an ex-convict who rides a b****in bike.



The farmer needs a job, he's stripping while he sobs

Hi-ho the stripper pole, they're laughing at his knob



The farmer drinks a lot, his liver starts to rot

Chuggity-chug the winey-o, time to start growing pot""

Trump Tariffs Call For An Update To Mother Goose youtu.be

The Trump administration has provided billions in aid to farmers to support them throughout this trade conflict with China, but many are still left wondering if this will all end up being worth it for them.



""There was a sense that this was going to be a short-term fight and the mantra we constantly heard was, 'short-term pain for long-term gain,'"" said Brian Kuehl, co-executive director of Farmers for Free Trade, according to Politico. ""I think you can see very clearly that farmers are more frustrated now than they were six months ago. We heard there's a deal that's imminent, then it's not. We heard this was all going to be wrapped up quickly, then it wasn't. A lot of farmers just want to know there's a light at the end of the tunnel.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cnn-s-brian-stelter-says-that-disgraced-host-chris-cuomo-might-be-back-on-the-air-as-soon-as-january,2019-05-17
Colin Kaepernick calls for release of convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal,"Activist Colin Kaepernick called for the release of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther who was convicted of killing a 25-year-old Philadelphia police officer in 1981.

The former NFL quarterback recorded a video for the ""Bring Mumia Home"" campaign, where he said that Abu-Jamal ""is a human being who deserves to be free.""

In the video that was released Monday, Kaepernick described Mumia as ""a political prisoner who has since the age of 14 dedicated his life to fighting against racism [who] continues to be caged and lives his life on a slow death row.""



""We're in the midst of a movement that says Black Lives Matter, and if that's truly the case, then it means that Mumia's life and legacy must matter,"" Kaepernick said in the video. ""And the causes that he sacrificed his life and freedom for must matter as well.""

The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback claimed Abu-Jamal was ""framed"" in the killing of Philadelphia police Officer Daniel Faulkner, and contends the former Black Panther member was not given a fair trial.

""Mumia has been in prison longer than I've been alive,"" Kaepernick said in the video that was shown at an event that involved Black Lives Matter Philadelphia and the Black Philly Radical Collective. ""Since 1981, Mumia has maintained his innocence. His story has not changed.""

Kaepernick believes that Abu-Jamal has had to endure ""psychosocial torture"" from being in prison for 38 years, which he says is ""a second by second assault on the soul.""

Colin Kaepernick Speaks on Mumia's Freedom www.youtube.com

The Justice for Daniel Faulkner Facebook page disputed Kaepernick's assertions.



""Another article including a video statement on Kaepernick calling for the 'release of convicted cop killer Mumia Abu Jamal.' Kaepernick repeatedly states in video that Mumia has been in jail for 38 years and deserves freedom,"" the page stated. ""Why on earth would he deserve freedom for committing a murder? The video shows Kaepernick truly has no knowledge on the true facts and evidence of his conviction. The ignorance of Kaepernick is a disgrace.""

Abu-Jamal was convicted of first-degree murder after being found guilty in the shooting death of Faulkner in 1982. Abu-Jamal was originally sentenced to death, but he was resentenced to life in 2012.

""Faulkner was shot and killed in a scuffle after pulling over Abu-Jamal's brother in what was then 'the red-light district' as the bars closed,"" the Philadelphia Tribune reported. ""Abu-Jamal, who moonlighted as a cab driver, came upon the scene and was found shot and wounded in the aftermath nearby. The prosecution witnesses testified that Abu-Jamal, then known as Wesley Cook, ran toward the scene and shot the officer. His brother never testified and soon left town.""



""Just before 4 a.m. on Dec. 9, 1981, in a rough downtown neighborhood of Philadelphia, Police Officer Daniel Faulkner stopped a Volkswagen Beetle and arrested its driver, William Cook, for driving the wrong way down a one-way street,"" the Baltimore Sun reported. ""Expecting or experiencing trouble, Daniel Faulkner radioed for assistance.

""When fellow police officers arrived, they found him lying in the street, shot in the back and the face,"" the news report stated. ""A few feet away, slumped in his own pool of blood, was William Cook's brother, a free-lance journalist and black activist named Mumia Abu-Jamal – born Wesley Cook.

""Mumia Abu-Jamal, who moonlighted as a cab driver, later said that he had been driving by and, seeing a police officer hitting his brother, stopped his cab and rushed to his defense,"" the paper wrote in 1995. ""His licensed .38 caliber pistol, which he had bought after having been robbed twice, was found at the scene.""

Kaepernick wants the Philadelphia district attorney's office to release Mumia Abu-Jamal.

There is an ongoing legal battle because Faulkner's widow, Maureen Faulkner, wants to remove Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner from handling Abu-Jamal's appeals. The widow alleges there is a conflict of interest because the former law firm of Krasner's wife had represented Abu-Jamal in the past.

In February, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered a special master to investigate the conflict of interest allegations, KYW-TV reported. The court assumed jurisdiction over the case, and has halted all legal appeals for Abu-Jamal.

The 64-year-old Abu-Jamal is currently serving a life term at the Mahanoy State Correctional Institution in Frackville, Schuylkill County.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/co-author-of-influential-natural-origins-paper-says-people-with-conflicts-of-interest-shouldnt-investigate-covid-19-origins,2020-11-19
College faculty chair compares Chick-fil-A to 'pornography' as academic senate votes to kick restaurant off campus,"The vice chair of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's academic senate likened popular fast-food chain Chick-fil-A to ""pornography"" as the faculty body voted overwhelmingly to kick the restaurant off campus after 25 years, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

""We don't sell pornography in the bookstore, and we don't have a Hooters on campus — we already pre-select those kind of things based on our existing values,"" Thomas Gutierrez told student publication Mustang News. ""This is a similar thing. The difference is we're actually profiting from this. So our money, every dollar a student is spending at Chick-fil-A, is going to these causes that are in violation of our values.""



Mustang News — citing left-wing outfit Think Progress — said the ""Chick-fil-A Foundation donated more than $1.8 million to groups with a history of anti-LGBTQ discrimination in 2017.""

The Tuesday vote to oust Chick-fil-A was a landslide of sorts, with 38 of 44 academic senators wanting to get rid of the restaurant, the Chronicle said.

What did the school administration have to say?



Despite the demands of the faculty representatives, it doesn't appear Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is in any rush to bow to them.

""While university administration passionately disagrees with the values of some of the organizations the president of Chick-fil-A has chosen to make personal donations to, we do not believe in responding to intolerance with intolerance,"" university spokesman Matt Lazier told KSBY-TV. ""Rather, we must model our values of inclusion — that means upholding the rights of others to have different perspectives and ensuring there is space in our community for differing viewpoints and ideologies, even those that may be in direct conflict with our own.""

The school and Chick-fil-A signed a 5-year contract extension in 2018.



Despite attacks, Chick-fil-A just keeps forging ahead



Chick-fil-A has been enduring left-wing attacks for years. But it seems that as the punches increase in number and intensity, the success of the franchise just keeps increasing: To wit, Chick-fil-A just became the third-largest restaurant chain in America, behind McDonald's and Starbucks.

But some folks are nevertheless doing their darndest to keep Chick-fil-A down:

Watch: College students say rude or disrespectful speech should not be protected on campus,"Some Virginia college students told Campus Reform that hateful, offensive, or rude speech should not be considered free speech on college campuses.

President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Thursday afternoon that would penalize colleges that don't protect the First Amendment on their campuses. Schools that don't uphold free speech would face losing billions in research grants from a dozen federal agencies.

Ahead of the president's executive order, Campus Reform's Cabot Phillips asked students at Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia, what they believed should and shouldn't be permitted as free speech on their campus.

What exactly did the students say?

Several students told Campus Reform that they believe hateful or disrespectful speech crosses the line between what should and shouldn't be allowed on campus.

""I think if it's, like, hateful and, like, disrespectful to specific groups, then that's not OK,"" one student said.

Another student shared a similar opinion.

""It's OK to disagree but you have to do it respectfully and in an adult manner because if you're gonna talk about free speech, then you need to back it up with facts and not just your personal opinion,"" the student responded when asked about free speech.



""But as far as having the right to speak up, I'm allowed to be disrespectful, right?"" Phillips asked.

""No,"" she answered.

""The First Amendment says I can speak out,"" he said.

""I mean, if you wanna be an a**hole, that's your life choice,"" she continued.

Another student said students who make offensive comments should be removed from campus.

""I should be allowed to speak but ... if you're directly offending someone with like racial slurs, then I mean you should be escorted off campus or asked to stop,"" he said.

One student said she agreed that people have a right to free speech but only it doesn't negatively affect others.

""I understand you have free rights to say what you want about people but when it's, like, negatively impacting our school as a whole and other students around you, that's crossing the line,"" the student said.

What is the purpose of the executive order?

The executive order, which the president teased during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this month, is intended to stop colleges from silencing conservative voices on campus.

""If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they've got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people and old people to speak,"" Trump said, the Christian Broadcasting Network reported. ""Free speech. If they don't, it will be costly.""

The order would require public universities to uphold free speech and private universities would be expected to uphold open inquiry on campus, USA Today reported.

""It will be applied consistently with how agencies already condition federal grants. I won't get into implementation details,"" a senior Trump administration official told reporters Tuesday on a phone call. ""But schools are already supposed to be following these rules. Essentially, each agency already conditions grants, and schools are certified after following these conditions, and it will just add free speech as one of those conditions.""

Student loans and grants would not be affected by the order.

Why does this matter?

The values of free speech and open inquiry have been under attack on many higher learning campuses in recent years.

A number of schools have banned conservative speakers including Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief of the Daily Wire, and best-selling author Jordan Peterson.

Last month, Grand Canyon University in Arizona, the largest Christian University in the U.S., blocked Shapiro from speaking on campus.

""Our decision to cancel Shapiro's speaking engagement is not a reflection of his ideologies or the values he represents, but rather a desire to focus on opportunities that bring people together,"" GCU wrote in a statement.

""As a university, we encourage thoughtful discussions and rational dialogue in our classrooms about the issues affecting our society, and we encourage students to put greater emphasis on actions that produce positive change in our society,"" the university continued.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/colin-kaepernick-mumia-abu-jamal,2019-03-21
College students and alum outraged and 'shaking' that Mike Pence will speak at commencement,"The picture of the aggrieved and trembling college student unable to cope with hearing unpleasant things, or simply things with which they disagree, is fast becoming the face of higher education in the United States. It is therefore not a surprise that the invitation of Vice President Mike Pence to speak on a campus might result in some safe space complaining.

It is perhaps somewhat a surprise that, in this case, it's an evangelical Christian school: Taylor University. In the VP's own state of Indiana.

After it was announced that the Vice President of the United States would give the graduating students the honor of high office at their commencement, some students, and even alum and parents, went into meltdown. PJ Media's Tyler O'Neil has their reactions.

Naturally, there was a petition.

""Inviting Vice President Pence to Taylor University and giving him a coveted platform for his political views makes our alumni, faculty, staff and current students complicit in the Trump-Pence Administration's policies, which we believe are not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear,"" Alex Hoekstra, a former staffer for President Barack Obama and a 2007 Taylor University graduate, said in the petition.



Others proved more angry and visceral.



""I have never been made to feel so physically ill by an email before. Taylor University, you should be ashamed of yourselves,"" Claire Hadley, who graduated from Taylor in 2015, began in a long Facebook post. ""I am physically shaking. The fact that the school who claims to love and support me, and each of it's [sic] students and alum, would invite such a vile individual to speak on the most important day of the year??""



""VP Pence is no friend of mine. He does not support me. He does not support equality,"" Hadley declared. ""He does not uphold the values that are at the very core of the church, my own faith, and I would hope, of this University. He is rooted in hate. To stand beside President Trump would have been enough to put him on my watch list."" She argued that Mike Pence ""only values you if you fit in his very narrow, white, straight, box.""



""Taylor University, I feel personally attacked,"" she concluded. ""Please, I'm begging you. Don't do this.""

Lindsey Snyder, a 2014 graduate, said she emailed Taylor University President Lowell Haines. ""This invitation gravely concerns me, because whether intentional or not, it is politicizing Taylor University, aligning the school with the current administration,"" she reported writing. ""Many current and former Taylor students are adamantly against some of Pence's stances and will no doubt feel unsafe at their own graduation. Even if it was someone less controversial than Pence, having a political figure speak at commencement alights unnecessary and grievous conflict.""



There is so much more. Not everyone had the same reaction, and some among the student body and the alumni have responded. On Saturday, O'Neil reported that a counter-petition has been launched, and is picking up steam.

O'Neil spoke with one graduate, Kevin Holtsberry of the class of '94, who told him ""Inviting the sitting vice president of the United States, and former Indiana governor and congressman, to speak at commencement is not an attack on students, faculty or alumni with differing political views or opinions about Mike Pence,"" Kevin Holtsberry.

The fact that these students at a Christian university in middle America, in the state where Pence was the governor not that long ago, shows just how far the ""woke"" college experience has extended. It's not just coastal elites. It's right in your backyard.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-faculty-chair-compares-chick-fil-a-to-pornography-as-academic-senate-votes-to-kick-restaurant-off-campus,2019-04-13
"Sen. Collins faces off with CDC director, says agency used to be the 'gold standard' — but not any more after its terrible COVID messaging","Americans have for months been exacerbated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's mixed messaging during the coronavirus pandemic. From messages on mask-wearing to outdoor transmission to how fully vaccinated people should conduct themselves, the agency has repeatedly undermined itself in the eyes of many Americans and tarnished its own reputation — likely permanently for vast swaths of the population.

One of those people disillusioned with the CDC's ""expertise"" is Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) — and she made her disappointment and distrust of the agency clear in remarks to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky during a Senate Health Committee hearing Tuesday.

What happened?

The CDC finally — after ongoing pressure from all sides — issued new face mask guidance late last month. Though the new guidelines were celebrated for finally offering some relief to fully vaccinated people, many critics — on the right and the left — criticized the new rules for not loosening restrictions even further. Beyond that, the members of the Biden administration have continued to undermine the new CDC guidelines — from the Health and Human Services secretary to Biden's COVID czar to President Joe Biden himself.

Late last week, the CDC finally acknowledged publicly that COVID-19 is airborne — a fact that other health experts have known for several months.

The CDC has been inconsistent in its support for reopening schools and recently suffered its own scandal when it was revealed that the American Federation of Teachers appeared to play a significant role in CDC guidelines for reopening.

There has also been debate over the agency's restrictions for outdoor summer camps that say outdoor campers should be masked.

And on Tuesday, the New York Times exposed a move by the CDC to exaggerate the risk of outdoor COVID spread in order to protect people. The Times revealed that Director Walensky's claim that ""less than 10 percent"" of transmissions occur outdoors was misleading at best. In fact, the Times said, the rate of outdoor transmission is less than 1% — and may be below 0.1%.

These recent CDC messaging snafus led Collins to issue a stark rebuke to Walensky for her agency's missteps.

""I used to have the utmost respect for the guidance from the CDC,"" Collins said. ""I always considered the CDC to be the gold standard. I don't anymore.""

The senator cited the CDC's ""conflicting"" and ""confusing"" guidance that has ""undermined public confidence"" and ""contradicts the scientific guidance of many experts"" on school openings, outdoor transmission risks, and summer camps.

""So, here we have unnecessary barriers to reopening schools, exaggerating the risks of outdoor transmission, and unworkable restrictions on summer camps. Why does this matter?"" Collins asked. ""It matters because it undermines public confidence in your recommendations, in the recommendations that do make sense, in the recommendations that Americans should be following.""

Walensky stood behind her agency's widely criticized actions and rules, saying the ""CDC will continue to follow the science"" — without explaining which science that would be.

The director briefly addressed the report that the AFT played an outsized role in reopening guidance for schools, claiming that the guidelines that were updated with the union's requested language was actually based on CDC science and was initially left out based on an accidental oversight.

She attempted to explain away the Tuesday Times report that exposed the CDC's exaggerations on outdoor transmission, saying that the agency's messaging was based on a ""published study"" — a claim the Times report clearly debunked.

And she lamented the camp restrictions, saying she won't let her own 16-year-old go to camp, but she failed to note that kids are not the people at risk with COVID, and most of the adults who would be considered vulnerable have received vaccines.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-student-rude-speech-not-protected,2021-05-11
Colorado baker who refused to bake a gay wedding cake is back in court over a 'transition day' cake,"Colorado baker Jack Phillips, who gained global attention for refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple's wedding, was back in court earlier this week, The Associated Press reported.

The Christian baker and his lawyers are fighting back against allegations that he discriminated against transgender lawyer Autumn Scardina when he denied her request for a ""transition day"" cake.

""At this point, he's just a guy who is trying to get back to life. The problem is the state of Colorado won't let him,"" Jim Campbell, an attorney for the Alliance Defending Freedom, told the AP after Tuesday's hearing. Alliance Defending Freedom is the Christian nonprofit law firm representing Phillips.

Phillips' lawyers argued Tuesday that the state violated his First Amendment right to practice his religion and his 14th Amendment right to equal protection under the law.

In August, Phillips' lawyers filed the lawsuit against Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's administration, the Division of Civil Rights, and the Colorado Civil Rights Commission for ""unconstitutional bullying,"" according to the report.

Phillips is seeking $100,000 in punitive damages from Aubrey Elenis, director of the Colorado Civil Rights Division.

The Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation by any ""place of business engaged in sales to the public.""

What are the details?

Last summer, Scardina called the bakery and asked for a cake that was pink on the inside and blue on the outside to celebrate the seventh anniversary of her gender transition.

Scardina's request was made June 26, 2017, the same day that the Supreme Court agreed to hear Phillips' case involving his refusal to bake a wedding cake for Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins in 2012.

On June 28, less than a month after the Supreme Court had ruled 7-2 in Phillips' favor, Scardina filed the complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission citing she was discriminated against for being transgender.

The Supreme Court ruled that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission showed anti-religious bias in its sanctions against Phillips for refusing to make the gay couple's cake.

What does the lawsuit claim?

The lawsuit claims that Phillips ""serves everyone,"" adding that cake artists such as Phillips have the right to decline to make cakes with designs that include messages that conflict with religious beliefs.

""All people — no matter who they are, what they believe, or what protected characteristics they have — are welcome in Phillips' shop and may purchase anything available for sale,"" according to the lawsuit. ""But as a devout man of faith, Phillips cannot create custom cakes that express messages or celebrate events in conflict with his religious beliefs.""

The lawsuit points out that the baker has received calls asking for cakes to celebrate ""Satan, featuring satanic symbols, depicting sexually explicit materials, and promoting marijuana use. Phillips believes that some of those requests came from the same Colorado lawyer.""

Phillips' lawyers told the court that he ""believes as a matter of religious conviction that sex — the status of being male or female — is given by God, is biologically determined, is not determined by perceptions or feelings, and cannot be chosen or changed.""

What did the state say?

State officials argued for the court to dismiss the case based on the state's attempts to enforce an order against Phillips.

What was the judge's response?

Judge Wiley Y. Daniel said he believed the Supreme Court's ruling was relevant to the current case and that he was inclined to allow the case to move forward.

He also noted that in the now-retired Justice Anthony Kennedy's conclusion, the commission had shown ""hostility"" toward religion, according to the AP report.

Daniel said he would issue his written decision at a later date.

Judge fines Masterpiece Cakeshop for refusing to make a cake celebrating a transgender woman’s transition,"The Colorado Christian baker who was famously sued over his refusal to make a custom cake celebrating a same-sex couple's wedding has now been fined by a Colorado court for refusing to make a cake celebrating transgenderism.

Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips was ordered to pay a $500 fine by Denver District Judge A. Bruce Jones on Tuesday for violating anti-discrimination laws by denying a transgender activist attorney's request that he make a cake celebrating their gender transition.

The request in question was made June 26, 2017, by a local attorney named Autumn Scardina, who asked Phillips to make a custom cake with a blue exterior and pink interior to celebrate and reflect a transition from male to female.

Phillips, who notched a pyrrhic victory at the Supreme Court in 2018 over his refusal to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, used essentially the same argument in his denial of Scardina: that as a devout Christian, he cannot ""create custom cakes that express messages or celebrate events in conflict with his religious beliefs.""

During court proceedings, Phillips' lawyers explained that he ""believes as a matter of religious conviction that sex — the status of being male or female — is given by God, is biologically determined, is not determined by perceptions or feelings, and cannot be chosen or changed.""

After Scardina's initial lawsuit, which was pursued through the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, failed, the attorney filed another lawsuit, this time taking the complaint to the state court. That avenue has proven fruitful for Scardina's cause.

In the decision, Judge Jones wrote, ""Anti-discrimination laws are intended to ensure that members of our society who have historically been treated unfairly, who have been deprived of even the every-day right to access businesses to buy products, are no longer treated as 'others.'""

In response to the ruling, the Alliance Defending Freedom, the firm representing Phillips, wrote that Scardina's most recent lawsuit ""could bring financial ruin on Jack and his business,"" and vowed to appeal the district court's ruling.

""Radical activists and government officials are targeting artists like Jack because they won't promote messages on marriage and sexuality that violate their core convictions,"" ADF general counsel Kristen Waggoner said in a statement. ""We will appeal this decision and continue to defend the freedom of all Americans to peacefully live and work according to their deeply held beliefs without fear of punishment.""

She added that the case ""represents a disturbing trend: the weaponization of our justice system to ruin those with whom the activists disagree.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/collins-walensky-cdc-messaging-gold-standard,2021-06-17
Colorado ranchers pushing back against movement to reintroduce wild wolves,"Colorado ranchers have formed a coalition pushing back against initiatives to reintroduce wild wolves to the state, saying their livelihoods are threatened by the predators' return.

What are the details?

The Rocky Mountain Wolf Project is working to restore a gray wolf population in Colorado, arguing that the eastern part of the state is the best habitat in the world for the endangered species. The issue could become a ballot measure, which has ignited arguments from both sides, according to The Daily Sentinel.

""The concerns expressed by the ranchers are what I've heard for a long time,"" Sierra Club representative and ecologist Delia Malone told the Sentinel. ""If we examine the facts they don't support the concerns that ranchers have. Ranchers have been living and doing well with wolves on the landscape up in Canada and Montana and Idaho for many decades.""

Fourth-generation Montana rancher Dean Peterson acknowledged to The New York Times that gray wolves were reintroduced to his state by a Clinton-era action that he said was shoved ""down our throat with a plunger.""

Last year, Oregon cattleman Todd Nash told VICE News he's lost around 100 head to wolves over the last seven years. The state reimburses ranchers for livestock losses from the predators, but Nash says the government's compensation doesn't cover his costs.

Nash told VICE, ""I was the least bit concerned about wolves before they came here. It's different when it's your livestock being killed.""

For that reason, Colorado ranching communities are uniting to counter proposals aimed at adding wolves to the existing list of threats to livestock, pets and humans.

""No different right now than the mountain lion, or the coyote, or the bear. We are already dealing with enough predators as it is,"" rancher Tim Ritschard told KCNC-TV.

The fear of ranchers is that their voices will be outweighed by urban voters who aren't financially impacted by predatory species, and would be more likely to side with those arguing that wolves could help restore ecosystems in rural areas.

Anything else?

Meanwhile, the wolf population is growing in nearby states, leading Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials to warn the public through KWGN-TV that killing a gray wolf can result in criminal charges, a year in prison and a fine as high as $100,000.

A common motto for dealing with wolves in the region is ""SSS"": shoot, shovel, shut-up.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/colorado-baker-gay-cake-transition-cake,2019-01-24
"Columbia Univ. Marching Band dissolves, confessing to being founded on racism and sexual harassment","The Columbia University Marching Band voted to dissolve itself over the weekend after more than a century of existence, citing a foundation of racism and sexual misconduct, according to the Columbia Spectator.

The band, which has had various conflicts with the university for years, was stripped of its university funding in 2019 after failing to register as a recognized student group. That registration was a condition for the group continuing to receive funding after violating university rules to hold a concert in the library in 2017.

In a statement provided to the Spectator, the band's leadership said the decision to dissolve was the result of ""anonymous postings and allegations of sexual misconduct, assault, theft, racism, and injury to individuals and the Columbia community as a whole,"" which were discussed during a Sept. 12 town hall meeting.

In the statement, leadership expressed a belief that the organization was so structurally corrupt that it was beyond reform.

""The Band has unanimously and enthusiastically decided to dissolve. The Columbia University Marching Band will not continue to exist in any capacity and will no longer serve as a Columbia spirit group,"" the statement says. ""The Columbia University Marching Band apologizes for insult and injury victims have experienced as a result of actions perpetrated in its name. The Band has maintained a club structure founded on the basis of racism, cultural oppression, misogyny, and sexual harassment. While substantial efforts have been made in recent years toward undoing decades of wrongdoing, we as a Band feel ultimately that it is impossible to reform an organization so grounded in prejudiced culture and traditions.""

Earlier this month, the band released a statement about problems within the group that sparked calls for dissolution and led some members of the band's leadership to step down.



""The CUMB has very serious problems when it comes to racism, sexual assault, and alcohol culture,"" a Sept. 2 read, according to the Spectator.

Although it remains possible that a new band will be formed in the future, some fear that the spirit of the band that served the university for 116 years will be lost.

""The band is gone, and if and when it returns, it will be exactly what the corporations bankrolling Ivy League sports specifically because Ivy League sports is an essential establishment power identification and training system, want it to be,"" said Steve Greenfield, a former drum major from the class of 1982.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/colorado-christian-baker-fined-transgender-cake,2020-09-15
Commentary: Don't end Black History Month just because some people abuse it,"February is Black History Month, a celebration of the African American men and women both famous and obscure who contributed to this great nation. With Black History Month comes the debate about whether the month-long holiday should exist at all.

BlazeTV's own Jon Miller weighed in on the topic this week, stating his case for ending Black History Month, which he calls ""one of the most useless observances in the country after National Cookie Day.""

Miller writes:

""After I suggested this on social media, my inbox instantly flooded with messages from confused and outraged conservatives. To those people, I would ask: What is the point of Black History Month? It's to allow white liberals to feel ""woke"" for a month while doing absolutely nothing whatsoever to educate themselves about history and the real story of African-Americans in this country. They get to add BHM-themed filters to their Snapchat photos while spending time no differently than they do any other month of the year. Nike, of course, gets to release its ""black people"" shoe collection, because when has Nike ever turned down using racial strife to turn a profit?""

Miller raises a valid point about how Black History Month has been trivialized and commercialized by some who have no sincere interest in learning about or promoting black history. Still, to call the observance ""useless"" implies that nobody can get value from Black History Month just because some people abuse it.

I believe that is the wrong way to view it. The value of a holiday or observance should not be determined by those who don't take it seriously.

For example, Christmas has also been trivialized and commercialized in America. But, to those of us who recognize Christmas as a time to reflect on the birth of Jesus Christ and what that means to us, the holiday is immensely valuable. We don't want to abolish Christmas because it has been abused. Instead, we are motivated to fight for its true meaning and observance.

What's the point of Black History Month?

Miller asks, ""What is the point of Black History Month?"" But then he incorrectly identifies the present-day abuses of the celebration as the point of its existence. The point of Black History Month is far more significant than whatever so-called ""woke"" white liberals or shoe companies choose to do with it.

Black History Month as we know it today began in the early 20th century with Carter G. Woodson, who founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in 1915. The ASNLH created Negro History Week in 1926. It occurred during the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln.

The purpose was to ""both create and popularize knowledge about the black past."" Woodson believed the black community ""should focus on the countless black men and women who had contributed to the advance of human civilization.""

Negro History Week gained momentum across the country over the years, and by the 1960s it had evolved to a month-long celebration in some places. President Gerald Ford officially recognized Black History Month in 1976.

""The Negro History movement was an intellectual insurgency that was part of every larger effort to transform race relations,"" wrote Howard University history professor Daryl Michael Scott.

That's the point. Black History Month does not exist to divide the nation. It does not exist in opposition to white people. It exists to educate. Let us never abandon an educational effort on account of those who don't wish to be educated. We should continue to serve those who have a respect and a desire to see black history preserved and taught.

Miller writes about the pitting of black history versus white history. Black History Month doesn't pit races against one another. It simply points to the history, as it happened.

Unfortunately, much of black American history is a story of black people being oppressed by white people. To acknowledge and remember that is not an attempt to punish white people for the sins of the past, rather it is an attempt to promote understanding of those historical injustices and conflicts and their lasting effects, which is necessary to promote healthy race relations in the present and future.

But shouldn't the schools teach it all year?

One of the primary arguments against Black History Month is that, because black history is American history, it should not be limited to one month.

The underlying faulty assumption there is that the existence of Black History Month is the reason black history isn't taught year around in school and emphasized all year in our society. The emphasis on black history won't suddenly expand simply because we stop highlighting the subject in February.

Of course black history is American history. Of course it should be taught all year in the course of normal American history curriculum. But in many schools, it's not. If it was, the widespread ignorance of black history that Miller decries in his column would not be an issue.

The truth is, even in 2019, Black History Month is still the only time some people are exposed to black history. And while that isn't ideal, it's better than the alternative of those people never being exposed to a focused study of African Americans who helped shape the nation as it exists today.

How should we move forward?

It's true that even Carter G. Woodson lived with a hope that Black History Month would evolve into Black History Year. He hoped for an era where such distinctions and divisions of history were not necessary. And there is legitimate difference of opinion about whether such distinctions are still necessary today.

To those who want to end Black History Month, I would remind them that the observance and celebration of black history every February is a voluntary exercise. It would be quite easy for those opposed to the idea to ignore it, as all of us ignore holidays which don't apply to us, rather than insisting that no one celebrate.

But to those people, regardless of race, who enjoy the annual 28 or 29 days of celebration of a rich history, who take special pride in the accomplishments and contributions of black Americans, I say as Woodson once did: ""We are going back to that beautiful history and it is going to inspire us to greater achievements.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/colorado-ranchers-fight-wild-wolves,2019-02-07
Commentary: Media reactions to Bush's death reflect a lack of basic respect,"It didn't take long after the passing of former President George H.W. Bush for some media organizations to begin pointing out the flaws of his life and legacy.

The Associated Press, hours after news of Bush's passing broke, posted a tweet that omitted Bush's military service but notably emphasized the fact that he was voted out of office after one term amid a struggling economy. The organization later deleted and apologized for the tweet.

The next day, New York Magazine took the opportunity of Bush's death to update and republish a Nov. 14, 2017 article titled ""Beware the Bush Family Image-Rehab Machine."" The magazine tweeted the article out Saturday with the succinct caption ""The case against George H.W. Bush.""

And Sunday, HuffPost published ""The Media is Erasing George H.W. Bush's Catastrophic Harm to LGBTQ People.""

My opposition to these examples is not that I don't respect and support the rights of the authors to express these opinions. I don't believe they should pretend to agree with or even like Bush just because he recently died.

I do, however, maintain a (possibly naive) view that when someone dies, you show them some respect by either saying something kind or comforting, or refraining from saying anything if you don't have anything good to say. The news of a former president's death shouldn't send you to your computer to publish your best takedown of his life.

Maybe I still have an old-fashioned mentality and I haven't assimilated to the current internet culture that says you always have to speak on everything right away. To me, it makes sense to read the situation and consider the timing and appropriateness of whatever you have to say.

Everyone has a platform now, and even those with the largest audiences seem taken by a desperation to be heard, right now. It's a high crime in online media to let a cultural moment pass without adding your voice to it, and too many add their voices without a thought to whether they're adding value. And so when someone of national significance dies, along with the respectful tributes and condolences come the people making sure we don't remember the deceased too fondly.

There are clicks to be gotten, I suppose. When something hits ""trending topic"" status on Twitter, everyone has to take their shot. But it illustrates the divide between what is acceptable online versus real life, where I think even Bush's most extreme political and ideological opponents would hesitate before walking into a room and saying ""Oh, Bush just died? That guy was awful.""

If nothing else, I hope that those of us who have public-facing platforms to express our opinions would choose to exercise some empathy, and think very hard before treating someone else's death in a way that would cause us offense if someone did it to our loved one.

Rest in peace to George H.W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States of America. He lived, served, and led in a way that is worthy of respect, in a way that should be able to exist separate and apart from political conflict.

Bush's legacy, like that of any person to rise to that office, is complex and disputed. And there is a time and a place for that conversation. In my opinion, that time is not the moment he dies.

Concealed carrier shoots at crooks who steal his car at gunpoint and make getaway. But soon two shot teens turn up — and now they're persons of interest.,"A motorist whose car was stolen at gunpoint Friday morning in suburban Chicago turned out to be a concealed carrier — and he refused to play victim, firing his gun at the crooks, who managed to make a getaway, WGN-TV reported.

What happened next?

No injuries were reported after the white 2014 Nissan Maxima was carjacked around 5:43 a.m. at a Mobil gas station in Hoffman Estates, the Arlington Cardinal reported.

But around 7 a.m., Chicago police said they responded to a call about a shooting in the 3800 block of West Chicago Avenue, WGN said — about 45 minutes southeast of where the carjacking took place.

Seems a pair of 16-year-old males who were in a nearby hospital told cops they were shot in the Chicago location, the Cardinal reported. But police determined the shooting actually occurred in Hoffman Estates after the teens told them conflicting stories, WGN reported.

Believe it or not, the stolen car in question was located a short distance from where it was carjacked in Hoffman Estates, the Cardinal said. The outlet added that it was initially unknown how the teens got to West Suburban Medical Center in Oak Park, which a little over two miles from the Chicago location where the teens claimed they were shot.

Persons of interest

Later Friday, police said the two teens were persons of interest in the carjacking case, WGN reported.

Police said one of the teens was shot in the left shoulder and back and was transported from West Suburban to Stroger Hospital in serious condition, the station reported, adding that the other teen was shot in the left leg and is in fair condition at West Suburban.

'Kind of scary'

Folks in Hoffman Estates were taken aback by the armed carjacking.

""It's unbelievable,"" Jerry Barrios told WGN. ""I can't put words to it.""

Jennifer Emberton added to the station, ""I live down the street, and I work right here"" before saying with a nervous giggle, ""Kind of scary.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/commentary-dont-scrap-black-history-month-because-of-those-who-fail-to-observe-it-properly,2021-09-27
'Very clear conflict of interest': Explosive new report reveals Stacey Abrams' scandal-plagued nonprofit group poured nearly $10 million into law firm belonging to her campaign chairman,"A special report published on Monday by Politico revealed that the law firm belonging to Stacey Abram's campaign chairman was paid nearly $10 million in legal fees for services rendered to Abrams' nonprofit group, Fair Fight Action, for its work on a lawsuit that recently failed in a federal court.

In addition to raising concerns about a possible conflict of interest, the exorbitant amounts paid to the Abrams-affiliated firm, while not unprecedented, have nevertheless been flagged as exceptional.

A failed lawsuit, a friend's firm, and a big payday

Stacey Abrams is the Democrat candidate currently seeking to unseat Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in Georgia's gubernatorial race. The chairman for her campaign, who also happens to be a close friend of Abrams', is Allegra Lawrence-Hardy.



Politico reported that Lawrence-Hardy is one of two named partners at the law firm Lawrence and Bundy. Lawrence-Hardy's firm was reportedly paid $9.4 million by Fair Fight Action in 2019 and 2020.

Fair Fight Action filed a lawsuit after Abrams was soundly defeated in Georgia's 2018 gubernatorial election by 54,723 votes — a result the Democrat candidate gained a reputation as an ""election denier"" for rejecting.

The lawsuit claimed that the state had ""grossly mismanaged"" the election, depriving some citizens of their right to vote.

The Fair Fight Action v. Raffensperger trial began on April 11 and was rejected by U.S. District Judge Steve Jones in Atlanta on Sept. 30.

Jones, an Obama appointee who found for the defendants on all counts, stated that while ""Georgia's election system is not perfect, the challenged practices violate neither the constitution nor the [Voting Rights Act of 1965],"" as had been alleged by Abrams.

Kemp said of the expensive legal failure: ""Today, Stacey Abrams and her organization lost in court - on all counts. From day one, Abrams has used this lawsuit to line her pockets, sow distrust in our democratic institutions, and build her own celebrity.""

$25 million of the roughly $61 million Fair Fight Action raised between 2019 and 2020 went into advancing this failed lawsuit.

Of the eight law firms that worked on the case, the largest amount reportedly went to Lawrence-Hardy's firm, which acted as lead counsel.

The deputy director for litigation at the Legal Defense Fund, Leah Aden, underscored that the legal fees paid to Lawrence-Hardy's firm altogether accounted for an amount obscenely higher than in most voting rights cases brought to federal court.

Aden told Politico, ""The typical case is a couple of hundred thousand dollars and can take a couple of years. ... Beyond $10 million would be very shocking, I would say.""

Kathleen Clark, a legal ethics professor at Washington University in St. Louis, suggested to Politico, ""Fair Fight Action ought to explain why this lawsuit cost so much. ... I think there are significant questions about this choice of firm and just why this lawsuit was so much more expensive.""

Although Lawrence-Hardy suggested to Politico that her firm provides ""other services for Fair Fight Action,"" she did not specify what those were.

Former Fair Fight Action organizing director Hillary Holley made clear that in speaking of ""other services,"" should Lawrence-Hardy have been referring to work done on a 2020 case brought by Fair Fight Inc. against True the Vote, that case would only have accounted for two months of billings.

It is unclear how many additional millions the law firm may have billed the Abrams group over the past two years.

Conflict of interest?

Lawrence-Hardy's firm made a great deal of money advancing the ill-fated lawsuit that Abrams appeared to have used, in turn, not only to raise money but as a campaign tool.

Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at Public Citizen, told Politico, ""It is a very clear conflict of interest because with that kind of close link to the litigation and her friend that provides an opportunity where the friend gets particularly enriched from this litigation.""

""The outcome of that litigation can directly affect her campaign itself,"" added Holman.

Questionable fairness at Fair Fight

Last week, it came to light that Fair Fight PAC, the political action group founded by Abrams, had a director whose inexperienced friends and family were allegedly getting significant paydays while maintaining other full-time jobs.

In response to a critical Fox News Digital report, Fair Fight PAC issued a press release, stating that on Oct. 13, the organization ""became aware that PAC funds may have been incorrectly paid to consultants.""

""Fair Fight strives to serve with the utmost integrity, as is core to our values. We take these matters seriously and have initiated a comprehensive investigation,"" the statement added.

The individual warranting investigation was the PAC's political director, longtime Abrams aide André Fields.

Fields' sister, Darius Faulk, received over $120,000 despite having no political experience. Asa Fludd and Cruz Alvarado, both friends of Fields, received tens of thousands of dollars from Fair Fight PAC — $29,800 and $29,000 respectively.

While Fox News Digital indicated the amount paid by the PAC to these three individuals was over $178,000, CNN's review of the FEC filings from this and the previous election cycles suggests the figure may be closer to $250,000.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/commentary-media-reactions-to-bushs-death-reflect-a-lack-of-basic-respect,2022-10-24
"Virginia Democrat torches own party for not taking action on banning Congress from trading stocks, calls for new leadership: 'This moment marks a failure'","A Virginia Democrat called for new leadership in her party after plans to vote on legislation banning lawmakers from trading stocks were scrapped.

Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) lashed out at her own Democrat Party for engaging in ""delay tactics"" when it comes to banning members of Congress, their spouses, and their dependent children from buying, selling, and trading individual stocks.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said a bill prohibiting lawmakers from trading stocks would ""probably"" not get a vote this week. The delay would cause the bill not to be voted on before Congress leaves to campaign ahead of the 2022 midterms.

The text of the proposed ""Combatting Financial Conflicts of Interest in Government Act"" was released on Tuesday night. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) directed Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) to draft the bill in February.

However, Pelosi scoffed at a reporter who asked if Congress members and their spouses should be banned from trading stocks in December 2021. Pelosi defended Congress members trading stocks, ""This is a free market and people — we are a free market economy. They should be able to participate in that.""

Hoyer told CNN, ""I haven’t read it, it's a complicated issue, as you can imagine, as a new rule for members they have to follow, and their families as I understand, so I think it deserves careful study to make sure if we do something, we do it right.""

Spanberger was vexed by her party not taking action on legislation that would prevent lawmakers from possibly profiting from being privy to information that some have deemed to be akin to ""insider trading.""

""Our job as elected officials is to serve the people — not ourselves,"" Spanberger said in a statement released on Friday. ""That’s why I’ve been proud to lead the charge on legislation to ban Members of Congress and their immediate families from trading individual stocks — not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because the Virginians I represent overwhelmingly support it and want us to get it done.""

On Jan. 15, 2021, Spanberger introduced her ""Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust (TRUST) in Congress Act"" to prohibit trading stocks by members of Congress and their spouses. Spanberger said her bill had received bipartisan support.

""For months, momentum grew in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate to finally take a step towards prohibiting Members of Congress from day trading while on the job,"" she said. ""We saw remarkable progress towards rectifying glaring examples of conflicts of interest.""

""And after first signaling her opposition to these reforms, the Speaker purportedly reversed her position. However, our bipartisan reform coalition was then subjected to repeated delay tactics, hand-waving gestures, and blatant instances of Lucy pulling the football,"" she said, making a reference to ""Charlie Brown.""



“This moment marks a failure of House leadership — and it’s yet another example of why I believe that the Democratic Party needs new leaders in the halls of Capitol Hill, as I have long made known,"" Spanberger proclaimed. ""Rather than bring Members of Congress together who are passionate about this issue, leadership chose to ignore these voices, push them aside, and look for new ways they could string the media and the public along — and evade public criticism.""

She slammed the Combatting Financial Conflicts of Interest in Government Act, ""As part of their diversionary tactics, the House Administration Committee was tasked with creating a new piece of legislation — and they ultimately introduced a kitchen-sink package that they knew would immediately crash upon arrival, with only days remaining before the end of the legislative session and no time to fix it.""

“It’s apparent that House leadership does not have its heart in this effort, because the package released earlier this week was designed to fail,"" the Virginia Democrat declared. ""It was written to create confusion surrounding reform efforts and complicate a straightforward reform priority — banning Members of Congress from buying and selling individual stocks — all while creating the appearance that House Leadership wanted to take action.""

""In the months ahead, I will be dogged in my efforts to ban Members of Congress from using the privilege of their position to profit,"" she concluded. ""I look forward to working with both my Democratic and Republican colleagues to get these reforms done.""

During a press conference on Friday, Pelosi responded to Spanberger bashing the leadership of the Democratic Party, ""Her bill is in the bill, others had ideas too. And that’s what the committee put forth. But it’s good press because you asked a question.""

This isn't the first time that Spanberger has criticized her own party.

In November 2020, Spanberger blasted progressive Democrats pushing the defund the police agenda and socialism before the 2020 elections.

""We need to be pretty clear. It was a failure. It was not a success. We lost incredible members of Congress,"" she reportedly said during a caucus phone conference. ""We have to commit to not saying the words 'defund the police' ever again. We need to not ever use the words socialist or socialism ever again. It does matter, and we have lost good members because of that.""

""If we run this race again we will get f***ing torn apart again in 2022,"" she declared.

In June, Spanberger made an appearance on Fox News where the Democrat explained that she didn't want help from President Joe Biden in her election campaign.

""I intend to do the campaigning myself. I am the candidate. It is my name on the ballot,"" Spanberger told host Dana Perino. ""Certainly when I first ran, I ran in an R +7 district. And I won in that seat by getting out, speaking to voters, making sure that they know who I am and what it is that I intended to do for them.""

""In 2020, [I] ran for re-election and certainly outperformed the president on the ballot by telling the people what I had done and what I was going to continue to do,"" she boasted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/concealed-carrier-shoots-at-crooks-who-steal-his-car-at-gunpoint-and-make-getaway-but-soon-two-shot-teens-turn-up-and-now-they-re-persons-of-interest,2022-10-01
Congressional group visits Taiwan as China ramps up military presence,"Days after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi enraged Chinese officials with a trip to Taiwan, a congressional delegation made an unannounced two-day visit of their own to the island.

Led by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, the five-member delegation “will meet President Tsai Ing-wen and other officials, as well as members of the private sector, to discuss shared interests including reducing tensions in the Taiwan Strait and investments in semiconductors,” reports the Associated Press.

After Pelosi’s visit earlier this month, the government of China announced that it would extend its threatening military exercises around Taiwan.

China's embassy in Washington, D.C. argued the latest congressional visit ""once again proves that the U.S. does not want to see stability across the Taiwan Straits and has spared no effort to stir up confrontation between the two sides and interfere in China's internal affairs.""

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said members of Congress have gone to Taiwan for decades and will continue to do so, reports Reuters.

According to the Associated Press, the other members of the delegation are Republican Rep. Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen from American Samoa, Democratic House members John Garamendi and Alan Lowenthal from California, and Democratic Rep. Don Beyer from Virginia.

China and Taiwan split in 1949 after a civil war; however, China's ruling Chinese Communist Party continues to claim Taiwan as its own territory. In a statement, the Chinese government stated that while it seeks peaceful reunification with Taiwan, “we will not renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all necessary measures. This is to guard against external interference and all separatist activities.”

The United States does not officially recognize Taiwan as an independent country— only 13 countries currently do — however, it does maintain a strong relationship with Taiwan, and has repeatedly vowed to defend the island against potential attacks.

According to analysis conducted by the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, the U.S. could lose up to 900 warplanes fighting a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, reports Bloomberg.

“The results are showing that under most — though not all — scenarios, Taiwan can repel an invasion,” said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “However, the cost will be very high to the Taiwanese infrastructure and economy and to U.S. forces in the Pacific.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/conflict-of-interest-stacey-abrams-campaign-law-firm,2022-08-15
"VIDEO: Cop drives motorcycle into protester blocking his path, pushing her up road, knocking her down","In the Antifa Shangri-La of Portland, Oregon, a crowd of protesters tried having their way with a lone police officer Friday night — but he was having none of it.

What happened?

The officer had pulled over two vehicles — a white van and a blue sedan — blocking traffic near the intersection of Northeast 47th Avenue and Northeast Couch Street, police told the Oregonian.

Video shows protesters converging upon the scene and the white van escaping and speeding off, after which protesters cheered and applauded.

The lone, completely outnumbered officer then found himself facing down a crowd of protesters who inched their way toward him as he stood next to the blue sedan.

""Back up!"" he hollered repeatedly to the group of about seven as they yelled back at him.



Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @baaascom

Presumably sensing the moment was right, the driver of the blue sedan took off as well — followed by more cheers and applause from the protesters.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @baaascom

But the cop wasn't about to slink off in defeat. He got on his motorcycle and prepared to pursue the driver.

Oh, but the protesters didn't like that very much — and a couple of them stood in his way.

The officer, however, wasn't deterred. He easily moved past one protester armed with a shield who tried to prevent his passage.

But then another protester a few feet away positioned herself directly in front of his motorcycle — her legs literally straddling the path of his front wheel.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @baaascom

Think the cop froze in the face of this righteous indignation? Nah.

He kept right on going, pushing the protester with his motorcycle up the road until she tumbled to the street, after which he sped away.

But right on cue, the cop blocker's comrades flipped out like the officer had invaded the protester's personal space or something, and in another familiar sight they chased after the officer on foot while unleashing enraged howls.

The clip in question is the second video in the below tweet. Content warning: Language:

What happened afterward?

Portland police said in their early Saturday statement that the woman jumped on the officer's motorcycle, the Oregonian reported. But the paper noted that independent photojournalist Sean Bascom — who posted the video of the incident — said ""no one 'jumped on the motorcycle.' The protesters planted their feet in front of it and were driven into.""

Bascom added to the Oregonian that police were citing drivers who had been protecting demonstrators from ""vehicular attacks"" and believed that the officer could have avoided pushing the protester with the motorcycle by driving elsewhere ""or simply not accelerat[ing] at all and call[ing] in other patrol vehicles like they did when the white van took off moments earlier.""

More from the paper:

Live videos from the scene showed officers approach the crowd to check if the person needed medical attention. An argument ensued, and at least one person was detained during the encounter.



Police said Saturday afternoon that the protester struck by the motorcycle was eventually taken to the hospital and later booked on charges of rioting, interfering with a peace officer and second-degree disorderly conduct. Police did not provide an update on the person's medical status. Police said they were booked into jail later than initially planned because someone had slashed the police vehicles' tires in the hospital parking lot.

Jim Middaugh, a spokesman for Mayor Ted Wheeler, told the Oregonian he didn't know if any investigation had been launched into the incident and couldn't comment about the police bureau's account.

""It's troubling whenever police officers and protesters end up in an interaction that results in conflict, and that clearly happened last night,"" Middaugh told the paper. ""It requires a thorough investigation of the police officer's actions and tactics involved in the traffic stop. At the same time, I think it's important for all protesters to remember that in any circumstance, it's not a good idea to surround an officer who is alone or to try and impede an officer who is attempting to carry out his or her duties.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/congress-trading-stocks-ban-spanberger-pelosi,2020-10-05
"Cops shouldn't be responding to rape calls if the suspect runs away, Minnesota AG Keith Ellison says","Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said it would be better to not have police officers responding to rape calls in situations when the rapist has already fled, according to The Federalist.

Instead, Ellison suggests, it is preferable to have a social worker trained in interacting with rape victims respond to such a call. In making his point, Ellison dismisses police officers as people who are simply trained in how to use guns.

""If you're a woman who's been a victim of a sexual assault, and the assailant ran away, wouldn't you rather talk to somebody who is trained in helping you deal with what you're dealing with, as opposed to somebody whose main training is that they know how to use a firearm? Right?"" Ellison said on a virtual panel with PBS's Yamiche Alcindor and California Democratic Rep. Karen Bass.

Ellison's comments are similar to rhetoric that has surrounded efforts to defund or dismantle police departments in liberal localities. The idea is that police officers shouldn't be responding to things that could conceivably be handled more effectively by social workers or other unarmed officials, in order to minimize the potential for unnecessary violent conflicts that can lead to police killings.

Applying that to mental health crises or minor traffic stops carries its own problems, but applying it to the violent crime of rape is even more controversial and potentially dangerous.

Also, Ellison's description of police as nothing more than people who know how to use guns is inaccurate and indicates a narrow way of viewing police that is potentially fueling anti-police rhetoric. Police officers are trained to respond capably to a variety of situations that don't require the use of firearms, including sexual assaults.

For victims' comfort, and for public safety, having police respond to not only take care of the victim but to work quickly toward catching the suspect is crucial, even and especially if that person has fled the scene.

Ellison faced accusations of sexual abuse in 2018.

Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed by police officers on May 25, has been ground zero of the recent anti-police movements that followed Floyd's death. Last month, the city council voted to start the process of replacing the police department with an alternative model.

From WCCO-TV:

The charter amendment calls instead for ""a department of community safety and violence prevention."" It also includes a provision for licensed law enforcement officers.



""As a charter department, the director would be nominated by the Mayor and approved by the City Council. The director would have non-law enforcement experience in community safety services, including but not limited to public health and/or restorative justice approaches,"" the council reported in a press release.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/congressional-group-visits-taiwan-as-china-ramps-up-military-presence,2020-07-23
Cori Bush praises BLM activist who called for deaths of cops,"Democratic Rep. Cori Bush from Missouri delivered a speech on the House floor, where she lauded an infamous Black Lives Matter activist who called for the death of police officers. With the Israel-Gaza conflict making headlines this week, Bush sang the praises of Bassem Masri, a Palestinian-American Black Lives Matter activist who became well-known because of his vitriolic, at times threatening, rhetoric toward cops.

On Thursday, Bush compared the ""militarized occupation"" in Palestine to St. Louis after the 2014 shooting of Ferguson teenager Michael Brown Jr.



""As a Palestinian, he was ready to resist, to rebel, to rise up with us as our St. Louis community mourned Mike Brown, Jr.'s state-sanctioned murder, and as we demanded an end to the militarized police occupation of our communities,"" Bush said on the floor of the House of Representatives. ""Palestinians know what state violence, militarized policing, and occupation of their communities look like.""

""So when heavily militarized police forces showed up in Ferguson in 2014, Bassem and so many others of our St. Louis Palestinian community, our Palestinian siblings showed up too,"" the far-left Democrat said.

Following the Ferguson shooting, Masri garnered notoriety for malicious messages that he would scream at police officers. Marsi would regularly threaten police officers, and even call for their deaths.

""Coward straight pig out here b****! You gotta go. Your life is in danger homie,"" Marsi yelled at cops in October 2014, according to KTVI-TV. During one BLM protest, Marsi asked a police officer, ""What happens when we take your gun?""

Marsi went down the line of police officers and pointed at each one, ""I'm praying for your death and your death and your death and your death.""

Masri was one of the BLM activists who popularized the notorious anti-police chant: ""Pigs in a blanket! Fry 'em like bacon!""







Marsi, who had 40 arrests for traffic violations, passed away in 2018 from what Bush called a ""health crisis.""

Bush called for an end to foreign aid to Israel during her speech, ""That harassment, that extortion, that brutalization by heavily armed militarized presence in our community, that's what we fund when our government sends our tax dollars to the Israeli military.""



The congresswoman suggested using those funds to support St. Louis communities instead.

Earlier this month, Bush praised the ""historic"" vote to defund the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department and axe nearly 100 police officer positions, despite the city being one of the most violent in the world.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cop-drives-motorcycle-into-protester,2021-05-15
"Corpse of young boy found under floorboards of his home. His sister found with burned scalp, cracked ribs.","An Arkansas couple is in custody for multiple charges, including capital murder, after police say they discovered a savagely abused young girl and the decomposing corpse of her brother in the couple's home.

At about 10:45 p.m. Friday night, special agents with the Arkansas State Police Criminal Investigation Division raided a home in Moro, Arkansas, a tiny town of just over 200 people about halfway in between Little Rock and Memphis. According to their report, the agents made two horrific discoveries in the home: the woman's severely injured daughter and the decomposing body of the woman's young son.

From their preliminary investigation, agents believe that the boy may have died perhaps as far back as three months ago. They also believe that the boy died from injuries he sustained from abuse, though the state medical examiner has not yet made an official determination about the cause of death, the report says.

Though alive, the boy's sister appeared to have suffered terrible physical abuse as well. Reports indicate that her scalp was burned, she had several cracked ribs, and she appeared to be malnourished. Her hair had also been chopped off, and there were burns in various stages of healing elsewhere on her body as well, reports claim. The girl has received treatment at a Memphis hospital and is said to be in stable condition.

In connection to the alleged crimes, police have arrested the children's mother, 28-year-old Ashley Roland, as well as 33-year-old Nathan Bridges, who is presumed to be Roland's boyfriend. Both adults have been booked into the Lee County Jail and charged with capital murder, abuse of a corpse, tampering with physical evidence, and endangering the welfare of a minor.

Reports indicate that police may have been tipped off about a possibly dangerous situation in the home by the children's grandmother, identified only as Karen. In a GoFundMe account created to raise money for funeral and medical expenses for the two children, family friend Anita Widby wrote that Karen had been trying to gain custody of the children for ""over a year."" Last week, Karen was finally granted weekly visitation rights. When she showed up at the kids' home on Friday, she was reportedly told that the boy was staying at a friend's house and that the girl was unable to walk. Karen immediately took the girl for medical treatment. Karen learned later that evening that her grandson had been discovered under the hallway floorboards of the home.



""These injuries are presumed to be from her mother and the mother’s boyfriend,"" Widby wrote.

There are conflicting reports about the children's respective ages. The girl has been listed as either 6 or 7 years old, while the boy was either 5 or 6 at the time of his death.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cops-shouldnt-be-responding-to-rapes,2022-12-18
Cotton leads Republicans in demanding answers from Biden on abandoned Americans and Afghan allies,"A group of Republican senators, led by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), is seeking answers from the Biden administration on the exact number of Americans and Afghan allies abandoned in Afghanistan.

The Republicans on Thursday wrote a letter to President Joe Biden that also requests information on the vetting process being used for evacuees who are on their way to the United States.

""The signatories of this letter may have differing opinions about whether the United States should have maintained a military presence in Afghanistan, but we all agree that the arbitrary and poorly-planned method by which you withdrew from Afghanistan caused this crisis,"" the letter stated.

""We request thorough, unclassified answers to these questions that can be made available to the general public. Americans need to see that the United States will not abandon them to terrorists abroad forever,"" the senators wrote.

America's longest war ended Monday when Biden completed the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. The almost 20-year conflict cost an estimated $2 trillion and the lives of nearly 2,500 U.S. troops and about 240,000 Afghans.

According to the Biden administration, more than 123,000 persons have been evacuated from Afghanistan since Aug. 14, the day before the Taliban took control of the capital Kabul, though U.S. troops only assisted with the evacuation of 79,000 civilians on military aircrafts, according to the New York Post.

The senators pointed out that only 4.5% of those evacuees, about 5,500 individuals, were ""self-identified"" as American citizens. The exact number of Americans abandoned in the country by the Biden administration remains unknown, though officials estimated that as many as 250 Americans were still in the country after the U.S. completed its exit.

The letter asked Biden to clarify exactly how many American citizens remain in Afghanistan, as well as how many green-card holders and special immigrant visa applicants were abandoned in the country. It further requests details on the vetting process used to admit ""more than 57,000 Afghans who are not American citizens, green-card holders, or SIV applicants or their families"" into the United States.

Speaking on Fox News on Friday, Cotton said Biden performed a ""bait and switch"" on Americans by promising to get all of our citizens and allies out and failing to do so.

""The administration is going to have to tell the American people the truth sooner rather than later, but we need it sooner, because currently they're flying in approximately 4,000 Afghans a day. And we don't really know who many of these people are — because this is one of the biggest bait and switches in American politics,"" Cotton said.

""Joe Biden appealed to the generosity and the sense of honor of the American people who rightly wanted to save all those loyal Afghans who worked alongside our troops for the last 20 years. But his own administration now admits that they left the vast majority, that's their words, the vast majority of those Afghans who had been reviewed and vetted in Afghanistan,"" he continued.

""That means that tens of thousands of Afghans who had no direct connection to our military were evacuated out of the country and now are en route to our country in the days ahead,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cori-bush-blm-police-palestine,2021-09-03
Couple charged with felony child neglect claims the 'abandoned child' is actually a murderous adult scam artist with dwarfism,"An Indiana couple accused of abandoning their child is speaking out and insisting that the child is not a child at all — but a 22-year-old scam artist from Ukraine.

What are the details?

Michael and Kristine Barnett, who are now divorced, adopted the girl, Natalia, in 2010. A court document revealed that Natalia suffers from dwarfism.

Just two years later in 2012, the couple changed their adopted daughter's age to 22 in a probate court prior to leaving the United States to relocate to Canada.

When the Barnetts left the U.S. with their two sons, they left Natalia behind in Indiana. The couple also reportedly paid rent for the apartment in which they left Natalia, but said that they ""did not financially support"" their adopted daughter.

Last week, officials charged the Barnetts with two counts of felony neglect of a dependent. A Tippecanoe County judge issued warrants for Michael and Kristine on Tuesday. Natalia told investigators during a 2014 interview that she is from Ukraine and was adopted through an agency in 2008. She also said she has not seen the Barnetts since they moved to Canada.

According to an affidavit, ""Michael Barnett admitted Kristine Barnett told Natalia to tell others Natalia looked young but was actually 22."" The New York Post reported that Michael also admitted to detectives that he knew Natalia was a minor when he and Kristine left the U.S.

However, an attorney for Michael told NBC News that his client, who plans to surrender Wednesday, insists that he and his ex-wife were victims of fraud during the adoption process and were led to believe that Natalia was a child.

Kristine told WISH-TV that Natalia was diagnosed as a sociopath and a psychopath, and also claimed that Natalia is an adult who was between the ages of 18 and 22 at the time of adoption and presented herself as a minor. In a Facebook post, Kristine insisted that the allegations are ""false charges.""



The couple's story is eerily similar to the plot of 2009 movie, ""The Orphan,"" in which a family adopts a child who turns out to be a murderous adult who suffers from dwarfism.

What else?

In an interview with the Daily Mail, Kristine said that Natalia was dangerous and tried to kill her adopted family.

Things were immediately amiss when the couple brought Natalia home, Krisine told the outlet, claiming that Natalia had an expansive vocabulary for a girl her age and an active menstrual cycle.

Conflicting doctors' reports regarding Natalia's have also added to the confusion. Upon adoption, a doctor estimated her age at approximately 8 years old. Two years later, however, another doctor estimated that Natalia was approximately 11 years old.

Kristine also said that Natalia began threatening her new family after the adoption and tried to poison Kristine and push her into an electric fence. She added that the family took Natalia to a psychiatric hospital for help, where doctors diagnosed her with significant mental illness. During treatment, Natalia reportedly admitted her real age.

A doctor's report later found that Natalia is actually an adult. The report stats that she has reportedly ""made a career of perpetuating her age façade"" and has been successful in deceiving others about her real age.

Kristine told the Daily Mail that after Natalia received treatment, she helped the girl get on her feet with a social security number and sources of state assistance. The girl was reportedly evicted from an apartment in 2014 and went on to pose as a child for another family, Kristine said.

In 2016, an unnamed couple reportedly attempted to adopt Kristine, but the Barnetts filed an objection, saying that the adoption was a farce because Natalia is an adult — not a child. The unnamed couple reportedly dropped the guardianship petition, Kristine told the outlet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/corpse-of-young-boy-found-under-floorboards-of-his-home-his-sister-found-with-burned-scalp-cracked-ribs,2019-09-25
"COVID-19 lockdowns are the 'greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history' besides slavery, AG Barr says","Attorney General William Barr was heavily critical of the COVID-19 lockdown measures that have been implemented across the world this year, saying they represent an almost unprecedented ""intrusion on civil liberties,"" CNN reported.

Barr was speaking at a Constitution Day celebration put on by Hillsdale College in Michigan, when he was asked about the legal ramifications of orders that restrict people from going to church.

""You know, putting a national lockdown, stay at home orders, is like house arrest,"" Barr said. ""Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history.""

State and local government leaders in March implemented various levels of stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China. Many of those orders were put in place after March 13, when President Donald Trump called for them for 15, and later 30 days.

The president has since claimed that the lockdown measures saved ""millions of lives,"" although the COVID-19 death toll in the U.S. is now heading toward the 240,000 death projection from the White House that seemed extreme to many at the time. Also, there is evidence of a significant death toll directly resulting from the lockdowns themselves in the form of suicides and overdoses.

What else did Barr say?

Barr spoke on a wide variety of topics at the event, including Black Lives Matter, which he accused of not having real interest in black lives at all. From The Federalist:

""They're interested in props, a small number of blacks who are killed by police during conflicts with police—usually less than a dozen a year—who they can use as props to achieve a much broader political agenda,"" he said. Barr instead views the priorities for black American lives as ""not only keeping people alive, but also having prosperity and flourishing their communities.""



""Most deaths in the inner city of young black males below the age of 44…is being shot by another black person,"" he noted. The left likes to talk about ""root causes,"" Barr said, hinting at claims of systemic racism. But all the political changes the BLM movement demands ""depend on peaceful streets at the end of the day.""

Barr also addressed criticism from Justice Department employees who feel he has been overly partisan in the way he does his job.

""Name one successful organization or institution where the lowest level employees' decisions are deemed sacrosanct, there aren't. There aren't any letting the most junior members set the agenda,"" Barr said. ""It might be a good philosophy for a Montessori preschool, but it is no way to run a federal agency.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cotton-republicans-answers-biden-abandoned-americans,2020-09-17
"Accidental COVID-19 laboratory-leak theory must be taken seriously and investigated, leading scientists declare","The theory that the novel coronavirus was unleashed upon the world through a laboratory leak must be taken seriously until proven wrong by a data-driven investigation, Reuters reported, citing a group of leading scientists.

What are the details?

The outlet focused on a Friday letter from 18 scientists that was published in the journal Science indicating ""more investigation is still needed to determine the origin of the pandemic.""

Authors of the letter include Ravindra Gupta, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Cambridge; Jesse Bloom, who studies the evolution of viruses at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; and David Relman, professor of microbiology at Stanford.

Their letter states that ""theories of accidental release from a lab and [animal-to-human transmission] both remain viable,"" and that ""knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks.""

Lab-leak theory not taken seriously enough

The scientists who penned the letter called attention to the findings of a China–World Health Organization joint study released in November that indicated animal-to-human virus transmission from an intermediate host was ""likely to very likely"" while a laboratory incident was ""extremely unlikely.""

However, the letter states that ""the two theories were not given balanced consideration. Only 4 of the 313 pages of the report and its annexes addressed the possibility of a laboratory accident"" and that WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said as much while offering ""to provide additional resources to fully evaluate the possibility.""

The scientists who penned the letter indicated they possess ""relevant expertise"" on the subject and that they ""agree with the WHO director-general, the United States, and 13 other countries, and the European Union that greater clarity about the origins of this pandemic is necessary and feasible to achieve.""

""A proper investigation should be transparent, objective, data-driven, inclusive of broad expertise, subject to independent oversight, and responsibly managed to minimize the impact of conflicts of interest,"" the letter adds. ""Public health agencies and research laboratories alike need to open their records to the public. Investigators should document the veracity and provenance of data from which analyses are conducted and conclusions drawn, so that analyses are reproducible by independent experts.""

The letter from the scientists ended with kudos to China, saying that ""in this time of unfortunate anti-Asian sentiment in some countries, we note that at the beginning of the pandemic, it was Chinese doctors, scientists, journalists, and citizens who shared with the world crucial information about the spread of the virus — often at great personal cost.""

Anything else?

The notion that COVID-19 was leaked from a Wuhan, China, laboratory has long been a point of contention. Reports emerged in April 2020 reflecting that very theory.

Former President Donald Trump said last spring he was very confident that the coronavirus originated from a Wuhan virology lab, as did the majority of American intelligence agencies and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

In September, Twitter reportedly suspended the account of Chinese virologist Dr. Li-Meng Yan just hours after she told Fox News host Tucker Carlson that China intentionally manufactured and released the COVID-19 virus.

And just prior to President Joe Biden taking office in January, the U.S. State Department said it had new evidence possibly pointing to the coronavirus coming from a Wuhan lab — and that Chinese lab researchers might have been infected with COVID-19 before the first identified case of the outbreak.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/couple-charged-with-felony-child-neglect-claims-the-abandoned-child-is-actually-a-murderous-adult-scam-artist-with-dwarfism,2021-05-14
"Chairman of the Lancet's COVID-19 Commission 'pretty convinced' pandemic's origin from 'US lab biotechnology,' suggests governments aren't investigating because even more 'dangerous research underway ","The chairman of the Lancet's COVID-19 Commission has come forward to say that he is ""pretty convinced"" that the pandemic's origin is from ""U.S. lab biotechnology."" He also warns that even more dangerous research is happening right now – which could be why governments don't seem to be interested in investigating the origins of COVID-19.

Jeffrey Sachs is the director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, the president of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, winner of the 2015 Blue Planet Prize, a best-selling author, and a Chairman of the Lancet's COVID-19 Commission.

In November 2020, Sachs assembled a task force for the prestigious medical journal to determine the origins of COVID-19. He hand-selected Dr. Peter Daszak – the president of EcoHealth Alliance – to be the chairman of the task force. However, Daszak recused himself from the investigation in June 2021, following accusations of a conflict of interest.

Daszak had deep ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars of National Institutes of Health funding to the Chinese lab. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Daszak has vehemently argued that COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease that jumped from animals to humans. Furthermore, he vociferously argued that suggesting that COVID-19 originated from a lab leak is a baseless conspiracy theory.

By September 2021, the task force organized by the Lancet's COVID-19 Commission was disbanded because of EcoHealth's conflict-of-interest issues.

Sachs said at the time, ""I just didn't want a task force that was so clearly involved with one of the main issues of this whole search for the origins, which was EcoHealth Alliance.""

Last week, Sachs told Current Affairs that he appointed Daszak to the task force dedicated to discovering the origins of COVID-19 because he said to himself, ""Well, here’s a guy who is so connected, he would know.""

Sachs added, ""And then I realized he was not telling me the truth. And it took me some months, but the more I saw it, the more I resented it.""

Sachs revealed that he disbanded the task force because other members were ""part of this thing.""

He noted that the NIH had been hiding documents from the public – which were later revealed by a Freedom of Information Act request. Emails exposed by a FOIA request revealed that officials with the NIH and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases were concerned that EcoHealth could be conducting gain-of-function experiments at the Wuhan lab.

Sachs noted that Daszak should have informed him that EcoHealth Alliance was ""manipulating the viruses.""

Sachs said that he requested a research proposal from Daszak, but the EcoHealth head allegedly balked, ""No, my lawyer says I can’t give it to you.""

A video went viral last month featuring Sachs proclaiming that ""after two years of intensive work,"" he is ""pretty convinced"" that COVID-19 originated from ""U.S. lab biotechnology, not out of nature.""

""So it’s a blunder in my view of biotech, not an accident of a natural spillover,"" he said. ""We don’t know for sure, I should be absolutely clear.""

Sachs noted, ""But there’s enough evidence that it should be looked into. And it’s not being investigated, not in the United States, not anywhere. And I think for real reasons that they don’t want to look underneath the rug.""

In the interview with Current Affairs editor Nathan Robinson, Sachs suggested that scientists were ""creating a narrative"" of COVID's origins early in the pandemic by collectively claiming that COVID-19 naturally originated from the Wuhan wet market without definitive evidence.

Sachs asked, ""Did we find an animal? No. Do we have an explanation of where that furin cleavage site came in? No. We don’t have an explanation of the timing, which doesn’t quite look right.""

He accused health officials and the media of pulling a ""kind of misdirection"" since February 2020.

Sachs believes the laboratory hypothesis is ""very plausible.""

""The alternative that is the right one to look at is part of a very extensive research program that was underway from 2015 onward, funded by the NIH, by Tony Fauci, in particular NIAID, and it was to examine the spillover potential of SARS-like viruses,"" Sachs told Robinson.

Sachs suggested that COVID-19 may have come from gain-of-function research, ""There was a lot of research underway in the United States and China on taking SARS-like viruses, manipulating them in the laboratory, and creating potentially far more dangerous viruses.""

""We know that at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the scientists there had been trained by American scientists to use advanced bioengineering methodologies,"" Sachs explained. ""And in particular, we have scientists in North Carolina, Texas, and so forth who do this kind of research, believe in it, argue for it, and say that they don’t want any regulations on it and so on. And they were in close contact with Wuhan Institute of Virology, and they were part of a joint research group that was stitched together by something called EcoHealth Alliance.""

Sachs described EcoHealth Alliance as a ""vehicle for funding from the U.S. government, especially from the National Institutes of Health, and especially from Tony Fauci’s unit, the NIAID.""

Sachs said Dr. Anthony Fauci and the NIH ""haven’t shown us anything"" about possible research at the Wuhan lab.



""So you saw a narrative being created,"" he continued. ""And the scientists are not acting like scientists. Because when you’re acting like a scientist, you’re pursuing alternative hypotheses.""

Robinson asked Sachs why governments aren't vigorously investigating the origins of a disease that has killed more than 6.4 million people in less than three years.

Sachs responded, ""There are at least two reasons why they might be doing what they’re doing. One is, as you say, the implications are huge. Imagine if this came out of a lab. And we have, by some estimates, about 18 million dead worldwide from this. That’s not the official count. But that’s the estimated excess mortality from COVID. Well, the implications of that—the ethical, the moral, the geopolitical—everything is enormous.""

The chairman of the Lancet's COVID-19 Commission added, ""But there’s a second matter that is really important, too. One thing that is rather clear to me is that there is so much dangerous research underway right now under the umbrella of biodefense or other things that we don’t know about, that is not being properly controlled.""

He suggested that governments could be saying, ""Don’t poke your nose into that.""

On Saturday, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said, ""The fact that virtually no one in Washington DC wants to investigate the origins of COVID-19 should tell you all you need to know about the origins of COVID-19.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/covid-19-lockdowns-are-the-greatest-intrusion-on-civil-liberties-in-american-history-besides-slavery-ag-barr-says,2022-08-08
"CPAC takes action against Mitt Romney after voting for new witnesses, evidence in Trump trial","Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, announced Friday that Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) would not be invited to this year's gathering.

""BREAKING: The 'extreme conservative' and Junior Senator from the great state of Utah, @SenatorRomney is formally NOT invited to #CPAC2020,"" Schlapp said.

Schlapp's announcement came after Romney voted to allow new witnesses and documents in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. Romney's vote was motivated by his desire to hear from John Bolton, Romney's spokesperson, Liz Johnson, said, The Hill reported.

Romney and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) — two of the most moderate Republican lawmakers — were the only two Republicans who voted in favor of additional witnesses and evidence.

However, because Democrats needed four Republican votes, Trump's trial will likely end next Wednesday in an acquittal without having heard from additional witnesses.

Romney has spoken at CPAC several times, including in 2012 when he secured the Republican nomination for president, and in 2013 after losing the election to then-President Barack Obama.

Sen. Mike Lee (R), who also represents Utah in the Senate, defended Romney on Friday, calling him a ""good friend"" and ""excellent senator.""

Anti-Critical Race Theory parents told to die by Fairfax County official,"Crowds gathered outside the Luther Jackson Middle School in Virginia, where concerned parents were rallying against critical race theory being taught to students in Fairfax County Public Schools. During Thursday's ""Stop CRT Rally,"" a PTA and NAACP official spewed rhetoric against the parents, including proclaiming, ""Let them die!""

An event flyer for the ""Stop CRT Rally"" stated: ""It's not about race or equity, it's about a Communist Radical Takeover of America!"" At the rally, there were counterprotests, including a diatribe delivered by federal employee Michelle Leete, who is also the vice president of training at the Virginia Parent-Teacher Association, vice president of communications for the Fairfax County PTA, and first vice president of the Fairfax County NAACP.

Leete lambasted anti-critical race theory parents, even going so far as to say, ""Let them die!""

So let's meet and remain steadfast, steadfast, in speaking truth, tearing down double standards, and refuting double talk. Let's not allow any double downing on lies. Let's prepare our children for a world they deserve. Let's deny this off-key band of people that are anti-education, anti-teacher, anti-equity, anti-history, anti-racial reckoning, anti-opportunities, anti-help people, anti-diversity, anti-platform, anti-science, anti-change agent, anti-social justice, anti-health care, anti-worker, anti-LGBTQ+, anti-children, anti-health care, anti-worker, anti-environment, anti-admissions policy change, anti-inclusion, anti-live-and-let-live people. Let them die. Don't let these uncomfortable people, don't let these uncomfortable people deter us from our bold march forward.

Asra Nomani, an education activist and vice president for strategy and investigations for the watchdog group Parents Defending Education, shared footage from the rally and counterprotest on Twitter.

""I listened, stunned, as Michelle Leete, an executive of the NAACP and the PTA, put a target on the backs of parents just because they have a different point of view,"" said Nomani, whose son recently graduated from Fairfax County Public Schools.



""What we heard tonight was hate speech, pure and simple. It was shocking that anyone would cheer and applaud a call to violence,"" Nomani told the Daily Wire, ""Ironically, her hateful, intolerant words are a perfect illustration of the divisive ideology of critical race theory in action. In the name of tolerance, it preaches intolerance and is a betrayal of all values of humanity and decency.""

Harry Jackson, who has three children in the Fairfax public school system and is president-elect of the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Parent Teacher Student Association, told the Daily Wire, ""I was in shock looking at the crowd, watching Ms. Leete pander to white liberals with her hateful rhetoric … Her call to violence against every kind of parent, including parents who oppose changes to admissions policies at schools like TJ, also reveal that she has a serious conflict of interest.""



In May, Nomani delivered a stirring speech where she slammed the Fairfax County Public Schools board for pushing ""anti-racism"" propaganda.

""And then by the fall, every single one of you voted to remove the merit-based race-blind admissions test to TJ. And we pled with you, as Asians, as an immigrant (I came at the age of 4, I knew no English), and you didn't listen to us,"" Nomani scolded the school board.



Thomas Jefferson School for Science and Technology, ranked the top math school in the country, instituted a ""merit lottery,"" where race became a factor in admissions and academic qualifications were a lesser determinant.

The Daily Mail reported that admissions data for the class of 2025 at the prestigious school shows that black students rose from 1% in 2021 to 7%, Hispanics grew from 3% to 11%, white students increased from 18% to 22%, but Asian students dropped from 73% to 54% because of the new standards.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/covid-origin-lab-lancet-jeffrey-sachs,2021-07-16
"Cuomo faces bipartisan condemnation, calls for resignation following latest nursing home revelations","New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's political troubles intensified Friday, as he faced the fallout from the latest bombshell in the widening nursing home scandal that has engulfed his administration: an admission from one of his top lieutenants that his office withheld information from the New York legislature because they were afraid that former President Donald Trump would tweet negatively about the governor's efforts if the information became public.

The admission, which was first reported by the New York Post, consisted of an admission from top lieutenant Melissa DeRosa, who said in a video call with Democratic leaders in New York that the Cuomo administration ignored requests for information from the legislature because, ""[R]ight around the same time, [Trump] turns this into a giant political football. He starts tweeting that we killed everyone in nursing homes.. And basically, we froze.""

The Cuomo administration released a partial transcript of the video conference on Friday, and many New York Democrats offered prompt condemnation of Cuomo's actions.

Perhaps most alarming for the Cuomo administration, 14 New York Democrats (so far) signed on to a petition calling for Cuomo's emergency pandemic powers to be revoked.











The petition states that ""it is clear that the expanded emergency powers granted to the Governor are no longer appropriate,"" and calls on the Senate to repeal them as expeditiously as possible, even before they are set to automatically expire on April 30th.

Cuomo's leadership during the early stages of the pandemic was originally a source of pride for national Democrats, who often favorably contrasted Cuomo's decisions and tactics with former President Donald Trump. He was frequently invited as a guest on national news programs and was hailed as a model of leadership, which ultimately led him to author a book about his handling of the pandemic.

However, as the breadth of Cuomo's mishandling of the nursing home crisis in his home state has come under increasing scrutiny, many Democrats have turned sour on Cuomo. Even liberal progressive network CNN, which allowed Cuomo to field softball interviews with his brother, anchor Chris Cuomo in spite of widespread criticism from media watchdogs about the obvious conflict of interests this posed, has begun to acknowledge that Cuomo's handling of the coronavirus crisis was not as praiseworthy as they originally believed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cpac-takes-action-against-mitt-romney,2021-02-13
CNN initiates 'thorough review' of report on sources Chris Cuomo used to obtain info on his brother's accusers,"The CNN cable news network said they were initiating a ""thorough review"" of the claims made in a report saying their anchor Chris Cuomo used his news sources to help his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, navigate a sexual abuse scandal.

The revelation was included in a release of transcripts Monday from an investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James into the alleged misconduct.

The transcripts included an exchange where the CNN anchor admitted to investigator Jennifer Kennedy Park that he used his sources to help his brother.

""I would — when asked, I would reach out to sources, other journalists, to see if they had heard of anybody else coming out,"" said Chris Cuomo in the transcripts.

He went on to claim that he never ultimately carried out the research for his brother.

Chris Cuomo also defended himself in the transcripts against accusations that he was using his privileged position to give his brother favorable coverage at the news network.

""You know, the idea that I could ever report on my brother has always been an absurdity to me,"" said Chris Cuomo. ""That's never been my intention. That's never been my practice. And so, look, this was just — you know, just wanted to be able to help my brother. That's it.""

CNN's media reporter Brian Stelter posted the company's statement about the report on his Twitter account.

""The thousands of pages of additional transcripts and exhibits that were released by the NY Attorney General deserve a thorough review and consideration,"" read the statement. ""We will be having conversations and seeking additional clarity about their significance as they relate to CNN over the next several days.""

The phrase ""Chris Cuomo"" trended nationally on social media over the report and over CNN's brief response.

Andrew Cuomo resigned from the governor's office in Aug. 10 over the sexual assault allegations, and has denied most of the accusations while downplaying others as a misunderstanding.

Critics of the media have lambasted CNN for ignoring the potential conflict of interest created by Cuomo interviewing his brother before the scandals broke out.

Video: Dad gets in massive brawl with students on high school campus. Conflicts between students and his sons apparently sparked it.,"A father was involved in a massive brawl with students on an Arizona high school campus earlier this week, after which the dad and a student were arrested. Much of the melee was caught on video, and conflicting stories about what led to the brawl have arisen.

What are the details?

Willie Smith, 40, was called Tuesday to Tucson High School to pick up his two sons, who were being sent home following an incident with another group of students, KOLD-TV reported, citing the interim complaint.

School staff and safety officers told Smith he and his sons should leave through a rear exit instead of through campus to avoid a confrontation, KOLD said, citing the document.

But Smith said he didn’t feel they needed to do that since school staff didn't tell him his sons had done anything wrong to be sent home, the station said, citing the complaint.

In addition, Smith allegedly told staff if the ongoing issue wasn't addressed, there would be a problem, the station reported. The document indicated that Smith said, “If it’s going down, it’s going down here,” KOLD reported, adding that officers said Smith was referring to his sons protecting themselves if they were provoked.

Smith then took his sons through the courtyard during lunch, the station reported.

Dad in 'mutual combat with a student'

While Smith and his sons walked through the courtyard, there was an exchange between students and Smith’s sons, and a fight broke out, KOLD said, citing the document, which also said Smith engaged in “mutual combat with a student.”

Smith admitted to fighting with the student and claimed the student was assaulting his son, the station said, citing the complaint.

KOLD said video and witness statements couldn't confirm who threw the first punch.

Smith was arrested on a felony charge of disrupting an educational institute, Tucson police said, according to the station.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Police added to the station that a 15-year-old boy is facing a charge of disorderly conduct-fighting.

Tucson Unified School District told KVOA-TV that at least 14 students were involved in the fight and may face discipline. The station added that Smith also was charged with aggravated assault.

Smith's sister speaks out

Rosalina Martinez — Smith's sister — told KPNX-TV that one of Smith's sons has special needs, the other son was defending him, and that both of them have been bullied by the other students for about a month.



“When [my brother] was supposed to leave the campus, they asked him if he could go around the block to get to his car because [there] were attempted attacks toward his kids,” Martinez told KPNX. “So my brother said, ‘Why do I have to go around? My car is right there. I’m not a criminal. I’m not doing nothing wrong.’”

She told the station that when her brother and his sons walked out to their cars, the students attacked them.

“He’s just pushing them off him,"" Martinez added to KPNX. ""You can see in the videos that he’s pulled down, from his shirt to the ground. Then you can see a bunch of children — because they are children — [with] closed fists hitting him in his head, kicking him in his body when he’s on the [ground]. When he’s trying to get up, that’s when they take that picture that shows that he has his arm on this kid’s neck. In reality, what he’s trying to do, is get up, and that’s when they take the picture.”

She added to the station that her brother ""never hits anybody, all he is doing is protecting his kids from being attacked.""

“This shouldn’t have happened,” Martinez also told KPNX. “The staff knew that there were plans of other people attacking them; they should have escorted him to safety.”

Video shows at least 30 students involved in fight at Tucson High School youtu.be

Superintendent blames the father

Gabriel Trujillo, the district's superintendent, told KVOA that Smith started the fight and is to blame.

""We are not going to stand for parents coming onto campus and putting hands on kids,"" Trujillo added to the station.

Trujillo also said Smith ""took it upon himself to charge out, in an unauthorized fashion, out into the courtyard and physically attack one of other students. This is what triggered a chain reaction of other fights as two factions of students began to square off against themselves, each other and certainly this parent,"" KVOA reported.

The superintendent added to the station, ""I hold this parent responsible for the level of violence we saw ...""

In addition, Trujillo told KOLD-TV in a subsequent story that there was a conflict between two students on Monday, which social media posts that evening.

“The conflict with [the] two students is a relationship with a significant other who had relationships with both students,” Trujillo told the station, adding that the conflict escalated Tuesday morning, after which school staff isolated the two students and called their parents to pick them up.

“Classic tale of two young men passionate, enraged, jealous, going after each other over the affections of someone else,” Trujillo added to KOLD.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cuomo-faces-bipartisan-condemnation-calls-for-resignation-following-latest-nursing-home-revelations,2022-05-06
Daily Mail blasts U.K. government for heavily redacting emails related to origins of COVID-19,"Details of a teleconference on the COVID-19 pandemic response held in early 2020 between leading scientists including Dr. Anthony Fauci remain shrouded in secrecy after the U.K. government heavily redacted documents requested by a newspaper.

The U.K. Daily Mail submitted a Freedom of Information request to its government for emails relating to the secretive meeting between British and American health officials. The requestwas answered by a cache of 32 emails that were almost entirely redacted, leaving the details of what was discussed on that teleconference call unknown, the paper reported.

What is known is that in the early days of the pandemic, a group of scientists led by Fauci, Dr. Jeremy Farrar, the director of the London-based megacharity Wellcome Trust, and Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance, among others, held the call ""in total confidence"" and that after the call, the public campaign by many of the participants to stifle discussion of the lab-leak theory intensified.

Before the conference call, some of the world's top virologists who participated had raised concerns that the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus had features that ""(potentially) look engineered"" — but after this call those scientists reversed their opinions and publicly condemned the hypothesis that COVID-19 escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology as a conspiracy theory.

Since the call was held on February 1, 2020, EcoHealth Alliance's ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology have come to light, and Fauci's repeated assurances that the U.S. National Institutes of Health did not fund risky virus research at the Wuhan lab have been shown to be false. It is in the public interest to learn what was discussed on the call, to know if top health officials had a conflict of interest in publicly discrediting the lab-leak theory.

However, the Daily Mail reports how the U.K. government is obscuring the details of the call:

The Mail on Sunday requested emails, minutes and notes on the call between Sir Patrick Vallance – Britain's chief scientific adviser – and its organisers Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust medical charity, and Anthony Fauci, the US infectious diseases expert and presidential adviser.



Yet when the documents were released they had page after page redacted with thick lines of black ink by Whitehall officials. Even the names of experts copied in on discussions were blocked – and exchanges as trivial as one Edinburgh biologist's 'thank you' for being invited – leaving only a few basic details about the call visible.



The lines left intact include a demand for the discussions, involving 13 participants around the world, to be conducted in 'total confidence', and an intriguing email line suggesting 'we need to talk about the backbone too, not just the insert'.



That was possibly sent by Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans, a member of the World Health Organisation team that produced a widely criticised report into Covid's origins.

According to the Daily Mail, a request for communications on the origins of COVID-19 between Sir Patrick Vallance, the U.K.'s chief scientific adviser, Farrar, and Fauci were ""rejected on cost grounds,"" even though the government said it had the information requested.

""Such absurd state secrecy is highly contemptuous towards taxpayers and to a world that wants to know what caused this devastating pandemic to guard against similar catastrophes in the future,"" the paper complained.

""Such official obfuscation only serves to fuel concerns over a possible cover-up on Covid's origins – and about Britain's strange silence on issues of such global importance, which surprises some close international allies.""

Reporters first learned of the conference call from a Freedom of Information Act request for Fauci's work-related emails issued by BuzzFeed News. Emails detailing the specifics of what was discussed were redacted. In an interview with USA Today, Fauci said the call was a ""productive back-and-forth conversation where some on the call felt [SARS-CoV-2] could possibly be an engineered virus.""

Details of the call were also discussed by Farrar in his book on the pandemic, where admits to being ""50-50"" on the question of the lab-leak theory after the Feb. 1 call, even though days later he would sign a highly influential statement by leading scientists condemning the lab-leak hypothesis as a conspiracy theory.

Another participant on the call, Dr. Kristian Andersen, a virologist at Scripps Research, had studied the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and wrote in an email to Fauci just before the call that ""some of the features (potentiallly) look engineered."" He also said that several experts who had looked at the virus ""find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory,"" though he would later claim that these scientists changed their opinions as new evidence convinced them it was more likely the virus originated in nature.

A mere three days after the conference call, Andersen emailed Daszak to strategize about pushing back against ""crackpot theories"" suggesting ""this virus being somehow engineered with intent"" when that was ""demonstrably not the case.""

The public ought to know why these scientists changed their opinions so rapidly in light of the fact that many of them were connected to 2014 and 2019 NIH research grants for gain-of-function research in China.

Gain-of-function research involves genetically manipulating a virus to make it more transmissible among mammals, particularly among humans, to study how virus might evolve in nature and develop vaccines or strategies to prevent a pandemic. The 2014 research grant was funded at a time when the U.S. had established a moratorium on federal funding for such research, which had been deemed risky because of the possibility that a lab accident might cause a pandemic.

The 2019 grant proposal revealed that Daszak's group EcoHealth Alliance had sub-awarded NIH money for bat coronavirus research in Wuhan, China.

Documents published by DRASTIC further revealed that in 2018, EcoHealth Alliance applied for a grant to study pathogens to create infectious bat coronaviruses in the Wuhan lab that would be altered to boost their ability to infect human cells. Daszak had proposed to work with Shi Zhengli, the top virologist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, to insert ""appropriate human specific cleavage sites"" into SARS-like viruses, demonstrating that EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan lab were interested in conducting exactly the kind of research that is hypothesized to be related to the origins of COVID-19.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cuomo-sources-gov-sexual-abuse,2021-10-04
Popular children's author has book canceled over 'passive racism',"Children's publisher Scholastic announced they have immediately stopped the sale and distribution of a book over allegations of ""passive racism.""

The announcement came weeks after six Dr. Seuss books were similarly canceled over allegations of racist imagery.

What are the details?

Scholastic announced last week they would immediately stop distribution of ""The Adventures of Ook and Gluk,"" a book originally published in 2010.

The book was written by Dav Pilkey, who is known for writing ""Captain Underpants"" and ""Dog Man,"" two wildly successful children's book series that have sold more than 100 million copies.

In a statement, Scholastic said the decision to cancel the book was made with ""full support"" from Pilkey.

On Monday, March 22, 2021, with the full support of Dav Pilkey, Scholastic halted distribution of the 2010 book The Adventures of Ook and Gluk. Together, we recognize that this book perpetuates passive racism. We are deeply sorry for this serious mistake. Scholastic has removed the book from our websites, stopped fulfillment of any orders (domestically or abroad), contacted our retail partners to explain why this book is no longer available, and sought a return of all inventory. We will take steps to inform schools and libraries who may still have this title in circulation of our decision to withdraw it from publication.

Scholastic did not explain what ""passive racism"" the book contains.

What did Pilkey say?

In an apology uploaded to YouTube, Pilkey said the book promotes ""racial stereotypes"" that are ""harmful"" to Asians.

""About ten years ago I created a book about a group of friends who save the world using Kung Fu and the principles found in Chinese philosophy,"" Pilkey said.

""'The Adventures of Ook and Gluk: Kung-Fu Cavemen from the Future' was intended to showcase diversity, equality, and non-violent conflict resolution,"" he explained. ""But this week it was brought to my attention that this book also contains harmful racial stereotypes and passively racist imagery. I wanted to take this opportunity to publicly apologize for this.""

""It was and is wrong and harmful to my Asian readers, friends, and family, and to all Asian people,"" Pilkey added.

Pilkey explained that Scholastic is ""actively working"" to purge existing copies of the book ""from retail and library shelves."" He added that he would donate his advance and royalties earned from the book to charities.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dad-brawls-with-high-schoolers,2021-03-28
David Brock under investigation for profiting from nonproft,"David Brock, who was described by Time magazine as ""one of the most influential operatives in the Democratic Party,"" is accused of illegally transferring millions of dollars from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity. Brock, the founder of Media Matters for America and a longtime ally of the Clintons, is under investigation for possibly violating tax laws.

Far-left Super PAC American Bridge 21st Century was founded by Brock in 2011, which included the nonprofit group American Bridge Foundation. The AB Foundation is accused of transferring $2.7 million in tax-exempt assets to True Blue Media, a for-profit company owned by Brock that is the parent company of ShareBlue, a for-profit media company now known as The American Independent, according to the Daily Caller.

American Bridge Foundation's transfers to True Blue Media were disclosed in the nonprofit's Form 990s filed to the IRS in 2017 and 2018.

Patriots Foundation, a right-leaning government watchdog, alleged that the transactions violated Internal Revenue Service rules that prohibit nonprofit organizations from using tax-exempt resources to pay personal or private expenses of any key figures connected to the nonprofit. The Iowa-based watchdog filed a complaint with the IRS.

""David Brock, a leading left-wing political consultant, raises millions of dollars every year to influence the media, politics, and campaigns,"" Craig Robinson, the president of the Patriots Foundation, said. ""Behind the scenes, his network of organizations have engaged in very troubling behavior that warrants serious investigation.""

""These complaints we filed provide damning indictment of serious allegations about how his organizations have circumvented rules and exploited the tax-exempt status of the organizations for personal benefit and partisan political purposes, and potentially siphoning millions for improper purposes,"" Robinson told The Daily Beast in a statement.

""We're calling on the IRS to conduct a thorough investigation of Brock's organizations and to hold them accountable for all violations,"" Robinson said.

The complaint stated: ""AB21CF appears to have abandoned any attempts at credibly describing itself as a social welfare organization under section 501(c)(4). Instead, it has become singularly focused on one mission, 'to take on Donald Trump.'""

The document claimed American Bridge 21st Century planned to create ""a 47-person war room to take on Donald Trump with a staff of 23 researchers, a communications team of 16.""

American Bridge President Bradley Beychok said the group's ""investment"" was authorized by the board of directors. ""The investment in True Blue Media, LLC was determined by the Independent Board of Directors to further the mission of AB Foundation,"" Beychok told The Daily Beast.

""To remove any potential conflict of interest, David Brock resigned as an officer and a member of the board of directors [of American Bridge] in 2016, before the first investment was made,"" Beychok said. ""In the interest of transparency, the investments were listed on IRS form 990 as both a grant on Schedule I and on Schedule L. AB Foundation received an industry-standard investment agreement and in turn owns stock in True Blue Media.""

However, the AB Foundation referred to Brock as its chairman as recently as 2018, and Brock currently labels himself as the chairman of American Bridge.

Liberal billionaire George Soros has given donations to American Bridge 21st Century. According to records, American Bridge 21st Century has spent $10 million on anti-Trump advertising in battleground states. Brock has been talking about ""kicking Trump's ass"" since November 2016.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/daily-mail-blasts-u-k-government-for-heavily-redacting-emails-related-to-origins-of-covid-19,2020-04-25
NYC Mayor de Blasio says city plans to 'fully reopen' by July 1 with no restrictions,"New York City will attempt to ""fully reopen"" by the first of July, ending all coronavirus restrictions on restaurants, retail, and other businesses, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday morning on MSNBC.

Citing that more than 6.3 million city residents have been vaccinated against COVID-19, de Blasio said it's now time for the city that was once the global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic — with nearly 800 daily deaths reported in April 2020 — to mostly return to normal life.

""Our plan is to fully reopen New York City on July 1. We are ready for stores to open, for businesses to open, offices, theaters, full strength,"" the mayor said. ""People have gotten vaccinated in extraordinary numbers, 6.3 million in New York City to date.""

During the process of reopening, de Blasio encouraged New Yorkers to be ""smart"" by practicing social distancing and mask-wearing when in public with strangers, but otherwise said the city is confident that the virus is managed to the point where life can return to normal.

""We said a month or so ago, it was the variants versus the vaccination, what was going to win, which one was going to win the race. Vaccination is winning this race ... 6.3 million vaccinations, COVID is plummeting,"" de Blasio said. ""This is going to be the summer of New York City. You're going to see amazing activities, cultural activities coming back. I think people are going to flock to New York City because they want to live again.""

New York City's move to reopen could potentially come into conflict with statewide coronavirus restrictions enacted by Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). The mayor indicated he has not discussed the city's reopening plans with the governor, though he did pledge to work with the state government to achieve full reopening.

""I think the best way to proceed here is to set out the city's vision. We're going to work with the federal government, we're going to work with the state government, but it's quite clear it's time to set a goal and move on that goal,"" de Blasio said.

On Wednesday, Gov. Cuomo announced the state would lift the curfew on outdoor dining for bars and restaurants on May 17. At the end of the month, the 12:00 a.m. curfew on indoor dining will also be lifted. The move was widely seen as an attempt to one-up the state legislature, which had intended to repeal some of Cuomo's executive orders restricting the types of services bars may offer.

New York state has also adopted the new CDC guidance on mask-wearing, which advises that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks outdoors unless they are in a large crowd with strangers.

According to the New York Times COVID-19 tracker only 29% of New York City residents have been fully vaccinated against the virus. The city is reporting an average of 1,803 new cases per day, though this is a 44% decrease from the average number of cases reported two weeks ago. The New York Times labels New York City at ""very high risk"" of exposure to COVID-19.

Mayor de Blasio encouraged those who have not been vaccinated to go and get the free vaccine, which will help New York City fully reopen by immunizing people from the virus.

""Anyone who likes what I'm saying, help us out by going out and getting vaccinated if you haven't already,'"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dav-pilkey-book-pulled-passive-racism,2021-04-29
Delaware Division of Public Heath apologizes for 'fat-shaming' to encourage vaccination,"The Delaware Division of Public Health has issued an apology for a vaccination memo that some people believed was fat-shaming to encourage vaccination.

What are the details?

WBOC-TV reports that Delaware's health department issued an apology following the controversy spurned on by the ad.

The since-deleted ad — which was shared to the department's Facebook page — read, ""Remember when you gained 10 pounds from stress eating? ... You would have to run five miles a day for a week just to lose one pound of fat.""

The ad continued, ""#GettingVaccinated sounds a lot easier. Protect yourself and those you love from the #Delta variant. #VaxxUpDE."" Following outcry, the agency pulled the ad from its social media page and issued an apology.

Fitness experts, according to WBOC, are speaking out as the Facebook post has since been taken down.



Jennifer Kaufmann, a personal trainer at Rise Fitness & Adventure, told the station that shaming an audience into getting a vaccine will ""only going to have the opposite effect.""

""I personally believe in the vaccine. I am vaccinated; I still take offense to this,"" Kaufmann said. ""I think it's just mean-spirited. It's a low blow.""

Kaufmann added, ""For us to look at public places and say 'This is a risk,' we are missing the whole boat here. If we are so worried about everyone's health, the gym should be the number one place everyone is going.""

In a statement, a spokesperson for the agency said, ""We have updated an early post promoting vaccination. We understand some were offended by the post and we sincerely apologize for our word choice. It was not intentional. DPH supports all activities that contribute to a healthy lifestyle including exercise, eating well and getting recommended vaccinations.""

The department also added a graphic to its apology, which read, ""Sometimes we don't have a way with words. You should still get vaccinated though.""

Anything else to know?

Tara Gush, emotional wellness and integrated health coach for Soul Vikality, said that she has concerns over the agency's vaccination initiatives.

""I think one of my statements [to DPH] was 'Why are we giving out donuts and free beer to people to do something that is healthy for them but then we're giving them these unhealthy rewards in order to do that?' I just feel like it sends a really conflicting message.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/david-brock-investigations-media-matters,2021-08-20
"Delaware state auditor Kathleen McGuiness found guilty of official misconduct, still running for re-election. Senate calls for her removal from office","Last month, Delaware state auditor Kathleen McGuiness was found guilty of three misdemeanor charges, including official misconduct, conflict of interest, and structuring a contract to avoid a procurement policy. Since McGuiness’ guilty verdict, Senate Democrats have called for her resignation.



McGuiness is the first sitting official in Delaware to be charged with a crime.

The state auditor was accused of arranging payments to a public policy communications company that strategically sidestepped Delaware’s procurement guidelines. The payment amounts were just under the legal threshold. Payments above $50,000 require a bidding process.

The other two misdemeanor charges against McGuiness were related to the hiring of her daughter, Saylar McGuiness. McGuiness hired Saylar under her direct supervision and allowed her benefits that were not available to other staff. For example, McGuiness permitted her daughter to work remotely, drive a state vehicle, and “bank hours.”

The structured payments and conflict of interest charges ultimately amounted to the official misconduct charge. Two felony counts of theft and witness intimidation were dropped.

Attorney General Kathy Jennings stated in a press release, “From the moment I took office, I promised that no one would be either above the law or beneath justice.” She continued, “I am grateful for the jury’s judgment, for the excellent work of our trial team, and above all else for the courage of the whistleblowers and witnesses who came forward and made accountability possible. Our office’s — and the jury’s —message is clear: abuse of office will not be tolerated in Delaware.”

WMDT spoke to McGuiness shortly after the ruling and said that the jury received a ""biased, cherry-picked account of the truth.""

Governor John Carney released a statement in response to pressure from the senate to remove McGuiness from office. He explained that “the Governor has no power to act until after the entry of a judgment of conviction by the Superior Court.”

Two weeks after the verdict, Delaware Democratic House Caucus wrote Governor John Carney. The letter stated, “The crimes the State Auditor has been found guilty of meet the Constitutional criteria of ‘misbehavior in office,’ and that as a result, you are obligated to remove her from office upon entry of a judgment of conviction by the Superior Court.” Senate voted 13-7 to hold a removal hearing for McGuiness.

Since then, Speaker of the House Pete Schwartzkopf voiced support for McGuiness. He called the senate’s actions nothing more than “political theater.” Senate cannot move forward with the removal hearing without Schwartzkopf’s approval.

Schwartzkopf argued that, even if a hearing was held and the senate voted to remove McGuiness, the ruling would only be a vote “to ultimately ask the governor to remove the state auditor from office – a request he’s not required to fulfill, and a request he’s indicated that he wouldn’t carry out at this time anyway.”

McGuiness has made it clear that she will “absolutely not” be resigning.

This week, WRDE-LD interviewed McGuiness about her thoughts on the guilty ruling. The auditor insists that she is blameless. “I profess my innocence maybe other folks should do the same.”

In response to the payment structuring charge, she stated, “I did work with the owner in 2016 but we are not friends.” McGuiness continued, “He did not do anything for me since then. He is very talented with communications and policy they do not just work on campaigns.”

McGuiness is running for re-election in September’s primary against candidate Lydia York.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/de-blasio-nyc-fully-reopen-july-1,2022-08-05
Dem strategist threatens 'scorched-earth' crusade against Trump's family over Hunter Biden pressure,"A Democratic strategist who served as an adviser to Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign has promised to go after President Donald Trump's family if Republicans continue pressuring Hunter Biden over his Ukraine business dealings.

Timothy O'Brien said on MSNBC over the weekend that there will be a ""scorched-earth"" crusade against Trump's children if Republicans ""make an issue out of Hunter Biden.""

""If the Republicans really want to make an issue out of Hunter Biden, which is very low-hanging fruit that I don't think most Democratic voters care about anyway, there is going to be a scorched-earth response aimed at all of the Trump children that is unlike anything they've experienced thus far in the media,"" O'Brien said.

O'Brien, who is an executive editor at Bloomberg's news conglomerate, also claimed that the entire Trump family are ""grifters,"" a suggestion that their wealth is illegitimate.

""The Trump family are epic grifters, and this goes back generations,"" O'Brien said. ""Fred Trump made his money by intersecting with both the federal government and state government in New York. Donald came up through New York, intersecting with local government and in Atlantic City.""

""Now they are now in the White House, and all of them are dipping their faces into the till,"" he claimed.

When show host Joe Reid asked if his boss — former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg — would be funding the ""scorched-earth"" campaign, O'Brien said it is ""important"" for voters to see how the Trump family has earned its billions.

""I think it's an important moment for the American people to be woke about how rampant the financial conflicts of interest are among Trump's children and the president himself,"" O'Brien said.

After ending his presidential campaign last month, Bloomberg endorsed Joe Biden for president and has indicated that he will continue to use his vast fortune to ensure Trump loses re-election in November.

Demi Lovato describes feeling shame over whiteness after high-profile killings of black people,"Pop star Demi Lovato said she felt shame about being white because of killings of black people committed by white people in the past several months, she wrote in a piece for Vogue.

Lovato described the conflicted feelings she had about what she should do in response to apparent racial injustice.

""At first, I was self-conscious about speaking out about these issues because I didn't want anyone to feel like it wasn't genuine,"" Lovato wrote. ""I also felt like I wanted to call every person of color that I knew and apologize, which I know isn't the right thing to do either. Like a lot of people, I didn't know what to do.""

""All I knew was that I hated that I shared the same skin color as the people accused of committing heinous crimes against Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and many, many other Black lives,"" Lovato said.

Lovato pointed out that after the video of Ahmaud Arbery's killing was released to the public in May, her social media habits changed.

""My relationship with social media before lockdown was very typical,"" Lovato said. ""If you scroll down my feed, it was mainly all glamour shots and pictures of me looking cute and fancy. But then there's this sudden shift around the time Ahmaud Arbery was killed. Now my feed is filled with information about racial injustice and what we can do to help.""

One effect of recent high-profile killings of black people by white people, and the subsequent protests, has been an increase in discussion about white privilege and a push for white people to reflect on what inherent advantages they might have in life because they are white.

Some of these discussions have gone to extreme levels, resulting in videos of white people kneeling before black people or white people being encouraged to wash the feet of black people as penance for the sins of white people against minorities.

More recently, there have been examples of protesters confronting white people in public places and attempting to harass or intimidate them into raising a fist in support of Black Lives Matter.

During one such scene in Washington, D.C., the mob chanted ""White silence is violence"" as they surrounded a woman who refused to raise her fist. Many, if not most, of the mob doing this was white. The woman later told a reporter she was supportive of Black Lives Matter and had even participated in marches, but didn't feel right about raising her fist in that circumstance.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/delaware-state-auditor-kathleen-mcguiness-found-guilty-of-official-misconduct-still-running-for-re-election-senate-calls-for-her-removal-from-office,2020-09-03
Hong Kong democracy activist calls out LeBron James for social justice hypocrisy,"An activist who protested for democracy in Hong Kong and who has testified in front of Congress called out NBA star LeBron James for being ""hypocritical"" on the issue of social justice, Bloomberg reported.

The activist, Joshua Wong, pointed out that while James is active and vocal about seeking justice for black Americans, he declined to say a word against China's oppression because doing so would put him at some financial risk.

""Defending democracy is vital, but @KingJames only talks loud in the U.S.,"" Wong wrote. ""All he cares about is money, not human rights.""

Wong served two months in jail for participation in the 2014 protests in Hong Kong against the influence of the communist Chinese government.

In the fall, the NBA got into a conflict with the Chinese government because Daryl Morey, an executive for the Houston Rockets, tweeted his support for pro-Democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The NBA has a significant presence in China, and many players have endorsement deals either in China or strongly boosted by sales in China.



China threatened to cut ties with the NBA over the tweet, and players were forced to choose between speaking out against human rights violations by the Chinese government or protecting their own business interests. James, one of the most influential voices in sports, chose the latter.

Instead, James criticized Morey for putting players in an uncomfortable position with his support for Hong Kong. The Los Angeles Lakers star was among players who were in China at the time for a series of preseason basketball games.

""I don't want to get into a word- or sentence-feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand,"" James said after a Lakers game in October in China. ""And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.""

James recently started a group that aims to protect voting rights for black Americans. The organization is a response to reported voting issues in predominantly black precincts this week.

""Everyone talking about 'how do we fix this?'"" James said. ""They say 'go out and vote?' What about asking if how we vote is also structurally racist?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dem-strategist-threatens-scorched-earth-crusade-against-trumps-family-over-hunter-biden-pressure,2020-06-11
'Non-binary' son of House Democrat whip who called Republicans 'extremists' charged for attack on Boston police,"The No. 2 Democrat in Congress suggested earlier this month that Republicans were ""extremists."" On Saturday night, her son Jared Dowell was charged with assaulting a Boston police officer amid a wave of Antifa violence.

Leftist extremism

The Boston Police Department noted that around 9:30 p.m. on Jan. 21, officers responded to a scene of leftist disturbance at the Parkman Bandstand Monument in the Boston Common.

According to the BPD, officers found the son of House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) vandalizing the monument, writing ""NO COP CITY"" and ""ACAB,"" the latter of which stands for ""all cops are bastards.""

Jared Dowell, 23, was not alone, however. Other Antifa thugs were blocking traffic and making a scene.

When officers intervened to arrest the son of the Democratic whip and restore order, a group of 20 leftist violators began ""screaming profanities through megaphones"" and interfering with Dowell's arrest.

An officer was brutally struck in the face and left ""bleeding from the nose and mouth"" during the leftists' violent efforts to prevent the arrest, which Dowell is accused of partaking in.

Despite the efforts of the leftist mob, officers were ultimately able to arrest Dowell and charge him with assault by means of a dangerous weapon, destruction of personal property, and damage of property by graffiti/tagging. He is expected to be arraigned in Boston Municipal Court.

AntifaWatch reported that Dowell appears to run a leftist mutual aid group and has posted about it on anarchist subreddits.

Dowell's apparent antipathy for police may not be an anomaly in his family. After all, his BLM-supporting mother stressed in 2020 that it should be ""easier to prosecute"" officers.

Clark — the Democrat who reportedly failed to properly disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock trades in 2021 —confirmed that her son, whom she refers to as a ""daughter"" and calls ""Riley,"" was arrested in Boston, noting that ""this is a very difficult time in the cycle of joy and pain in parenting.""

While apparently reluctant to denounce Antifa's violent attacks on Boston police over the weekend, Clark has previously been quick to accuse her political rivals of fomenting unrest and to warn of violence when politically expedient.

The Democratic minority whip suggested to CNN earlier this month that congressional Republicans were ""extremists"" and that the fruitful debates concerning the House speakership ""endangered our country's national security.""

Axios reported that ahead of the midterm elections, Clark claimed that the answer to America's political conflicts ""cannot be through division, misinformation and appeals to hate speech and violence,"" intimating that's what the GOP had on offer.



Dowell's mother tweeted on Nov. 2, ""The tolerance of violence and bigotry in our political discourse must end. We are one nation, one community, and we can't allow ourselves to be torn apart by the GOP's campaign of lies, hate and misinformation.""

Clark noted in a follow-up tweet, ""Violence begets violence. Hate begets hate. When brutality is campaign currency, it is legitimized.""

Christina Kulich, an instructor of political science and legal studies at Suffolk University, told Boston.com in December that Clark's new role in Congress means she ""will probably spend less time in her district than she was able to before.""

It is unclear if less time in her district might mean less time monitoring potential extremism at home or less time addressing family members' ""nightmares over concern around climate change.""

Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard says she actually supports some restrictions on abortion,"Democratic presidential hopeful Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) broke with other members of her party when she revealed that she believed that abortion should be limited, with exceptions, to before the start of a pregnancy's third trimester. She also criticized her fellow Democrats for supporting open borders policies.

What did she say?

During an interview Monday, libertarian host Dave Rubin asked Gabbard to clarify her position on abortion. Rubin noted that Gabbard used to be pro-life and admitted that he was becoming more pro-life due to the recently radical abortion policies espoused by members of the Democratic Party.

Gabbard said that her own position had changed along with her ""understanding of the role of government."" She said she took ""a more libertarian position on this issue: that government really shouldn't be in that place of dictating to a woman the choice that she should make.""

""I think that there should be some restrictions, though,"" she continued. ""You know, for me personally, I would not make that choice for myself, but I don't believe that I should be telling anyone else the kinds of decisions that they should make for themselves or for their family. And, therefore, a woman should have a right to choose. And I will stand up and protect her right to do so.""

She also said that she believed that abortion should be restricted at ""the third trimester, unless a woman's life or severe consequences is at risk, then there shouldn't be an abortion in the third trimester.""

This view is in contrast to her fellow Democratic candidates, including South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who argued Friday that a baby was not alive until it had taken its first breath.

Historically, Gabbard has made conflicting statements about her position on abortion. According to National Review, she initially claimed to be pro-life, but currently has a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood. She also said during this interview that her views on abortion were ""libertarian,"" yet she supports federal funding of abortion.

In a tweet Tuesday morning, Rubin said that ""old school liberals, libertarians and conservatives"" had told him that while they ""don't agree with her [Gabbard] 100%,"" they ""respect her."" Progressives, however, he said had been ""screeching that she's a sell-out, evil, right-wing maniac.""

What about open borders?

Gabbard also criticized her fellow candidates for pushing for what she saw as open borders policies on immigration.

""I don't support open borders,"" she said. ""Without secure borders, we don't really have a country and while some of the other Democratic candidates will say, 'Well, open borders, that's a conservative argument and that's not really what's being advocated for,' if you look at some of the practical implications of some of the things they are pushing for, it is essentially open borders.""

She said that she thought the country needed secure borders, although she did not believe that President Trump's proposed border wall across the entire southern border was the most effective way to accomplish this goal.

What are Gabbard's chances in 2020?

According to the Real Clear Politics average, Gabbard is currently polling at 1.7 percent.

Democratic senator fears President Trump's response to Iran might be similar to 9/11 terror attacks,"Since the recent escalation of tensions and violence between the U.S. and Iran, Democratic politicians have grappled with how to make the entire situation about how bad President Donald Trump is, which has led to some comments that almost make it unclear whose side they're on in the conflict.

Some Democrats, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have struggled to even admit that Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani was a terrorist. Others have taken to calling the drone strike that killed Soleimani an assassination and saying it was illegal, despite the fact that he was a military leader who had planned and executed attacks that led to American deaths.



Now, Massachusetts' other senator has expressed fears that President Trump's response to Iran's hostility could be similar to what terrorists did to the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, according to The Washington Free Beacon.

""When al Qaeda attacked us on September 11, 2001, which targets did they select?"" Sen. Ed Markey said during a speech Tuesday on the Senate floor. ""They selected the World Trade Center, the symbol of capitalism in the United States. They selected the Pentagon, the symbol of our defense.

""We have a choice to make right now out here on the floor of the United States Senate,"" Markey said. ""And that is to make a statement before we do that to the Iranians, because we ourselves experienced it, and we know what our reaction was. They will rise up in a way that will make it impossible to reconcile. We will be in eternal war in the Middle East.""

Markey's Senate speech did not age well, as late Tuesday Iran launched more than a dozen missiles at an air base in Iraq where U.S. troops were stationed in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani.

While many feared that the missile attack would spur a disproportionate response from the president, that's not what happened. There were no U.S. casualties, and there are no plans for a military response by the U.S. Certainly no acts of terror against Iran, as Markey was worried about.

"Democratic state senator accused of punching woman in face, gets arrested. The charges? Offensive touching and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors.","A Delaware Democratic state senator was accused of punching a woman in the side of her head amid a domestic dispute Sunday and later was arrested on misdemeanor charges of offensive touching and disorderly conduct.

What are the details?

Delaware State Police said troopers were dispatched to the Taverna Rustic Italian Restaurant in Wilmington around 6:20 p.m., where a 44-year-old woman said state Sen. Darius J. Brown, 39, punched her in the side of her face after the pair began arguing about a social media post.

Police said after Brown assaulted the victim, he got up from the booth where he and the victim were sitting and threw a glass of water, which shattered. Brown then left the restaurant and wasn't there when police arrived.

The victim sustained some redness to the side of her face but did not require any medical attention, police said.

Troopers then obtained warrants for Brown's arrest on misdemeanor charges of offensive touching and disorderly conduct, police said.

Brown turned himself in Tuesday and was processed and arraigned, then released on his own recognizance, although he was given a no-contact order with the victim, police said.

'Presumption of innocence'

Brown was absent from Tuesday's legislative session, and WDEL-FM said he didn't return the station's request for comment.

Dave Sokola — a Democrat and the state Senate's president pro tempore — told WDEL he'd consider taking formal action against Brown but that ""presumption of innocence"" must be maintained.

""Accusations of domestic violence are serious and in direct conflict with the values of the Delaware Senate Democratic Caucus,"" Sokola said, according to the station. ""However, a presumption of innocence is one of the most sacred principles in the American criminal justice system. I will carefully consider whether any formal actions are warranted in the coming days as we learn more about this incident.""

Call for resignation

Jane Brady, chairwoman of the Delaware Republican Party, called for Brown to resign if the allegations are true, according to the Cape Gazette.



""The behavior that has been reported, if true, is reprehensible and warrants his resignation,"" Brady said in a press release, the paper noted. ""If Senator Brown refuses to resign, we call on the Senate to conduct an inquiry and expel him for conduct unbecoming an elected official.""

More from the Gazette:

Brady cited to the bipartisan effort to expel former Republican Rep. John Adkins of Millsboro. ""The circumstances are remarkably similar to the Adkins matter. In that case, Republicans recognized the need to act and did so. The Democrats should hold the members of their caucus to the same high standard,"" she said.



In 2006, then Republican representative Atkins, was stopped in Ocean City for suspected driving under the influence and a few hours later was charged with offensive touching in connection with an argument with a former wife. He resigned his seat but was re-elected in 2008, running as a Democrat. Atkins retained the seat by 69 seats in a 2012 challenge by Republican Rich Collins, but lost the seat by 352 votes in 2014 to Collins, who has held the seat since.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-presidential-candidate-tulsi-gabbard-says-she-actually-supports-some-restrictions-on-abortion,2021-05-20
Jewish Dem asked Reps. Omar and Tlaib to affirm Israel's right to exist. Here's their stunning response.,"The Democratic Party is facing an impasse: How do they manage anti-Semitism from freshman lawmakers, most notably, Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), without alienating their progressive colleagues from the caucus?

The solution, so far, has been to hold several private, closed-door meetings, which lawmakers believe foster safe environments to be frank with one another.

After Omar's latest round of anti-Semitism, in which she questioned the loyalty of pro-Israel lawmakers, a group of Jewish and Muslim Democrats met together on March 5 for what was supposed to be a ""moment meant to be about listening and learning,"" according to The Washington Post.

Instead, the meeting devolved into ""anti-Semitic jokes and unapologetic members of Congress,"" the Washington Free Beacon reported.

What happened at the meeting?

According to the Post, which first reported the gathering, Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.) organized the ""formal event"" with the hope that lawmakers within his party could both share differing perspectives and address rampant anti-Semitism that has come to define the Democratic Party this year.

To comfort Omar and Tlaib, Levin invited Bend the Arc — a deeply progressive and anti-Israeli activist organization with ties to George Soros — to moderate the discussion. He also invited Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Omar and Tlaib's closest allies in Congress.

The lawmakers discussed their family lives in an attempt to humanize everyone for nearly two hours before Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) addressed the elephant in the room. He characterized Omar's controversial comments the as ""tips of the arrow"" of American anti-Semitism.

Lawmakers who spoke to the Post privately said Phillips then urged Omar to apologize and ""publicly affirm Israel's right to exist and protect itself."" The request ""stunned the three Muslim Democrats in the room,"" the Post reported. Rep. André Carson (D-Ind.) was the third Muslim at the gathering.

According to the Post, Omar did not respond to Phillips' request. Instead, the conversation shifted to Palestine as Tlaib broke out in tears when describing the impact of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on her family, like her grandmother who lives in the West Bank. Others saw racism in Phillips' suggestion.

The Post reported:

Others in the room saw racial undertones in Phillips's comments, offended that a white businessman representing an affluent suburban community was suggesting a black refugee such as Omar incited fear.

Tlaib's reaction reportedly stunned Phillips, who later embraced the freshman lawmaker and expressed interest in meeting her grandmother.

""It wasn't planned, and it wasn't what we expected. But I think it was cathartic. It certainly was for me,"" Phillips told the Post.

Anything else?

The Free Beacon reported that a representative for Bend the Arc engaged in anti-Semitism jokes at the gathering, lamenting ""about Jews and money."" Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) rebuked the jokester and questioned why it was allowed at the sensitive gathering.

""It's not okay. These [sorts of jokes] are off-limits. It's confusing for someone like me who is trying to learn,"" she later told the Post about the incident.

However, the Post has since removed this detail from its story. The editor's note at the bottom of the article does not explain the edit, nor does it mention why the detail was removed from the story altogether.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-senator-fears-trump-response-to-iran-might-be-similar-to-9-11-terror-attacks,2019-03-19
"Democrats block bill that would restart Keystone pipeline, boost US energy production","House Democrats this week blocked a motion to consider a Republican bill that would reauthorize construction of the TransCanada Keystone pipeline and restart the federal oil leasing program, among other things, in an effort to boost domestic energy production amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Daily Caller reported.

The legislation — called the American Energy Independence from Russia Act — was introduced in the House by Energy and Commerce Committee ranking member Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) and Natural Resources Committee ranking member Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) on Feb. 28. The bicameral bill was also introduced in the Senate by Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) on March 3.

It comes at a time when gas prices are skyrocketing in the U.S. due to private-sector boycotts and a public-sector embargo on imports of Russian oil in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine. The global energy supply disruption has exposed the West's reliance on Russian energy sources and thus renewed calls to bolster American energy independence.

Republicans have argued for years that the U.S. should seek energy independence as a matter of national security, and the current conflict with Russia has undoubtedly served to strengthen the argument.

Yet, according to the Daily Caller, on Wednesday evening, 219 Democrats in the House voted down a motion to consider the legislation. The Epoch Times reported that a motion to consider the bill was also shot down by Democrats on March 1.

The legislation would immediately reauthorize the construction of the Keystone pipeline from Canada to Montana and restart oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters, both of which were suspended by the Biden administration last year.

It would also require the Biden administration to submit an energy security plan to Congress within 30 days that would grow America’s oil and natural gas production to offset Russian imports.

In a joint statement to introduce the legislation, Reps. McMorris Rodgers and Westerman said, ""Putin and Russia’s economy are dependent upon dominating energy production and exporting to other nations. He gains power by doing so, and it’s what funds his military and aggressive behavior. To counter Putin, our bill flips the switch to promote American energy jobs, production, and exports.""

The president was torched on social media this week after he begged foreign despots and dictators to increase their oil production in response to the global energy crisis rather than unleashing America's energy resources.

In a floor speech in support of the bill Wednesday, Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw (Texas) slammed President Joe Biden for his energy policies.

""This week our president — our American president — asked Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to increase oil production, asked them to boost their output so that American consumers wouldn’t see a spike in gas prices,"" Crenshaw said.

He added, ""Surely, [Biden] knows we can also boost domestic production right here at home. Surely he knows that domestic production supports American jobs, and surely he knows that domestic production is cleaner, by far, than foreign production.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-state-senator-punching-woman-face,2022-03-11
Democrats vow investigation after whistleblower says Trump administration overruled denials for clearance,"A whistleblower has claimed that as many as 25 security clearances that the White House requested were denied due to security concerns — only to be overruled and granted. House Democrats have promised to launch a full investigation into the matter, the Washington Post reported.

Who is this whistleblower?

Tricia Newbold is a White House security adviser and has worked as a ""security specialist for the federal government"" for the past 18 years. She was suspended without pay after she came forward. She was recently interviewed on March 23 by the House Oversight and Reform Committee.

What did she say?

Newbold told the House Oversight Committee that the Trump administration had overruled denials for security clearances on 25 separate occasions. These allegedly included ""two current senior White House officials.""

According to a memo regarding her testimony, these clearances were denied over concerns that the applicants had ""a wide range of serious disqualifying issues involving foreign influence, conflicts of interest, concerning personal conduct, financial problems, drug use, and criminal conduct."" One of the senior officials, who was not identified, was specifically said to be disqualified due to ""foreign influence.""

Now what?

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who chairs the committee, informed the White House Counsel's Office that he was seeking a subpoena for one of the people who allegedly approved security clearances despite Newbold's misgivings.

He wrote, ""In light of the grave reports from this whistleblower — and the ongoing refusal of the White House to provide the information we need to conduct our investigation — the committee now plans to proceed with compulsory process and begin authorizing subpoenas, starting at tomorrow's business meeting.""

The White House previously told the committee that it would not comply with its investigation into the security clearance of Jared Kushner, the president's senior adviser and son-in-law, calling it ""overly intrusive.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-anti-semitism-closed-door-meeting-omar-tlaib,2019-04-01
Democrats plan to fight potential Roe overturning — by sending out Kamala Harris. What could go wrong?,"Pro-abortion Democrats outraged over news that the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to overturn its landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade are looking to Vice President Kamala Harris to be their champion. But Democrats should be warned; that strategy has been tried before, and failed.

What are the details?

The Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday that the embattled vice president ""is likely to play an expanded role in pushing the Democrats’ political case on protecting abortion rights"" ahead of a formal ruling on the matter, expected sometime this summer.

In a statement issued Tuesday in response to a leaked draft memo of the forthcoming decision, Harris took hold of her vaunted position and proclaimed, ""This is the time to fight for women.""

""Opponents of Roe want to punish women and take away their rights to make decisions about their own bodies. Republican legislators in states across the country are weaponizing the use of the law against women,"" the vice president argued.

She added: ""The rights of all Americans are at risk. If the right to privacy is weakened, every person could face a future in which the government can potentially interfere in the personal decisions you make about your life. This is the time to fight for women and for our country with everything we have.""

Harris's combative statement was met with a positive response from abortion advocates on social media, many of whom are enraged over the notion that the right to an abortion — which was invented out of thin air in Roe — could soon be sent back to the states for deliberation.

They want to see national Democrats step up and do something. The current idea being postulated is to eliminate the filibuster and codify abortion rights in federal law.

""This is a moment that @VP should step up, must step up and lead,"" tweeted author David Rothkopf.

Daily Beast columnist Wajahat Ali added, ""Kamala Harris can emerge and own this moment ... She is the first Black female VP. She can marshall this energy and try to galvanize it.""

Others on social media concurred with the opinion.

The Los Angeles Times even added that Harris ""would be a natural point person for the administration to vocally raise the issue on the midterm campaign trail"" thanks to her gender and her longstanding support for abortion.



""She’s been a champion of the pro-choice movement for a long time,"" noted Karen Finney, a NARAL Pro-Choice America board member and Harris ally. ""She is a very important messenger to talk about the impact that this is going to have on women — from a health perspective, from the perspective of our bodily autonomy, from the perspective of rights, as a former attorney general.""

What's the problem?

The problem for Democrats is this: Harris is historically unpopular and has failed remarkably at every initiative she's been tasked with leading as vice president — be that the border crisis, Russia-Ukraine diplomacy, or management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In fact, Republicans will likely welcome the news that Harris may be tapped to lead on the abortion issue.

Early in President Biden's term, Harris was named point person on the unprecedented immigration crisis on the southern border. She responded by never so much as making a trip to the border and ultimately unveiling a vague, ""root causes"" strategy with no ""detailed timeline or specific policy actions to be taken."" She has since moved on from that task, yet the border assault still rages.

Late last year, she created a significant snafu for the Biden administration when she confusingly stated that the administration ""didn't see"" waves of virus variants ""coming.""

Most recently, Harris embarrassed herself after being dispatched to Germany to meet with top European leaders in hopes of deescalating the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and decreasing the chances of war. During the meeting, she declared that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""made his decision"" to invade Ukraine while also promising that the U.S. would ""absolutely"" deter Putin from invading Ukraine.

Harris's failures have resulted in her earning a historically low 28% approval rating and caused many of her senior staff to resign in attempt to save their own careers.

But now, she apparently hopes to turn the tides on her disappointing vice presidency by saving the day on one of the most consequential issues in modern American history.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-block-bill-that-would-restart-keystone-pipeline-boost-us-energy-production,2022-05-03
"'Reckless move': Democrats spin killing of terrorist Iranian top general as bad, illegal","After an airstrike ordered by President Donald Trump killed top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani on Thursday night, Democrats were left searching for a way to criticize the president for taking out a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans over the years.

Soleimani's death is unanimously acknowledged as a severe blow to Iran, as Soleimani was a figure of immense military and political authority. He was also indisputably a terrorist and an enemy of the United States who was an active threat to the lives of Americans in the Middle East.

So, Democrats attempted to toe a fine line, which can be summarized as: ""Soleimani was a murderous, evil, terrorist who deserved to die, but....""

Some examples:

From Sen. Elizabeth Warren: ""Soleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans. But this reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict. Our priority must be to avoid another costly war.""

And former Vice President Joe Biden: ""[Soleimani] deserved to be brought to justice for his crimes against American troops and thousands of innocents throughout the region. He supported terror and sowed chaos. None of that negates the fact that this is a hugely escalatory move in an already dangerous region. … President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox…""

Wendy Sherman, onetime under secretary of state for political affairs for former President Barack Obama, said the Obama administration didn't go after Soleimani because they understood what the consequences were: ""There will be terrible, terrible reprisals. They will likely happen in the Middle East, but they could happen really anywhere in the world.""

Perhaps the clearest example that President Trump would be criticized no matter what comes from Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy.

After violent protests by an Iran-backed militia at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq earlier this week, Murphy blamed Trump for rendering America ""impotent"" in the Middle East, saying ""no one fears us.""

Days later, after a powerful show of force against Iran, Murphy was criticizing the president for killing a major enemy in the Middle East.

""[D]id America just assassinate, without any congressional authorization, the second most powerful person in Iran, knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war?"" Murphy wrote on Twitter.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-investigation-over-security-clearances,2020-01-03
GOP rep proposes constitutional amendment to stop Democrats from packing the Supreme Court,"Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee plans to introduce a constitutional amendment that would limit the number of justices on the Supreme Court, a direct response to Democratic presidential candidates who have proposed expanding the court, according to The Hill.

Several candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have proposed or expressed an openness to increasing the number of Supreme Court justices, claiming that expansion would combat an alleged politicization of the courts.

""Schemes to pack the court are dangerous to the Founders' vision of an independent judiciary that serves as a check on both the Executive and Legislative branches of government,"" Green said in a statement.

The Constitution currently does not dictate how many justices are on the Supreme Court. The court has had nine justices since 1869.

Why do Democrats want to expand the Supreme Court?

The political conflict over the Supreme Court has steadily escalated since 2016, when Republicans blocked Judge Merrick Garland from getting a confirmation hearing after former President Barack Obama nominated Garland. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) believed that an outgoing president should not be allowed to appoint a justice.

Since then, President Donald Trump has appointed two justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, to the Supreme Court, shifting the ideological balance in a way that Democrats claim threatens the impartiality of the judicial branch.

""This central objective that is to prevent the Supreme Court from continuing on this trajectory to become basically ruined by being a nakedly political institution, this idea of adding justices is one way to do it,"" South Bend, Indiana, Mayor and Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said on Pod Save America.

According to The Hill, Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke want to give Republicans five justices and Democrats five justices, then have those 10 justices agree on five more justices to complete a 15-justice Supreme Court.

Other Democrats, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have accused Republicans of ""stealing"" Supreme Court seats, which she feels justifies a potential move to pack the court to favor Democrats.

""First they steal a Supreme Court seat, and then they turn around and change the rules on the filibuster on a Supreme Court seat,"" Warren said, according to Fox News. ""So when it swings back to us, what are we going to do? I think all options are on the table.""

Green said in his statement that he plans to introduce the amendment on Thursday.

""The Supreme Court must remain a fair and impartial branch of government not beholden to a party,"" Green said in the statement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-look-to-vp-harris-in-abortion-fight,2019-03-20
Top Democrat says they got destroyed by backlash from Hispanics in Florida when Dems supported BLM and defunding police,"A top Democrat said that the Biden campaign failed in Florida because Democrats tried to court the black vote with support for the Black Lives Matter movement and got backlash from Latinos.

The surprising admission was reported by Marc Caputo, who covers the presidential campaign in Florida for Politico.

""We must have gotten obliterated by Hispanics ... defund the police killed us,"" Caputo quoted the unidentified Democrat, who texted him after Florida was projected to be won by the president.

The crucial battleground state appeared to head towards a victory for President Donald Trump's re-election campaign on election night. The Trump campaign made a concerted effort to court the Hispanic vote in Florida, while Democrats were caught between conflicting demographic groups.

""We came out strong for BLM and then saw the [H]ispanic push back and went lukewarm and got killed with both demos,"" the Democrat added in the text posted by Caputo.

""Waving Che Guevara flags, even though it was by just a few, gets lots of attention in a community that sees him as a symbol of totalitarian butchery,"" explained Caputo, who added a photo of a protester waving a Che flag.



In September Caputo reported that Florida state Democratic officials were panicked to see the gains that Trump was making among Hispanics. They criticized the Biden campaign for not doing enough to reach out to the influential demographic, but the Biden campaign was dismissive of their demands.

A poll by Telemundo in October found that Trump had lessened the gap of support among Latinos between himself and Biden as compared to that between himself and Hillary Clinton in 2016. While Clinton had 27% more support than Trump did among Latinos in 2016, Biden had only 5% more support than the president among Latinos.

"'Open brawl': House Dems rip Rep. Omar for equating US, Israel, and Hamas — with some reportedly calling her an 'anti-Semite.' Omar claps back.","Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) upset a lot of people this week when she equated the U.S. and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban. It turns out it wasn't just Republicans who are calling her out for her remarks.

A dozen of her fellow U.S. House Democrats issued a statement Wednesday night criticizing her statements. And now a report has surfaced that the split between Omar and Democratic caucus is more significant than previously reported, with some Democratic lawmakers reportedly calling her an ""anti-Semite"" privately.

What did Omar say?

In a Monday tweet, Omar claimed the U.S., Israel, Hamas, and the Taliban have all committed ""unthinkable atrocities"" and human rights abuses.

""We must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crimes against humanity,"" she said.

The tweet included a clip of Omar questioning Secretary of State Antony Blinken how those who perpetrate human rights abuses — including, she said, Hamas, the Taliban, and Israeli security forces — will be held accountable.

Omar's tweets and questions for Blinken came in the wake of thousands of Hamas rocket attacks against Israel in May, to which Israel responded with targeted air strikes. During the conflict, Omar accused Israel of committing war crimes.



How did her Democratic critics respond?

On Wednesday, 12 Democratic representatives, led by Illinois Rep. Brad Schneider, issued a statement condemning Omar's accusations.

""Equating the United States and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban is as offensive as it is misguided,"" the statement began. ""Ignoring the differences between democracies governed by the rule of law and contemptible organizations that engage in terrorism at best discredits one's intended argument and at worst reflects deep-seated prejudice.""

""The United States and Israel are imperfect and, like all democracies, at times deserving of critique, but false equivalencies give cover to terrorist groups,"" the dozen Democrats concluded. ""We urge Congresswoman Omar to clarify her words placing the US and Israel in the same category as Hamas and the Taliban.""

Schneider was joined by Democratic Reps. Jake Auchincloss (Mass.), Ted Deutch (Fla.), Lois Frankel (Fla.), Josh Gottheimer (N.J.), Elaine Luria (Va.), Kathy Manning (N.C.), Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.), Dean Phillips (Minn.), Kim Schrier (Wa.), Brad Sherman (Calif.), and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.).

Things, however, are reportedly worse than even that statement let on.



According to Punchbowl News, the fallout from Omar's actions ""has erupted into an open brawl"" and the ""fight threatens to leave a deep divide among Democrats."" It could even cost Omar her seat on the Foreign Affairs Committee.

Punchbowl reported that a group of Jewish Democratic lawmakers met on a call Wednesday and were listening to a speaker address concerns about the right's anti-Semitism. The discussion, however, ""quickly turned to Omar's recent remarks and what they should do in response.""

This is not the first time Democrats have had to contend with Omar's anti-Semitic rhetoric, the outlet noted, citing the March 2019 anti-bigotry resolution the House was forced to pass in response to her multiple contentious statements.

Apparently, Omar's schtick is wearing on some of her liberal colleagues, as a ""number of Omar's fellow Democrats believe Omar is an anti-Semite,"" Punchbowl reported, ""even if they don't say so publicly.""

Omar claps back

The left-wing Minnesota lawmaker did not take kindly to the Democrats' Wednesday statement about her latest remarks.

She went on Twitter to rip her fellow lawmakers for their ""islamophobic tropes"" and their ""constant harassment & silencing.""

""It's shameful for colleagues who call me when they need my support to now put out a statement asking for 'clarification' and not just call,"" she said. ""The islamophobic tropes in this statement are offensive. The constant harassment & silencing from the signers of this letter is unbearable.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-want-to-pack-the-supreme-court-so-a-gop-lawmaker-is-proposing-a-constitutional-amendment,2021-06-10
Dems suggest that Trump’s lawyer shouldn’t take part in the impeachment trial. Ted Cruz fires back.,"The House Democrats, prosecuting the lower chamber's impeachment efforts against President Donald Trump, kicked off the day Tuesday by taking aim at the White House's lead defense attorney in the case, suggesting that he shouldn't take part in the trial.

In a letter to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone dated Tuesday, the House's team of impeachment managers — which is led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — wrote to ""notify you that evidence received by the House of Representatives during its impeachment inquiry indicates that you are a material witness to charges in both Articles of Impeachment for which President Trump now faces trial.""

The letter went on to describe instances that supposedly make Cipollone a witness to the events underlying the articles of impeachment. With regard to the article of impeachment for abuse of power, for example, the letter cited ""multiple witnesses"" who told the House that they ""raised concerns"" with a White House attorney who reports to Cipollone. Regarding the article of impeachment for obstruction of Congress, the managers claimed that Cipollone's office was ""directly involved in potential efforts to conceal President Trump's scheme from Congress and the public.""

The managers added that Cipollone's knowledge of such events brings into question his ability to act as the president's legal representative in this case.

""In light of your extensive knowledge of these key events, your personal representation of President Trump threatens to undermine the integrity of the pending trial,"" the letter contended. ""You may be a material witness to the charges against President Trump even though you are also his advocate.""

The managers' letter concluded by telling Cipollone that ""at a minimum, you must disclose all facts and information as to which you have first-hand knowledge that will be at issue in connection with evidence you present or arguments you make in your role as the President's legal advocate so that the Senate and Chief Justice can be apprised of any potential ethical issues, conflicts, or biases.""



In a fiery statement following the release of the letter, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) fired back at the managers' ""absurd request"" and said that the upper chamber wouldn't deny the president Cipollone's legal counsel.



""Unlike the House, the Senate will have a FAIR trial,"" Cruz said. ""That means we won't deny the President his lawyer ON THE DAY the trial starts.""

The senator suggested that Schiff should be disqualified from trying the case instead.

""Under the standard put forth by the House Democrats today — that any potential fact witness cannot serve as counsel in the impeachment hearing — there is an obvious person who should be disqualified: Adam Schiff,"" Cruz said. ""Schiff, it has been alleged, spoke directly with the so-called 'whistle-blower' and may even have helped him draft the complaint that launched this entire impeachment. So, maybe we should disqualify Schiff as a lawyer, and schedule him instead as a witness to explain his role in creating the 'evidence' in this proceeding?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dems-lose-hispanics-florida-blm,2020-01-21
"Denver mayor warns against holiday travel, then hops on a plane to visit family for Thanksgiving","Denver Mayor Michael Hancock is the latest Democrat to get caught flouting his own guidance amid the coronavirus pandemic, after his office confirmed that he flew out of state Wednesday to visit family for Thanksgiving — just 30 minutes after a warning went out from his Twitter account urging people to ""avoid travel"" for the holiday.

What are the details?

""Pass the potatoes, not COVID,"" a message from Hancock's Twitter feed read, urging constituents to ""stay home as much as you can,"" suggesting they ""host virtual gatherings instead of in-person dinner,"" and warning folks to ""avoid travel, if you can.""

But local outlet KUSA-TV reported that roughly 30 minutes later, Hancock hopped on a flight to Houston, in order to visit is daughter in Mississippi. A spokeswoman for the mayor confirmed his plans, noting that his wife was already there.

Observers on social media were not impressed. ""Are you kidding?"" one person wrote in reply to Hancock's tweet. ""We're out here, staying home, doing our best and you fly to Houston? Not only is this over-the-top hypocritical, it's plain stupid. Nice job giving the repubs more ammo.""

Another chided, ""Being that you are on a plane to visit family, can we visit family? You think it's safe enough for you, why not us?!?""

Some argued, ""Every bar and restaurant in the city of Denver should re-open in protest of the Mayor's 'Do what I say, not what I do' policy.""

What did the mayor say?

After the news broke and hit several nationaloutlets, Hancock issued a public apology and his own explanation via Twitter, writing in a thread:

I fully acknowledge that I have urged everyone to stay home and avoid unnecessary travel. I have shared how my family cancelled our plans for our traditional multi-household Thanksgiving celebration.



What I did not share, but should have, is that my wife and my daughter have been in Mississippi, where my daughter recently took a job. As the holiday approached, I decided it would be safer for me to travel to see them than to have two family members travel back to Denver.



I recognize that my decision has disappointed many who believe it would have been better to spend Thanksgiving alone. As a public official, whose conduct is rightly scrutinized for the message it sends to others I apologize to the residents of Denver who see my decision as conflicting with the guidance to stay at home for all but essential travel.



I made my decision as a husband and father, and for those who are angry and disappointed, I humbly ask you to forgive decisions that are borne of my heart and not my head.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dems-rip-omar-us-israel-hamas-anti-semite,2020-11-26
Department of Defense awards $3 million to company at the center of Wuhan lab leak theory as part of program combating weapons of mass destruction,"The Department of Defense awarded a multi-year grant worth $3 million to EcoHealth Alliance – the company at the center of the Wuhan lab leak theory.

Starting on Dec. 12, 2022, and ending on Dec. 11, 2025, the Department of Defense will give $3 million in funding to EcoHealth Alliance, according to USA Spending – the official source for spending data for the U.S. government.

EcoHealth Alliance will utilize the multi-million-dollar grant to ""reduce the threat of viral spillover from wildlife in the Philippines.""

The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA), also known as Assistance Listings, listed the government funding as part of scientific research aimed at ""combating weapons of mass destruction.""

The objective of the program:

To support and stimulate basic, applied, and advanced research at educational or research institutions, non-profit organizations, and commercial firms, which support the advancement of fundamental knowledge and understanding of the sciences with an emphasis on exploring new and innovative research for combating or countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).

The grant was provided directly by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which is an agency within the Department of Defense.

The DTRA's mission is to ""provide cross-cutting solutions to enable the Department of Defense, the United States Government, and international partners to Deter strategic attack against the United States and its allies; Prevent, reduce, and counter WMD and emerging threats; and Prevail against WMD-armed adversaries in crisis and conflict.""

USA Spending revealed that EcoHealth Alliance has been receiving government funding since 2008. In 2020, the U.S. government provided EcoHealth Alliance with nearly $25 million. In total, EcoHealth Alliance received $79.4 million – nearly 48% of the amount has come from Assistance Listings with the purpose of ""combatting weapons of mass destruction."" The DTRA has provided more than 52% of EcoHealth Alliance's total funding from the U.S. government.

In September, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) – which is headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci – awarded EcoHealth Alliance with $3.3 million in funding over five years.

The NIH grant funds a project to analyze the ""potential for future bat coronavirus emergence in Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam.""

Peter Daszak's EcoHealth Alliance previously conducted controversial bat coronavirus experiments at China's state-run Wuhan Institute of Virology. There have been accusations that EcoHealth Alliance carried out gain-of-function experiments at the notorious Chinese biosafety level 4 lab. Some have blamed EcoHealth Alliance's research for the possible Wuhan lab leak theory.

Florida Gov. DeSantis announces executive order banning mask mandates in schools,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Friday that he will sign an executive order ""protecting the rights of parents"" by banning mask mandates in his state.

""There's a movement to try to impose more restrictions on the American people,"" the governor said at a news conference broadcast by WPLG-TV.

""In Florida, there will be no lockdowns, there will be no school closures, there will be no restrictions and no mandates in the state of Florida,"" he declared, standing in opposition to public health officials who have called for vaccine mandates and a renewed requirement for all Americans to wear face masks in areas with high rates of COVID-19 infections.

DeSantis said Floridians should be free to make their own decisions about what is best for them and that the state government's role was to protect the rights to work, conduct business, and attend school.

His executive order will issue emergency rules for ""protecting the rights of parents"" by banning school districts from imposing mask mandates, leaving the choice of whether to mask children up to their parents.

DeSantis' order will come into immediate conflict with the Broward County School board, which voted on Wednesday to require all K-12 students and faculty to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations on masking and social distancing in the upcoming school year.

School board members expressed concerns about the risks posed by the Delta variant of coronavirus, which is capable of infecting and being spread by vaccinated people.

Earlier this week, the CDC issued updated guidance recommending that all individuals in areas with high COVID-19 transmission wear masks indoors, regardless of vaccination status. The policy is a stark change from the CDC's recommendations in May, which said vaccinated people were fully protected from COVID-19 and could resume activities they enjoyed exactly as they did before the pandemic, without masks or social distancing.

Reasons given for the change were that unpublished data suggested vaccinated people were capable of becoming infected with and spreading the Delta variant, putting anyone who was unvaccinated at high risk of contracting the virus, possibly becoming hospitalized or even dying. But scientists and other experts questioned the CDC for not immediately publishing that data and for sowing confusion and doubt on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.

After the criticism, the unpublished data referred to by CDC officials was leaked to the Washington Post. An internal CDC document proclaims that ""the war has changed,"" that the Delta variant spreads as easily as chickenpox and is possibly more severe than other variants of the virus. The document makes clear the CDC is struggling to figure out how to communicate to the public that the vaccines are still safe and effective while acknowledging that breakthrough infections could mean promises that COVID restrictions would go away might be impossible to keep without more people becoming vaccinated.

DeSantis said forcing universal masking in schools ""would be a huge mistake"" and complained that the CDC wasn't properly considering the physical and mental well-being of children.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/denver-mayor-warns-against-holiday-travel-then-hops-on-a-plane-to-visit-family-for-thanksgiving,2021-07-30
"After banning CRT, Gov. Ron DeSantis signs law requiring all students learn 'evils of communism' and 'real patriots' who escaped it","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed three bills into law Tuesday that target education and require the teaching of the ""evils of communism"" and more.

Earlier this month, DeSantis officially banned the teaching of critical race theory from all public schools across the state.

What are the details?

In signing the bills, DeSantis — an outspoken conservative — said, ""The sad reality is that only two in five Americans can correctly name the three branches of government, and more than a third of Americans cannot name any of the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. It is abundantly clear that we need to do a much better job of educating our students in civics to prepare them for the rest of their lives.""

""The bill,"" he continued, ""also expands our previous efforts in civics to add a requirement for the high school government class that students receive instruction on the evils of communism and totalitarian ideologies. We have a number of people in Florida, particularly southern Florida, who've escaped totalitarian regimes, who've escaped communist dictatorships to be able to come to America.""

The Florida Republican also added that it's imperative for the state's children to understand why someone would take dangerous steps to flee their communist home country for America.

""We want all students to understand the difference. Why would somebody flee across shark-infested waters, say, leaving from Cuba to come to southern Florida?"" he said. ""Why would somebody leave a place like Vietnam? Why would people leave these countries and risk their lives to be able to come here? It's important that students understand that. Now as part of this bill, Florida will create a 'Portraits in Patriotism' library so students can learn about real patriots who came to this country after seeing the horrors of these communist regimes.""

What else?

The bills include House Bill 5: Civic Education Curriculum, requiring the Florida Department of Education to create an ""integrated K-12 civic education curriculum that includes an understanding of citizens' shared rights and responsibilities under the Constitution and Bill of Rights.""

The bill particularly targets high school civics curricula, requiring comparative discussions of ""political ideologies that conflict with the principles of freedom and democracy essential to the founding principles of the United States, such as communism and totalitarianism.""

Senate Bill 1108: Education states that all public tertiary education institutions require students to take a civic literacy course and subsequent examination as a graduation requirement.

""The bill further requires high school students to take a civic literacy assessment that has no high stakes consequences,"" the bill notes.

House Bill 233: Postsecondary Education requires that all state colleges and universities ""conduct annual assessments of the viewpoint diversity and intellectual freedom at their institutions to ensure that Florida's postsecondary students will be shown diverse ideas and opinions, including those that they may disagree with or find uncomfortable.""

Detective will not face criminal charges after accidentally shooting to death his 15-year-old son,"A Jacksonville, North Carolina, police detective who fatally shot his 15-year-old son in the head during an incident over Christmas break will not face criminal charges.

What are the details?

Jacksonville Police Detective John Clukey and his 15-year-old son Alexander were ""playing with toy guns"" on Dec. 27 when the incident took place, according to a report from the Daily News.

The two were playing outside in the Clukey's front yard when he shot Alexander in the head with a .45-caliber handgun.

According to reports, Clukey had his duty pistol on his side as the two played with a variety of AR-15-style airsoft guns that Alexander received for Christmas. When Clukey's first airsoft pistol ran out of ammunition, he grabbed at his side for the second airsoft pistol, but grabbed his service pistol instead — and fired it at his 15-year-old's head.

Clukey immediately called 911 and reported that his son was ""playing with fake guns"" and that ""someone shot [him] with a real gun.""

While on the phone with dispatchers, Clukey could be heard telling his son, ""I'm so sorry ... Take me instead ... Stay with me.""

Alexander was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment of his injuries, which he succumbed to on Jan. 3.

Clukey was placed on administrative leave following the incident pending an internal investigation.

What else?

Wilmington District Attorney Brian David said that an investigation into the incident showed that Clukey believed he was grabbing the airsoft pistol rather than his holstered .45-caliber gun.

“There is no evidence that John Clukey intended the death or injury of Alexander Clukey,” David said. “No substantiated evidence of any domestic abuse or threats of abuse, or of any homicidal ideation or planning have been discovered. Everything about this incident shows a father who did not intend for this to happen.”

“Clukey, to be clear, should have been more careful than to have played an airsoft game while wearing a holster with a real firearm,” David added. “There’s no dispute about that.”

David concluded that the incident was nothing more than an ""accidental shooting"" as a ""father and son were engaged in horseplay.""

“In the present instance there is insufficient proof that John Clukey acted in a negligent manner,"" he said. ""Accidents do happen.”

The district attorney added, “There is no question that the death of Alexander Clukey is a tragedy. By any objective measure, this is one of the most heartbreaking losses imaginable.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/desantis-announces-executive-order-banning-mask-mandates-in-schools,2022-01-21
"'It was me or him': Gun owner stands his ground when man allegedly tries to break into home, pulls firearm","A Detroit homeowner fatally shot an armed man who allegedly tried to break into his residence early Tuesday morning.

What are the details?

Maiso Jackson awoke around 4:30 am on Tuesday to a man pounding on his door. According to Jackson, who spoke with WJBK-TV, the man was ""talking about how someone owed him money.""

""I said no one here owes you money,"" Jackson recounted. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

When the man refused to leave, Jackson called police — and that is when the situation escalated. Jackson said that after he dialed 911, the man broke a window in an apparent attempt to enter the property.

A doorbell camera captured the armed man standing outside Jackson's door.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Jackson then grabbed his firearm and confronted the man. Jackson has been a legal gun owner for the past eight years, taking lessons on how to properly use the firearm. Unfortunately, the would-be home-invader forced Jackson to exercise his Second Amendment rights.

""I came outside and said you have to leave, you can’t be doing this,"" Jackson told WJBK. ""So then he reached for his gun and pulled it out. I had to defend myself, I had to shoot him because of that.""

Jackson fired four shots at the man, hitting him in the chest and killing him.

""It was me or him at that point,"" Jackson told WJBK. ""I didn’t want to hurt nobody, but he just wouldn’t quit.

""You can’t help but defend yourself — you have no choice but to,"" he explained.

Was Jackson arrested?

Police detained Jackson and questioned him for several hours after the incident. However, police confirmed they released Jackson without filing criminal charges against him.

Ultimately, a decision regarding criminal charges is the responsibility of the prosecutor's office.

Jackson's actions appear to be legal under Michigan's stand your ground law.

""In Michigan, civilians have the right to stand their ground if they believe they are in grave danger. They can defend themselves and others if they believe that someone is going to cause them serious bodily harm, and they do not have a duty to retreat to safety or avoid conflict,"" explains Michigan attorney Daniel Hajji.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/desantis-students-evils-communism-real-patriots,2022-06-09
Detroit police officer killed by suspect wielding 'high-powered rifle' who was angry and looking for his girlfriend,"One Detroit police officer was killed and another seriously injured by a suspect who was armed with a ""high-powered rifle"" and apparently seeking his girlfriend during a domestic conflict, according to NBC News.

The two officers have not been identified, except that the slain officer was a 17-year veteran of the force, and the injured officer was three-year veteran.

""We regret to announce the passing of one of our officers, who was killed in the line of duty,"" a tweet from the department read. ""He was a 17 veteran of the DPD who served with dedication and valor, an American hero will be missed and forever remembered. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.""

Officers arrived at a home at about 7:20 p.m. Wednesday night in response to a reported disturbance in the home that appeared to be domestic in nature. They entered the house with the knowledge that there was an allegedly armed man inside, based on information received from other occupants of the house.

The suspect opened fire on the officers in the house. Police were able to shoot and wound the suspect, but one officer was fatally shot in the neck and another was injured by a gunshot to the leg. The suspect's gun was described by Chief James Craig as ""high-powered,"" but the specific type of weapon was not disclosed.

According to police, the suspect had a ""lengthy"" criminal history that included weapons charges. He had just been released from parole.

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan credited the officers for their courage and heroism in entering the home to protect the lives of others.

""Detroit police have got to be as courageous as any people in this country,"" Duggan said, according to NBC News.

"Diplomat: I tried to warn the Obama administration about Hunter Biden and Ukraine in 2015, but no one would listen","A diplomat who served in the State Department under former President Barack Obama testified Tuesday that he sounded the alarm about Hunter Biden's appointment to Ukrainian energy company Burisma in early 2015, but no one seemed to care, according to the Washington Post.

George Kent, who still works in the State Department as deputy assistant secretary of state, testified as a part of the House impeachment inquiry that he was concerned about the conflict of interest with Hunter Biden joining the company at the same time that then-Vice President Joe Biden was heavily involved in the administration's Ukraine policy. From the Post:

Kent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for currying influence with his father, said the people. But when Kent raised the issue with Biden's office, he was told the then-vice president didn't have the ""bandwidth"" to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau, was battling cancer, said the people familiar with his testimony.

Kent's testimony is an example of how Biden could become collateral damage in the push to impeach President Donald Trump. It's going to be nearly impossible to keep digging into President Donald Trump and Ukraine without constantly running into the apparent conflict of interest the Bidens were involved in.

It's possible that Democrats will have to sacrifice Biden, their most electable candidate, if they want to keep holding on to impeachment hopes as November 2020 draws nearer. And, it's possible that they're willing to do so — as the recent elevation and coverage of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as the Democratic front-runner seems to indicate.

Biden has tried to distinguish himself from Trump regarding Ukraine, saying that if he is elected president, he will not have any family members working in the White House or having business relationships with foreign corporations — not because he believes it is inherently wrong, but because of Trump and his family.

""In my White House, none of my children or family have offices at the White House,"" Biden said. ""They will not be invited to sit in significant meetings of a Cabinet-level post and they will have no foreign investment, and the reason to do that is not because of anything that went on in our administration. It is because of what Donald Trump has done. He has so debased the standard of what constitutes ethical behavior that the next president has to make it absolutely clear — absolutely clear — this will not happen again.""

That's the ethical tightrope that Biden will attempt to walk between now and the Democratic primary elections, and potentially the general election. It remains to be seen whether it will work, or whether his own party will decide that the best path to the White House is to damage Trump at all costs rather than trust Biden to get the job done in 2020.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/detroit-homeowner-fatally-shoots-armed-man,2019-10-18
Disney Junior TV show Rise Up Sing Out talks to kids about racial microaggressions,"Disney Junior – a self-described ""global multiplatform brand expressly for kids age 2-7"" – launched a new kids show earlier this month titled ""Rise Up, Sing Out."" The short-form animated musical series is executive produced by Ahmir ""Questlove"" Thompson and Tariq ""Black Thought"" Trotter of the music group The Roots.

D23 – ""the official Disney fan club"" – says ""Rise Up, Sing Out"" is an ""animated show featuring music-based shorts that showcase an inspiring, empowering, and optimistic message about race, culture, community, and celebrating differences.""

Variety reports, ""The series, which will touch upon themes like diversity, inclusion, kindness and self-expression, was produced in response to parents who have increasingly asked Disney Junior for entertainment content to aid them in talking to children about respect towards others.""



Common Sense Media – an organization that provides parents with age-based ratings of entertainment – noted that ""Rise Up, Sing Out"" is suitable for children ages 3 and up.



Common Sense Media states:

In each approximately 3-minute episode, a diverse group of kids share ideas, sometimes have conflicts, and then sing songs that answer questions like ""Is it OK for another person to touch my hair without permission?"" or ""What's it like to have parents from two different cultures?"" Concepts addressed through the show's songs include microagressions, hearing scary news on TV, black hair routines, and more, all explored in an age-appropriate way.

The first episode has a song with the lyrics:



Come on, everybody, let's gather 'round

It's time to talk about the things that are goin' down

Racism in the world affects me and you

And it's time to end it now, let's come together, we'll show you how

The St. Louis American said the show for preschoolers features characters who ""grapple with the harsh realities of implicit bias and the trauma that comes with bearing witness to racial violence.""

The outlet describes the plot for one episode: ""Before bedtime, Gabriel confesses to his abuela that he is terrified after seeing the news where he saw someone suffer simply because they had the same skin color as he has.""

Another episode shows the characters get upset when they feel like they are not represented at an art museum.

Another episode lectures preschoolers about racial microaggressions.

""A microaggression is when someone says or does something that makes you feel bad. Sometimes just because of your race,"" a child says in the episode. ""But you know what, he’s wrong. You should be proud of your skin, it’s what makes you-YOU!""

Disturbing video of man being shot sparks outrage over lack of arrests  in February killing,"The release of a video purportedly showing the killing of 25-year-old Georgia man Ahmaud Arbery in February has shined a spotlight on the case, and raised questions over why no arrests have been made in connection with his death.

What are the details?

Arbery, who was black, was admittedly pursued on Feb. 23 by two white men in a truck, Gregory McMichael and his son, Travis McMichael. A third white man was also reportedly involved in chasing Arbery.

Arbery's family members say he liked to stay in shape and was simply out for a jog. Gregory McMichael told police that there had been several break-ins in the neighborhood, and that Arbery was a suspect who had been caught on surveillance video.

Gregory McMichael, a former Glynn County police officer and retired investigator with the local district attorney's office, says he was standing in his front yard when he saw Arbery ""hauling ass"" down the street, so he ran inside and told Travis. The McMichaels each grabbed firearms and jumped in a truck to try and chase Arbery down ""in an attempt to intercept him,"" according to the police report obtained by The New York Times.

The McMichaels tried to ""cut off"" Arbery, according to Gregory's account, but Arbery ran the other away. Then they tried to block him a second time, shouting that they wanted to talk to him, and that is when Arbery was killed.

The police report reads: ""[Gregory] McMichael states the unidentified male began to violently attack Travis and the two men then started fighting over the shotgun at which point Travis fired a shot and then a second later there was a second shot.""

Video emerged this week, purportedly showing the footage of what happened when Arbery was shot.

Be warned, it is violent content:

Lee Merritt, the attorney for Arbery's mother, who said of the footage, ""The series of events captured in this video confirm what all evidence indicated prior to its release—Ahmaud Arbery was pursued by three white men that targeted him solely because of his race and murdered him without justification. This is murder.""

The footage was widely circulated on social media on Tuesday, and a series of news reports were published covering the incident from over two months ago.

Prior to the release of the video, two prosecutors had recused themselves from the case. The first cited a conflict of interest because Gregory McMichael had worked in her office.

The second was forced to recuse himself at the pressing of Arbery's mother due to a separate conflict of interest over a professional connection, after arguing against making any arrests in a letter the Glynn County Police Department.

District Attorney George Barnhill wrote that the McMichaels acted lawfully in pursuing Arbery, that Travis McMichael was acting in self-defense, and that ""Arbery's mental health records & prior convictions help explain his apparent aggressive nature and his possible thought pattern to attack an armed man.""

The Times reported that ""court records show that Mr. Arbery was convicted of shoplifting and of violating probation in 2018. Five years earlier, according to the The Brunswick News, he was indicted on charges that he took a handgun to a high school basketball game.""

Arbery's mother, Wanda Jones, told CBS News that her son's previous brushes with the law have nothing to do with what happened the day he died, maintaining that he was the victim. She told the outlet that the McMichaels ""should have waited for the authorities to arrive.""

USA Today reported the day that the video was released, the third prosecutor on the case, Tom Durden, announced in a statement, ""I am of the opinion that the case should be presented to the grand jury of Glynn County for consideration of criminal charges against those involved in the death of Mr. Arbery.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/diplomat-tried-to-warn-obama-administration-about-hunter-biden-in-2015,2020-05-06
"DNA test shows Hunter Biden is father of Arkansas woman's baby, despite his previous denials","A DNA test has confirmed that Hunter Biden fathered a child with an Arkansas woman who is suing him for financial support, after months of Biden denying the allegations and asking that the suit be thrown out.

What are the details?

The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette first reported Wednesday that ""DNA testing has established 'with scientific certainty'"" that Biden is the father of the baby, according to court documents filed by the child's mother, Lunden Alexis Roberts. According to the motion, Biden ""is not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process.""

Biden has repeatedly denied having a sexual relationship with Lunden, and demanded in August that the paternity suit against him be tossed out by the court, The Daily Mail reported. Biden eventually agreed to take a DNA test.

As Business Insider noted, ""Biden's relationship history is complicated.""

At the time of Biden's affair with Lunden, he was dating his late brother's widow, Hallie Biden, who he moved in with after divorcing his wife of 22 years. Biden remarried in May to Melissa Cohen, who he reportedly had met just days before.

Anything else?

Biden is the son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, and has spent a great deal of time in the headlines over the past year.

Ahead of the fifth Democratic presidential primary debate on Wednesday, not only had the news broke that Joe Biden was officially confirmed to be a grandfather again, but it was revealed that Hunter Biden and business his associates allegedly received millions in illegal funds in a Ukrainian business deal.

Hunter Biden's foreign business relationships have become a major focus of Republicans amid the impeaching probe into President Donald Trump, and — in turn — a major source of frustration for Joe Biden's presidential campaign.

The younger Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas firm, Burisma, until this year, receiving a lucrative salary during and well after his father was point-man to Ukraine during his time as vice president.

Both Bidens have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the apparent conflict of interest, while officials in the U.S. and Ukraine continue to press for investigations into corruption allegations surrounding Burisma.

DOJ court filing shows how Nancy Pelosi sabotaged Dem efforts to obtain secret Mueller files,"The Justice Department told a federal judge on Friday the House Judiciary Committee should not be granted access to secret grand jury material collected during Robert Mueller's Russia investigation because Democratic lawmakers do not agree on why they need the files.

The DOJ's response comes nearly two months after the committee filed a petition in court arguing they needed full, unredacted access to the materials in order to determine whether to move forward with an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

According to the DOJ, the committee — chaired by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) — has ""come nowhere close to demonstrating a particularized need"" for the grand jury material.

In fact, the DOJ argued that conflicting language from Democratic leaders undermine their central claim for needing the secret files, citing statements from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-N.Y.).

""Most prominently, the Speaker of the House has been emphatic that the investigation is not a true impeachment proceeding,"" the DOJ wrote.

""And the House Majority Leader had even explained that branding the Committee's proceeding as 'impeachment' is a simply a device to enhance the Committee's legal arguments in this and other courts,"" the agency explained.

The DOJ went on to say:

As the Committee's Chairman has stressed—and as the Speaker of the House and the House Majority Leader both reiterated this week—the purpose of its investigation is to assess numerous possible remedial measures, including censure, articles of impeachment, legislation, Constitutional amendments, and more.



What may come of this investigation—if anything—remains unknown and unpredictable.



Because congressional impeachment proceedings ""are not 'judicial proceedings' under the plain and ordinary meaning of that term,"" the DOJ said secrecy rules governing federal grand juries must be upheld.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/disturbing-video-of-man-being-shot-sparks-outrage-over-lack-of-arrests-in-february-killing,2019-09-14
DOJ announces new restrictions on employees ‘to avoid even the appearance of political influence’,"Attorney General Merrick Garland released a memo on Tuesday issuing new restrictions on political activities by Justice Department employees, the Associated Press reported. The goal of the restrictions is ""to avoid even the appearance of political influence.""

The previous long-standing DOJ policy allowed non-career appointees to attend political campaign events and fundraisers on their personal time with prior approval. Employees hired under presidential administrations who did not plan on making a long-term career out of their Justice Department role were permitted to attend political events as passive participants.

Tuesday's memo announced a change to that policy, stating that non-career appointees are no longer permitted to attend ""any partisan political events in any capacity."" It stated that the new restrictions apply to both public and private political activities.

The previous policy limited appointee attendance at political events during presidential election years. However, it granted an exception to non-career employees who had family members running for office. Attorney General Merrick Garland wrote that attendance at such events would no longer be permitted.

Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe previously came under fire regarding his wife's Virginia political campaign in 2015. Former President Donald Trump insisted that Jill McCabe's failed run for office, which a close friend of the Clintons partially funded, was a conflict of interest for the deputy director. The FBI later released a statement insisting that Mr. McCabe ""played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind.""

The prior DOJ policy also allowed non-career appointees to attend political campaigns and fundraisers on the evening before Election Day. The new restriction will no longer allow that participation.

Attorney General Merrick Garland wrote, ""We must do all we can to maintain public trust and ensure that politics — both in fact and appearance — does not compromise or affect the integrity of our work.""

The new DOJ announcement occurred just one day after reports surfaced that a senior FBI agent resigned due to allegations of political bias. The agent was accused of downplaying the Hunter Biden investigation.

In Tuesday's memo, Garland wrote, ""I know you agree it is critical that we hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards to avoid even the appearance of political influence as we carry out the Department's mission. It is in that spirit that I have added these new restrictions on political activities by non-career employees.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dna-test-shows-hunter-biden-is-father-of-arkansas-womans-baby-despite-his-previous-denials,2022-08-31
DOJ says a major health records vendor helped drug companies push opioids on patients in exchange for kickbacks,"An electronic health records vendor was ordered to pay $145 million in damages and penalties for allowing drug companies to help create medical alerts in its software that push doctors toward prescribing more opioids, according to the Department of Justice.

San Francisco-based Practice Fusion both sought and received kickbacks from an opioid company, and in return, it allowed that company's marketing department to help craft alerts that influence physicians to prescribe potentially addictive opioids.

""Practice Fusion's conduct is abhorrent. During the height of the opioid crisis, the company took a million-dollar kickback to allow an opioid company to inject itself in the sacred doctor-patient relationship so that it could peddle even more of its highly addictive and dangerous opioids,"" Christina E. Nolan, U.S. attorney for the District of Vermont, said. ""The companies illegally conspired to allow the drug company to have its thumb on the scale at precisely the moment a doctor was making incredibly intimate, personal, and important decisions about a patient's medical care, including the need for pain medication and prescription amounts.""

Practice Fusion solicited ""sponsorship"" payments from drug companies, the DOJ said, and in exchange for those payments, Practice Fusion then allowed the drug companies to influence the process of creating clinical decision support alerts in its software.

Not only were the companies allowed input in setting the criteria for the CDS alerts to be sent to physicians, they were sometimes allowed to influence the actual text of those alerts — a shocking conflict of interest, considering the financial interest drug companies have in pushing their product.

Practice Fusion sold the arrangement to the drug companies explicitly by emphasizing the profitability of the scheme for the drug companies, who would have a chance to more than recoup their original investment. One opioid company paid Practice Fusion nearly $1 million.

In addition to the criminal aspect of the settlement, Practice Fusion will pay out millions in a civil settlement for concealing the fact that its software did not comply with all applicable certification requirements, and misled the certifying body in order to obtain the certification anyway.

Of the $145 million, Practice Fusion is paying $118.6 million in criminal fees and forfeitures, and $26 million to the federal government and state governments in civil settlements.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/doj-court-filing-shows-how-nancy-pelosi-sabotaged-dem-efforts-to-obtain-secret-mueller-files-for-impeachment,2020-01-29
Justice Dept. sues Republican Arizona governor over shipping container border wall,"The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey over his order to pile up shipping containers at the border to create a wall and deter illegal migrant crossings.

Ducey began filling gaps in the border wall with shipping containers stacked on top of each other in August. The Department of Justice objected to the policy, and Ducey filed a lawsuit in October to keep the container wall in place.

“Arizona is taking action to protest on behalf of our citizens,"" he said at the time. ""With this lawsuit, we’re pushing back against efforts by federal bureaucrats to reverse the progress we’ve made. The safety and security of Arizona and its citizens must not be ignored. Arizona is going to do the job that Joe Biden refuses to do — secure the border in any way we can. We’re not backing down.”

On Wednesday, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in an Arizona district court accusing the state government of acting unconstitutionally.

""Officials from Reclamation and the Forest Service have notified Arizona that it is trespassing on federal lands,"" the lawsuit said. ""Not only has Arizona refused to halt its trespasses and remove the shipping containers from federal lands, but it has indicated that it will continue to trespass on federal lands and install additional shipping containers.""

The government also argued that Ducey is violating the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which says that federal laws take precedence over state laws when there's a conflict between the two.

Ducey has said that the state has stacked about 130 shipping containers along 3,820 linear feet.

On Wednesday, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said California was in a fiscal crisis over the number of illegal immigrants who had been sent to the state by the federal government.

Dozens of Turkish soldiers killed in Syrian airstrike; Turkey vows retaliation,"Turkey said Thursday that dozens of its soldiers were killed in northwestern Syria in an airstrike carried out by the Syrian government, and a spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised Turkey would ""retaliate against the illegal regime.""

What are the details?

The Associated Press reported that the governor of Turkey's Hatay province, Rahmi Dogan, said 29 Turkish troops were killed and another 30-plus wounded in an airstrike carried out in the Syrian province of Idlib.

President Erdogan called an emergency meeting with his top security officials after the attack, according to the Washington Post, which cited local media reports.

Turkish officials blamed the Russian-backed Syrian government ruled by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the attack, and Erdogan spokesman Fahrettin Altun promised Turkey would ""retaliate against the illegal regime, which pointed their guns at our soldiers.""

The New York Times reported that the attack ""could dramatically change the course of the Syrian war as fears grow of a direct conflict between Russia and Turkey, a NATO member."" The outlet noted Turkish protesters rallied outside the Russian consulate in Istanbul, chanting, ""Murder Russia! Murder Putin!""

According to the Times, the spokesman for President Erdogan's Justice and Development Party told CNN Turk news channel, ""The attack against Turkey is an attack against NATO. NATO should have been with Turkey, not starting today but from before these events. We are expecting concrete actions on the safe zone and no-fly zone.""

Anything else?

Turkey also announced that it would not longer stop Syrian refugees from fleeing to Europe by land or sea, Reuters reported. A Turkish official told the outlet that Turkey's police, coast guard, and border security officials have all been told to stand down in anticipation of waves of more civilians fleeing Idlib.

Net tracking group NetBlocks.org reported on Twitter Thursday night after the attack that ""social media have now been restricted in #Turkey for over two hours. Live network data show transfer of image/video content now also limited on WhatsApp following #Idlib incident.""

The organization noted that Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube have also been restricted in the country.

WHO director was a leader of a political group designated as a terrorist organization by US officials,"World Health Organization Director Dr. Tedros is facing increased scrutiny over his ties to an organization that was designated as a terror group by US officials.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who goes by Dr. Tedros, was a leader of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, a group that was designated as a terrorist organization by U.S. officials.



A memo from the Department of Homeland Security in 2014 details the background of the EPRDF.

The TPLF is a political group founded in 1975 in Ethiopia, as an opposition group. The TPLF engaged in prolonged armed conflict with the government of Ethiopia, which, along with other groups, it succeeded in overthrowing in 1991. The TPLF then joined the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a political coalition that became the governing coalition in Ethiopia. The EPRDF continues to control the government of Ethiopia. The TPLF qualifies as a Tier III terrorist organization under INA section 212(a)(3)(B)(vi)(III) on the basis of its violent activities before it became part of the ruling coalition and the government of Ethiopia in May 1991.

In 2017, National Review called for the WHO to be defunded in part over Dr. Tedros ties to the terror group.



Dr. Tedros, as he likes to be called (he has a Ph.D. in community health), is a leader of Ethiopia's brutal minority party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front, a wing of the ruling Marxist-rooted Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. He served the violently repressive regime as minister of foreign affairs from 2012 to 2016, after a stint as health minister.

Even before he was elected to lead the WHO, Dr. Tedros was hit with accusations that he had helped cover up numerous epidemics in Ethiopia during his time as the health minister of the country.

There are also claims that Dr. Tedros was aided in his campaign to lead the WHO by China.

President Donald Trump ordered the end of US payments to the World Health Organization over their bungled response to the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats have been very critical of the move and said it was not the proper time to weaken the global institution.

'Drag 101' class for teens canceled at public library after 'veiled threats' and 'hostile' messages,"An Ohio public library summer class for teenagers titled, ""Drag 101"" — to be led by a former Miss Gay Ohio America and local drag queen — has been canceled due to the ""veiled threats"" and ""hostile"" messages, ThisWeekNews reported.

What's the background?

""Curious about the art of drag and no idea where to start? Come learn the basics with former Miss Gay Ohio America and local queen, Selena T. West!"" the original class description at the Orange Branch of the Delaware County District Library read. ""We will learn about the application of makeup and creating characters, as well as the history of drag. All genders welcome! Teens only, please.""

West's goal for the class — which would have taken place next Wednesday afternoon — was to show that ""drag is for everyone"" and give youths an outlet they may otherwise not have had, ThisWeekNews said.

""It's going to be open to everybody, and I want people to come be able to express themselves and learn about drag,"" West said, according to the outlet. ""Drag is not scary; drag is not sexual. [Teens can] learn about what seem like trivial things like hair, nails, makeup, clothing. Those are the building blocks of a Drag 101 class I would teach.""

Here's a video report about the class:

Drag 101 class for teens sparks controversy at Delaware County library youtu.be

Backlash

But library spokeswoman Nicole Fowles said ""hundreds"" of phone calls and emails came in regarding the class — a large portion from out of state — and were ""interfering with our librarians' ability to do their daily jobs,"" the outlet said.

""A small number of [the phone calls and emails] were hostile,"" she added to ThisWeekNews. ""A smaller number were veiled threats.""

So library leaders met with Delaware County Sheriff Russell Martin, who also shared his concerns, the outlet said, and that led to the class cancellation.

'It really does break our hearts'

Fowles said library leadership was upset about the cancellation. ""It really does break our hearts,"" she told ThisWeekNews.

Library Director George Needham added that ""our mission statement ensures that we will provide lifelong learning in a friendly environment. Threats of protests, hate and violence stand in direct conflict with that mission and we cannot sacrifice the safety of the public we serve,"" the outlet added.

The library issued a statement that said, in part, that other messages supported the ""Drag 101"" class taking place:

Our hearts overflowed with the stories people told us. Stories that said they wished a program like this had been offered when they were a teen living in Delaware County. Stories from parents and grandparents who said they were proud to live in a community with a library that supported them and their children. Stories from teens who would attend the program and are excited for the library's offerings of inclusive and diverse programming.

New location for class

West told ThisWeekNews that the ""Drag 101"" class will now take place at the same time — 2 to 3 p.m. June 5 — but instead at Secret Identity Comics in Delaware, Ohio.

""The owner of that shop approached me,"" West told the outlet. ""He was one of the people who spoke at the [library] board meeting in favor of the program and was really for it for all the teens to get involved and learn about the building blocks of what drag is.""

"Special counsel John Durham says Trump relationship with Russia was 'technically plausible,' is 'user-created'","The accusations of former President Donald Trump having a relationship with Russia that was provided by a Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer was ""not technically possible,"" special counsel John Durham wrote in a court filing posted Friday.

Less than two months before the 2016 presidential election, Clinton lawyer Michael Sussmann presented ""purported data and 'white papers' that allegedly demonstrated a covert communications channel"" between the Trump Organization and the Kremlin-tied Alfa Bank to then-FBI General Counsel James Baker. In February 2017, Sussman reportedly furnished an ""updated set of allegations"" about Trump working with Russia to the CIA.

Durham outlined Sussmann's involvement with the discredited anti-Trump dossier authored by ex-British Intelligence agent Christopher Steele. Sussmann allegedly met with Steele in the summer of 2016 at the law offices of Perkins Coie, where he informed Steele about the Alfa Bank allegations.

Durham noted that ""the dossier's author was hired"" by Fusion GPS to ""dig up dirt on Trump for an unnamed U.S. client.""



The Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign reportedly funded the anti-Trump dossier through Perkins Coie.

""The fact that FBI headquarters received on the same date both sets of information involving the same political campaign (Clinton campaign), the same law firm [Perkins Coie] and the same investigative firm [Fusion GPS] makes Steele’s involvement in these matters relevant,"" Durham wrote.

Sussmann is accused of lying to the FBI because he told ""the general counsel that he was not providing the allegations to the FBI on behalf of any client,"" according to the indictment. Sussmann allegedly presented the damning accusations against Trump on behalf of the Hillary Clinton campaign.

Durham claimed that Sussmann ""represented and worked for the Clinton campaign in connection with its broader opposition research efforts"" and ""took steps to integrate"" the Russian bank allegations ""into those opposition research efforts"" by Fusion GPS.

Fox News reported, ""Durham argued that the evidence is 'highly probative' because it establishes that Sussmann 'represented and worked for the Clinton campaign with its broader opposition research efforts.'""

Sussman has pleaded not guilty and has sought for the case to be dismissed, but a judge denied the request. Sussmann is scheduled to go to trial on May 16.

Durham wrote in Friday's court filing, ""While the FBI did not reach an ultimate conclusion regarding the data's accuracy or whether it might have been in whole or in part genuine, spoofed, altered, or fabricated, [the CIA] concluded in early 2017 that the Russian Bank 1 data and Russian Phone Provider 1 data was not 'technically plausible,' did not 'withstand technical scrutiny,' 'contained gaps,' 'conflicted with [itself]' and was 'user-created and not machine/tool generated.'""

However, Durham added, ""The Special Counsel’s Office has not reached a definitive conclusion in this regard.""

Durham also noted that ""separate and apart from whether the data was actually unreliable or provided a motive"" for Sussmann to lie.

""Evidence concerning the steps the FBI and Agency-2 took to investigate these matters is critical to establishing materiality because it will enable the jury to evaluate those steps, which, in turn, will inform their conclusions about whether the defendant’s alleged false statements were material and could tend to influence or impair government functions,"" Durham explained.

Durham wrote, ""At a minimum, however, the Government does expect to adduce evidence at trial reflecting (i) the fact that the FBI and Agency-2 concluded that the Russian Bank-1 allegations were untrue and unsupported and (ii) the primary bases for these conclusions, including the particular investigative and analytical steps taken by these agencies.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dr-tedros-has-terror-ties-in-ethiopia,2022-04-17
Elizabeth Warren indicates she might undermine relations with Israel if elected president,"President Donald Trump has cultivated a very close relationship with Israel during his presidency, moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognizing Israeli's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.

But Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) indicated over the weekend that she might undermine those relations if elected president.

Speaking to reporters in Iowa on Saturday, the Democratic presidential contender took a jab at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and said ""everything is on the table"" to impose a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

""Right now, Netanyahu says he is going to take Israel in a direction of increasing settlements, [but] that does not move us in the direction of a two-state solution,"" Warren said.

""It is the official policy of the United States of America to support a two-state solution, and if Israel is moving in the opposite direction, then everything is on the table,"" she continued.

When a reporter followed up for further clarification, Warren cut him off, emphasizing: ""Everything is on the table.""

Warren's comments indicate that she would make U.S. aid to Israel conditional on whether or not Israel continues to build settlements in the West Bank, which is technically Palestinian territory.

Israel, however, has not indicated it will stop building in the West Bank. In fact, Netanyahu said in August, reiterating a campaign promise, that he plans to annex all Israeli settlements in the West Bank.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/drag-101-class-for-teens-canceled,2019-10-21
Elizabeth Warren wants to change the policy that prevents sitting presidents from being indicted,"After special counsel Robert Mueller emphasized that charging President Donald Trump with a crime was never an option due to a Department of Justice policy, Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced that, if she's elected president, she'll do everything in her power to change that, according to The Hill.

Warren said that as president she would appoint officials to the Justice Department who would change policy to allow for a sitting president to be charged with a crime. She also said Congress should pass a law allowing a president to be charged.

""Congress should make it clear that Presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice,"" Warren wrote in a post on Medium. ""And when I'm President, I'll appoint Justice Department officials who will reverse flawed policies so no President is shielded from criminal accountability.

""Donald Trump believes that he can violate the law, and he believes that the role of the Department of Justice is to help him get away with it. That's not how our country is supposed to work,"" Warren continued.

Warren, who has been in favor of impeaching Pres. Trump since the Mueller report was released, believed that Mueller was referring the president for impeachment in his less-than-10 minute statement earlier this week about his findings.

""Mueller's statement made clear what those of us who have read his report already knew: He's referring President Trump for impeachment, and it's up to Congress to act,"" Warren wrote.

Still, even after the statement, even Democrats are conflicted about whether to impeach. Their hesitancy contradicts daily public statements from Democrats who claim the president has or likely has committed impeachable offenses.

But, they also fear political backlash and they understand that their case isn't nearly strong enough to convince a Republican-majority Senate to convict.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/durham-trump-russia-sussmann-dossier,2019-05-31
Musk says oil and gas production needs to be ramped up,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk issued a tweet on Friday declaring that oil and gas output should be ramped up, even though he acknowledged that such a move would have a negative impact on Tesla, which sells electric vehicles.

""Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil & gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures,"" Musk tweeted. ""Obviously, this would negatively affect Tesla, but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil & gas exports.""

He also tweeted the message, ""Hold Strong Ukraine,"" along with Ukrainian flag emojis. He followed that up by tweeting, ""And also my sympathies to the great people of Russia, who do not want this.""

Musk's comments come as Russia wreaks death and destruction in the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Ukrainians are bravely fighting back against the Russian onslaught.

The billionaire business tycoon, who is also the SpaceX CEO, has sought to help ensure that Ukraine has internet access during the conflict.

""Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route,"" Musk tweeted last week in response to Mykhailo Fedorov, a Ukrainian official who had asked Musk for Starlink stations.

Fedorov later shared a photo of supplies and tweeted, ""Starlink — here. Thanks, @elonmusk.""

Musk has issued a warning regarding the use of the satellite internet service.

""Important warning: Starlink is the only non-Russian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine, so probability of being targeted is high. Please use with caution,"" Musk tweeted. ""Turn on Starlink only when needed and place antenna away as far away from people as possible,"" he advised.

Elon Musk promises to send more Starlink systems to Ukraine to maintain internet in 'destroyed cities',"In response to pleas from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has promised to send additional Starlink systems to provide internet coverage in war-torn areas of the country.

In a Saturday tweet, Zelenskyy announced that he had spoken to Musk, who had promised additional Starlink support. Zelenskyy thanked Musk for ""supporting Ukraine with words and deeds"" and indicated that he would like to work with Musk on space projects after the war is over.

Musk, who is believed to be the richest person in the world, has become an important figure in the Ukraine-Russia conflict after he agreed to use Starlink systems to provide internet to areas of Ukraine where internet service had been shut off by the invading Russian army.

Musk also made news by refusing to block Russian state-owned news sources like Russia Today from being broadcast on Starlink, which he says many governments asked him to do. ""We will not do so unless at gunpoint,"" Musk tweeted. ""Sorry to be a free speech absolutist.""

The Russian government has responded to Musk's action by attempting — apparently with some measure of success — to jam Starlink signals in the Ukraine conflict area. In a tweet last week, Musk noted that SpaceX had developed a software workaround to the Russian jamming attempts, and said that SpaceX would reprioritize its resources to promote cybersecurity to ensure that its signals could not be jammed by hostile powers in the future.





Control over the internet and the flow of information into and out of Ukraine has been a key priority for the governments of both Ukraine and Russia during this conflict.

Emails reveal top US scientist warned Chinese colleagues that Republicans wanted to investigate Wuhan lab for COVID-19 origins,"A top U.S. scientist at a lab in Texas that shared close ties with the Wuhan Institute of Virology was offered a job at a Chinese university about one year after warning Chinese scientists that members of Congress were likely to start an investigation of the COVID-19 lab-leak theory, records obtained by Judicial Watch reveal.

In emails from April 2020, Dr. James W. LeDuc, a professor and former director of Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch, warned the top scientist at the Wuhan lab, Dr. Zhengli Shi, that Republican lawmakers were pushing for an investigation of her lab, which received funding from the U.S. government to conduct research into coronaviruses.

“These startling documents show that China had partners here in the United States willing to go to bat for them on the Wuhan lab controversy,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.

Judicial Watch obtained these email records through a public records request issued to the University of Texas Medical Branch. The Galveston National Laboratory at UTMB is among the largest active bio-containment facilities in the United States, hosting several biosafety level 4 labs where deadly diseases are studied under tight security restrictions.

LeDuc is a renowned expert on biosafety with decades of experience operating BSL-4 labs — the highest safety level designation, reserved for labs that work with the most dangerous pathogens, like the Ebola or Marburg viruses. His lab in Galveston has partnered with China since at least 2013, when construction on the Wuhan Institute began, and he has made several trips to Wuhan to train staff since at least 1986. LeDuc's Galveston lab also hosted two Chinese post-doctoral students, who were trained to work safely in BSL-4 facilities and who returned to China to work in the Wuhan lab.

The lab-leak origins theory of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, centers on the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is located near the seafood market to which the first major outbreak of the virus was traced. Though the theory is disputed by scientists who say it is more likely that COVID-19 naturally evolved from an animal host, conclusive evidence pointing toward either origins theory has remained elusive. And while neither hypothesis has been proven, opponents of the lab-leak theory have waged a vigorous campaign to label it ""misinformation"" and discredit it, often with the help of big tech companies that banned users from discussing the theory at the prompting of top public health officials. Many of these officials never disclosed potential conflicts of interest they would have if the lab-leak theory proved true, such National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose agency provided taxpayer funding for coronavirus research at the Wuhan lab.

The emails obtained by Judicial Watch show that as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and other Republicans urged the Trump administration to investigate the Wuhan lab in 2020, LeDuc became aware of their efforts and warned his Chinese colleagues.

An April 16, 2020, email from former commander of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases David Franz to LeDuc carries the subject line ""Rubio"" and states, ""I heard from someone in government this evening that Senator Rubio is starting to push for an investigation regarding Wuhan lab. Just found it on the web at Forbes by Kenneth Repoza. Title of article is ‘eight senators call for investigation into coronavirus origins.’”

The email links to a Forbes article on an effort by Rubio and seven other Republican senators to have Trump appoint a special envoy to investigate the origins of COVID-19 and the lab-leak theory. Records show that LeDuc forwarded this email to Shi, director of the Wuhan lab, requesting a phone conversation with her ""soon"" to discuss the potential investigation.

Shi wrote back on April 18, 2020, rejecting LeDuc's request. ""Due to the complicated situation, I don’t think it’s a right time to communicate by the call. What I can tell you is that this virus is not a leaky [sic] from our lab or any other labs. It’s a shame to make this scientific question so complicated.”

LeDuc responded that he had been asked to give an accounting of his work with the Wuhan lab to the University of Texas system and was preparing a summary of that work he could provide to university administrators or to members of Congress should he be asked to do so. He offered to let Shi edit the summary of their work together.



I understand completely and I certainly do not wish to compromise you personally or your research activities. Given our long history of collaborations between the GNL 9Galveston National Laboratory0 and the WIV (Wuhan Institute of Virology0, I have been approached repeatedly for details on our work. Attached is a draft summary that I will be providing to the leadership of our University of Texas system and likely to Congressional committees that are being formed now. Please review carefully and make any changes that you would like. I want this to be as accurate as possible and I certainly do not want to misrepresent any of your valuable contributions.

Two days later in an April 20, 2020, email, LeDuc wrote to Shi and Dr. Zhiming Yuan, the director of the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, informing them that he is concerned that the Wuhan lab will continue to be the focus of those investigating the origins of COVID-19.

""I’m afraid that this discussion will continue for some time regarding where early coronavirus work was being done, the role, if any, of the Wuhan CDC in research on bat-associated coronaviruses, and exactly when scientists at WIV [Wuhan Institute of Virology] first became aware of the new coronavirus and had possession of specimens in the WIV and where was that work done (level of biocontainment),"" LeDuc wrote.



Previously reported emails show that months earlier, LeDuc had pushed his Chinese colleagues to be transparent and answer questions investigators would ask about the possible origins of COVID-19. In February, LeDuc had sent Yuan a series of questions he believed the Wuhan lab would need to answer as part of an investigation into whether COVID-19 was ""the result of a release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (main campus or new BSL3/BSL4 facilities).""

The questions he asked were never answered, and China continues to stonewall international investigators.

Energy Sec. Granholm begs for companies to increase oil production after Biden admin denied that it would help gas prices,"The Biden administration appeared to put out conflicting messages on gas prices when U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm begged oil companies to increase production in order to ease the price at the pump.

The statement came after several administration members denied that increasing domestic production was possible or that it would have any effect on gas prices.

“Right now, we need oil and gas production to rise to meet current demand,” Granholm told hundreds of energy executives at the CERAWeek by S&P Global conference in Houston, Texas.

""That means you producing more right now, where and if you can,"" Granholm said to them. ""In this moment of crisis, we need more supply.""

She specifically tied the dire need to increase oil production in order to help American families struggling with the high price of gas.

""We have to responsibly increase short term supply where we can right now to stabilize the market and to minimize harm to American families,"" Granholm said.



That contrasted with a statement from President Joe Biden on Tuesday where he said gas prices were solely the fault of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""They're going to go up,"" he said to reporters about future gas prices. ""Can't do much right now. Russia is responsible.""

Deputy National Security Advisor Daleep Singh made similar claims about Biden shutting down the Keystone Pipeline from Canada when he first entered office.



""Keystone has absolutely nothing to do with the current supply and demand in energy markets,"" Singh claimed on ""Morning Joe"" on MSNBC Wednesday.

""Keystone is a pipeline, it’s not an oil field. It doesn’t produce additional oil,"" he added. ""Even if we drilled as much as we could, the price of oil is still set globally by the demand and supply conditions.""

The same sentiment was also expressed by White House Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese on CNBC.

""There is no amount of domestic production that we can do when we're dealing with a volatile global commodity where the price is set globally, there is no amount of domestic production we can do to reduce or eliminate our vulnerability as a country to that volatility,"" said Deese.

""The only way to do that is to the energy intensity of the economy overall, which means shifting to cleaner sources of energy,"" he added.

Granholm was previously criticized in November when she responded with laughter to a question about how she plans to increase oil production.

Here's Granholm's statement to the media:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-promises-to-send-more-starlink-systems-to-ukraine-to-maintain-internet-in-destroyed-cities,2022-03-10
Biden's EPA set to run small Texas oil refinery out of business with big gov't regulations — even as energy prices skyrocket over Russia conflict,"The Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden is set to abruptly issue a sweeping denial of economic hardship exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program from small oil refineries around the U.S., likely forcing one Texas refinery to go out of business at a time when American energy independence is desperately needed.

In a forthcoming letter to the agency, obtained by TheBlaze, Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy urged the EPA to reconsider its proposed decision to deny more than 60 pending small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions on behalf of The San Antonio Refinery LLC (TSAR), a small independent refinery in South Texas.

TSAR, which sources its oil from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, employs roughly 100 workers at its facility and primarily supplies gasoline and diesel to the San Antonio and Austin areas, operating at a production capacity of 21,000 barrels per day.

Since 2013, under the Clean Air Act, TSAR has been able to avoid burdensome costs associated with RFS ethanol blending mandates under a statutory guideline that allows refineries with a capacity of fewer than 75,000 barrels per day to request exemption — so long as they can demonstrate compliance would cause ""disproportionate economic hardship.""

But that all changed in December 2021 when the EPA proposed denying all pending SRE petitions, which for TSAR, included petitions from the 2019, 2020, and 2021 compliance years.

In his letter, Roy warned that imposing such a staggering regulatory burden would be catastrophic for small refineries like TSAR.

""Executing this proposal could lead to the closure of TSAR, an independent small refinery located in San Antonio, Texas, and would kill good-paying jobs, further increase the cost of refined products, and make the U.S. more dependent on hostile foreign nations like Russia for energy,"" Roy writes in a letter to EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan.

""TSAR estimates that the combined cost of denying SREs for these years could be up to six times greater than what it spends on payroll annually. This would likely put the refinery out of business,"" Roy continued, adding, ""If that is not 'disproportionate economic hardship,' I don’t know what is.""

The congressman argued that under the RFS's statutory rules, the EPA is obligated to consider each exemption request on its own merits, a provision the agency appears to have ignored with its sweeping proposal.

TheBlaze reached out to the EPA requesting a comment on the matter, but the agency has not yet issued a response.

The regulatory burden on small oil refineries also comes as America's need for energy independence is crystallized amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. has inexplicably become more reliant on foreign energy in recent years — specifically doubling its imports of Russian oil in 2021. Now, the Biden administration appears hamstrung by its reliance, unable or unwilling to curtail purchases of Russian oil, thereby enriching Moscow as it carries out an unprovoked attack on its neighboring country.

Yet in the midst of all this, the EPA is set to make it even harder to obtain domestic energy at a time when it is most needed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/emails-reveal-top-u-s-scientist-warned-chinese-colleagues-that-republicans-wanted-to-investigate-wuhan-lab-for-covid-19-origins,2022-03-03
Erik Wemple slams CNN for Cuomo brothers love-a-thon,"Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple went scorched earth during an appearance on CNN. While appearing on CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" Wemple bashed the liberal cable TV news network for allowing CNN host Chris Cuomo to have ""love-a-thons"" with his brother Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).

Chris Cuomo is the anchor of CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time,"" which is self-described as a ""news program where Cuomo tests power with newsmakers and politicians from both sides of the aisle."" However during the coronavirus pandemic, Cuomo welcomed his New York governor brother on the show to deliver an unchallenged and glowing narrative of his leadership.

Many times the interviews were completely unprofessional and chummy. There were jokes that the governor only appeared on the show because their mom made him and then there was a strange segment that involved a gigantic Q-tip. All this positive coverage despite New York having the second-most coronavirus deaths per million and there being bombshell reports that New York's nursing home deaths were far higher than Cuomo's administration admitted.

Cuomo has not appeared on his brother's CNN show since the flurry of sexual harassment allegations against the governor started to storm in.

Flash forward to Sunday, Wemple was a guest on ""Reliable Sources"" to discuss the media coverage of Andrew Cuomo and his scandals. Wemple did not hold back at pointing out the bias of a news network previously handing out flattering publicity to a political figure by his own brother.

""I would be remiss, Brian, if I didn't mention CNN's own huge media story here with Chris Cuomo, the anchor at the nine o'clock hour, who covered Andrew Cuomo and had all these wonderful love-a-thon interviews with him, more than ten of them,"" Wemple told CNN host Brian Stelter.

""And they suspended the conflict of interest rule for Chris Cuomo for those interviews, yet all of the sudden they've enforced it again now that Andrew Cuomo is in the midst of a historic scandal in the Albany State House,"" Wemple continued.

""So, I think that is a major black eye for CNN,"" Wemple proclaimed. ""I will say that you and other people have covered the Cuomo story very aggressively, so I do want to be fair about this, but it is a major black eye for this network.""

Stelter looked stone-faced as Wemple ripped his network during an interview on CNN.

To his credit, this isn't the first time that Wemple has called out a left-leaning cable TV news host. In 2019, Wemple bashed MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow for her partisanship and ""rooting"" for the Steele dossier to be true instead of being more concerned with the truth.

When small bits of news arose in favor of the dossier, the franchise MSNBC host pumped air into them. At least some of her many fans surely came away from her broadcasts thinking the dossier was a serious piece of investigative research, not the flimflam, quick-twitch game of telephone outlined in the Horowitz report. She seemed to be rooting for the document.



And when large bits of news arose against the dossier, Maddow found other topics more compelling.



She was there for the bunkings, absent for the debunkings — a pattern of misleading and dishonest asymmetry.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/energy-sec-granholm-begs-for-companies-to-produce-more-oil-after-biden-admin-denied-that-it-would-help-gas-prices,2021-03-14
ESPN gets political again as Dan Le Batard rips Trump rally 'send her back' chant,"ESPN, at the command of its president, has avoided political discussions since former host Jemele Hill got into a public conflict with President Donald Trump in 2017. After the ""send her back"" chants at Wednesday night's Trump campaign rally, however, one network host could no longer hold his silence.

Dan Le Batard, who hosts a daily show on ESPN Radio, called out both Trump for the chant and his own network for its avoidance of political issues.

""So, what happened last night. This felt un-American. Basically, a chant, 'Send her back.' It's not the America that my parents came to get for us … There's a racial division in this country that's being instigated by the president,"" Le Batard said. ""And we here at ESPN haven't had the stomach for that fight because Jemele (Hill) did some things on Twitter, and you saw what happened after that. Then, here, all of the sudden, nobody talks politics on anything unless we can use one of these sports figures as a meat shield in the most cowardly possible way to discuss the subject.""

Le Batard criticized the president for using racial division as a way to boost his reelection efforts.

""It is so wrong what the president of our country is doing, trying to go down getting reelected by dividing the masses at a time when the old white man, the old, rich white man feels oppressed being attacked by minorities,"" Le Batard said. ""Black people, brown people, women - that's who we're going after now. Black people, brown people, women - let's do it, as the platform.""

Trump disavowed the ""send her back"" chant on Thursday, saying he disagreed with it and maintaining that he moved on with his speech quickly in order to prevent it from continuing.""

ESPN host skips show after clashing with network president over Trump criticism,"ESPN host Dan Le Batard skipped his Monday morning radio show after a weekend conversation with network president Jimmy Pitaro over Le Batard's on-air criticism of President Donald Trump, according to John Ourand of Sports Business Journal.

What's the news?

After the crowd at a Trump campaign rally in North Carolina chanted ""send her back"" last week in reference to Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Le Batard violated ESPN's policy prohibiting on-air personalities from discussing politics on the network. Le Batard attacked the chant, the president, and even ESPN for not having the courage to delve into political issues.

Ourand reported that Le Batard and Pitaro spoke over the weekend, and the two men could not reach common ground on the issue of discussing politics on the air.

""Dan Le Batard will not be on the radio today,"" Ourand tweeted. ""He expects to be back on it tomorrow. He will be on 'Highly Questionable' this afternoon. Le Batard and ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro were in contact much of the weekend. Sources said Pitaro would not waver from his policy of no pure-play politics. Le Batard told Pitaro that he was not in the right frame of mind to do his radio show Monday.""

Why does it matter?

ESPN's decision to shut down political talk from it's on-air talent was a business decision. The audience made it clear through ratings that when they turn on ESPN, it's for sports, not politics.

The network also didn't like the heat that came when former host Jemele Hill called President Trump a white supremacist on Twitter, a remark that put the network directly in Trump's crosshairs.

I support ESPN's stance on this. As someone deeply immersed in politics on a daily basis, the last thing I want to hear when I turn on ESPN to relax is political conflict.

I understand that sports talk personalities are not detached from events outside sports, and they sometimes feel a responsibility to use their platforms to speak out against what they feel is wrong. But, they're also entertainers, and they're paid to deliver a specific product to the audience.

I don't think it's ""cowardly"" for ESPN to tell its talent to keep their politics to themselves, as Le Batard suggests. I, for one, hope that ESPN can remain one of the few places I can reliably turn to when I want to take some time away from the often-distressing world of political current events.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/erik-wemple-cnn-cuomo-stetler,2019-07-22
EU unveils new legislation aimed at protecting independent media,"European media could soon be subject to new rules that aim to protect journalism from government influence and spying.

The Media Freedom Act, adopted last week by the European Commission, bans the use of spyware and other surveillance tactics against journalists and their family members. The act also forbids the search and seizure of media offices. However, the act makes an exception to these rules “on the ground of national security…or in case of investigations of a closed list of crimes, such as terrorism, child abuse or murder.”

The law also addresses the “opaque and unfair allocation of state advertising” which the commission argues may influence public media or subsidize “media outlets that provide government-friendly views.”

The legislation is also intended to protect against “rogue media service providers…which may prejudice or pose risks of prejudice to public security and defense.” Earlier this year, the EU implemented a ban on the media outlet Russia Today over alleged disinformation.

Under the new law, media organizations will also have to disclose potential conflicts of interest by declaring who owns them.

A European Board for Media Services will be set up to oversee the act's implementation, monitor how regulatory decisions affect the European media landscape, and combat disinformation on online media platforms.

Several EU governments have been criticized for interfering with journalists over the past several months. The head of Greek intelligence recently revealed that his agency had spied on a journalist whose work has included investigative reporting on financial crimes.

In a joint statement, the European Magazine Media Association and the European Newspaper Publishers’ Association took issue with the law and called for its dismissal. ""It is not acceptable and highly problematic that in a proposal intended to protect media freedom the European Commission reveals plans to de facto override the principle of publishers’ editorial freedom…as well as the freedom to invest and conduct a business,"" the statement read.

Eurpean Commission Vice President Věra Jourová also stated that she was prepared for a clash with governments who oppose the legislation. ""This will be an uphill struggle,"" Jourová said. ""We cannot and we will not stay idle in the light of threats to media freedom.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/espn-gets-political-again-as-dan-le-batard-rips-trump-rally-send-her-back-chant,2022-09-18
Warning signs that Europe could have an energy crisis this winter,"Energy prices are soaring in Europe because of inflation and the repercussions of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. There are numerous warning signs that Europe could face a crippling energy crisis this winter.

Inflation has spiked

Inflation is surging in Europe. In July, the annual inflation rate was up 9.8% among the 28 European Union member nations – up from 2.5% a year earlier.

Russia holds power over Europe's natural gas supply

Gazprom – the Russian government-owned energy behemoth – has shut down a critical natural gas pipeline to Europe. Last week, Gazprom switched off the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to perform urgent maintenance work.

There are concerns that Russia may hold Europe hostage with the pipeline over the winter.

Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia supplied more than a third of Germany’s gas supplies.

Europe is already burdened with record-high energy prices

In August, Spain experienced its most expensive month for electricity since records have been kept.

France 24 reported, ""The year-ahead contract for German electricity reached 995 euros ($995) per megawatt hours while the French equivalent surged past 1,100 euros – a more than tenfold increase in both countries from last year. In Britain, energy regulator Ofgem said it would increase the electricity and gas price cap almost twofold from October 1 to an average £3,549 ($4,197) per year.""

Daniele Franco – Italy's Minister of Economy and Finance – warned that the country's net energy import costs will more than double this year to nearly 100 billion euros ($99.5 billion). Franco said the nation was helpless in the matter, ""To keep offsetting, at least in part, rising energy prices through public finances is very costly and we could never do enough.""

Germany faces a coal shortage

The lack of oil and gas has forced European nations to increase their dependency on coal.

In Germany, the water levels in the Rhine River have hit crisis levels amid summer heatwaves. The Rhine River – one of Europe's key waterways – has already been closed due to low water levels.

""Due to very reduced domestic shipping, accumulated coal stocks could quickly fall,"" Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action said in a document obtained by Reuters.

Other major waterways have also prevented large vessels from bringing coal to European countries. That coal is now stuck in ports. Approximately 8 million tons of coal were stranded in ports at the end of July, Politico reported. If the supply chain woes continue, it will have dire effects on Germany, Poland, and Switzerland in the winter.

Scandinavian governments are bailing out energy companies

Finland and Sweden announced that they plan to offer billions of dollars to energy companies to prevent them from ending up in ""technical bankruptcy.""

""The rapid rise in electricity prices has resulted in paper losses on electricity futures contracts of energy firms, forcing them to find funds to post additional collateral with the exchanges,"" according to Reuters.

Finland will offer $9.95 billion, and Sweden will give $23.2 billion to energy companies.

Businesses face bankruptcy over energy costs

MakeUK – the lobbyist group for British factories – said nearly half of all manufacturers in the country have seen electricity bills skyrocket more than 100% in the past year.



Bloomberg reported, ""Soaring energy bills are threatening to put six in 10 British manufacturers out of business, according to a survey that lays bare the extent of the crisis facing the next prime minister.""

Sky-high energy prices are severely curtailing production

""Nordic Greens, one of the largest tomato growers in both Denmark and Sweden, has announced that they will not grow any tomatoes during winter in their Sweden-based cultivation because of the skyrocketing electricity prices, ""according to HortiDaily – a global greenhouse news website.

An estimated 500 tonnes of tomatoes will be lost because of the shutdown.

Multiple European aluminum smelters have drastically cut production or temporarily shut down because of spiking energy prices.

""Industry insiders say the escalating energy crisis is now threatening to create an extinction event across large swathes of the region’s aluminum production,"" Bloomberg reported.

Restrictions on electricity, heat, and water

Since July, some of Germany's biggest cities implemented restrictions on warm water, heat, and lighting.

U.S. Army bracing for energy shortages at a military base in Germany

Last month, the U.S. Army notified troops that there would likely be energy restrictions at the U.S. Army Garrison in Ansbach, Germany.



""USAG Ansbach installations rely solely on local German utility partners for power, heating, and water needs,"" the Army memo stated. ""In spite of all the solar panels and windmills in Germany, a large percentage of the energy used for heating within the EU is imported…much of it from Russia.""



DPW Energy manager Brad Jennings said, ""There is the potential that we will have to endure large cuts in available power and heating.""

The U.S. Army advised servicemembers to put on extra clothing, minimize long, hot showers by lowering the temperature, and use cold water instead of hot.

Civil unrest is on the rise across the globe

Verisk Maplecroft – a risk consultancy firm – released its latest Civil Unrest Index last week. The most recent report found that out of 198 countries, 101 experienced an increase in risk of civil unrest, versus only 42 which decreased.

""The data, covering seven years, shows that the last quarter saw more countries witness an increase in risks from civil unrest than at any time since the Index was released,"" the report stated.

The analysts noted that ""rising food and energy prices will make it more difficult for governments to manage popular discontent.""

""A cold autumn and winter in Europe would worsen an already serious energy and cost of living crisis,"" the report said.

On Friday, Italians burned their energy bills in front of the town hall in Naples.

On Saturday, an estimated 70,000 protesters staged a demonstration in Prague ""against soaring energy bills and demand an end to sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine,"" according to the Guardian.

European Union fails to implement Russian oil embargo despite overall unified opposition to Russia,"The European Union was unable to reach a consensus on banning the import of Russian oil into member nations.

The New York Times reported the member nations of the European Union were unable to reach a unanimous decision in Brussels to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin by cutting off imports of Russian oil.

Reportedly, the diplomatic envoy from Hungary put up the most resistance to the proposed ban on Russian oil imports.

In order for the European Union to implement sanctions, as an institution, all 27 of its member states must agree to enforce them in their respective nations. Historically, countries like Hungary and Germany have been hesitant to issue restrictions on oil imports from Russia due to their nations’ dependence on it. Currently, the European Union is the single largest consumer of crude oil and fuel from Russia. In 2019, almost two-thirds of the European Union’s crude oil imports came from Russia.

Despite the roadblock in banning the import of Russian oil, the European Union member states appear to be solidly unified against Russia as the war in Ukraine drags on.

The European Union has already approved five sanctions packages against Russia. This latest package and its subsequent failure to pass underscore what U.S. intelligence officials have warned that the leadership of Russia is counting on: weakening Western resolve as the conflict drags on. That said, this recent round of sanctions would have caused considerable economic distress for the people of the countries implementing the sanctions.

The U.S. director of national intelligence, Avril D. Haines, said, “Putin most likely also judges that Russia has a greater ability and willingness to endure challenges than his adversaries, and he is probably counting on U.S. and E.U. resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation, and energy prices get worse.”

Haines delivered these remarks as Russia appeared to be nearing the fulfillment of one its stated goals of the invasion: taking control of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. However, Haines suggested that taking control of Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine is likely neither to satisfy Putin nor bring the war to a close. Haines suggested that Putin likely wants to claim territory that stretches across Ukraine’s Black Sea coast but that this goal will take much longer to achieve.

On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to send Ukraine $40 billion in aid.

"Exclusive: Trump calls for recusal of Clinton-appointed judge reviewing his lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, DNC","In an exclusive interview with BlazeTV host Glenn Beck, former President Donald Trump discussed his lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, and others who he says colluded to defeat his 2016 presidential campaign and sabotage his presidency.

Trump's attorneys filed the lawsuit this week, naming nearly 50 defendants and charging them with a smattering of accusations including, but not limited to, a RICO conspiracy, injurious falsehood, conspiracy to commit injurious falsehood, malicious prosecution, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act violations, and theft of trade secrets.



""It was totally corrupt what they did,"" Trump told Beck, repeating his accusation that the Obama administration ""spied on my campaign"" in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election.

In the 108-page complaint filed in the Southern District of Florida, Trump's attorneys argue that Clinton, her campaign, former FBI Director James Comey, the DNC, and many others ""orchestrated an unthinkable plot—one that shocks the conscience and is an affront to this nation's democracy."" Trump's lawsuit alleges that these actors hatched a plot to falsify records and manipulate data in an attempt to ""cripple Trump's bid for presidency"" during the 2016 election.



Trump indicated that his lawyers have ""been building this up for a long time"" and that more names could be added to the lawsuit as special counsel John Durham completes his probe into the FBI's handling of the Russia investigation.

The lawsuit will be heard by U.S. District Court Judge Donald Middlebrooks, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton. In 2015, Middlebrooks threw out a civil racketeering suit filed against Hillary Clinton that claimed she had used her private email server and position as secretary of state to promise changes in U.S. foreign policy in exchange for speaking fees and donations to the Clinton Foundation.

Trump accused this judge of having a ""conflict of interest"" and said he should recuse himself from the lawsuit.

""We have a judge that was appointed by Bill Clinton. And who knows Hillary Clinton very well. And we're suing Hillary Clinton,"" he said.

""Now, the problem we have, though, is if you have a judge that's going to throw out the case, and you have to go through appeals. Yep, I think you have a great appeals section. But we'll see. So we'll probably ask for a recusal. Maybe a change of venue. But not a change as much as a recusal,"" he added later.



The former president is seeking at least $72 million in damages to recoup legal fees and lost business earnings his legal team says he suffered from the allegations that his campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election.

Some legal experts and analysts have dismissed Trump's lawsuit, saying it is deeply flawed and predicting that it will be tossed out of court and possibly result in sanctions against Trump and his legal team; however, Trump's attorney, Alina Habba, has defended the lawsuit in written statements to the media.

“For years, Hillary Clinton and her cohorts attempted to shield themselves from culpability by directing others to do their dirty work for them. This lawsuit seeks to hold all parties accountable for their heinous acts and uphold the principles of our sacred democracy,” she said.

Explosive report provides new details on Fauci's lab-leak cover-up,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top expert on COVID-19, was privately urged by former CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield to vigorously investigate both the lab-leak and natural origins theories of virus in early 2020, only to then exclude Redfield from discussions with world-renowned virologists and wage a PR campaign denouncing the lab-leak theory as a conspiracy theory, according to an investigative report.



The explosive report from Vanity Fair reveals new details of how Fauci and former National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins strongly pushed back against scientists who raised legitimate questions about the origins of the virus — questions that could implicate the NIH's financial support for the non-governmental group EcoHealth Alliance and risky bat virus research in China.

By analyzing more than 100,000 internal EcoHealth documents, interviewing five former staff members, and speaking with 33 other sources, Vanity Fair's Katherine Eban uncovered how EcoHealth Alliance operated in a world of ""murky grant agreements, flimsy oversight, and the pursuit of government funds for scientific advancement, in part by pitching research of steeply escalating risk.""

Her report delves deep inside EcoHealth Alliance, showing how the group's president, Peter Daszak, spent years wooing Fauci — at times literally at D.C. cocktail parties — to win federal support for gain-of-function studies at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese lab central to the lab-leak hypothesis of COVID-19's origins. Fauci, in turn, worked with Daszak, Collins, and other top virologists to lead a well-documented campaign discrediting the lab-leak theory, all the while never being completely transparent about their potential conflicts of interest should the theory prove true.



Under Fauci's tenure at NIAID, EcoHealth Alliance received a $3.7 million federal grant in 2014 to study the potential for a deadly new coronavirus to emerge from wild bats in China. The group partnered with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, sub-awarding the lab $600,000 in federal funds, to collect virus samples from bats and analyze them.



In early 2020, the deadly COVID-19 pandemic would be traced back to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, near where the lab is located. Early analysis suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was 96.2% similar to a previously discovered bat coronavirus, which led many scientists to believe the most likely origin for COVID-19 was that it hopped from bats to humans, possibly through an intermediary animal. However, an animal host for SARS-CoV-2 was never discovered. And unique features of the virus led some of the world's top virologists, including those associated with Fauci, to raise the possibility that it was laboratory-engineered.

The fundamental questions concerning COVID-19 are whether EcoHealth Alliance paid for gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab — experiments that make viruses deadlier and more infectious to humans — and whether Chinese scientists, either with federal funding from EcoHealth Alliance or on their own, engineered the SARS-CoV-2 virus before it somehow escaped the laboratory and caused a global pandemic, killing more than six million people.

After the pandemic began, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield asked those questions.



“I personally felt it wasn’t biologically plausible that [SARS CoV-2] went from bats to humans through an [intermediate] animal and became one of the most infectious viruses to humans,” he told Vanity Fair.

As the Chinese government worked to cover up the spread of COVID-19 in late 2019 and through the new year, Trump administration officials desperately sought to learn how the pandemic started. Redfield was aware of a 2015 gain-of-function study funded by EcoHealth Alliance and published by Wuhan lab scientist Dr. Zhengli Shi with University of North Carolina virus expert Dr. Ralph Baric. The study had shown it was possible to manipulate a SARS-like bat coronavirus in a laboratory setting so that it would infect human cells, which researchers believed showed the danger that such a virus could naturally evolve to threaten humans.

The gain-of-function experiments were carried out in Baric's laboratory in North Carolina, but the Chinese scientists had learned his techniques. Redfield questioned whether scientists in Wuhan had gone on to carry out gain-of-function experiments on their own, at a laboratory with insufficient security and little international oversight. Could that be where COVID-19 came from?

According to Vanity Fair, Redfield brought his concerns to Fauci in mid-January 2020. He also shared them with Jeremy Farrar, the director of the U.K. mega-charity Wellcome Trust, and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO). His message was: “We had to take the lab-leak hypothesis with extreme seriousness.”



What happened next is scandalous. A Freedom of Information Act request by BuzzFeed News revealed that on February 1, 2020, at 12:30 a.m., Fauci emailed NIAID principal deputy director Hugh Auchincloss a copy of the 2015 gain-of-function study and wrote, ""Hugh: It is essential that we speak this AM. Keep your cell phone on."" He told Auchincloss to read the paper and wrote, ""You will have tasks today that must be done.""



Later that day, Farrar organized a conference call with 11 top international virologists including Fauci and NIH Director Francis Collins to discuss what was known about the virus. Astonishingly, Redfield was excluded from the call. According to Vanity Fair, he was not even told it was happening. The person in charge of the agency leading the U.S. government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic was kept out of discussions about the origins of the virus after asking Fauci and Farrar to seriously investigate all the possibilities.

The conference call was held ""in total confidence,"" and the details of the discussion remain shrouded in secrecy. What is known is that before the call, some of the participants, such as Dr. Kristian Andersen, a virologist at Scripps Research, had noted that some features of SARS-CoV-2 ""(potentially) look engineered."" Andersen told Fauci in an email that several experts who had analyzed the virus ""find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.""

But after the call, those involved would condemn the lab-leak hypothesis and those advancing it. Within three days, four of the scientists who raised the possibility of a laboratory origin for COVID-19 signed on to a draft letter declaring that “we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.” That letter, titled, ""The Proximal Origins of SARS-CoV-2,"" was published in the journal Nature Medicine on March 17. National media outlets seized on the statement, inaccurately referring to it as a ""study"" that purportedly debunked the lab-leak theory.

Redfield, meanwhile, says he realized Fauci, Farrar, and the others had gone behind his back and launched a concerted effort to present the appearance of a scientific consensus that would shut down discussion of the lab-leak theory.

""They made a decision, almost a P.R. decision, that they were going to push one point of view only” he told Vanity Fair. “They argued they did it in defense of science, but it was antithetical to science.”

A spokesperson for the Wellcome Trust disputed that characterization. ""The letter was a simple statement of solidarity with highly reputable researchers based in China and against non-evidence-based theories. Dr. Farrar does not believe the letter was covertly organized. He had no conflict of interest to declare,"" the spokesperson told Vanity Fair.



Vanity Fair's report recounts several details that have been previously reported by TheBlaze and others, such as Peter Daszak's own campaign to organize scientists to denounce the lab-leak theory as a ""conspiracy"" and his effusive praise for Fauci's public comments asserting the same. It paints a picture of Daszak as egotistical, gluttonous for federal funds to keep EcoHealth Alliance afloat, and naively trusting of his partners in communist China. He sought to ""present the lab-leak hypothesis as a groundless and destructive conspiracy theory,"" all the while never disclosing that were it true, his own organization would come under intense scrutiny for funding related, risky research at the Wuhan lab.

Yet even after unanswered questions and unlikely coincidences propelled the lab-leak theory into the mainstream, Fauci and Collins continued to play defense for Daszak and EcoHealth Alliance, in public and in private.



Vanity Fair describes in a revealing incident how the NIH officials were hostile to any suggestion by scientists that contradicted the natural origins narrative or placed suspicion on China.

In June 2021, an American scientist named Dr. Jesse Bloom discovered that Chinese researchers appeared to have deleted important data from an NIH database that collects virus samples. He wrote a paper detailing how early genomic sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus had ""somehow vanished without a trace,"" suggesting that this data may provide a clue regarding the origins of COVID-19.

Bloom told Vanity Fair that he took his preprint paper to Fauci for review because it contained sensitive revelations about the NIH, given that the agency ran the database from which the viral sequences went missing. Bloom realized that the NIH itself had deleted the data, at the request of Chinese researchers at the Wuhan institute, and he wanted Fauci and NIH Director Francis Collins to help him find other missing data that could shine a light on the origins of COVID-19.

Collins reportedly organized a Zoom meeting to discuss the paper on June 20. He invited outside experts, including Kristian Andersen — who had previously voiced suspicions that the virus looked potentially engineered, only to reverse those suspicions after the call with Fauci — and virologist Robert Garry, to participate on the call. Both of these scientists were also on the secretive conference call put together by Jeremy Farrar more than a year earlier. Bloom was permitted to bring his own support, and he invited evolutionary biologist Sergei Pond and genetic biologist Rasmus Nielsen.

Bloom had sought advice and support for his investigation of COVID-19's origins. Instead, the meeting was reportedly ""extremely contentious."" Andersen reportedly told Bloom his paper was ""deeply troubling"" and said it would be unethical to analyze the deleted viral sequences, since the Chinese scientists had wanted them deleted and that was their right.

Andersen — who had himself once declared that ""some of the features [of the virus] (potentially) look engineered"" — allegedly asserted there was nothing unusual about those early genomic sequences from Wuhan.

According to Bloom's account, a shouting match erupted between Nielsen and Andersen after Nielsen insisted the Wuhan sequences were ""extremely puzzling and unusual.""

But Andersen made another objection, according to Bloom, stating that he ""needed security outside his house, and my preprint would fuel conspiratorial notions that China was hiding data and thereby lead to more criticism of scientists such as himself.” This, of course, is not an objection to the scientific points Bloom raised at all.

When Fauci weighed in, he objected to the preprint paper's description of the Chinese scientists ""surreptitiously"" deleting the data, telling Bloom his choice of words was loaded and that the reason for the deletion was unknown.

Andersen reportedly made an offer to Bloom: He said he was a screener at the preprint server, which gave him access to Bloom's work before it went public. He offered to either delete the preprint or revise it ""in a way that would leave no record that this had been done,"" Bloom recounted to Vanity Fair. The offer was rejected, said Bloom, who reportedly told Andersen that it would not be appropriate to secretly edit or delete the paper ""given the contentious nature of the meeting.""

Vanity Fair reports that both Fauci and Collins thought Andersen had gone too far and distanced themselves from his offer. ""Just for the record, I want to be clear that I never suggested you delete or revise the preprint,” Fauci said, according to Bloom.

Reached for comment by Vanity Fair, Andersen called Bloom's account ""false,"" and Garry said it was ""nonsense."" Sergei Pond, however, confirmed Bloom's story as accurate after having it read aloud to him. “I don’t remember the exact phrasing—I didn’t take any notes—but from what you described, that sounds accurate. I definitely felt bad for poor Jesse."" He told Vanity Fair that the ""charged-up"" atmosphere struck him as ""inappropriate for a scientific meeting."" A spokesperson for Fauci did not comment.

This account is disturbing. At the very least, it shows how Fauci, Collins, and the others strongly pushed back against any criticism of their preferred COVID-19 origins narrative, even dismissing legitimate questions raised by scientists earnestly seeking the truth. There is no scientific reason for silencing that debate. But as the NIH's ties to EcoHealth Alliance and the potential conflicts of interest therein demonstrate, there were plenty of political reasons for doing so.

"Exposé reveals Twitter, other social media platforms routinely hire former feds: It's a 'revolving door'","Alan MacLeod of MintPress News has just released an exposé of the hiring practices in Silicon Valley, particularly at Twitter, and his findings suggest that many social media companies have filled some of their highest security positions and most influential positions with former members of federal agencies, including the FBI, CIA, and the military.

According to MacLeod, former high-profile FBI figures Dawn Burton, Karen Walsh, Jim Baker, Mark Jaroszewski, and Douglas Turner, as well as former FBI agents listed as Matthew W., Patrick G., and Bruce A., and FBI employees Cherrelle Y. and Laura D. all once held or currently hold positions at Twitter related to policy, security, finances, or legal issues.

Whistleblower Coleen Rowley, a former FBI agent, said she's not at all surprised, claiming that there's now a ""revolving door"" between federal agents and the companies they were once charged with policing.

In all, dozens have made the jump from federal law enforcement to social media, and MacLeod argued that the cozy relationship between the two sectors creates a myopic feedback loop that affects social media policies regarding censorship and disinformation, just as it reifies the prestige of federal agencies.

“These [tech] companies are using the mythical aura of the FBI,"" Rowley said. ""They can point to somebody and say, ‘Oh, you can trust us; our CEO or CFO is FBI.'”

And Twitter and the FBI are not the only entities to do so. Facebook, TikTok, the CIA, even the Army and Marine Corps all have crossovers between social media and the federal government, and some of those crossovers have gigs in Silicon Valley and with the federal government at the same time.

And not just the U.S. federal government. In 2019, Gordon Macmillan, Twitter's head of editorial for the entire Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, was also discovered to be a member of what MacLeod called ""the British Army’s notorious 77th Brigade,"" which he said is ""dedicated to online warfare and psychological operations.""

MacLeod carefully noted, however, that none of the persons mentioned in his piece are considered bad actors and that ""there is a limited pool of people qualified in these sorts of fields."" However, MacLeod also argued that the career pipeline from federal agency to social media platform is both bad optics and, as Rowley says, a conflict of interest.

“In terms of their outlooks on the world and on the question of misinformation and internet security, you couldn’t get a better field of professionals who are almost inherently going to be more in tune with the government’s perspective"" than former federal agents now working for social media companies, Rowley said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/exclusive-trump-calls-for-recusal-of-clinton-appointed-judge-reviewing-his-lawsuit,2022-07-06
"Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp experience outages, company CTO says 'network error' to blame","Facebook's chief technology officer offered ""sincere"" apologies to users experiencing a widespread outages Monday afternoon after Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp went down.

Thousands of users around the world began reporting outages on Facebook's website and on it's apps Instagram and WhatsApp around 11 a.m. ET Monday, according to DownDetector.

""We're aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products,"" Facebook said in a statement posted to Twitter. ""We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.""

Information on what caused the outage was initially limited. Nearly five hours after the website went down, Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer said the company was experiencing ""network issues,"" causing the outage.

""*Sincere* apologies to everyone impacted by outages of Facebook powered services right now,"" Schroepfer tweeted. ""We are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible.""

Facebook employees that spoke to The Verge said the outage has disabled the internal communication systems the company relies on for work. Employees are reportedly communicating via work-provided Outlook email accounts, though they cannot receive emails from external addresses. Anyone who was logged out of services like Google Docs or Zoom before the outage and uses their work email to log in reportedly cannot access those programs.

The Verge reports that Facebook has deployed engineers to its U.S. data centers to fix the problem, but it is unclear when the social network or its companion apps will be back online.

More from The Verge:

A peek at Down Detector (or your Twitter feed) reveals the problems are widespread. While it's unclear exactly why the platforms are unreachable for so many people, their DNS records show that, like last week's Slack outage, the problem is apparently DNS (it's always DNS).



Cloudflare senior vice president Dane Knecht notes that Facebook's border gateway protocol routes — BGP helps networks pick the best path to deliver internet traffic — have been ""withdrawn from the internet."" While some have speculated about hackers, or an internal protest over last night's whistleblower report, there isn't any information yet to suggest anything malicious is to blame.

The outage is compounding a public relations nightmare for Facebook as whistleblower Frances Haugen will testify to Congress on Tuesday. During a ""60 Minutes"" interview, Haugen, 37, a data scientist from Iowa, revealed herself as the whistleblower who filed complaints with law enforcement alleging that Facebook's own research shows its platform amplifies hate, misinformation, and political unrest — data that Facebook has hidden from the public. She plans to ask Congress to introduce new regulations against the social media giant.

""The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook. And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money,"" Haugen told ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/explosive-report-provides-new-details-on-fauci-s-lab-leak-cover-up,2021-10-04
"Facebook rejects ads for 'Florida Strong' T-shirts, veteran CEO says there's bias against conservative messages","Veteran-owned clothing company Nine Line Apparel has come into conflict with Facebook over ads for a T-shirt the company is selling to raise money for Hurricane Ian relief.

Tyler Merritt, a retired Army captain and CEO, told ""Fox & Friends"" that Facebook rejected an advertisement for a T-shirt that says, ""Florida Strong."" Facebook's parent company, Meta, claimed the ad was banned because it ""mentions politicians or is about sensitive social issues."" Meritt said the T-shirt design was not meant to be political.

""I think we were representing what every American wants to do out there. We want to support Florida. We want to show a commitment to rebuild in this incredible devastation that Ian's left behind,"" he told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade.



""We've done this before with other natural disasters, to come to aid physically and to bring cash and resources. We're actually boots on the ground as of yesterday, working with the community cooperative. Handing out generators. Handing out fuel. And everyone loved these shirts. They asked, 'why can't I find them? Why can't I see them?'""

Merritt said Nine Line Apparel has had a ""longstanding"" issue with Facebook's algorithm, which flags certain patriotic products and shuts down advertising for those products.



""They have you reach out to them and say, 'hey, would you please allow this advertisement to go forward? It doesn't actually make mention of any political individual [or] initiative,"" Merritt said. ""But most of the time it falls on deaf ears.""

Fox News reached out to Meta for comment. The company said, ""in this case, the advertiser marked the ad political in nature when submitting it for approval. Running such ads require prior authorization and because the advertiser had not gone through that process, the ad was rejected.""

""Given that the ad is in fact not a political ad, all the advertiser needs to do is submit the ad again without marking it political,"" a Meta spokesperson said.

But Merritt said that Meta had its facts wrong and that his company never marked this ad as political. He said that as a small business owner who has spent millions of dollars on advertising, he needs more clarity from Facebook on what its policies permit.

""It seems that there's a trend that anything that is deemed conservative gets flagged, gets hindered, and gets stopped. And I, to date, have not been able to reach out to an individual until last night, when I got a phone call late in the evening asking how could Meta come and help our company,"" Merritt said.

""We've been attempting to get ahold of a human being at Meta for the last year ever since we were flagged and banned from the platform because of advertisements that they deemed inappropriate five, six years ago that got flagged,"" he added.

""There is an algorithm out there that is targeting organizations like ours, in my opinion, and there's no individual that we can reach out to. And it's horrible.""

"Facebook removes pro-Israel page with over 75 million followers after 'cyber terrorism' campaign by Islamic radicals, page founder says","The founder of a pro-Israel Facebook page that had over 75 million followers says Facebook shut down the page after ""radical Islamic"" groups reportedly waged a ""cyber terrorism"" campaign targeting the page with hate speech.

Mike Evans, the founder of the ""Jerusalem Prayer Team"" page, told CBN News his Facebook page was the target of a harassment campaign that was orchestrated by radical Islamic organizations who posted fake comments and then reported those comments as spam to Facebook.

""There was an organized attempt by radical Islamic organizations to achieve this objective. They posted over a million comments on our site, and then had the people contact Facebook saying that they never posted to the site,"" Evans said. ""That was a complete scam and fraud. It was a very clever, deceptive plan by Islamic radicals.""

Evans, who is currently in Israel leading people around the world in prayer for the country amid renewed violence with Hamas and Palestinian terrorist groups, said his page was flooded with anti-Semitic comments — including photos of and quotes from Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. He also said the same groups that posted the comments directed people to report them to Facebook, flagging them as spam that violated the platform's terms of service.

Also, some users claimed Facebook made them follow the page without their consent.

On Friday, Facebook informed the Jerusalem Prayer Team that the page was suspended. Evans received a message from Facebook indicating the case was ""complete"" and that ""no further action"" will be taken.

""These Pages were deleted by our system due to being not Policy Compliant. Sadly, we can't review appeals at this time due to a shortage in reviewers caused by the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. Since you are unable to access the Page, this means that the appealing is no longer an option. There's no further action that we can take for these Pages.

""Facebook got caught with its pants down. Facebook has been accused of being biased towards conservative media sources. This is a prime example of bias on steroids. It's, in my opinion, cyber terrorism based upon racism,"" Evans told CBN News.

Far-left actor Mark Ruffalo apologizes for accusing Israel of 'genocide',"Far-left actor Mark Ruffalo, best known for playing ""The Hulk"" in Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe, apologized on Tuesday for making social media posts that accused Israel of committing ""genocide"" amid the conflict between the world's lone Jewish state and the terrorist group Hamas.

""I have reflected & wanted to apologize for posts during the recent Israel/Hamas fighting that suggested Israel is committing 'genocide,'"" Ruffalo tweeted. ""It's not accurate, it's inflammatory, disrespectful & is being used to justify antisemitism here & abroad. Now is the time to avoid hyperbole.""

Ruffalo's apology follows a recent increase in hate crimes committed against Jews in the United States and abroad in the weeks of renewed conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. In several recent social media posts, Ruffalo took the Palestinians' side, comparing Israeli treatment of the Palestinians to apartheid in South Africa.

""1500 Palestinians face expulsion in #Jerusalem,"" Ruffalo wrote on May 11, sharing a petition that called for international sanctions against the Israeli government. ""200 protesters have been injured. 9 children have been killed. Sanctions on South Africa helped free its black people – it's time for sanctions on Israel to free Palestinians. Join the call.""

After 11 days of violence, with Hamas terrorists targeting Israeli civilians with rocket attacks and the Israeli Defense Forces responding with airstrikes in Gaza, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire last Friday. Palestinian officials reported that 248 people were killed in Gaza, including women and children. On the Israeli side, 13 people were killed — a seemingly disproportionate number of casualties that can be attributed to Israel's Iron Dome defense system protecting Israelis while Hamas fighters position tunnels, rocket launchers, and command and control infrastructure in close proximity to Palestinian civilians.

It is unclear when Ruffalo shared a social media post accusing Israel of ""genocide"", but after his apology a vocal segment of his 7.5 million followers on social media accused him of moderating his support for the Palestinians. Some suggested that Disney, which owns Marvel Studios, forced him to make an apology.

While Disney's involvement is pure speculation, it would not be the first time the House of Mouse cracked down on one of its stars for controversial social media posts. In February, Disney fired ""The Mandalorian"" actress Gina Carano after a social media campaign demanded she lose her job for making a controversial Instagram post that compared censorship of conservative points of view and cancel culture to the Holocaust.

Ruffalo posting that Israel is committing ""genocide"" is at least as controversial as Carano's Holocaust post.

Fareed Zakaria shuts down argument that people only care about Ukraine because they're white and European,"Fareed Zakaria argued eloquently on CNN against those saying that the only reason the world cares about the invasion of Ukraine is that Ukrainians are white and European.

Zakaria appeared on Don Lemon's show Friday where he addressed why the Ukrainian war was unique in its importance to the global order.

""There are people who say why are we, why this conflict,"" asked Lemon, ""there are conflicts, there are skirmishes all over the world. Why is this one so different? Why are we involved with it, why should we upend our lives, the price of our gas, and so on and so forth, you understand what I'm saying.""

""I totally understand, and here's the simplest way to understand it,"" Zakaria replied.

""A skirmish that takes place between two small countries in Africa, the Middle East, in Latin America, they don't threaten to upend the international system. When you have a nuclear power, the largest nuclear power in the world, Russia has more nuclear weapons than the United States, a great power with a veto in the security council, when it threatens its neighbor what you are reverting to, is a pattern of great power politics that is more reminiscent of the age of Hitler and Mussolini, more reminiscent of 19th century Europe, where the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must,"" he explained.

""That is a very different world than what we've lived in for the last 70 years, and certainly, ever since the end of the Cold War, so its not, to put it directly to people who think about this and they say, why are Ukrainians, why do we pay so much attention, is it just because they are white?"" Zakaria continued.

""No, it is not because Ukrainians are white or European, it's because their aggressor, their invader, is a nuclear armed superpower, that's the danger. That if Russia can get away with this, it can get away with invading Poland. It can get away with invading the Baltic states. China can get away with invading Taiwan,"" he added.

""You essentially tear up the rule book on international relations,"" Zakaria concluded.

Many global analysts believe the timeline for the Russian invasion has been significantly stalled by the unexpected efforts of the Ukrainian military and civilians fighting back.

"Fauci and other top scientists had another secret COVID-19 origins call, records reveal","A group of the world's top virologists held secretive private discussions in February 2020 on ""all theories"" of the origins of COVID-19 days after they began drafting an influential article that would attempt to debunk the lab-leak theory, newly reported emails reveal.



The group was led by Wellcome Trust Director Jeremy Farrar and University of Sydney virologist Edward Holmes. Members of these discussions included then-National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins and the U.S. government's top pandemic spokesman, Dr. Anthony Fauci.

A Freedom of Information Act request by U.S. Right to Know reveals that their discussions on the pandemic's origins continued on Feb. 7, 2020, three days after an article purporting to show the virus ""is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus"" was drafted and a week after a previously reported conference call on Feb. 1.



“Eddie Holmes and a small group have been looking extensively at the origins and evolution of n-CoV including all theories,” Farrar wrote to National Academy of Medicine President Victor Dzau on Feb. 8, 2020, using an abbreviation for ""novel coronavirus"" in reference to the emerging SARS-Cov-2 virus.

“This is the latest summary, written as part of a series of [teleconference] discussions we set up and included [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci] and [National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins] as well as a small group from USA, UK, Europe and Australia,” Farrar wrote.

The records obtained by U.S. Right to Know included six pages of notes from the Feb. 7 discussion, but the material is fully redacted.

The newly unearthed records reveal that scientists continued to consider the lab-leak origins theory of COVID-19 in private while working to dismiss the theory in public. But exactly what they discussed remains unknown, hidden behind redacted records and repeated refusals to comment.



There are two competing theories of the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. The first is that the virus has natural origins — that it was carried by an animal host and evolved to be contagious among human beings. This is the view widely accepted by most scientists.

The second theory is that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a Chinese lab that studies coronaviruses, may have genetically manipulated one of their virus samples, creating SARS-CoV-2, and somehow that engineered virus leaked from the lab. This theory was maligned as a crackpot conspiracy theory by most public health officials.

Neither hypothesis of the pandemic's origins has been definitively proven or ruled out. An intelligence review by President Joe Biden's administration determined the theories were ""equally plausible"" and that the lab-leak hypothesis was ""a credible line of inquiry.""



In previously reported email chains, Farrar, Fauci, and other public health officials were shown to have discussed the possibility that the Wuhan coronavirus was ""engineered."" But after holding private conference calls on the matter, many of those involved waged a vigorous public campaign to discredit the lab-leak theory, apparently with no outstanding scientific reasons for doing so.

That public campaign began with a Feb. 19, 2020, statement signed by Farrar and other top health and medical professionals that strongly condemned ""conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin"". It continued with various public statements from Fauci and others that the lab-leak theory was a ""conspiracy,"" which led social media companies to censor any discussion of the possible lab origins of COVID-19.

Perhaps the most significant blow to the credibility of the lab-leak theory came on March 17, 2020, with the publication of a letter titled, ""The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2."" This letter sought to definitively squash the idea that COVID-19 came from a laboratory setting. ""We do not believe any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,"" the authors wrote, words that were seized by the national media and used to attack President Donald Trump because he had made statements supportive of the lab-leak theory.

Yet just one month before the ""proximal origins"" letter was published, three of its five authors had privately concluded that aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were ""inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory"" and that ""some of the features (potentially) look engineered."" Their opinion was revealed in a Feb. 1 email to Fauci, first published by BuzzFeed News.

A subsequent Feb. 4 email from Farrar to Fauci and Collins revealed he was split ""50-50"" between the natural origins and lab-leak theories and that Holmes was ""60-40"" in favor of the lab origin.



Emails transcribed by Republican staff on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform show that on the same day Farrar sent a draft of the ""proximal origins"" paper with Fauci.

Farrar, Fauci, and the rest have stated that while they were initially open to all theories of the virus' origins, their change of opinion and embrace of the natural origins theory reflected the weight of scientific evidence.



However, there is a potential conflict of interest in how Fauci and Collins shaped the narrative that the lab-leak theory of COVID-19's origins was a ""conspiracy theory."" The nonprofit group EcoHealth Alliance had received federal grants from Fauci's agency to study coronaviruses and had sub-awarded nearly $600,000 to the Wuhan lab in the years preceding the pandemic.

Whether the Wuhan lab used that grant money to conduct risky gain-of-function research to create new artificially enhanced viruses is a hotly contested claim, with Fauci and others denying it and Republican lawmakers like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) accusing them of lying.



The truth is likely redacted.

Daughter of Dr. Fauci works as a software engineer at Twitter,"The daughter of the coronavirus task force director Dr. Anthony Fauci works for the social media platform Twitter and some are calling it a conflict of interest.

Alison Christine Fauci, 28, has worked for the microblogging platform as a software engineer since 2014 after she graduated from Stanford University, majoring in computer science.

The connection between the controversial epidemiologist and Twitter had been reported at Heavy.com since at least March 2020 but it resurfaced as many questioned censorship of lockdown-skeptical voices on the platform.

She said on her LinkedIn profile that she focused on developing ""ad formats for the Twitter for Android app."" That profile has since been deleted or made private.

Twitter has been among the Big Tech companies who have shut down the spread of those arguing against the efficacy of masks and lockdowns to fight the spread of the coronavirus. In one instance from August 2020, the service suspended the Trump campaign account over a video containing information the company deemed misleading about the pandemic.

Some saw the employment of Fauci's daughter at Twitter circumspect given how the service has enforced the guidance handed down from Fauci and other health officials by shutting down dissent.

""Imagine that. No wonder they are screening / blocking all 'Covid' posts. Only Power hungry Dictators on the left think this way,"" said one critic on Twitter.

""Fraud Fauci's daughter works for Twit. Twit acts like jack booted thugs to anyone who questions corrupt Dr or his vac-cine,"" said another user.

Dr. Fauci had previously mentioned his daughter in connection to his work fighting the coronavirus pandemic. In December 2020 during an interview at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, he said that his family had been personally affected by the pandemic.

""My youngest daughter's boyfriend's brother is a 32-year-old young man, athletic, healthy, who got COVID-19 and had one of the unusual complications of cardiomyopathy with an arrhythmia and died,"" said Fauci.

""So there you have a 32-year-old young man, otherwise healthy actually, quite athletic and strong, who died,"" he added.

Here's the latest from Fauci on the pandemic:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fareed-zacharia-ukraine-racist-white,2021-03-05
"Senator Roger Marshall releases Dr Anthony Fauci's financial disclosures, plans FAUCI Act","The Republican senator who was called a ""moron"" by Dr. Anthony Fauci has published unredacted financial disclosures of the nation's top doctor. The GOP senator is also planning to introduce a bill named after Fauci following a tense exchange on Capitol Hill.

Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) grilled Fauci on Tuesday during a Senate committee hearing.

""You have an annual salary in 2020 that was $434,000,"" Marshall said of Fauci. ""You oversee over $5 billion in federal research grants. As the highest-paid employee in the entire federal government, yes or no: Would you be willing to submit to Congress and the public a financial disclosure that includes your past and current investments?”

Fauci responded, ""My financial disclosure is public knowledge and has been so for the last 37 years or so.""

The two men then had a testy exchange debating whether or not Fauci's financial disclosures are public knowledge. The volatile back-and-forth ended with Fauci being caught on a hot mic demeaning Marshall, ""What a moron! Jesus Christ.""

On Friday, Marshall obtained Fauci's previously unpublished financial disclosures from the National Institutes of Health.

""While Fauci's financial disclosure documents can be requested from the National Institute of Health, they aren't listed in the same searchable database as many other federal officials,"" Fox News noted.

The records show that Fauci — who is the top bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health — and his wife have a combined net worth of $10.4 million.

Fauci will reportedly make approximately $2.5 million as President Joe Biden's chief medical advisor between 2020 and 2024 if he stays on through Biden's current term.

Fauci, 80, has been in charge of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, and he is currently making $434,312 a year as head of the NIAID.

""Fauci's records show that he and his wife were paid $13,298 to attend four galas and ceremonies - three of them virtual,"" the Daily Mail reported. ""The disclosures show Fauci was paid $5,000 to attend a 'RFK Ripple of Hope' virtual awards ceremony in December 2020; $1,600 to attend 'An Evening of Hope' virtual event in April 2020; and $1,500 to attend a 'Prepared for Life' virtual gala in October 2020. He was also reimbursed $5,198 for costs associated with his being awarded federal employee of the year and being given the Service to America medal, in October 2020.""

A report that surfaced last month stated that Fauci is set to make a $350,000 annual pension, the largest retirement package in U.S. government history.

Marshall released a statement that reads, ""Since the disclosures were not public, on Wednesday, Senator Marshall sent a letter to Dr. Fauci formally requesting his un-redacted financial disclosures by 5:00 p.m. Friday, January 14th. In response, Dr. Fauci produced these previously unpublished documents.""

Marshall accused Fauci of lying about his financial disclosures being available to the public, and announced that he plans on introducing legislation named after the White House's chief medical adviser.

Dr. Fauci lied to the American people. He is more concerned with being a media star and posing for the cover of magazines than he is being honest with the American people and holding China accountable for the COVID pandemic that has taken the lives of almost 850 thousand Americans. Just like he has misled the American people about sending taxpayers dollars to Wuhan, China to fund gain-of-function research, about masks, testing, and more, Dr. Fauci was completely dishonest about his financial disclosures being open to the public – it’s no wonder he is the least trusted bureaucrat in America. At the end of the day, Dr. Fauci must be held accountable to all Americans who have been suing and requesting for this information but don’t have the power of a Senate office to ask for it. For these reasons, I will be introducing the FAUCI Act so financial disclosures like these are made public and are easily accessible online to every American.

Marshall's bill is named the ""Financial Accountability for Uniquely Compensated Individuals Act."" The bill claims that records of government officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci are not easily accessible to the public.

The FAUCI Act would require administration officials to provide public access to their financial disclosures on the official Office of Government Ethics website. The bill would also list all confidential filers within the government whose financial disclosures are not public.

Others have previously attempted to obtain Fauci's financial information.

The Center for Public Integrity submitted a request for Fauci's financial disclosures with the NIH in 2020.

""I first asked the NIH for Fauci’s disclosure on May 18, 2020 and didn’t receive it until Aug. 5,"" wrote Center for Public Integrity reporter Liz Essley Whyte. ""The NIH also chose to give the disclosure to me under the Freedom of Information Act, which they didn’t need to do and caused the document to be partially redacted. (Though most of the information about Fauci’s income, gifts and investments in 2019 is still there for all to see.) They did not respond to my questions, then or now, about why they did that.""

In October, Judicial Watch launched a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit on behalf of OpenTheBooks.com against the Department of Health and Human Services for the ""employment contracts; financial, conflict of interest, and confidentiality disclosure documents; and job description of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., as well as royalties paid to NIH employees by outside entities.""

Forbes reported that the ""NIH is holding 1,200 pages of Fauci disclosure information,"" and that the ""agency will only produce 300 pages per month and not even begin to produce documents until February 1st.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-and-other-top-scientists-had-another-secret-covid-19-origins-call-records-reveal,2022-01-15
"Hawley calls on Fauci to resign, demands covid origins investigation","Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) is calling for Dr. Anthony Fauci to resign from his post following the controversy ignited by the release of emails from the nation's top epidemiologist regarding the coronavirus pandemic. Hawley is also demanding an investigation into the origins of COVID-19.

""Anthony Fauci's recently released emails and investigative reporting about #COVID19 origins are shocking,"" Hawley stated on Friday, and called for him to step down as the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""The time has come for Fauci to resign and for a full congressional investigation into the origins of #COVID19 - and into any and all efforts to prevent a full accounting.""

""The public deserves to know if persons within the US govt tried to stop a full investigation into #COVID origins, as recently reported,"" the Republican Senator of Missouri said. ""And Congress must also find out to what extent Fauci's NIAID was involved in financing research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.""

More than 3,200 pages of Fauci's emails were made public via a Freedom of Information Act request from BuzzFeed News and the Washington Post. There are numerous concerns regarding Fauci's emails, including his opposition to wearing face masks at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are also questions whether Fauci colluded with other top health officials to bury the theory that coronavirus was created in a lab and escaped.



Hawley is demanding a full congressional investigation into the origins of coronavirus. Fauci had been saying that the coronavirus naturally evolved, and dismissed the lab leak theory. But then in late May, Fauci reversed course and called for an investigation into COVID-19's origins and acknowledged the coronavirus pandemic was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Fauci was asked if he still believed that coronavirus developed naturally, to which he responded, ""No, I'm not convinced about that. I think that we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we find out to the best of our ability exactly what happened.""

Others have called for an investigation into the origins of coronavirus, including 18 high-profile scientists who published a letter calling for an inquiry to ""determine the origin of the pandemic,"" noting that ""theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable.""

""Knowing how COVID-19 emerged is critical for informing global strategies to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks,"" the scientists proclaimed.

There are also 209 House Republicans demanding a congressional investigation into the origin of coronavirus, and to see if the Chinese Communist Party attempted to cover it up. Minority Whip Steve Scalise (La.), the top Republican on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) demanding a probe.

""We request that you instruct the appropriate Democrat committee chairs to immediately join Republican calls to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its role in causing the global COVID-19 pandemic,"" the letter reads. ""There is mounting evidence the pandemic started in a Chinese lab, and the CCP covered it up. If that is the case, the CCP is responsible for the deaths of almost 600,000 Americans and millions more worldwide.""

Vanity Fair published a bombshell report this week following months of investigating, which found ""conflicts of interest"" including large U.S. government grants ""supporting controversial virology research, known as 'gain-of-function.'"" Vanity Fair investigative reporter Katherine Eban claimed the conflicts of interest ""hampered"" the investigation into the coronavirus origins by the United States government.



As far as Fauci being fired, the White House said he's going nowhere and called him ""a renowned public servant.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki declared there was no circumstance under which President Joe Biden would fire Fauci, who is the president's chief medical adviser.

""He's overseen the management of multiple global health crises and attacks launched on him are certainly something we wouldn't stand by,"" Psaki said on Friday. ""I understand there's interest in the emails. He's answered a lot of questions on the emails, I don't think I'm gonna have much more to add on them from here.""



""The President and the administration feel that Dr. Fauci has played an incredible role in getting the pandemic under control, being a voice to the public throughout the course of this pandemic,"" Psaki said during Thursday's White House press briefing. ""And, again, I would reiterate a lot of these emails are from 17 months ago or more, certainly predating this administration, but some time ago in — as we look to history.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-daughter-twitter-coronavirus-conflict,2021-06-05
Dr. Fauci suggests people wear goggles or eye shields 'if you really want to be complete' against COVID-19,"Just as much of the country is getting used to wearing face masks in public in an attempt to slow the transmission of COVID-19, Dr. Anthony Fauci suggested an even higher level of protection: goggles.

During in interview on ABC News with Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton, Fauci said that while it's not a widely-recommended practice, the safest thing for people to do is also to cover their eyes.

""If you really want perfect protection of your mucosal surfaces…you have mucosa in the mouth, mucosa in the nose, but you also have mucosa in the eye,"" Fauci said. ""And that's one of the things, theoretically, you should protect all the mucosal surfaces. So if you have goggles or an eye shield, you should use it.

""It's not universally recommended, but if you really want to be complete, you should probably use it if you can,"" Fauci said.

The recommendation to wear eye protection is the latest step in a dramatic evolution by Fauci on this issue, which started months ago when he assured the American public that there was no reason to walk around wearing a face mask.

Now, states led by both Republicans and Democrats have mandated mask use in public, as have numerous localities and businesses. Even President Donald Trump has worn a mask publicly, calling it ""patriotic"" to do so.

Still, the science on whether masks, particularly cloth masks, slow or stop the spread of COVID-19 is conflicting, at best, and as a result mask usage is still a divisive issue. Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp went so far as to ban cities and counties from mandating masks, and sued the mayor of Atlanta when she refused to back off the city's mask mandate.

Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday. He has been opposed to wearing masks, but has worn them occasionally recently. He said he suspected it was actually the use of the mask, rather than all the times he wasn't wearing one, that caused him to get infected.

""I can't help but wonder if by keeping a mask on and keeping it in place, I might have put some germs — some virus — onto the mask and breathed it in,"" Gohmert told KETK-TV.

A Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released Monday found that 79% of people would support a national mask mandate, and 70% of people support local enforcement of mask mandates with fines.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-financial-disclosures-roger-marshall,2020-07-29
'Bad conduct': Former FBI agent pleads guilty to destroying evidence relevant to trial,"On August 17, Former FBI Special Agent Robert Cessario signed a plea agreement, admitting to having paid a business to permanently erase data from his hard drive so that forensic examiners could not analyze its contents. The data he had wiped was considered relevant to former state Sen. Jon Woods' corruption trial (R-Ark.). Woods was convicted of mail and wire fraud in 2018, having received kickbacks for directing funds to Ecclesia College in Springdale.

Cessario admitted in the plea deal that he had erased the contents of the hard drive knowing that the court had ordered the computer be submitted to an FBI forensics examiner in Little Rock. His stated intention was to make ""the contents of the computer's hard unavailable for forensic examination.""

The former FBI special agent also stated that he knew ""the contents of the hard drive were relevant to an official proceeding, that is, Cause No. 5:17-CR-50010, United States v. Woods et al.""



KATV reported that Cessario has been charged with ""corrupt destruction of record in an official proceeding."" He could face up to 20 years in prison.

Background

Former state Rep. Micah Neal secretly recorded conversations with Woods in hopes of aiding investigators and lightening his own sentence. (He pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud on Jan 4, 2017.) Using an audio recorder disguised as a pen, he taped conversations, which were referenced in the Woods trial.

Cessario, who later made copies of the audio recordings, reportedly provided the court only 39 of Neal's 119 audio files ahead of the trial. When asked to provide the remainder, as there were noticeable gaps in the information provided, he took the files, then stored on his laptop computer, to a computer shop on December 4, 2016. There he paid to have the hard drive wiped. He then wiped the drive a second time himself.

Court documents indicate that Cessario's texts revealed his bias ahead of the trial. In one text, he told Shane Wilkinson, former Arkansas Rep. Micah Neal's counsel, that the trial would be ""hilarious."" In another, he claimed that Woods was a ""true narcissist.""



Extra to the perception of bias and the destruction of evidence, there was also a potential conflict of interest related to the trial involving the FBI special agent.

Cessario, who attended and conducted part of an interview of Woods on November 11, 2015, not only knew Woods' attorney W.H. Taylor, Esq., but had been represented by Taylor. A year prior, Taylor acted on Cessario's behalf in divorce proceedings.

Taylor is said to have instructed his new client, Woods, to meet with Cessario on numerous occasions without a legal representative present.

Concerning this conflict, District Judge Timothy Brooks suggested in 2018: ""Can a zealous and effective defense be expected of the shepherd when the wolf appears in sheep's clothing? The course of events certainly raises the appearance of impropriety.""

Fallout

The revelation of Cessario's destruction of evidence comes at a time when Americans are becoming increasingly distrustful of the FBI.

A week after the FBI raid on former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence, Rasmussen released a poll indicating that 53% of Americans believe the FBI is ""Biden's Gestapo.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-resign-emails-hawley-covid-origins,2022-08-19
FBI Director Wray orders internal investigation of alleged misconduct in Mike Flynn probe,"Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray announced an internal investigation into the alleged misconduct by FBI agents in the probe of former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn.

Wray made the announcement in a statement on Friday after revelations about the FBI questioning of Flynn that led him to plead guilty for lying.

""FBI Director Christopher Wray today ordered the Bureau's Inspection Division to conduct an after-action review of the Michael Flynn investigation,"" said the Bureau in the statement according to Fox News.

The statement said that the purpose of the probe was to see if any FBI employees acted improperly, and also to determine whether the bureau's policies need to be amended and updated.

""Although the FBI does not have the prosecutorial authority to bring a criminal case, the Inspection Division can and will evaluate whether any current onboard employees engaged in actions that might warrant disciplinary measures,"" the FBI added.

The investigation is in response to accusations that the investigation into Flynn was a politically motivated partisan hunt to ultimately seek prosecution against President Donald Trump.

Democrats have countered that Republicans have leaked partial documentation in order to mislead the public on efforts from the FBI that they say were done ""by the book.""

In response to the allegations former Obama national security advisor Susan Rice, infamous for pushing the narrative that the Benghazi terror attack was sparked by a YouTube video, has called for the release of unredacted transcripts of calls between Flynn and a Russian ambassador.

"FDA says no need to wipe down groceries. CDC, epidemiology experts say otherwise.","The Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday that consumers don't have to worry about contracting the coronavirus from grocery packaging.

However, the Centers for Disease Control and other experts say the opposite.

What is the FDA saying?

In a release on its website, the FDA wrote, ""We want to reassure consumers that there is currently no evidence of human or animal food or food packaging being associated with transmission of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.""

The organization does not cite the evidence — or, in this case, lack of evidence — to support its claim.

It goes on to note that while the COVID-19 virus is spread from person-to-person contact, it cannot be spread through ""contaminated food.""

""This particular coronavirus causes respiratory illness and is spread from person-to-person, unlike foodborne gastrointestinal or GI viruses, such as norovirus and hepatitis A that often make people ill through contaminated food,"" the release added.

The organization does not address, however, whether the virus is transmissible from contaminated surfaces, such as plastic milk cartons or cardboard pasta boxes.

It does note, though, that shoppers should wash their hands when they return home from the grocery store, and then once more after putting away the groceries.

""Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds when you return home and again after you put away your groceries,"" the release continued.

It also offers up the idea of wiping groceries down anyway — just as a precaution.

""If you wish, you can wipe down product packaging and allow it to air dry, as an extra precaution,"" it concluded.

What are others saying?

CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, for one, says that while it's not necessarily likely that consumers can contract COVID-19 from grocery parcels, it's not unreasonable to take the proper protective precautions.

""It's very unlikely you're going to get it from packages, but we do know that the virus can live on surfaces, for example, steel and plastic for up to three days. ... We know it can live up on cardboard for 24 hours.""

He later added, ""Respiratory droplets that are in the air, you can touch surfaces and then you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. I think it's a very low likelihood ... but being cautious is a good idea.""

The CDC also notes, ""[T]ransmission of novel coronavirus to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented.""

""Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials,"" the organization added.

Researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham say that the virus is ""more stable"" on surfaces like plastic — a common food container material — and steel when compared to more porous surfaces like paper or cardboard.

""Viable virus was detected for up to three days on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces,"" one researcher said. ""While on copper, no viable virus was measured after four hours or on cardboard after 24 hours.""

Dr. Jodie Dionne-Odom, who is assistant professor in UAB's Division of Infectious Diseases, adds, ""Packages will be coming from a number of hands, and you might not know the symptom status of everyone who touched it along the way. Wash your hands after opening and handling the package. That will kill the germs.""

Harvard University Medical School also advises to take the safer road.

""Recent studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus may remain on surfaces or objects for up to 72 hours,"" researchers write. ""This means virus on the surface of groceries will become inactivated over time after groceries are put away. If you need to use the products before 72 hours, consider washing the outside surfaces or wiping them with disinfectant. The contents of sealed containers won't be contaminated.""

""After unpacking your groceries, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds,"" researchers advise. ""Wipe surfaces on which you placed groceries while unpacking them with household disinfectants.""

The conclusion?

Wipe down your groceries as well as your counters after grocery shopping — and then wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.

It's better to be safe than sorry.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbi-agent-pleads-guilty-to-destroying-evidence,2020-04-17
'Take these masks off of my child!': Fed-up mom of kindergarten student goes off on school board for continuing mask mandate through next year,"A fed-up Georgia mother read the riot act to the Gwinnett County Board of Education last week and demanded that the members end the COVID-19 mask mandate for students that has been extended through next year, Fox News reported.

Video of Courtney Ann Taylor's fiery comments to the board at its April 15 meeting have gone viral.

""Every month I come here, and I hear the same thing: 'social emotional health.' If you truly mean that, you would end the mask requirement tonight,"" Taylor said.

What else did she say?

Taylor added that it's been over a year since life shut down over the pandemic, every adult in Georgia is eligible to receive vaccines — and most importantly, children aren't adversely affected by the coronavirus.

""Every one of us knows that young children are not affected by this virus. They're not!"" she told the board, adding that it's ""a blessing.""

""But as the adults, what have we done with that blessing?"" Taylor continued. ""We've shoved it to the side and we've said, 'We don't care. You're still gonna wear a mask on your face every day … You still can't play together on the playground like normal children … We don't care. We're still going to force you to carry a burden that was never yours to carry.' Shame on us!""

She tearfully added that her 6-year-old daughter — a kindergartner — is weary of the mask requirement, and it has to end.

""It's April 15, 2021, and it's time!"" Taylor said. ""Take these masks off of my child!""

She added that citizens voted for the school board members — and not for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""We chose you to make decisions that would be in our children's best interest,"" Taylor told the board. ""Enforcing 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9-year-old little children to cover their noses and their mouths — where they breathe — for seven hours a day, every day for the last nine months for a virus that you know doesn't affect them! That is not in their best interest!""

Before stepping away from the microphone, she added that ""this has to stop. Defend our children ... Take these off of our children.""

'No end in sight'

Taylor also spoke to Fox News after her address and said that there seems to be ""no end in sight"" to the mask mandate, and that it's ""heartbreaking.""

She added that ""kindergarten is supposed to be fun,"" and that it's where students learn social norms, cues, and skills such as resolving conflict.

""I don't see how any of the children can really do that and have a real childhood right now,"" she said.

Taylor added to Fox News that she's received a lot of support since her comments went viral and that ""it's not OK to put our children through something that we disagree with like this.""

The cable network added that she's started a change.org petition demanding that Gwinnett County Public Schools make masks optional for children.

""It is the parent's responsibility to make health decisions for their children,"" the petition reads, according to Fox News. ""The parents decide which pediatrician they see and which vaccines they receive, so they also decide if their child is going to cover their nose and mouth. Stop trying to parent our children for us.""

As of Thursday evening, the petition has reached nearly 900 signatures out of its goal of 1,000, the cable network said.

Fox News said the Gwinnett County school board didn't immediately respond to its request for comment.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbi-probing-fbi-on-mike-flynn,2021-04-23
Federal agents reportedly erecting 'non-scalable' fence around White House ahead of possible Election Day unrest,"Federal agents are set to erect a ""non-scalable"" fence around the White House, according to reports from CNN and NBC News, in what appears to be anticipation of possible Election Day unrest.

What are the details?

According to NBC News White House correspondent Geoff Bennett, agents will reportedly begin erecting the barrier outside of the White House ahead of Tuesday's nationwide election.

Bennett shared news of the report on Twitter on Sunday, writing, ""The White House on lockdown: A federal law enforcement source tells NBC that beginning tomorrow, crews will build a 'non-scalable' fence to secure the WH complex, Ellipse, and Lafayette Square.""

Bennett added, ""250 National Guardsmen have been put on standby, reporting to Metro Police officials.""

CNN reported Monday that ""[t]he fence, the same type that was put up during protests this summer, will encompass the Ellipse and Lafayette Square. It will go down 15th Street to Constitution Avenue and then over to 17th Street. The fence will then run up to H Street and across by Lafayette, and then come down 15th Street.""

'Increased militia activity'

Business Insider reported Monday that stores across major U.S. cities have also begun the process of boarding up windows and fortifying entrances and exits in apparent anticipation of any forthcoming Election Day violence.

As highlighted by The Hill, an October YouGov poll reported that a majority of voters reportedly expected to see a ""rise in violence following the elections,"" including more than half of both Republicans and Democrats.

The outlet added, ""A study released in mid-October also warned that five states — Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Oregon — were at risk to experience increased militia activity ahead of the elections and afterward.""

The report, released by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project along with MilitiaWatch, found that states including California, New Mexico, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia were at a ""moderate risk"" to see increased active militias for the same time period.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fda-says-no-need-to-wipe-down-groceries-experts-disagree,2020-11-02
"Federal court strikes down Florida laws banning conversion therapy for children struggling with sexual orientation, gender identity","The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday struck down laws in South Florida that ban therapists from offering conversion therapy to children struggling with sexual orientation or gender identity, Reuters reported.

What are the details?

In a 2-1 decision, the court said the laws in Boca Raton and Palm Beach County were unconstitutional, content-based restrictions on speech that violated the First Amendment, the outlet said.

The two therapists who challenged the laws banning conversion therapy said their patients typically had ""sincerely held religious beliefs conflicting with homosexuality"" and sought counseling to conform their identities and behaviors with those beliefs, Reuters said.

Therapists Robert W. Otto and Julie H. Hamilton said a prohibition on therapy aimed at ""reducing a minor's sexual or romantic attraction (at least to others of the same gender or sex), or changing a minor's gender identity or expression"" violates their ""constitutional right to speak freely with clients,"" LifeSite News said.

President Donald Trump appointed the two judges who voted for striking down the laws, Reuters reported — and the no-vote came from a judge appointed by former President Barack Obama.

""We understand and appreciate that the therapy is highly controversial,"" Circuit Judge Brit C. Grant wrote, according to LifeSite News. ""But the First Amendment has no carveout for controversial speech. We hold that the challenged ordinances violate the First Amendment because they are content-based regulations of speech that cannot survive strict scrutiny.""



The other Trump-appointed judge on the case was Barbara Lagoa, who was a leading candidate to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg after her death in September. Ultimately Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed last month to the nation's high court by a Republican-controlled U.S. Senate.

Anything else?

In February, Courthouse News Service reported about the case, noting that the county fine against conversion therapy on a minor is $250 — and then $500 for each additional violation.

Last year, a lower court denied the therapists' request to halt the bans, as the presiding judge wrote that the ""plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing that the ordinances violate the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment,"" CNS noted.

But the therapists' attorney Mathew Staver argued before the appeals court in February that the laws ""are unconstitutional content-based regulations that don't survive strict scrutiny.""

Staver — who's with Liberty Counsel — said Friday the appeals court decision ""is a huge victory for counselors and their clients to choose the counsel of their choice free of political censorship from government ideologues. This case is the beginning of the end of similar unconstitutional counseling bans around the country.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fed-up-mom-school-board-mask-mandate,2020-11-20
Federal judge blocks Biden administration's 'unauthorized' federal guidance on abortions in Texas,"U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix ruled on August 23 that the Department of Health and Human Services' guidance pertaining to the enforcement of the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act was ""unauthorized"" in Texas.

Following President Joe Biden's July 8 executive order on reproductive health, HHS issued new ""clarifying guidance"" on the EMTALA. The guidance ""reaffirmed that [the EMTALA] protects providers when offering legally-mandated, life- or health-saving abortion services in emergency situations.""

According to the EMTALA guidance issued by HHS, if a pregnant woman ""presenting at an emergency department is experiencing an emergency medical condition as defined by EMTALA, and that abortion is the stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve that condition, the physician must provide that treatment.""

Refusal by a physician or a hospital to follow HHS' new guidance on the EMTALA could result in fines of $119,942. Additionally, any physician found in violation of the law as clarified in HHS' new guidance could be ""excluded from participation in Medicare and State health care programs,"" as well as exposed to civil suits.

Concerning enforcement, the guidance specifies that any state actions against a physician who performs an abortion ""in order to stabilize an emergency medical condition"" would be pre-empted by the federal EMTALA statute. In Texas, if a doctor performs a prohibited abortion, the doctor could face life in prison or a $100,000 fine.

Judge Hendrix granted a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the EMTALA as interpreted in HHS' July guidance, in Texas as well as against members of both the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists and Christian Medical & Dental Associations.

His decision is in response to a lawsuit filed by Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on July 14.

At the time of filing, Paxton stated: ""This administration has a hard time following the law, and now they are trying to have their appointed bureaucrats mandate that hospitals and emergency medicine physicians perform abortions."" He indicated he was resolved to ""ensure that President Biden will be forced to comply with the Supreme Court's important decision concerning abortion and I will not allow him to undermine and distort existing laws to fit his administration's unlawful agenda.""

The State of Texas' original complaint alleged that the Biden administration, by way of the imposition of this guidance, was attempting ""to use federal law to transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic.""

According to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, the Biden administration expected ""providers to continue offering [abortion] services, and that federal law preempts state abortion bans when needed for emergency care.""



HHS alleged in its July 11 release that stabilizing treatment ""could include medical and/or surgical interventions, including abortion."" It further stated, ""If a state law prohibits abortion and does not include an exception for the health or life of the pregnant person ... that state law is preempted.""

Hendrix asserted that HHS ""guidance goes well beyond EMTALA's text, which protects both mothers and unborn children, is silent as to abortion, and preempts state law only when the two directly conflict. Since the statute is silent on the question, the Guidance cannot answer how doctors should weigh risks to both a mother and her unborn child. Nor can it, in doing so, create a conflict with state law where one does not exist.""



Concerning the nonexistence of such a conflict, Paxton's complaint noted that, as it currently stands, Texas' Human Life Protection Act does not apply ""if the woman on whom the abortion is performed 'has a life-threatening physical condition' arising from a pregnancy that places her 'at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed.'""

Hendrix's ruling was issued ahead of the implementation of Texas' ""trigger law,"" banning most abortions in the state, which goes into effect on August 25.

Paxton called Hendrix's ruling a ""WIN for mothers, babies, & the TX healthcare industry.""

The Biden administration has also sought to intervene in the state of Republican-led Idaho to prevent the enactment of its abortion ""trigger law."" It filed a lawsuit against the state on August 2.

On Monday, U.S. District Senior Judge B. Lynn Winmill said that he would issue a decision on August 24 regarding whether he would temporarily block Idaho's abortion ban while the lawsuit proceeds.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-agents-non-scalable-fence-around-whit,2022-08-24
Federal judge rules law criminalizing possession of guns without serial numbers is unconstitutional,"A federal judge in West Virginia has ruled that a federal law banning possession of a gun with its serial number removed is unconstitutional, relying on the legal standard established by the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Second Amendment ruling in June.

The federal law in question, 18 U.S.C. § 922(k), prohibits ""any person"" from knowingly transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce, ""any firearm which has had the importer's or manufacturer's serial number removed, obliterated, or altered,"" or from possessing such weapons.

In U.S. v. Price, U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin found the federal law was not consistent with the United States' ""historical tradition of firearm regulation,"" which was the standard established by the Supreme Court in its 6-3 New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen decision.

The criminal case concerns Randy Price, a man who was charged with illegal possession of a firearm that had the serial number removed. The weapon was found in his vehicle during a traffic stop in Charleston. The judge dismissed that charge, but kept another charge against Price of illegally possessing the gun after being convicted of previous felonies.



Goodwin said the law ""criminalizes the mere possession of a firearm after a serial number is removed, obliterated, or altered in any way, whether or not the firearm is then placed into commerce."" This conflicts with the plain text of the Second Amendment, he argued.

""Having found that Section 922(k) does implicate conduct that is protected by the Second Amendment, the statute is presumptively unconstitutional unless the Government can show that 'it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.' This analysis is constrained by the Supreme Court's definition of 'historical tradition' as the time of the founding and ratification of the Second Amendment in 1791,"" Goodwin wrote.

""Any modern regulation that does not comport with the historical understanding of the right is to be deemed unconstitutional, regardless of how desirable or important that regulation may be in our modern society,"" he explained.



Defense lawyer Lex Coleman said Goodwin's decision was ""thoughtful, measured and accurate,"" in a statement to Reuters. The U.S. attorney's office in charge of prosecuting the case said it was ""reviewing the ruling and assessing options.""

The Gun Control Act of 1968 requires serial numbers to be assigned to firearms to prevent illegal gun sales and track firearms involved in crimes.

Price argued that the law is unconstitutional under the historical standard test established in Bruen. Serial numbers were not required when the Second Amendment was adopted in 1791 and were not widely used until 1968.

Federal judge strikes down nationwide ban on evictions; Biden DOJ to appeal,"A federal judge on Wednesday struck down the national moratorium on evictions, allowing landlords to resume eviction proceedings against tenants who have stopped paying rent during the coronavirus pandemic.

When Congress passed the CARES Act in March 2020, it created a 120-day ban on evictions that applied to rental properties receiving federal assistance. When that order expired, the Trump administration Department of Health and Human Services issued a second eviction moratorium through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that unlike the CARES Act applied to all rental properties nationwide. President Joe Biden subsequently renewed that order twice, with the current moratorium set to expire on June 30, 2021.

The eviction moratorium was intended to protect some of the 13.5 million American adults — nearly 1 in 5 renters — who reported that they have fallen behind on their rent payments during the pandemic due to economic hardship. But landlords opposed to the policy say they can't continue to house people for free.

Rental property managers Danny Fordham and Robert Gilstrap, along with the Alabama and Georgia Associations of Renters, brought a lawsuit against the CDC challenging the order as unlawful and unconstitutional. They claimed the CDC exceeded its statutory authority, rushed to enact the order without proper procedure, and acted unconstitutionally by essentially depriving landlords of their property without due process.

D.C. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee, sided with their argument in her opinion, ruling that the CDC did not have the legal authority to impose a nationwide eviction moratorium.

""The pandemic has triggered difficult policy decisions that have had enormous real-world consequences. The nationwide eviction moratorium is one such decision,"" she wrote.

""It is the role of the political branches, and not the courts, to assess the merits of policy measures designed to combat the spread of disease, even during a global pandemic,"" the opinion reads.

""The question for the Court is a narrow one: Does the Public Health Service Act grant the CDC the legal authority to impose a nationwide eviction moratorium? It does not.""

Housing advocates and tenants-rights activists immediately called on the Biden administration to appeal the decision, and hours after the ruling the Department of Justice announced it would indeed challenge Friedrich's opinion.

""The CDC's eviction moratorium — which Congress extended last December and the CDC later extended through June 30, 2021 — protects many renters who cannot make their monthly payments due to job loss or health care expenses. Scientific evidence shows that evictions exacerbate the spread of COVID-19, which has already killed more than half a million Americans, and the harm to the public that would result from unchecked evictions cannot be undone,"" Brian M. Boynton, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Civil Division, said in a statement.

""The Department of Justice respectfully disagrees with today's decision of the district court in Alabama Association of Realtors v. HHS concluding that the moratorium exceeds CDC's statutory authority to protect public health. In the department's view, that decision conflicts with the text of the statute, Congress's ratification of the moratorium, and the rulings of other courts,"" Boynton continued.

""The department has already filed a notice of appeal of the decision and intends to seek an emergency stay of the order pending appeal,"" the statement said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-judge-blocks-biden-administration-from-imposing-abortion-rule-on-texas,2021-05-05
FTC officials invest in companies the agency regulates,"Individuals who work at the Federal Trade Commission also invest in the stocks of businesses that the agency regulates, according to the Wall Street Journal, which conducted an analysis of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies during a time period spanning 2016 through 2021.

The outlet reported that one third of the agency's 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in businesses involved in an FTC merger review or probe, based on activity the FTC has made public — the Journal also noted that agency officials held stock in 22 of the around 60 big businesses that the FTC lodged cases against during the timespan reviewed.

According to the Journal, an FTC spokesperson said that the ethics office examines senior workers' disclosures and advises them about how to abide by the rules. Prior to when ethics officials certify compliance, filers must affirm that they have reviewed guidance regarding any possible conflicts and that they are not cognizant of any actual conflicts. ""Ultimately, it is the filer’s obligation to comply with the rules,"" the FTC spokesperson said. Ethics officials attested that the individuals in the Wall Street Journal's analysis had complied with the law.

""The FTC’s mission is protecting the public from deceptive or unfair business practices and from unfair methods of competition through law enforcement, advocacy, research, and education,"" according to the agency's website.

The Journal discussed several specific people, including Randolph Tritell, the retired lead of the agency's office of international affairs, who had disclosed more stock trades than any other agency official during the timeframe that the outlet reviewed. Tritell said that he obeyed the law, according to the Journal, which also noted that ethics officials certified Tritell's disclosures every year as being in line with the rules.

Tritell had tech stocks in companies such as Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft, the outlet reported, citing his latest financial disclosure. He disclosed over 36 trades in Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle since 2016, the outlet noted.

The man said that a financial adviser is responsible for his trading, and that while he has the power to give some direction to the adviser, he seldom does. He noted that he had ""no role whatsoever"" in making Amazon, Oracle, Apple, and Microsoft trades. Regarding Facebook, he said he was not play a part in any trades ""other than for one transaction.""

He reported six Facebook trades during a probe regarding whether the business had abused the privacy of consumers, according to the Journal.

""I wasn't personally and substantially involved, so there's no issue,"" Tritell said regarding the Facebook investigation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-judge-rules-gun-ban-unconstitutional,2022-10-14
"FEMA official, former contractor with 'personal relationship' charged in Puerto Rico corruption case","A Federal Emergency Management Agency official who oversaw the restoration of Puerto Rico's power grid following Hurricane Maria has been arrested on federal corruption charges, along with a former contractor with whom she had a ""personal relationship.""

What are the details?

On Tuesday, the Department of Justice announced the indictments of FEMA Region II Deputy Regional Administrator Asha Tribble and former president of Cobra Acquisitions, LLC., Donald Ellison. Prosecutors allege that the two ""developed a personal relationship wherein Ellison provided Tribble with things of value with the intent to influence Tribble's performance of official acts.""

The press release goes on to state that ""Ellison provided Tribble with personal helicopter use, hotel accommodations, airfare, personal security services, and the use of a credit card.""

Authorities say Tribble, in exchange, actively directed recovery projects to Ellison's firm — which was awarded contracts valued at more than $1.8 billion dollars — paid with FEMA funds.

The New York Times reported that according to U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, Ellison and Tribble ""traveled together and stayed in the same room,"" and Cobra's competitors claim ""Ms. Tribble was seen publicly socializing with Mr. Ellison in San Juan in a manner that suggested a romantic relationship.""

Ellison's lawyer, Bill Leone, told The Washington Post that the indictment ""criminalizes normal business and personal relationships that are not criminal under the law, no matter how far you stretch it.""

Anything else?

Charges were also brought against a former FEMA employee Jovanda Patterson in connection with the same investigation. Patterson is accused of committing acts affecting personal financial conflicts of interest by allegedly conducting evaluations of Cobra as a FEMA employee while actively negotiating employment with the contractor.

Patterson left FEMA to work for Cobra in July 2018.

Ellison remained president of Cobra until June of this year. He is currently fighting the government for seizing his assets, including a $4.5 million retirement account, a 40-foot catamaran, his Ford truck and machinery.

Tribble has been suspended from FEMA but not terminated. She has been a longtime federal employee, formerly serving as a Homeland Security adviser under the Obama administration.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-judge-strikes-down-nationwide-ban-on-evictions-biden-doj-to-appeal,2019-09-11
Five minutes with: Author Joel Rosenberg,"When did you first realize that you were interested in writing?

Ever since I was 8 years old, I've wanted to write novels and screenplays. Writing has been a passion of mine ever since. And I really don't have any other professional skills — certainly none of the classic Jewish skill sets. I'm not a doctor, lawyer, accountant or even chiropractor. For much of the 1990s, I worked in politics in Washington but all of my candidates lost. Or, if they did well, it was long after I worked for them. Basically, I'm good at making things up. So, it was either go into journalism and write Fake News, or become a novelist. I'm happy with the choice I made.

Which of your books have you most enjoyed writing?

Wow, that's hard to say. I'll always love ""The Last Jihad,"" because that was my first novel, and such a bizarre story. I began writing it in January 2001, almost nine months before Sept. 11, yet the first page puts readers in the cockpit of a plane that's been hijacked by radical Islamist terrorists and it's coming in on a kamikaze attack into an American city. Then, after the attack (which was against Denver, not New York or Washington), my fictional American president sends U.S. forces into battle to remove Saddam Hussein from power. That was exciting to write but too surreal to see all the real-world events that unfolded later.

Beyond that, I've loved writing all 14 novels, each for different reasons. But ""The Auschwitz Escape"" was particularly special. It was the first work of historical fiction I ever wrote. For that I traveled to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp that was run by the Nazis in southern Poland. I met with the top scholars at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial research center in Israel. The story is fiction, but it's inspired by two true, historic events. The first was the greatest escape in human history, when four men escaped from Auschwitz in the spring of 1944, not simply to save their own lives but to warn Churchill and FDR of what was really happening in that death camp and to plead with them to either liberate the camp, or bomb it out of existence. The second true story upon which the novel is based is a group of Evangelical Protestant pastors in the little French town of Le Chambon sur Lignon. They rallied the town of some 3,000 people to save some 5,000 people fleeing from the Nazis, most of whom were Jews. Several of the pastors were eventually arrested and sent to concentration camps. It's an extraordinary story of faith and courage in the face of unspeakable evil. After the novel was released, I actually got to go visit the town, meet the Christians in the town, hear their stories, and give them copies of ""The Auschwitz Escape."" It was a very touching experience. I'll never forget it.

You've said that your books focus on worst case scenarios that could happen in the near future, but hopefully won't. Does it ever get stressful thinking up so many possible cataclysmic world events?

Absolutely. I spend a great deal of time trying to get into the heads of evil people, reading what they write, watching their speeches, studying their biographies, studying their strategies and tactics and trying to understand their world view. Some are Sunni radicals, others are Shias. Some aren't simply radical Islamists but rather Apocalyptic Islamists, people who literally are trying to bring about the end of the world as we know it. Others are extreme Russian nationalists. And Nazis. And North Korean nutcases. It's as sobering as it is stressful to study these people for long periods of time and then try to extrapolate what they believe into what they might try to do one day. I find myself watching a lot of sitcoms with my wife at the end of a work day — ""Seinfeld,"" ""Everyone Loves Raymond,"" ""Frasier,"" etc. — to take the edge off. That, and the Scriptures, of course. My faith is a deep source of joy and peace, and I need to lean on the truths of the Bible when I'm so deeply immersed in the lies of our enemies.

You've frequently praised Jordan's King Abdullah II. How important do you think Abdullah is to Mideast stability?

There are a number of Sunni Arab leaders that have emerged in the Middle East in recent years as bold reformers and vitally important allies of the United States, from Jordan's King Abdullah to Egypt's President el-Sisi to the United Arab Emirates' Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MBZ) to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). There are others, from Bahrain to Oman to Morocco, and beyond, and it's both fascinating and encouraging that the U.S. has so many Arab allies right now that truly understand the threats we all face from Iran, the Muslim Brotherhood, al Qaeda, ISIS, and the like.

That said, King Abdullah is, in my opinion, America's most faithful Sunni Arab Muslim ally. The others are very good in many ways, but they are newer. King Abdullah ascended to the throne in 1999. He took over when his father, the late King Hussein, passed away. King Hussein was an extraordinary leader — made some huge mistakes early in his career such as joining the Arab alliance against Israel in the 1967 war (which led to Jordan losing half its kingdom and its control of East Jerusalem), and siding with Saddam Hussein during the first Gulf War. That said, King Hussein learned from his mistakes and ended up building a wonderful alliance with the U.S. and signing a historic peace treaty with Israel.

King Abdullah has wisely and quite adroitly built on the foundations laid by his father. He has, by far, more experience than any other Arab leader in Middle East. He's navigated all kinds of challenges and steered Jordan on a moderate path, willing to fight the Radicals, willing to protect its Christian minorities, willing to welcome more than 1.3 million Syrian refugees and protect them from the savagery of the civil war there, willing to maintain peace with Israel, able to provide the U.S. extraordinary intelligence on ISIS and other terror groups. My goodness, the list of the King's impressive accomplishments goes on and on.

So, yes, I think the king is a vitally important ally of the U.S. and a force for stability and moderation in the Middle East. I've had the honor of getting to know him in recent years. He's read three of my novels. We've met together five times, and I must say I'm deeply impressed with him. He's the right man at a dangerous moment. But he needs help. Specifically, he needs more international financial assistance. He doesn't have oil. Jordan doesn't have a wealth of natural resources. The U.S. provides much aid, but the rest of the world needs to do much more. The kingdom is straining under the weight of all these refugees. The Jordanian people are hospitable, but there's only so much sacrifice they can make. I fear for what could happen if Jordan is allowed to collapse under the weight of this burden. God help us if the king is overthrown and radicals seize the country. I'm not saying this is likely. But the world should come alongside Jordan far more than it has so far to make sure it remains an island of stability and sanity in an ocean of terror and violence.

You've spoken before about how when you first converted to Christianity, many people questioned how you could be both Jewish and Christian. You also mentioned how few Jewish Christians there were back just a few decades ago. In the years since your conversion, how has this changed? Is there a stronger network for Jewish Christians today?

When I was born in 1967, it is estimated that there were fewer than 2,000 Jewish people on the entire planet who believed that Jesus was and is the Messiah. When my Jewish father came to faith in Jesus in 1973, he thought he was the first Jew since the Apostle Paul to believe that Jesus was the long-awaiting Messiah promised in the ancient prophecies. I then came to faith in 1975, and many Jewish people in the early 1970s were beginning to realize that Jesus was our Messiah. Now, fast-forward almost 50 years. Where are we now? A new study came out in early 2018 that found that there are now some 871,000 Jewish followers of Jesus — Jewish Evangelicals — in the United States alone. Worldwide, we estimate there are now approximately 1 million Jewish believers in Jesus, out of a total global Jewish population of 15 or 16 million people. So, we're definitely seeing a surge that is unprecedented since the First Century, and I find this very exciting and very encouraging. My people are discovering that the God of the Bible — the God of Israel — really does love us, and really did keep His promises, and really did send the Messiah, and that He really wants to forgive our sins and save our souls and fill us with the hope and peace and joy we have always longed for and haven't always experienced.

You've stressed that Christians need to not only pray for Israel, but for the Palestinians as well. Could you elaborate on that?

Absolutely. The Bible commands us to ""pray for the peace of Jerusalem."" The Scriptures certainly makes it abundantly clear that God loves the Jewish people, the nation of Israel, and that all who follow Jesus — the Jewish Messiah — must love Israel and the Jewish people, as well. But the Bible goes further. Jesus commands His followers to love our neighbors. All Muslims are our neighbors. All Arabs are our neighbors. And certainly the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza are our neighbors. So, Christians are commanded to love them all because God created them, and loves them, and wants them to know Him personally and experience His love and forgiveness and peace.

Now, some Christians say, ""No, I'm not going to do that. The Palestinians aren't my neighbors. They're my enemies!"" To that I say, ""Well, Jesus also commanded us to love our enemies and pray for them.""

The question is simple: Are we going to obey Christ, or not?

I can't say I always loved Palestinians. I never hated them, mind you. But only in the last decade or so have I made an intentional effort to build friendships with Palestinians, both Muslims and Christians. I've become much more intentional about praying for Palestinians on a daily basis, and learning more about their lives, and trying to understand their dreams and fears, and finding ways to serve them and encourage them. I can't say I have a detailed plan that will bring about peace between Palestinians and Israelis. But Jesus said, ""Blessed are the peacemakers."" The Bible says, ""seek peace and pursue it."" So, I'm trying to do that. And especially as an Israeli citizen now, with two of my four sons serving in the Israeli army, I'm praying for peace and working for peace more than I ever have.

How significant do you think it is that the U.S. has moved its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem?

Prophetically, it's not that significant. There's nothing in the Bible about embassies. But geopolitically, it's very significant. The U.S. and Israel are very close friends and allies, and it was kind of crazy that for 70 years the U.S. refused to place its embassy at least in undisputed West Jerusalem, since that was the declared capital of the Jewish state. Congress passed a law in 1995 declaring Jerusalem to be the Israeli capital and insisting the U.S. embassy be moved there. But one American president after another signed waivers every six months deferring the decision, essentially kicking the can down the road. But what that did was convince Palestinian leaders that maybe the U.S. and the rest of the world didn't really consider Jerusalem the legitimate capital of Israel. Rather than encouraging Palestinian leaders to forge a final, comprehensive peace treaty with Israel, it seems to have had the opposite effect.

President Trump is basically saying, ""Enough is enough. Jerusalem is the Israeli capital. That's where the prime minister lives and works. That's where the Parliament is located. That's where the Supreme Court is located. It's time to put the embassy there, in fulfillment of a law that's been on the books for 23 years. If the Palestinians want some part of East Jerusalem to be the capital of their own independent state, they'd better come to the table soon and start negotiating because the world isn't going to wait forever. Seventy years of refusing to sign a final peace treaty with Israel is enough, already.""

Is that controversial? Certainly. Is it reasonable? Personally, I think it is. Look, I grieve for the suffering of the Palestinian people. They live in poverty. Some live in squalor. Meanwhile, Israel has grown into an economic and technological superpower. I want the lives of every Palestinian to get better. I want them to experience peace and prosperity. I want them to have freedom and opportunity. But let's be honest — that's only going to happen if there is peace. And there can only be peace if the Palestinian leadership comes to the table and makes peace. The rest of the Arab world is urging them to end this conflict and make peace. I think more and more Palestinians want that, as well. But so far, the 82-year-old leader of the Palestinian Authority — Abu Mazen — seems content with digging in his heels and saying no peace, no negotiations, not now, not ever. That's very sad. Israel doesn't suffer from such intransigence. Only the Palestinian people suffer. So, I pray that either Abu Mazen changes his tune, or new leadership emerges that is ready to make peace and build a truly vibrant and dynamic free economy and free society.

What's one thing that you wish people know about you?

I'm a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen. I like to joke that that means I get to vote twice — it's like living in Chicago. My wife and sons and I live in Jerusalem. We actually just bought an apartment there. We love both of our countries, and we're passionate about our faith, and passionate about our desire to see peace in the region.

I'm also passionate about writing novels. I absolutely love being an author. There's nothing else I'd rather do. There are now about 5 million copies of my books in print, in more than two dozen languages. And one of the fun things about the books being read so far and wide is to discover who is actually reading them. Over the years, we've learned that Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, are fans of the novels since back when he was a member of Congress. So is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. King Abdullah is a fan and has read at least three of the novels. I recently got a very kind note from former President George W. Bush who is currently reading ""The Kremlin Conspiracy."" So, that's fun to know. But of course it also ups the ante because now I'm not just writing for ordinary people – now I have to attract and hold the attention of world leaders. That's an enormous challenge – but a good one, and one I'm up for.

Are you able to give any hints about what to expect in your upcoming book?

Happy to. I can't wait for this next one to be released. It's called, ""The Persian Gamble,"" and it comes out March 12. My hero is a man named Marcus Ryker. He's a decorated former U.S. Marine, and decorated former Secret Service agent who served on the Presidential Protective Detail. This is a man who has taken enormous risks to protect his country and her leaders, and now he is on the most dangerous mission of his life. The Iranians are secretly working with Russia and North Korea to buy fully operational nuclear warheads. They intend to use these warheads soon in attacks against the U.S. and Israel that will make 9/11 pale by comparison. But through a series of events, Ryker uncovers Tehran's plot — their huge, high-risk gamble — and now he's in their blind spot. The Iranians don't see Ryker coming, and that's when things really get exciting.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-trade-commission-officials-stock,2018-12-13
"Flight attendants sue CDC over mask mandate, ask court to prevent gov't from ever issuing such a mandate again","Nine flight attendants from six different airlines have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services over the federal mask mandate on air travel, claiming the measure is unconstitutional, ineffective, and harmful to their health and safety.

In the lawsuit, filed March 24 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, the flight attendants claimed the measure obstructs breathing over many hours and causes a litany of other health problems. Enforcement of the mandate also puts attendants in danger of retaliation from unruly passengers who refuse to comply, they added.

The plaintiffs also called the mandate ""an illegal and unconstitutional exercise of executive authority,"" since it was enacted ""without statutory authorization or following the rulemaking process required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).""

They urged a judge to vacate the Federal Transportation Mask Mandate effective immediately. Then they went even further, calling on the court to issue a permanent injunction prohibiting the CDC and HHS from ever issuing such a mandate again.

The suit comes as the large majority of states across the country have begun lifting mask mandates for most areas of public life. Air travel, however, remains one of the last sectors with an ongoing mask requirement. The FTMM, which was placed in effect on Feb. 1, 2021, has been extended several times, most recently until April 18, 2022.

That latest extension, issued March 10, served as the last straw for several in the aviation industry. Shortly after the extension was announced, 10 major airline company CEOs issued a letter to President Joe Biden demanding that his administration move on from the mandate. Around the same time, a group of pilots filed a lawsuit against the CDC over the requirement.

""Masks impair our health and reduce flight safety,"" Southwest Airlines attendant Victoria Vasenden of Reno, Nevada, who is one of the plaintiffs, said, according to KTVX-TV.

""We are in planes and airports up to 18 hours a day with zero chance of fresh air. Physicians don’t wear masks that long,"" she added. ""That’s assault on the brain, organs, and tissues of the human body. Yet, we are expected to ensure all aspects of the flight remain safe when masks clearly diminish our capacities.""

Another plaintiff, Alaina Trocano of Fort Myers, Florida, who works for American Airlines, added, ""We’re supposed to ensure safety yet there are many of us who do not feel safe ourselves.""

""Mask or be harassed. That’s not ensuring safety. That’s enabling hostility. Air travel should be the last place for conflict,"" she lamented in reference to the several on-flight skirmishes over mask policy adherence since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to Southwest and American, the plaintiffs in the complaint work for Allegiant, Delta, Frontier, and United. They come from six different states, as well.

The lawsuit is reportedly the 19th legal challenge filed against the FTMM but the first issued by flight attendants, who have effectively been commandeered by the federal government as enforcers of the mandate.

Neither the HHS nor the CDC have provided substantive comment to multiple local outlets reporting on the lawsuit.

Florida asks Supreme Court to decide whether Big Tech companies can claim First Amendment right to censor users,"The state of Florida has reportedly asked the U.S. Supreme Court to decide whether the First Amendment protects the right of big tech companies to shadow-ban, censor, or de-platform users and prevents state governments from regulating social media content moderation policies.

In a petition filed Wednesday, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody asked the high court to clarify whether states may require social media companies to host certain communications on their platforms and also whether tech companies may be required to provide explanation to users when content is removed or accounts are banned, the Washington Post reported.

The petition sets the stage for a high-stakes showdown between Silicon Valley tech giants and conservatives who have accused them of censorship.

Earlier this year, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals blocked a Florida law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) that placed several restrictions on social media content moderation policies. The anti-censorship law gave Florida residents a right to sue Big Tech platforms that fail to be transparent about their content moderation practices and censor or ban users inconsistently. The law also sought to prohibit platforms from censoring, de-platforming, or banning any news website ""based on the content of its publication"" and made it illegal to de-platform a candidate running for political office.

The Eleventh Circuit ruled the anti-censorship law violated the First Amendment, arguing that social media companies make editorial decisions when they enforce content moderation policies and those editorial decisions enjoy free speech protections.

However, this week the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decided to uphold a similar Texas law, ruling that corporations do not ""have a freewheeling First Amendment right to censor what people say."" The Texas law prohibits social media companies with at least 50 million monthly active users from acting to ""censor"" users by removing posts based on ""viewpoint.""

Moody's petition said the Fifth Circuit and Eleventh Circuit decisions were in conflict and that the Supreme Court must resolve the issue.

Netchoice, a tech trade group representing social media companies like Facebook and Twitter, welcomed Florida's appeal to the Supreme Court.

“We agree with Florida that the U.S. Supreme Court should hear this case, and we’re confident that First Amendment rights will be upheld,” Netchoice vice president and general counsel Carl Sabo told the Washington Post in a statement. “We have the Constitution and 200 years of precedent on our side.”

“There is consensus that this question — whether states can compel digital services to disseminate content inconsistent with their policies — is one that should be heard by the Supreme Court,” said Computer & Communications Industry Association president Matt Schruers in a statement to Politico. ""While Florida’s social media law is a threat to the First Amendment and to democratic principles, we do agree that the case calls for additional review.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/five-minutes-with-author-joel-rosenberg,2022-09-21
Florida woman killed by alligators at golf course,"A Florida woman was killed after she was attacked by two alligators at a golf course.

Shortly before 8 p.m. on Friday, an elderly woman accidentally fell into a pond at the Boca Royale Golf and Country Club, according to the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office.

Witnesses said the Englewood woman struggled to get out of the pond. Meanwhile, two alligators attacked the woman.

""While in the water, two alligators were observed near the victim and ultimately grabbed her while in the water,"" a news release said, according to WPTV-TV.

The woman was pronounced dead at the scene, according to WINK-TV. The woman's identity has not been revealed yet.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) found two alligators at the golf course pond. The FWC said the one gator was 8-feet, 10-inches-long, and the other was 7-feet, 7-inches-long. The FWC removed the animals from the golf course.

It is not known for sure if the two alligators were involved in the fatal attack.

In late May, a man was killed by an alligator about 85 miles north of the deadly golf course incident.

The body of Sean McGuinness, 47, was found in an alligator-infested lake in Largo on May 31, according to the Largo Police Department.

McGuinness was reportedly searching for lost golf discs at Taylor Lake when he was attacked. He was missing three limbs when he was found in the Tampa-area lake.

The FWC noted that alligators are found in all 67 counties in Florida.

""In recent years, Florida has experienced tremendous human population growth. Many residents seek waterfront homes, and increasingly participate in water-related activities. This can result in more frequent alligator-human interactions, and a greater potential for conflict.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/flight-attendants-sue-cdc-over-mask-mandate,2022-07-16
Former co-worker who claimed Floyd and Chauvin 'bumped heads' at work is now retracting his story,"Only days after telling CBS News that George Floyd and ex-Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin ""bumped heads"" while working overlapping shifts at a nightclub and knew each other ""pretty well,"" former employee David Pinney is retracting his story.

Pinney now says he had mistaken Floyd for another unidentified black employee.

""There has been a mix up between George and another fellow co-worker,"" he told CBS News in an email Wednesday. ""I apologize for not doing my due diligence and placing you in a very uncomfortable situation.""

The club's former owner, Maya Santamaria, had connected Pinney with CBS News after she disclosed last month that Floyd and Chauvin had both worked security at the nightclub. She told Pinney that ""she was unable to give detail information about George because she did not have a close relationship with him that [he did],"" according to an email sent by Pinney to the news outlet.

According to CBS News, in a 50-minute-long interview on June 6, Pinney described several detailed interactions between Floyd and Chauvin.

""Is there any doubt in your mind that Derek Chauvin knew George Floyd?"" CBS News asked him during the interview.

""No. He knew him,"" Pinney said.

""How well did he know him?"" the outlet asked.

And Pinney replied, ""I would say pretty well.""

Pinney added at the time that Chauvin would ""regularly show aggression"" toward Floyd and that Floyd would ask him to interface with Chauvin ""just to get away from the conflict and keep it professional.""

Pinney added that he ""knew George on a work basis"" and that they were fairly close: ""It's a difference when you work side by side with somebody. Like, I see him like a brother ...""

""I can relate to George, how he felt. And I think that's what makes that personal bond between him and I, dealing with Derek,"" he said.

Pinney allegedly worked under Floyd as a security adviser for roughly six months in late 2015 and early 2016.

Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder for kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes during an arrest and refusing to adjust his position despite Floyd's cries of ""I can't breathe.""

VIDEO: Former Hunter Biden associate makes explosive allegations against Biden family,"Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of Hunter Biden, made explosive allegations against the Biden family at a news conference Thursday, claiming that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was directly involved in foreign business dealings with a Chinese energy company and that the Biden family inappropriately benefited from that business relationship.

Bobulinski also said he will turn over his electronic devices and records of business dealings between the Biden family and its Chinese associates to the FBI.

The purpose of the news conference was to ""set the record straight about the involvement of the Biden family, Vice President Biden, his brother Jim Biden, and his son Hunter Biden in dealings with the Chinese,"" Bobulinski said.



Among the allegations he made against the Biden family were that Hunter Biden attempted to use a corporate entity set up in partnership with a Chinese energy company as ""a personal piggy bank"" and that Joe Biden had direct knowledge of the business dealings and that the Biden family was ""paranoid"" about keeping the former vice president's involvement secret.



Characterizing claims from the Democratic nominee that he never spoke with his son about his foreign business dealings as ""false,"" Bobulinski said his statements are corroborated by ""emails, Whats App chats, agreements, documents, and other evidence"" contained on three phones he personally used between the years 2015-2018.

He also claimed that he had a conversation with another individual ""involved in this matter"" on Sunday and was told that if he went public this information ""it would bury all of us, man, the Bidens included.""

""I have no wish to bury anyone, I have never been political. The few contributions I have made have been to Democrats. But what I am is a patriot and a veteran. To protect my family name, and my business reputation, I need to ensure that the true facts are out there,"" Bobulinski said.



The facts he related are as follows:

Bobulinski says that in late 2015 he was approached by James Gilliar, a business partner of the Biden family, about ""joining him in a deal"" involving the ""Chinese state-owned enterprise CEFC China Energy"" and ""what he called one of the most prominent families in the United States,"" the Biden family. He said he was also informed by Hunter Biden that the Bidens ""wanted to form a new entity with CEFC, which was to invest in infrastructure, real estate, and technology in the U.S. and around the world.""

Following an initial capital investment of $10 million, Bobulinski said he was told the entity would ""grow to billions of dollars of investment capital."" After months of discussions, he agreed to become CEO of the entity, called Sinohawk Holdings.

""Between February and May 2017, we exchanged numerous emails, documents, and Whats App messages concerning Sinohawk and its potential business,"" Bobulinski said. ""On May 2, 2017, the night before Joe Biden was to appear at the Milken conference, I was introduced to Joe Biden by Jim Biden and Hunter Biden.""

During their hourlong meeting, Bobulinski claims he discussed the Bidens' history and their family business plans with the Chinese, of which Joe Biden ""was plainly familiar, at least at a high level.""

In the ensuing days, the group reportedly communicated numerous times about ""the allocation of the equity ownership of Sinohawk."" On May 10, 2017, Bobulinski said he received the email first reported by the New York Post discussing Joe Biden's 10% equity share in the company.

""On numerous occasions, it was made clear to me that Joe Biden's involvement was not to be mentioned in writing but only face-to-face,"" Bobulinski said, adding that he was told ""Hunter and Jim Biden were paranoid about keeping Joe Biden's involvement secret.""

""I also had a disagreement with Hunter about the funds CEFC was contributing to Sinohawk,"" Bobulinski continued.

He claimed Hunter Biden wanted $5 million to be paid to himself and his family, to which Bobulinski objected. Then he claims Hunter, referencing his father, told him that ""CEFC was really investing in the Biden family, that he held the trump card, and that he was the one putting his family legacy on the line.""



""During these negotiations, I repeated to Hunter and others that Sinohawk could not be Hunter's personal piggy bank."" Bobulinski said.

He alleges that Hunter Biden became upset with him when he insisted on ""proper corporate governance procedures"" be implemented to keep him from withdrawing funds from Sinohawk.

Referring to a report on Hunter Biden's business dealings with Ukrainian energy firm Burisma released by Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iow) last month, Bobulinski said he realized that the Bidens had gone behind his back and transferred the $5 million to ""entities affiliated with Hunter.""

Bobulinski announced that he will be meeting with members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee Friday to discuss this matter and that he will turn over his electronic devices to the FBI.



Last week, the New York Post published an email that allegedly shows Hunter Biden pursuing ""lucrative"" business deals with a Chinese energy company that would be ""interesting for me and my family."" The email, written by James Gilliar of the international consulting firm J2cR, discussed ""remuneration packages"" for six individuals only identified by initials and nicknames. Hunter and Joe Biden are alleged to be two of the individuals receiving financial compensation from this business venture with the now-bankrupt Shanghai-based China Energy Fund Committee. The company was formerly led by Ye Jianming, who has been missing since 2018 and has rumored ties to China's People's Liberation Army and Chinese military intelligence. In 2018, the New York Times reported on Jianming's arrest for attempts to bribe foreign officials around the world, including the Bidens.

Democrats and the media have responded to the bombshell revelations from these emails by attacking the New York Post's reporting and dismissing the emails as Russian disinformation.

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee confirmed Thursday that it had reached out to Bobulinski as part of its investigation into the purported Hunter Biden emails.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-woman-killed-by-alligators,2020-10-23
"Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey blasts Brian Stelter, says he witnessed incident in which CNN tried to falsify news","Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO and co-founder, hit out at CNN's Brian Stelter on Sunday and said that he has seen CNN promoting falsified news reports and pushing narratives after witnessing an incident that took place during the 2014 Ferguson, Missouri, riots.



What are the details?

Dorsey on Sunday evening hit out at Stelter on Twitter after the CNN host shared a link from the Washington Post, which accused Fox News host Tucker Carlson of ""selling doubt"" to his core audience.

Dorsey fired back, ""And you all are selling hope?""

His response prompted a social media frenzy, with at least one Twitter user accusing him of defending Carlson.

""Not defending a thing. Holding up a mirror,"" Dorsey quipped.

Dorsey later took aim at the network in response to a tweet from Miss Universe Iraq Sarah Abdali Idan, who wrote, ""Even @CNN sometimes sells false news. I know this from covering Iraq events in 2019. People need to understand every media is prone to either mistakes or deliberate corruption. Do your own investigations before believing what they're selling you.""

Her remark prompted Dorsey to tweet, ""I know this from being on the streets of Ferguson during the protests and watching them try to create conflict and film it causing the protestors to chant 'f*** CNN.'""

Dorsey did not expound on specific incidents he saw in Ferguson.

What else is there to know?

Dorsey, who rarely speaks out on the social media network he co-founded, also made headlines over the weekend after blasting the company's board of directors amid Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk's bid to purchase and privatize the company.

His criticism came in response to a user's tweet that said, ""If I look into the history of Twitter board, it’s intriguing as I was a witness on its early beginnings, mired in plots and coups, and particularly amongst Twitter’s founding members. I wish if it could be made into a Hollywood thriller one day.”

Dorsey — who still sits on the company's board — responded, “It’s consistently been the dysfunction of the company” and agreed with another user's comment that ""[g]ood boards don't create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/floyd-chauvin-bumped-heads-retracts-story,2022-04-19
Fox News fires Trey Gowdy amid reports that he has agreed to join President Trump's legal team,"Fox News announced that it has cut ties with former congressman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), further bolstering reports that the attorney has joined President Donald Trump's legal team as outside counsel to fight the Democrats' impeachment probe.

What are the details?

""Trey Gowdy has been terminated and is no longer a contributor,"" a Fox News spokesperson wrote in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday.

The network's confirmation of Gowdy's departure follows multiple reports that the former prosecutor and conservative firebrand has agreed to assist in defending the president against what the commander in chief has repeatedly referred to as a ""witch hunt.""

The Hollywood Reporter noted, ""Television networks covet former politicians to provide on-air analysis as contributors, but generally cut ties with them if they re-enter the political fray.""

As of this writing, neither Gowdy nor President Trump have commented either way as to whether the South Carolina Republican has been hired to the join the president's legal team. Following several conflicting reports from an array of outlets, however, Washington Post White House reporter Josh Dawsey reported Tuesday evening that a senior White House official confirmed to him that ""Trey Gowdy is on the Trump team.""



Gowdy has already shared his views on the impeached inquiry in his capacity as a Fox News contributor, coming to the defense of multiple Trump administration officials while condemning the basis of the probe. The former congressman also hit out against Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — who is spearheading the impeachment efforts — saying Schiff's bias and dishonesty since taking the lead could doom his party's investigation.

The Daily Caller reported that Gowdy left the House of Representatives ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, after serving eight years in the lower chamber. At the time, he told Bloomberg, ""Whatever skills I may have are better utilized in a courtroom than in Congress, and I enjoy our justice system more than our political system.""

Fox News' Greg Gutfeld thanks colleagues for helping rescue his mother-in-law from Ukraine,"Fox News host Greg Gutfeld, whose mother-in-law has been trapped in Ukraine during the conflict with Russia, thanked his colleagues on Friday for helping her to finally reach safety in Poland as she fled from the conflict with Russia.

Gutfeld shared an emotional video segment showing his mother-in-law being reunited with his wife Elena after she successfully made it to Poland. Gutfeld explained that his mother, who is from Ukraine, went back to visit family after her husband passed away from COVID.

""Her husband passed away from COVID last year, so she'd been spending time — she was born in Ukraine, she's a Ukranian Russian — so she was with her cousins or whatnot in this little tiny village when all this stuff happened. So we had to get her out of there and get her back, you know, thanks to Fox,"" Gutfeld said.

Gutfeld lamented the fact that, while his mother-in-law had been successfully evacuated, there were still millions of refugees still stuck in Ukraine who are attempting to flee the escalating violence in that country. ""She was fortunate enough to make it to safety, but there are still millions and millions in danger.""

Gutfeld had spoken about his mother-in-law's plight earlier in the week, and revealed on Thursday afternoon on air during ""The Five,"" ""“Just to let everybody know my mother-in-law crossed into … Poland about half an hour ago, so she's in a car on her way to Warsaw to see her daughter, Elena.""

Rev. Franklin Graham of Samaritan's Purse Easter message of hope t o all faiths and People of Ukraine,"Rev. Franklin Graham will deliver an Easter message of hope from war-torn Ukraine, where he has seen the resiliency of the Ukrainian people who are fighting back against an invasion by Russia.

""The people that you meet and talk to [in Ukraine] are strong,"" Rev. Graham told Fox News. ""There's no question there's despair and there's fear. But they are determined they are going to fight for their land. And I just admire the [Ukrainian] people for the stand that they're taking.""

Graham said the worst suffering has occurred in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, where there is ""famine and great food shortage."" The faith leader revealed that four Ukrainian people distributing food through Graham's humanitarian aid charity Samaritan's Purse were recently killed. The victims died ""trying to help their own citizens, their own people,"" Graham said.

""This may be one of the hardest countries that we have worked in,"" he said of the crisis. ""It's a big country, the size of Texas. And transportation is an issue. They have trains, and trucks, and so forth, but fuel is a big issue. You can't always get fuel.""

Samaritan's Purse said their team of doctors and nurses has treated over 5,000 Ukrainian patients at six medical sites across Ukraine. The Christian charity has also airlifted more than 232 tons of emergency relief supplies to Ukraine, and utilized a network of over 3,200 churches to share medicine and food.

Graham said the Ukrainian ""people are living in the shadow of death,"" but still have the sense that God is with them.

""It's obvious that these people have a strong faith in God,"" Rev. Graham continued.

He pointed out that there are more than 5,000 churches in Ukraine, and they are ""full on Sunday.""

""They're packed. Catholic, Orthodox, Evangelical, Pentecostal, Baptist — they're packed. The people's faith is strong in Ukraine right now. Very strong,"" the CEO and president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association said.

""In Ukraine, there are billboards that say, 'Our only hope is God.' We need some billboards like that here in this country,"" he added. ""I hope that our nation would wake up and see the problems we're facing and realize that the only hope is God.""

""The problem we have in the world today is a sin problem,"" Rev. Graham stressed. ""People have turned their back on God.""



""The only hope is God. That's the only hope. Only God can turn [our] nation around,"" he proclaimed. ""This Easter, I pray that people will look to God, pray to him and ask him for his help in all that we do — and that he'll bless the nation.""

Graham declared, ""But to do that, we've got to repent, turn from our sins and believe on the name of his son, the Lord Jesus Christ.""



""We [all] need to repent and turn from our sins. And maybe God will hear us from heaven,"" Graham advised. ""Pray for yourself. Just examine your heart. And if something's not right in your life, confess it to God and turn from it. We need to look at ourselves.""

“I will be sharing a message the whole world needs to hear: Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, conquered sin and death 2,000 years ago when He rose victoriously from the grave,"" Graham said of his Easter message. ""This good news changes everything – for individual hearts, for communities, and for entire nations.”



Previously, Graham wrote to Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy requesting a ceasefire from April 15-24 in observance of the Easter holiday.



""It's a mess. It's going to get worse, I'm afraid,"" Graham said of the conflict in Ukraine. ""And what President Putin's end game is, I don't know. But I think we just need to pray that God can change his heart.""

""And I would recommend for people to pray for Putin. I don't want to be misunderstood,"" he clarified. ""I want people to pray that God would change his heart. And turn his heart around, and that he would see the sin that he's involved in. That he would repent and turn from it.""

He added, ""And if we pray, that could happen.""

""God loves us, and Easter is about God's love,"" Graham said.

College students support violence stop free speech on campus,"A new poll revealed that a disturbing percentage of college students are in favor of using violence to stop a campus speech. The survey, by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, Real Clear Education, and College Pulse polled 20,000 students from 55 different colleges, found that nearly one-fifth of college students believe it is acceptable to use violent means to shut down speech that they may agree with or deem offensive.

The poll found that 18% of college students approve using violence in certain situations to stifle campus speech. That number rises to 21% at Ivy League schools, and drops to 15% at colleges in the Southeastern Conference.

""Liberal students expressed a higher acceptance of violence,"" FIRE explained. ""Students identifying as extremely liberal said violence to stop a speech or event from occurring on campus was 'always' or 'sometimes' acceptable at a rate double than students identifying as extremely conservative: 13% to 6%. More than a quarter of extremely liberal respondents said it is 'rarely' acceptable, compared to 8% of extremely conservative respondents.""

""One quarter of atheist students and black students expressed some level of acceptance for violence, as did 27% of LGBT students,"" the poll revealed.

Over 60% of extreme liberals proclaim that it is ""always"" or ""sometimes"" acceptable to shout down a speaker, compared to only 15% for extreme conservatives.

The hostile atmosphere against speech deemed as offensive or inflammatory has caused conservative college students to self-censor to avoid conflict. While 55% of liberal students self-censor, 72% of conservative students feel the need to self-censor.



More than 40% of college students said the topic of race is a difficult topic to have an open and honest discussion about. There were 45% of students who said abortion would be a problematic topic to broach.

When it comes to guest speakers appearing at colleges and universities, there is a bias against conservative orators. The FIRE poll found that an overwhelming 87% of students would welcome former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders to speak, but only 69% would allow President Donald Trump to speak on campus.

Conservative students were much more tolerant in hearing speakers who they disagree with politically, and 71% of strong Republicans support Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden coming to speak at their campus. Meanwhile, only 49% of strong Democrats would allow President Trump to speak at their college.

The research also provided metrics for FIRE to name the best and worst colleges for free speech.

The best colleges for free speech:

The University of Chicago Kansas State University Texas A&M University University of California, Los Angeles Arizona State University

The worst colleges for free speech:

Syracuse University Dartmouth College Louisiana State University University of Texas DePauw University

"Sam Bankman-Fried FTX donations to Democrats, Ukrainian government","FTX had some eye-opening connections to powerful entities and individuals around the world before it all came crashing down.

The meteoric rise of FTX

FTX made waves with early endorsements by NFL legend Tom Brady, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, and NBA superstar Stephen Curry. FTX spent big money on a Super Bowl commercial featuring ""Seinfeld"" creator Larry David.

""In 2021, FTX inked a reported $135 million, 19-year deal with the NBA’s Miami Heat to rename the American Airlines Arena as FTX Arena,"" CNN reported. ""Major League Baseball struck a five-year deal in 2021 to name FTX as its official cryptocurrency exchange, a partnership that includes putting FTX patches on umpires’ uniforms.""

The extraordinary collapse of FTX

Then the FTX collapse happened.

Within the span of a few days, FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried – known in the industry as “SBF” – lost nearly all of his $16 billion fortune in what Bloomberg called ""one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.""

On Friday, the Bahamas-based FTX was forced to file for bankruptcy after $473 million of its funds were stolen in a hack of the cryptocurrency exchange. Customers rushed to withdraw their funds, but it was too late.

Reuters reported that between $1 billion and $2 billion in customer funds vanished from the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. The outlet also claimed that FTX secretly funneled $10 billion of customer funds into his trading company – Alameda Research. The Daily Mail claimed that SBF's alleged girlfriend – Caroline Ellison – ran the sister trading company.

The New York Times noted, ""Despite raising $2 billion, he remained the majority owner of the company. No investors joined FTX’s board of directors, which was made up of Mr. Bankman-Fried, an FTX employee and a lawyer.""

Sam Bankman-Fried gives millions to the Democratic Party

Before his cryptocurrency exchange collapsed, Bankman-Fried was a major financier of the Democratic Party.

MarketWatch reported, ""SBF contributed more than $5 million to Joe Biden and groups supporting him during his 2020 presidential campaign. He said he was motivated by Biden’s 'generic stability and decision-making process.'""

Bankman-Fried gave Democrats nearly $37 million in the 2021-2022 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets. SBF was the second-biggest individual donor to the Democrats, only to be surpassed by $128 million from George Soros.

In May, Bankman-Fried said he expected to donate ""north of $100 million"" to Democrats in the 2024 presidential election, but vowed to have a ""soft ceiling"" of political spending of $1 billion if former President Donald Trump ran again.



SBF goes to the White House

The 30-year-old billionaire was able to gain access to a top Biden advisor weeks before he offered vast political donations to the Democrats.

The Washington Free Beacon reported that Bankman-Fried met with top Biden adviser Steve Ricchetti on April 22 and May 12, according to White House visitor logs.

Gabe Bankman-Fried – SBF's brother who handles the billionaire's political operations – visited the White House on March 7, according to the outlet.

SBF largely funded the Democratic Protect Our Future PAC that only launched in May 2022. SBF's brother said the PAC was formed to ""stop the next pandemic.""

In May, Gabe Bankman-Fried said of the Protect Our Future PAC, ""If this is a weird crypto play, I certainly have not been informed about it. I want to stop the next pandemic. That is really my one and only goal here... I think over time, people will realize that.""

Bankman-Fried's mother is also a major fundraiser for Democrats

Bankman-Fried's mother, Barbara Fried, is a Stanford professor, and has ""written extensively on questions of distributive justice, in the areas of tax policy, property theory, and political theory."" She is also the co-founder of the Mind the Gap political action committee that was established in 2018 to help Democrats win elections.

Vox published a glowing article about Mind the Gap in January 2020 titled: ""Inside the secretive Silicon Valley group that has funneled over $20 million to Democrats.""

""What is also unusual is that Mind the Gap is led not by highly experienced political hands, but by academics with no professional backgrounds as fundraisers,"" the Vox article reads. ""The group’s leaders are a pair of Stanford law professors: Barbara Fried, who has no apparent campaign experience, and Paul Brest, the former president of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Graham Gottlieb, a Stanford fellow who served in junior roles for former President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign and in his White House, is its executive director.""



Vox notes, ""Backers include people like Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, San Francisco power broker Ron Conway, and a coterie of major Democratic donors from across Silicon Valley, including fundraiser Amy Rao.""

The FTX connection to the Ukrainian government and WEF

Curiously, the Ukrainian government launched a cryptocurrency donation website in March that was backed by FTX.

CoinDesk reported in March, ""'Aid for Ukraine,' which has the backing of crypto exchange FTX, staking platform Everstake, and Ukraine’s Kuna exchange, will route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine, Everstake’s Head of Growth Vlad Likhuta told CoinDesk. Ukraine’s crypto-savvy Ministry of Digital Transformation is also involved.""

An Everstake press release stated, ""Aid For Ukraine is cooperating with the cryptocurrency exchange FTX which converts crypto funds received into fiat and sends the donations to the National Bank of Ukraine. This marks the first-ever instance of a cryptocurrency exchange directly cooperating with a public financial entity to provide a conduit for crypto donations. Earlier this month, FTX already converted $1 million worth of SOL and transferred it to the National Bank of Ukraine.""

Bankman-Fried said at the time:

At the onset of the conflict in Ukraine, FTX felt the need to provide assistance in any way it could. By working with the Ministry of Digital Transformation to set up payment rails and facilitate the conversion of crypto donations into fiat currency, we have given the National Bank of Ukraine the ability to deliver aid and resources to the people who need it most. We are grateful for the opportunity to work with Sergey and the Everstake team as they continue to work tirelessly in helping Ukrainians as they suffer from this conflict.

Attorney General Garland appoints special counsel to investigate Biden's potential mishandling of top-secret documents,"The White House was not raided over President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents, which have turned up in at least two unauthorized stashes in recent days. Nevertheless, Biden may soon have to answer to the special counsel appointed Thursday by Attorney General Merrick Garland.

Garland has tasked former Department of Justice official Robert K. Hur with investigating Biden for potential impropriety over his admitted transport and possession of classified documents.

One batch of classified documents that Biden reportedly retained from his tenure as vice president was discovered at the president's private office in a China-linked think tank in Washington, D.C.. Another batch was discovered at his home in Wilmington, Delaware.

CNN noted that some of the documents were marked top secret.

Biden told reporters that he stored some of the classified documents in his garage beside his Corvette.

Hur, a Republican, served as the 48th U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland from 2018 to 2021. He was nominated for the role by former President Donald Trump.

Hur previously served as principal associate deputy attorney general with the U.S. Department of Justice, working with FBI Director Christopher Wray.

""In 2003, [Hur] joined the department's criminal division, where he worked on counterterrorism, corporate fraud and appellate matters. From 2007 until 2014, Mr. Hur served as an assistant US attorney for the district of Maryland, where he prosecuted matters ranging from violent crime to financial fraud,"" said Garland.

Axios indicated that Hur's appointment, which Garland said was in the ""public interest,"" is intended to ""avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.""

Garland may also want to avoid the appearance of inconsistency, granted that in November, he appointed Jack Smith special counsel for the criminal probe into whether former President Donald Trump, who had the power to declassify documents, mishandled sensitive documents.

In his announcement, Garland provided an outline for the investigation into Biden's potential malfeasance regarding the classified documents so far:



Nov. 4 — The National Archives Office of Inspector General contacted a DOJ prosecutor, informing him that the White House had notified the Archives that classified documents were found in Biden's Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement office. The office was not authorized to store classified documents.

Garland announced the special counsel on Jan. 12, just hours after news began circulating that another set of classified documents had been found.

""This appointment underscores for the public the department’s commitment to independence and accountability, and particularly sensitive matters and to making decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law,"" said Garland.

Garland added Hur will be given ""all the resources he needs.""

Hur suggested that he will ""conduct the assigned investigation with fair, impartial, and dispassionate judgment.""

""I intend to follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly, without fear or favor, and will honor the trust placed in me to perform this service,"" he added.""

Biden's counsel indicated in a Jan. 12 statement the White House will cooperate with the DOJ.

Garland warns DOJ employees that communicating with Congress without authorization violates their employee standards,"Attorney General Merrick Garland sent all Justice Department employees a memo on Tuesday reminding them of the agency's policies regarding communications with Congress.

What does the memo say?

Garland, referring to the DOJ employee manual, instructed all Justice Department employees that any communication with Congress must go through the department's Office of Legislative Affairs.

The manual reads:

Except as provided in this chapter, no Department employee may communicate with Senators, Representatives, congressional committees, or congressional staff without advance coordination, consultation, and approval by OLA. All congressional inquiries and correspondence from Members, committees, and staff should be immediately directed to OLA upon receipt.

Garland instructed employees that such policies are meant to protect the integrity of DOJ investigations.

Quoting the manual, Garland added that the policy is not ""intended to conflict with or limit whistleblower protections,"" which are provided under federal law.

Social media users quickly speculated the memo is a covert message to potential Justice Department whistleblowers who want to divulge behind-the-scenes information to members of Congress.

Importantly, Garland did not mention the importance of not leaking information to the media.

As has been observed, leaks have driven the media narrative of the Justice Department's criminal investigation into former President Donald Trump and the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago.

What about whistleblowers?

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) have repeatedly brought forward information they say whistleblowers revealed to them.

For instance, Grassley said last month that multiple FBI whistleblowers disclosed information to him indicating a partisan tilt in the Hunter Biden investigation.

Meanwhile, Jordan said two weeks ago that 14 FBI whistleblowers have come forward to his office, providing him with details about allegedly partisan dealings at the highest levels of the Justice Department.

""Fourteen FBI agents have come to our office as whistleblowers, and they are good people,"" Jordan said on Fox News. ""There are lots of good people in the FBI. It's the top that is the problem. Some of these good agents are coming to us, telling us what is baloney, what’s going on — the political nature now of the Justice Department — God bless them for doing it.""

Anything else?

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) responded to Garland's memo by reiterating whistleblower protections.

""DOJ employees, take notice: No matter what this memo says, you are protected by federal law if you contact my office to blow the whistle on the improper politicization of the Department of Justice by Merrick Garland and Joe Biden,"" Cotton said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-democrats-ukraine,2022-08-31
What we know and what we don't know about why Garrett Foster got shot Saturday night in Austin,"It has been several days since armed Black Lives Matter protester Garrett Foster, 28, was shot and killed during Saturday night protests in Austin, Texas, and yet details about the incident remain elusive.

A host of speculative information and conflicting reports have emerged following Foster's death, leaving Americans to wonder who was actually at fault in the killing.

Here's what we do know

Foster was carrying: On the night that he was shot, Foster was brandishing an AK-47-type rifle, which is legal under Texas' open carry law. Video captured live on Facebook by journalist Hiram Gilberto and posted later to Twitter shows Foster explaining his reasoning for carrying the weapon.

""They don't let us march in the streets anymore, so I got to practice some of our rights,"" Foster said.

When Gilberto asked Foster if he felt like he would need to use it, Foster responded: ""No ... if I use it against the cops, I'm dead ... and I think all the people that hate us ... are too big of p***ies to stop and actually do anything about it.""

Austin Police Association President Kenneth Casaday tweeted that the interview proves Foster ""was looking for confrontation and he found it"" on Saturday night.

There was an altercation between Foster and a driver: Some sort of altercation occurred between Foster and a person driving a vehicle with a concealed handgun near a crowd of protesters Saturday night on Congress Ave. and Fourth St., resulting in Foster's death.

According to KTVT-TV, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said that after the shooting, the driver called police to report the incident. The driver was reportedly taken into custody to be questioned but was later released. Manley did not release the driver's name.

Manley indicated that officers in the area heard ""two separate volleys of gunfire"" and made their way to the crowd, where they found Foster suffering from multiple gunshot wounds.

Foster was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Police say there was a third participant: Manley reported that a second shooter, who allegedly fired at the vehicle as it sped away, was also taken in for questioning and later released. That individual's name has also not been released.

Both the driver and the second shooter possessed concealed handgun licenses, police said. Those handguns as well as Foster's rifle have been secured as evidence.

A video of the incident first streamed live by Gilberto has been published on social media. In the video, you can see a crowd of protesters marching in an intersection before five shots clearly ring out, followed by three shots shortly after. Then you can see police and first responders tending to an individual lying in the street.

Garret Foster Shot Dead During Protest in Austin, Texas www.youtube.com

Here's what we don't know

In short, we don't know the precise details of what happened during the altercation between Foster, the driver, and the third participant, or what exactly prompted the shooting.

Witnesses reported to the Austin American-Statesman that the driver ""appeared to drive into the crowd and came to a stop when the vehicle hit a temporary barrier erected to block traffic."" At that point, they allegedly say, ""several protesters, including Foster, approached the car and Foster had his weapon pointed down.""

The driver and several other witnesses reportedly told police that Foster pointed his gun at them threateningly as he approached the vehicle and so the driver responded with force.

What is unclear is whether the driver was driving into the crowd with intent to harm protesters or whether the driver was simply attempting to push through the traffic barricade to find a way out.

When asked for more information on this by the outlet, police officials said that the investigation is ongoing and that they're ""encouraging anyone who might have information or video/photos to come forward.""

Anything else?

Some on social media originally surmised that Foster may have been the first to fire because the first five shots in the video sound like AK-47 rounds, while the final three sound more like a handgun. But that would likely only be possible if the second shooter was lying about his or her involvement, and also at this point, most witness testimony doesn't seem to corroborate that account.

In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" on Sunday, Foster's mother, Sheila Foster, said her son and his fiancé, Whitney Mitchell, had been attending protests in the city almost every day for the past 50 days.

Sheila Foster said she was told that her son had been pushing Mitchell, a quadruple amputee, in her wheelchair as the driver ""erratically"" approached the intersection.

""And this gentleman got out of his car and started firing shots, and my son was shot three times,"" she alleged.

Manley told reporters that witnesses who spoke to police reported ""several different versions of the incident.""

Garth Brooks to perform at Biden-Harris inauguration in show of 'unity',"Country music icon Garth Brooks has accepted an invitation to perform at the swearing-in ceremony for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice president-elect Kamala Harris, in what he calls a show of ""unity"" in the midst of the nation's deep political divisions.

The singer says he ""might be the only Republican at this place.""

What are the details?

""This is not a political statement, this is a statement of unity,"" Brooks declared from the start during a media interview announcing that he would join the inauguration performance lineup that also includes Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez.

Brooks said incoming first lady Jill Biden called to request that he sing at the ceremony, and he accepted.

When asked for his reaction to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters, Brooks replied:

""It was disturbing. It was sad. Try to remember that we are the human race, so I'm always going to find sunny sides in there. …The fact that we do make choices very much on the spur of the moment. I deal in music. I deal in raw emotion. That is what music is all about, and all that passion, guided, misguided as it is, I think that you saw the human race at a time that, for me as a person, seemed to reflect some other country's deadline, if that makes any sense. But it's here, and all I can do is beg and plead for everybody to take that second, that moment, take a breath and think about it. Think about your family. Think about what the mark you're going to leave on this planet as a human being, and with the children that you raise, and then make your decision.



""So I think what happened was we saw people in the heat of the moment, and we've seen it on television before, but I'm with you. I felt like it was in some other country, but it was here. And now we deal with it, take responsibility, we claim it, and now we do our best to make sure something like that doesn't happen again.""

He told the media of his upcoming performance, ""I might be the only Republican at this place, but it's about reaching across and loving one another.""

Joe Biden's team announces Garth Brooks will perform at the inauguration www.youtube.com

The Hill reported:

This will be Brooks's second time playing an inaugural ceremony after playing at former President Obama's inauguration in 2009. Brooks was also invited to perform at President Trump's inauguration in 2017 but declined due to a scheduling conflict with his ongoing tour at the time.

Biden and Harris are set to be sworn in at noon EST Wednesday on the west front of the Capitol, in a ceremony with about 1,000 attendees, including Congress. According to The New York Times, the inauguration will be followed by a virtual ""parade"" that begins at 3:15 p.m.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/garland-memo-doj-communications-congress,2021-01-19
Average US gas price tops $4 a gallon for first time since 2008 — and it could go even higher,"The average cost of gasoline in the U.S. soared on Monday to more than $4 a gallon amid Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

What are the details?

According to AAA, the average cost per gallon was $4.065 as of Monday morning, a notch up from Sunday when reports over the soaring prices began to circulate widely in American media.

The figure is just shy of the all-time high of $4.103 and the highest since 2008

While most average prices are hovering just below $4, in certain states — such as California, Nevada, and New York — the cost is exorbitantly high. In California, the average cost is well over $5 a gallon.

The skyrocketing prices are driven by fears over crude oil supply as private companies continue to boycott Russian energy and the U.S. and other Western nations consider embargos on Russian oil as a penalty for their attack on neighboring Ukraine.

On Monday, Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, was up 14%, trading at nearly $130 a barrel, double what it was trading for just a few months ago.

Even though many Western nations have so far largely kept their hands off Russia's energy sector as they advance crippling sanctions, the market is still responding to Moscow's war.

""The market is self-sanctioning — in other words, buyers are avoiding Russian products,"" CNBC reported. ""According to estimates from JPMorgan, 66% of Russian oil is struggling to find buyers. This is creating supply fears in what was an already tight market prior to Russia’s invasion.""

If the U.S. and other nations follow through with a formal embargo, it's expected that oil and gas prices will rise even more.

What else?

The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the subsequent rise in oil costs have renewed calls for curtailing America's reliance on foreign energy, specifically from adversaries like Russia. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. has doubled its imports of Russian crude oil over the past year.

Many business leaders and lawmakers have responded to the crisis by once again urging the U.S. to produce its own energy, or become energy independent, something quite possible given the country's natural resources. Yet for years the initiative has been thwarted by Democrat-imposed restrictions over supposed environmental concerns.

Over the weekend, influential tech billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk begrudgingly called for an increase in domestic energy production.

""Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil & gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. Obviously, this would negatively affect Tesla, but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil & gas exports,""

Soon after, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz threw his support behind Musk, saying, ""Couldn’t agree more! Unleash American energy NOW!""

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, too, has voiced his support for energy independence while criticizing the current president for continuing to buy up Russian oil.

""We produce energy cleaner than anybody in the world,"" Manchin said last week. ""We’re buying 650,000 barrels a day from Russia. It’s ridiculous. Totally ridiculous.""

""To continue to ask other countries to do what we can do for ourselves in a cleaner way is hypocritical,"" he added in a statement. ""To continue to rely on Russian energy as they attack Ukraine is senseless.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/garrett-foster-shooting-what-we-know,2022-03-07
"Gay, liberal, Jewish activist should feel right at home on left-wing college campus. But he says backing Israel makes him an enemy of the left.","Blake Flayton is a sophomore at George Washington University, and by all appearances possesses a pedigree and sociopolitical stance that one would think should serve him well among left-wing students on the left-wing campus.

""As a gay abortion rights advocate and environmentalist, my place in such circles has always been welcomed and accepted,"" Flayton said in his Thursday op-ed for the New York Times.

'Pushed to the fringes of a movement'

But times have indeed changed — and he wrote that he now finds himself ""pushed to the fringes of a movement I thought I was at the heart of, marginalized as someone suspicious at best and oppressive at worst. This is because I am a Zionist. It is because I, like 95 percent of American Jews, support Israel.""

And backing Israel at most institutions of higher learning is a no-no.

More from Flayton's piece:

Before I arrived on campus, I could proudly say that I was both a strong progressive and a Zionist. I didn't think there was a conflict between those two ideas. In fact, I understood them as being in sync, given that progressives have long championed the liberation movements of downtrodden minorities. I viewed — and still view — the establishment of the state of Israel as a fundamentally just cause: the most persecuted people in human history finally gaining the right of self-determination after centuries of displacement, intimidation, violence and genocide. For me, this remains true even as I oppose the occupation of the West Bank. It is my Zionism that informs my view that the Palestinian people also have the right to their own state.



But my view is not at all shared by the progressive activist crowd I encountered on campus. They have made it abundantly clear to me and other Jews on campus that any form of Zionism — even my own liberal variant, which criticizes various policies of Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and seeks a just two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — is a political nonstarter. For this group at my school, and similar groups on campuses and cities around the country, Zionism itself is, to parrot the Soviet propaganda of several decades ago, racist. And anybody who so dares to utter the words “right to exist"" is undeniably a proponent of racism.

""Given that almost all American Jews identify as 'pro-Israel,' even as the majority of us are also critical of Israeli government policy, this intolerance affects huge numbers of young American Jews,"" he added to his op-ed. ""I am one of them.""

What happens when he speaks up?

Flayton noted in his piece that a political club meeting he attended featured a description of Zionism as a “transnational project"" — which he said is ""an anti-Semitic trope that characterizes the desire for a Jewish state as a bid for global domination by the Jewish people"" — and a declaration that Zionism shouldn't be “normalized.""

When he said more Jewish voices should be part of the organization's leadership to add more nuance, Flayton recalled that he was ""assured that anti-Zionist Jews were already a part of the club and thus my concerns of anti-Semitism were baseless.""

More from his piece:

I expected this loophole, as it is all too common across progressive spaces: groups protect themselves against accusations of anti-Semitism by trotting out their anti-Zionist Jewish supporters, despite the fact that such Jews are a tiny fringe of the Jewish community. Such tokenism is seen as unacceptable — and rightfully so — in any other space where a marginalized community feels threatened.



All of this puts progressive Jews like myself in an extraordinarily difficult position. We often refrain from calling out anti-Semitism on our side for fear of our political bona fides being questioned or, worse, losing friends or being smeared as the things we most revile: racist, white supremacist, colonialist and so on. And that is exactly what happens when we do speak up.

Following Israel's April election, he said he tried to explain to classmates that many Israels didn't vote for Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party — that same way many Americans oppose President Donald Trump.

Boy, his progressive counterparts didn't like that one bit.

Flayton said in response they called him an ""apartheid-enabler,"" a ""baby killer"" and a ""colonial apologist.""

'This is our new normal'

""This is our new normal,"" he wrote in his op-ed. ""On college campuses and in progressive circles across the country, it does not matter if you strongly oppose the right-wing leadership in Israel; if you are a Zionist, you are seen as the enemy. It does not matter if you think President Trump is a monster for smearing Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib; I have been branded 'irredeemably problematic on G.W.'s campus because of my unwillingness to unconditionally support their politics. It does not matter if you believe in the right of self determination for all people, including Palestinians; if you still feel a connection to the State of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people, you are on the wrong side of history.""

More from his piece:

This is the reality of being a politically active Jew on many American college campuses. If you call yourself a Zionist because your family fled to Israel from a Middle Eastern country as a means of survival, you are complicit in ethnic cleansing. If you call yourself a Zionist because your family fled Germany to escape a concentration camp, you are a colonialist. If you call yourself a Zionist because your family made aliyah to Israel because of their religious or spiritual beliefs, you are complicit in apartheid.



Progressives believe that words matter, and that words can soften the ground for violence. We also believe that any politics that excludes, ignores or dehumanizes the voices of minorities is a politics that is dangerous for all of us. Do these activists, who have increasing sway beyond the quad, believe that those same considerations should be granted to Jews? I fear the answer to that question.

"Gen Z workers are offended by older people using the 'thumbs up' emoji, which they see as 'hostile' and 'super rude'","Another workplace generational chasm has opened up, this time surrounding the use of the ""thumbs up"" emoji by older people.

The conflict was described in a popular thread on Reddit where members of Generation Z, also known as ""Zoomers,"" relayed how they were confused and offended by the use of the emoji by older people at work.

“For younger people, the thumbs-up emoji is used to be really passive-aggressive,” explained a Redditor.

“It’s super rude if someone just sends you a thumbs up,” the 24-year-old explained. “So I also had a weird time adjusting because my workplace is the same.”

""No one my age in the office does it, but the Gen X people always do it. Took me a bit to adjust and get [it] out of my head that it means they're mad at me,"" said another young contributor to the thread.

A 25-year-old social worker said the thumbs up could appear dismissive to younger people.

“We’re people and we have words to use,” said Kim Law. “If I took the time out to write a thoughtful message then you shouldn’t be responding with the bare minimum. Fix it and write something real back.”

Part of the misunderstanding comes from how younger people use the emoji.

“I only use it sarcastically, though sometimes I’m not even sure if the irony comes across,” said 24-year-old Barry Kennedy to the New York Post.

Business consultant Sue Ellson told the Daily Mail that people should limit their use of the thumbs up emoji to personal interactions and avoid them in business. She also advised that people ask other workers if they're comfortable with the emoji use in order to prevent offending them.

A similar battle arose around the use of the ""crying laughing"" emoji, which was declared uncool by the younger generation.

"Amid George Floyd fallout, prominent pastor refuses to teach adopted son to be suspicious of whites","An Arizona pastor says he refuses to teach his adopted son to be suspicious of white people because the child is a person of color.

Jeff Durbin, a pastor of Apologia Church in Tempe, Arizona, also added that God created him and his son both — and neither are inherently flawed or guilty because of the colors of their skin.

What are the details?

He wrote, ""My son is a miracle. He is also a blend of tribes. He is Iranian and Guatemalan. I love him more than my own life. his differences from me make me happy and I truly celebrate and get excited about them. God has made him so special and I wouldn't want him any different.""

""I despise the modern mindset (shared by many so-called Christians) that want to teach him to be suspicious of his father because he is white,"" Durbin continued. ""I won't allow that division and I will spend my last breath fighting against anyone who wants to teach him that by being the color God made me (or him) means I am (or he is) inherently guilty and condemned.""

""He is,"" Durbin wrote, ""what God made him. And so am I. These colors are beautiful. As beautiful as a field of multi-colored roses. I refuse to lose that precious truth to people who want to replace it with tension hate, conflict, and war.""

Anything else?

According to CBN News, Durbin recently spoke out against the rioting and destruction following the death of George Floyd.

Durbin said that there's no room in the Christian creed for ""adopting the Marxist ideology"" of ""conflict between classes and groups.""

He said, ""When I see people professing the name of Jesus inciting riots and looting and adopting the Marxist ideology of conflict between classes and groups and trying to help with that and trying to put a Christian veneer over it, I wanna say that I am disgusted by it.""



""You can't say you're concerned about the abuse of an image-bearer of God then go about the enterprise of abusing other image-bearers of God,"" he added. ""Doesn't work. Here's the thing — I don't believe you. I don't believe you. I'm not convinced, whatsoever. I see through the lie. I see through the wickedness. And I know the only answer is Jesus.""

""I don't mean that as a pithy, stupid Christian saying,"" Durbin concluded. ""God is holy; we're sinners. We're rebels against a holy God. We deserve hell. And all this stuff you see in our nation right now is an expression of the evil and wickedness that comes from within people's hearts. It's coming from deep down within and the only escape from that is through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ.""

"Georgia-based ‘anti-colonial’ political group accused of kidnapping, arming, and attempting to recruit the homeless","The Black Hammer Party, an anti-capitalist and anti-colonial political group, is currently being investigated for several criminal offenses, including kidnapping and human trafficking, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Tuesday.



Black Hammer leader Augustus Claudius Romain Jr. and a top lieutenant, Xavier “Keno” Rushin, were arrested for alleged participation in a kidnapping and sexual assault case that occurred in July. The crime took place in a home which the group had rented in Fayetteville, Georgia.

Federal and local authorities are also investigating the group for additional drug and weapon offenses. Fayetteville Police Street Gang Investigator Diana Snider testified that she began investigating the Black Hammer Party when she discovered that the group had relocated its headquarters to her town.

Snider was called to testify regarding a kidnapping case in which Romain, 36, and Rushin, 21, were allegedly involved. The victim was a homeless man who claimed that on July 19, the suspects kidnapped him, locked him in a garage, and held him at gunpoint.

Both members have been charged with kidnapping, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, conspiracy to commit a felony, and participation in street gang activity. The defense attorneys for the two group members argued that a political party could not be labeled a street gang.

Snider stated that Romain also forced other members to engage in sexual acts with him to advance their positions within the group. For that accusation, Romain received an additional forcible sodomy charge.

When police arrived at the group's home in July to make the arrest, Romain went live on social media and stated, ""This is just going to build me up at the end of the day,"" reported WSB-TV.

One of the group members, Amonte “AP” Adams, 18, who had been accused of pointing a gun at the alleged kidnapping victim, was found dead inside the Fayetteville home when police went to investigate. Police stated that he appeared to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. However, the Black Hammer Party accused police of shooting Adams.

During her testimony, Snider reported that the FBI had noticed Black Hammer Party members attempting to recruit and arm homeless men in downtown Atlanta. She also noted that federal investigators reported that the group aggressively requested donations from college students in the area. At this point, no charges have been brought against the group regarding those allegations.

In Tampa, Florida, the Black Hammer Party was accused of being involved with a Russian citizen with Kremlin connections. The group was allegedly receiving payments to organize political protests and encourage conflict. The Black Hammer Party was one of several groups named in the indictment.

Snider testified that authorities are investigating additional kidnapping cases that allegedly occurred at the group’s residence.

The Atlantic Journal-Constitution reported that the FBI’s Atlanta office declined to comment on the matter since the investigation is ongoing.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/genz-genx-thumbs-up-emoji,2022-08-18
'I am outraged' — Rudy Giuliani threatens to sue Fox News host who called him an 'unethical disaster',"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani threatened to sue a Fox News host who recommended he be fired from the president's legal team and called him an ""unethical disaster"" in a commentary segment on his show.

Giuliani tweeted about it from his social media account on Monday.

""I have not taken a penny for representing my friend, President Trump,"" said Giuliani.

""I am outraged that @SteveHiltonx reported that I was trying to pursue private business deals in Ukraine to 'enrich' myself, when in reality I have made ZERO in Ukraine! Very lazy reporting!"" he added.



Hilton, who hosts the show ""The Next Revolution"" on Fox News, not only criticized Giuliani, but also other defenders of the president, including reporter John Solomon, and lawyers Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova.

""There is another side to this swamp, and we need to be open about it,"" said Hilton on his show Sunday.

""What's he doing?"" he added, speaking about Giuliani. ""He's going around trying to make business deals out of the Ukraine situation at the same time that he's acting for his client, President Trump. He's trying to make money off of his relationship with President Trump. I don't like that.""

Giuliani said that Hilton's accusation depended on what he saw as false reporting from the New York Times.

""Since representing Trump I have considered and turned down all deals in Ukraine, even those not presenting a conflict,"" he said in a second tweet. He added that his lawyers told him he should sue Hilton for libel.

""If it wasn't for me, @SteveHiltonx wouldn't even be covering Burisma. He sure didn't cover it for the THREE YEARS it was in front of his face. He should apologize for his maliciousness and thank me for the story!"" he said in a third tweet.

Glenn Beck unveils money laundering scheme linked to Hunter Biden and Burisma,"In a Thursday night special, BlazeTV host Glenn Beck laid out the evidence implicating a possible international money laundering scheme linked to Ukrainian gas firm Burisma and former Burisma board member Hunter Biden.

The links provided by Beck show that $1.8 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars sent to Ukraine during the Obama administration is unaccounted for — and raises the question: Why hasn't Congress launched an investigation into how those funds were spent?

What are the details?

During the special, Beck explained that in 2014, $23 million was sent to a bank in London via wire transfer by Mykola Zlochevsky, the head of Burisma. British authorities immediately froze the accounts and began tracing the funds back to their origins.

According to Beck, the evidence suggests that the money had been laundered through the minimally regulated Latvian banking system and transferred into an array of shell companies.

""Not only did Biden not seem to care about his new company being investigated for stealing and laundering money,"" Beck said, ""he also apparently didn't mind that the primary owner of Burisma [Valeriyovych Kolomoyskyi] was on a U.S. visa ban list for — get this — murders and beheadings.""

A few weeks after Burisma was implicated in a money laundering ring, Hunter Biden became a board member, and within a few months, then-Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry lobbied for $1.8 billion to be delivered into PrivatBank — which was owned by Kolomoyskyi and became Ukraine's state bank.



That $1.8 billion is still missing and could have gone anywhere — possibly into Kolomoyskyi's own pocket, or possibly spent in whole or in part to bankroll Ukraine's war with Russia, given that the oligarch was known for ""bankrolling"" the conflict. But if the funds were used to fund a war with Russia, those taxpayer dollars were not authorized by Congress.

The International Monetary Fund has also been investigating corruption and money laundering in Ukraine, and in 2016, the Ukrainian government finally seized PrivatBank from Kolomoyskyi for enriching himself off of IMF loans.

On September 10, 2019, the IMF informed the White House Budget Office that there was an ""obligating event"" that needed to occur in order for Ukraine to receive further IMF funds.



On Sept. 11, police special forces raided PrivatBank, seizing documents and evidence needed to investigate the scheme. The same day, President Donald Trump released military aid to Ukraine.



""Trump wanted a public announcement of 'investigations,' and everyone assumed that he meant an interview on CNN,"" Beck said. ""I'd say a special forces daylight raid on Ukraine's biggest and most corrupt bank is one hell of a public announcement.""

"Google diversity head wrote 'anti-Semitic' blog post saying Jews have 'insatiable appetite for war,' telling them what to think about Israel","The man in charge of Google's diversity strategy is facing heavy criticism for anti-Semitic comments he made in a 2007 blog post about Israel's military actions in Gaza and Lebanon.

Kamau Bobb, Google's global lead for diversity strategy and research, wrote that Jews have an ""insatiable appetite for war"" and an ""insensitivity to the suffering [of] others"" in the blog post, which was surfaced by the Washington Free Beacon on Tuesday. The post, titled ""If I Were A Jew,"" expressed what Bobb, who is not Jewish, believes Jewish people should think and feel about Israel's conflict with the Palestinians.

""If I were a Jew I would be concerned about my insatiable appetite for war and killing in defense of myself,"" he wrote on Nov. 30, 2007, on his personal website. ""Self defense is undoubtedly an instinct, but I would be afraid of my increasing insensitivity to the suffering [of] others. My greatest torment would be that I've misinterpreted the identity offered by my history and transposed spiritual and human compassion with self righteous impunity.""

Bobb, who at the time was a research associate in technology at Georgia Tech, blasted ""fundamentalist Jewish extremists"" and the state of Israel for military actions taken during the nation's 2006 war with Lebanon.

""If I were a Jew today, my sensibilities would be tormented,"" he wrote. ""I would find it increasingly difficult to reconcile the long cycles of oppression that Jewish people have endured and the insatiable appetite for vengeful violence that Israel, my homeland, has now acquired.""

He said that Jewish experience with the Holocaust ought to ""give rise to sympathy and compassion among the oppressed.""

""I don't know how I would reconcile that identity with the behavior of fundamentalist Jewish extremists or of Israel as a nation. The details would confuse me. I wouldn't understand those who suggest that bombing Lebanon, slaughtering Lebanese people and largely destroying Beirut in retaliation for the capture of a few soldiers is justified,"" he wrote.

""I wouldn't understand the notion of collective punishment, cutting off gas, electricity and water from residents in Gaza because they are attacking Israel who is fighting against them. It would be unconscionable to me to watch Israeli tanks donning the Star of David rumbling through Ramallah destroying buildings and breaking the glass,"" he continued.

Bobb also wrote that the memory of Kristallnacht should cause Jews to reject violence but instead he said they have embraced it.

""My reflections on Kristallnacht would lead me to feel that these are precisely the human sentiments that I as Jew would understand; that I ought to understand and feel compelled to help alleviate,"" he wrote. ""It cannot be that the sum total of a history of suffering and slaughter places such a premium on my identity that I would be willing to damn others in defense of it.""

Activists that oppose anti-Semitism criticized Bobb's blog post after the Free Beacon published its story.

""I searched for 'antisemitism' and 'hypocrisy'. Here's what I found. Google Diversity Head @kamaubobb Said Jews Have 'Insatiable Appetite for War'"", Stand With Us Executive Director Michael Dickson wrote on Twitter, sharing the Free Beacon's article.

""Did @Google Google him? He's not fit for this post,"" he added.

In follow-up tweets, Dickson said Bobb's blog post ""makes revolting, and antisemitic, comparisons between Nazi actions and that of the world's only Jewish country. He portrays Jews as bloodthirsty.""

""All of this begs the question whether (1) @Google did due diligence when selecting @kamaubobb for the sensitive position of global Google DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) Director and (2) whether he should remain in these positions,"" Dickson wrote.

The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a global Jewish human rights organization, called on Google to fire Bobb.

Separately, StopAntisemitism.org quoted from Bobb's blog post and demanded to know, ""How is the obscene, antisemitic bigot still employed [at Google]?""

Google and Bobb did not immediately respond to a Free Beacon request for comment.

Google reveals what Americans sought near them on Election Day: french fries and liquor were top choices,"While Americans eagerly awaited the results of the election to roll out on Tuesday, Google says that they sought out french fries and liquor to cope with the stress.

The search results were reported by Google Trends via their official social media account on Tuesday.

Google Trends reported that ""fries near me"" and ""liquor stores near me"" were at all time highs on Election Day.

The social media giant went on to document the foods that were most in demand while Americans waited to find out who would lead the most powerful country in the world.

Pizza, Chinese food, Sushi, and Mexican food were highly sought, and liquor showed up again in the searches.

People also searched on Google for explanations of common election terms, including ""projected winner,"" ""too early to call,"" ""incumbent,"" and ""electoral vote.""

Among those foreign countries where people showed the most interest in the U.S. election, Cuba topped the list, Germany coming in second, and Ethiopia, Iran, and Ghana, in the top five.

Election night dragged on into late Tuesday as confusing and conflicting reports of vote tallies came in from different states. Early Wednesday morning the president announced that he had won big but that Democrats were trying to steal the election, while Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said that he expected to win after the official count was completed.

""I'm here to tell you tonight, I believe we're on track to win this election,"" Biden said in Delaware.

""We knew, because of the unprecedented early vote and the mail-in vote that it was going to take awhile,"" he added. ""We're going to have to be patient until the hard work of tallying votes is finished — and it ain't over until every vote is counted, every ballot is counted.""

GOP senators formally ask Secret Service for records on Hunter Biden,"Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Ron Johnson (Wis.) sent a letter to Secret Service Director James Murray on Wednesday, requesting the agency to provide details on Hunter Biden's use of government security and travel accommodations while conducting business deals during the time his father, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, was vice president.

What are the details?

Grassley is chairman of the Finance Committee, and Johnson heads the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs. The committees are ""reviewing potential conflicts of interest posed"" by Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and China and want to know whether or not those relationships were fostered on the public dime.

1. Please provide the protective detail that Hunter Biden received while his father was Vice President.



2. Please provide a list of all dates and locations of travel, international and domestic, for Hunter Biden while he received a protective detail. In your response, please note whether his travel was on Air Force One or Two, or other government aircraft, as applicable and whether additional family members were present for each trip.

The GOP senators requested that the Secret Service:

The Daily Wire noted that the letter from Grassley and Johnson was sent ""immediately following President Donald Trump's acquittal in the Senate on Wednesday."" The chairmen asked that Director Murray provide the records no later than Feb. 19.

Anything else?

The Senate Finance Committee and Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee have been investigating Biden's foreign business dealings for months, after the impeachment probe against President Donald Trump exposed Biden's contracts with firms in China and Ukraine — where his father represented the United States under the Obama administration.

In their letter Wednesday, Grassley and Johnson wrote that as part of their inquiry, the two committees have already written ""several letters"" to ""other agencies,"" and ""the Committee on Finance also has written to the Department of Treasury regarding potential conflicts of interest"" involving Rosemont Seneca Partners, a company co-founded by Biden and Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry.

In November, the committees requested that the State Department release all records pertaining to the agency's interactions with Biden and his associates during the Obama administration.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/google-diversity-anti-semitic-blog-post,2020-02-06
'What the hell have they been doing?!' — Trey Gowdy excoriates FBI Director Wray's probe into Mike Flynn debacle,"Former congressman Trey Gowdy excoriated the announcement from FBI Director Christopher Wray of an internal probe into the Mike Flynn debacle.

Gowdy made the comments to Martha MacCallum on her Fox News show on Friday.

""It's been four years! What the hell have they been doing?!"" replied Gowdy.

""I mean, this happened in 2016 and 2017 so, I mean it's not like he just learned of the misconduct, we just learned of it, or some of your viewers just learned of it. He's known about it since the day he became the FBI director,"" he added.

Wray announced on Friday the internal inquiry into the conduct of FBI agents in their investigation into former Trump national security advisor Flynn. Critics of the prosecution of Flynn say the Obama administration improperly abused the power of government to punish political opponents.

""So, why now in May of 2020 you are announcing a look back at misconduct in 2016 and 2017, uh, I don't know what's next, I mean, the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, John Wilkes Booth, I mean I don't know what else he's going to look at that happened a long time ago,"" Gowdy continued.

""The time for investigating misconduct is much more contemporaneous than four years!"" he concluded.

Gowdy also opined on the demand from Susan Rice, the former Obama national security advisor, that the unredacted transcripts of Flynn's calls to a Russian ambassador be released. He said that he had seen some of them and that they would be ""boring"" to read.

Lindsey Graham says Democrats threatened to pull aid from Ukraine to pressure them to investigate Trump,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) accused Democrats of threatening to pull aid from Ukraine unless they investigated President Donald Trump in 2018.

The admission came during an interview on Fox News with Martha MacCallum as he defended the president from accusations of impropriety related to a call he made with the Ukrainian president.

MacCallum asked Graham if the quote of the president from the transcript troubled him at all.

""It troubles me that Joe Biden the Vice President of the United States, threatened to cut aid to the Ukraine without disclosing that conflict,"" responded Graham.

""There was a letter by Democratic senators in May 2018 threatening to cut off the aid to the Ukraine if they did not investigate Trump!"" he added. ""You're gonna hear a lot more about this conflict.""

Graham also defended the president from conclusions that his critics reached about an alleged quid pro quo in the transcript of his phone call to the Ukrainian president.

""Read this transcript, no rational person would conclude that the president of the United States was threatening to cut off aid to the Ukraine unless they did something against Joe Biden and his son,"" Graham explained.

""The truth of the matter is, there was a conflict regarding to the firing of the prosecutor, and if it had been a Republican who had done this, it would have been front page news all over the world!"" he concluded.

Democrats have rallied around the accusations from the call with the Ukrainian president in order to bolster their campaign to impeach Trump.

Graham predicts enough GOP votes to call both Bidens and the whistleblower in Senate trial,"If the United States Senate decides to call further witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, they're going to get a lot of them, says a GOP senator who also predicts there will be enough Republican votes to call former Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and the CIA whistleblower to testify.

""If people want witnesses, we're going to get a lot of witnesses. This idea of calling one and one makes zero sense to me,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) warned Tuesday in reference to the possibility of a witness trade-off between Democrats and Republicans.

""I'll make a prediction,"" Graham said. ""There will be 51 Republican votes to call Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, the whistleblower and the DNC staffer at a very minimum.""

""The DNC staffer"" was an apparent reference to Alexandra Chalupa, the former DNC contractor at the center of questions about whether or not the committee colluded with Ukrainian officials in 2016.

Graham made the remarks while briefing reporters in the basement of the U.S. Capitol before the trial resumed Tuesday, against a backdrop of new questions about whether or not the chamber would call former national security adviser John Bolton to testify following reports of allegations contained in a manuscript of his forthcoming book.

As to the allegations reportedly contained in Bolton's manuscript, Graham said that he's read the New York Times' story, saying he had ""no idea what they're talking about."" However, he supported what he called a ""reasonable solution"" proposed by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) to allow senators to read the manuscript's contents in a classified setting.

But Graham also said that he was ""comfortable with the idea I have enough,"" and would make his ultimate decision later in the trial.



""The House chose not to pursue witnesses that were available to them,"" Graham also pointed out, saying that he didn't ""want to start a precedent of just doing half-ass in the House and expecting the Senate to fix it.""

And if a majority of the chamber decides to bring in Bolton or others as witnesses, they're also going to end up looking into the questions about Ukrainian corruption at the center of the impeachment debate and that Democrats have repeatedly tried to dismiss as meritless.

""If we're going to open this up to additional inquiry, we're going to go down the road"" of whether it was ""legitimate for the president to believe there was corruption and conflicts of interest on the Bidens' part in the Ukraine,"" Graham said. ""We'll explore that and whether or not there's any credibility to the idea that the DNC may have been working with the Ukraine.""



Graham also told reporters ""it would have been wrong for President Trump not to raise this issue"" of alleged Biden-Ukraine corruption, and that ""you have to be willfully blind and say that Democratic misconduct doesn't matter to you not to believe that the president had a good reason to ask the Ukraine to look into the Biden affair.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gowdy-rips-into-wray-over-mike-flynn-probe,2020-01-28
Debunked ‘by who’? Graham pushes back on Democrats' talking points about Biden-Ukraine allegations in impeachment trial,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) pushed back against Democrats' claims that the concerns of corruption surrounding the Bidens and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma have somehow been debunked, despite a number of questions that still remain unanswered.

""I don't know how many times it was said by the managers that the Biden conflict-of-interest allegations has been debunked and has been, there's no scintilla of evidence in terms of conflicts of interest and potential wrongdoing,"" Graham told reporters on Thursday.

""I know a lot about the Trump family and their dealings in Russia,"" the senator continued. ""I don't know anything about the Biden connection to the Ukraine. So when the managers tell me this has been looked at and debunked — by who?""

In a break from the trial the day before, Graham tweeted critically about impeachment manager Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) claiming that the Biden-Burisma concerns had been debunked.

Graham explained that the issue was ""becoming relevant"" amid the Senate's trial because the House impeachment managers ""talked about it almost 50 times that the president had no reason to believe that anything improper occurred in the Ukraine with the Bidens and he was just out to create a political advantage.""

Graham questioned whether or not those talking points would hold up to scrutiny.

""The point of fact is that nobody, particularly in your business, has done much looking at what happened in the Ukraine with Hunter Biden,"" Graham said to the media, adding that they would ""hear more about that and I'll tell you more tomorrow.""

Graham then went through a brief chronology of events in the Ukraine, which included the timeline of how Hunter Biden came to work as a board member at Burisma while his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, was handling Ukraine policy for the Obama administration, and how a top prosecutor investigating the case was fired. In 2018, the elder Biden described how he pressured the former Ukrainian president to fire the prosecutor.

The series of events ""doesn't pass the smell test to me"" Graham said. ""Why are you paying Hunter Biden? You can say they're corrupt, but they're not stupid.""

Graham explained that he made the remarks in order to get the public ""to understand that the claims they're making — that there's no 'there' there in the Bidens"" that ""nobody's looked; somebody should.""

Graham — who heads up the Senate Judiciary Committee — is one of a trio of Senate committee chairman who have been looking into the questions of Hunter Biden's Ukrainian business dealings since late last year.

And after looking into the matter himself, the South Carolina senator said that he has ""a lot of questions."" For example, ""Were they buying insurance by hiring Hunter Biden? Because they sure as hell weren't buying expertise.""



However, despite his stated desire to get to the bottom of what really went on in the Biden-Burisma matter, Graham said he would not vote to call Hunter Biden as an impeachment trial witness.

""There are a bunch of people on my side who want to call Joe Biden and Hunter Biden"" to testify in the trial, Graham said. ""I want to end this thing sooner rather than later; I don't want to turn it into a circus.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/graham-accuses-dems-of-extorting-ukraine,2020-01-23
Lindsey Graham responds to Joe Biden’s warning: Hunter’s Burisma employment ‘doesn’t pass the smell test’,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has no intention of backing off his efforts to get to the bottom of questions about former Vice President Joe Biden, his son, Hunter, and the Ukrainian natural gas company that employed the latter on its board for tens of thousands of dollars per month, at least according to a statement Graham made on Monday.

On Friday, Joe Biden, a current presidential candidate, said that he was ""angered"" and ""disappointed"" that Graham — his former Senate colleague — would be looking into his interactions with the Ukrainian government while his son was sitting on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings.

""Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he's going to regret his whole life,"" the 2020 Democratic candidate told CNN. When asked if wanted to say anything directly to Graham, Biden responded, ""I say Lindsay, I'm just embarrassed by what you're doing. For you!""

Graham, however, made it clear that he was going to continue looking into the matter in a tweet sent Monday morning, which said, ""I love Joe Biden as a person but we are not going to give a pass to what is obviously a conflict of interest.

""I believe Hunter Biden's association on the Burisma board doesn't pass the smell test,"" Graham added. ""If a Republican was in the same position, they'd certainly be investigated!""

Questions about Hunter Biden's employment on Burisma's board and Joe Biden's influence on the firing of a top Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the company have been at the center of the Ukrainian controversy and subsequent impeachment fervor that has dominated things in Washington over the past few months.

Graham, who asked the State Department for documents and records related to Burisma and the Bidens on Thursday, is the third Senate committee chairman to start looking into the matter, behind Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), who asked the State Department for records regarding the matter weeks ago.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/graham-predicts-enough-gop-votes-to-call-both-bidens-and-the-whistleblower-in-senate-trial,2019-11-25
Grieving father of slain Atlanta child blasts killers: 'They say black lives matter. You killed your own',"The father of a young girl who was killed near a protest zone in Atlanta denounced the protesters whose violent conflict took his daughter's life over the weekend, WSB-TV reported.

""They say black lives matter,"" Secoriya Williamson, the father of Secoriea Turner, said. ""You killed your own this time. ... You killed a child. She didn't do nothing to nobody.""

Secoriea's mother, Chamaine Turner, broke down as she attempted to speak about her daughter during a press conference.

""She was only 8 years old,"" Turner said, WSB reported. ""She would have been on Tik Tok dancing on her phone, just got done eating. We understand the frustration of Rayshard Brooks. We didn't have anything to do with that. We're innocent. My baby didn't mean no harm.""

Secoriea was shot and killed Saturday night while riding in the car with her mother and one other person in a parking lot near the burned-down Wendy's where Rayshard Brooks was killed weeks earlier.



The site has been the location of protests since Brooks' death, and just before Turner was killed, the driver of the car she was in tried to turn into a parking lot that had been blocked off by protesters. At that point they were confronted by a ""group of armed individuals.""

Someone fired into the car, hitting Secoriea. It's unclear what sparked the gunfire at this time. She died at Atlanta Medical Center.

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Bottoms, who earned national attention for her stern words toward rioters in the wake of George Floyd's death, condemned the shooting and called for an end to the lawlessness.

""Enough is enough,"" Bottoms said, according to WSB. ""If you want people to take us seriously and you don't want us to lose this movement, we can't lose each other.""

Authorities are seeking information from the public about who might be involved in the shooting. Bottoms said there were at least two shooters.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/graham-pushes-back-on-democrats-talking-points-about-biden-ukraine-allegations,2020-07-06
Half of Americans still say the Bible should influence our laws: poll,"The Word of God has long played a role in the United States. It is part of our founding and has influenced much of our laws.

A poll from the Pew Research Center shows that half of Americans still want the Bible to have at least some influence on laws of the U.S. And when the will of the people comes in conflict with the Bible, more than a quarter side with having the Bible hold influence.

What did the poll say?

The survey details posted Monday showed that 49% of all U.S. adults say the Bible should have ""a great deal"" (23%) or ""some"" (26%) influence on laws of the use. The poll also said that 50% of Americans say the Bible should have ""not much"" influence (19%) or ""none at all"" (31%).

Broken down by faith, 68% of Christians, 31% of Jews, and 21% of ""unaffiliated"" — including 4% of atheists — said the Bible should have influence on our laws. Among Christians, 76% of Protestants and 51% of Catholics held this views.

Not surprisingly, when broken down further, white Evangelicals were the most likely group to support Biblical influence on U.S. laws at 89%.

Black Protestants came in second at 76%.

Of course, there was a major discrepancy between the two major political parties. Republicans were twice as likely to say the Bible should have influence on U.S. laws. Two-thirds of Republicans (67%) agreed with that stance, compared to 33% of Democrats (the party that famously ""booed God"" when debating the party platform in 2012).

Age also a played a factor: The older the respondent, the more likely he was so side with keeping the Bible as an influence. Sixty-four percent of adults 65+ held that view, while 30% of adults ages 18-29 said the same.

And when the Bible and the will of the people conflict, what then? Which should have more influence?

"Unhinged hardware store worker shoves customer with bat, throws punches after COVID-19 mask dispute: 'That's not customer service'","It would seem that social distancing wasn't too high up on the COVID-19 protocol list for one Seattle hardware store worker caught on cellphone video shoving a customer with a bat and then throwing punches.

What are the details?

Bobby Dixon told KOMO-TV he and a friend entered Tweedy and Popp Hardware at Lake City to buy screws on Sunday. Dixon said he wore a mask but his friend didn't, the station said, adding that signs posted on the front doors told customers that face coverings were required.

Dixon told KOMO that employees told his friend to mask up or leave — but his friend informed them he was fully vaccinated. The station said employees indicated mask-wearing was a store policy, and then things went downhill fast.

""It was a cussing match back and forth between them,"" Dixon told KOMO.

The station said Dixon's friend turned to go back outside, and Dixon headed for the cash register. But Dixon told KOMO that because the cashier was crude and offensive to him, as he was walking out he decided to stop, turn around, and head back to complain about the poor treatment.

""You work in customer service, and if you're going to be rude, I'm going to take your name down and give it to your boss,"" Dixon added to the station.

Then bat man showed up — which is when the video begins.

""You're going to hit me with that bat? You taunt me with that bat?"" Dixon is heard asking the bat-wielding employee, who ends up shoving Dixon out the door and punching him.

""It was actually quite terrifying,"" Dixon told KOMO. ""I've never had anybody come at me with a weapon like that, and it was flight or fight, and I was trying to get out of there, and he kept coming at me super aggressively.""

Jason Rantz of KTTH-AM said Dixon's friend recorded the video of the fight, which shows Dixon beginning to fight back and landing a kick:

Dixon manages to knock down the employee, and the pair wrestle:

Things soon come to a close, and the employee heads back into the store — but Dixon and his friend continue to exchange words with both store employees.

Here's the clip. (Content warning: Language):

Now what?

KOMO said store employees refused to speak to the station about the incident, and messages left at the corporate offices of Ace Hardware — which supplies the store — were not immediately returned.



The station added that a report was filed with Seattle police, and detectives said they are trying to sort out conflicting versions of the incident. Police told KOMO that the employee they contacted claimed neither customer was wearing a mask. Dixon told the station he had a mask on while inside the store — but the cellphone video shows him not wearing a mask.

In addition, the police report indicates the store employee claimed both men attacked him even though the video shows only Dixon fighting the store employee.

""I wasn't threatening, I never made any threats, and neither did my friend,"" Dixon told Rantz during his KTTH radio show. ""I never touched the dude until he came at me, and I was just trying to defend myself.""

Dixon added to Rantz, ""I wasn't trying to fight. I just kept trying to de-fuse the situation. And you know, you look in the video, he kept just coming towards me, and you even hear me tell him 'stop.'""

According to Rantz, Dixon said he intends to press charges and that the employee ""will have to be terminated.""

""That's not customer service, and that's not acceptable, and Ace Hardware needs to handle that,"" Dixon added to Rantz.

Dixon also said Ace Hardware should release surveillance video from inside the store and that it will prove he's telling the truth, Rantz reported.

""I'm kind of shook up,"" Dixon told Rantz. ""It's kind of humiliating because I'm trying to run a business out here, and it's not a good look for a business owner to be involved in something like that, but I want to clear the air.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/grieving-father-slain-atlanta-child,2021-06-16
VP Harris insists admin is 'singularly focused' on Afghanistan during statement from Singapore while en route to California — to campaign for Gov. Newsom — by way of Vietnam,"Vice President Kamala Harris claimed Monday that the Biden administration is ""singularly focused"" on resolving the unraveling situation in Afghanistan. But the nation's second-in-command won't even be back in Washington until next weekend.

Harris is currently in Singapore on the first leg of her second foreign trip since assuming office. On Tuesday, she'll head to Vietnam — which is ironic since the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan has drawn comparisons to the fall of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War.

Then she's off to Hawaii before finally returning stateside on Friday to focus on domestic policy by assisting Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom in his recall election fight.

But what about the pressing foreign policy catastrophe in Afghanistan where an unknown number of American citizens and legal permanent residents are still trapped, awaiting evacuation as Taliban forces sweep the country? There's plenty of time to address that, Harris claimed.

""I think there's going to be plenty of time to analyze what has happened and what has taken place in the context of the withdrawal from Afghanistan,"" the vice president said Monday during a news conference in Singapore, according to The Hill.



""But right now, we are singularly focused on evacuating American citizens, Afghans who worked with us, and Afghans who are vulnerable, including women and children,"" she insisted.

""There's no question there will be and should be a robust analysis of what has happened. But right now, there is no question that our focus has to be on evacuating American citizens, Afghans who worked with us, and vulnerable Afghans, including women and children. That has to be our primary focus and where we are placing our attention on the issue of Afghanistan,"" she reiterated.

That might be a difficult task to perform out-of-pocket. Nevertheless, Harris's plans to visit California have not been changed to this point.

The Sacramento Bee reported Friday that the vice president is expected to speak at a Newsom campaign rally in the Bay Area this upcoming Friday, where she will urge Californians to vote against the effort to recall the progressive governor.

""I am excited to join my friend and our vice president next week,"" Newsom reportedly said in a statement. ""The stakes of this election couldn't be higher.""

Harris's team confirmed the plans to the Bee.

To make matters worse, Harris undercut her own projected seriousness about the Afghanistan conflict by letting out a characteristic cackle when first questioned about it in Singapore.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/half-of-americans-still-say-the-bible-should-influence-our-laws-poll,2021-08-23
"Harvard Law prof suggests Tucker Carlson, 'Trump media' guilty of treason — then deletes tweets after backlash begins","Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe was forced on Monday to delete suggestions that Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the ""Trump wing"" of the Republican Party are guilty of treason against the United States.

What did Tribe say?

""Led by Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson, the GOP's Trump wing appears to be throwing its weight behind [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. If Putin opts to wage war on our ally, Ukraine, such 'aide and comfort' to an 'enemy' would appear to become 'treason' as defined by Article III of the U.S. Constitution,"" Tribe tweeted Monday morning.

Upon receiving pushback, Tribe claimed he was not using the word ""treason"" in a literal manner, and said ""treason prosecutions should be off the table"" because the U.S. is not at war with Russia.

""I'm persuaded by those who thought I meant to be using the word 'treason' literally — despite my use of the phrase 'would appear to be' — that I should've been more careful: Because we're not at war with Russia, treason prosecutions should be off the table,"" Tribe said. ""Sorry if I mislead you.""

Carlson's critics have accused him in recent weeks of being a stooge for Russia, and even charged that he promoted pro-Russia propaganda.

In reality, Carlson appears to oppose U.S. intervention in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Dismissing Russia's aggressive war build-up and opposing U.S. intervention is not, of course, the same thing as being a pawn for the Kremlin.

What about treason?

Tribe's tweets immediately generated backlash online precisely because the Constitution's treason clause is meant to protect individuals from shallow accusations of treason like the one Tribe floated.

Conservative lawyer David French described Tribe's suggestion as ""completely false"" that is ""not even in the same ballpark as the truth""; lawyer Harmeet Dhillon said that Tribe ""is often wrong, but rarely is he this risible""; First Amendment lawyer Adam Steinbaugh condemned the suggestion of treason, and instructed Tribe to ""please leave these tropes in the past where they belong.""

Here is what the Constitution's treason clause in Article III says:

Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.



The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.

Ironically, the treason clause was designed to protect American citizens from the exact shallow accusations that Tribe put forward.

Constitutional scholars Paul Crane and Deborah Pearlstein explain the treason clause was designed to ""guard against the historic use of treason prosecutions by repressive governments to silence otherwise legitimate political opposition. Debate surrounding the Clause at the Constitutional Convention thus focused on ways to narrowly define the offense, and to protect against false or flimsy prosecutions.""

Because of the Constitution's high standard for treason convictions — along with increased standards determined by subsequent Supreme Court cases — the federal government has never executed an American citizen for treason under Article III.

However, William Bruce Mumford was executed for treason in 1862 — after he tore down an American flag and replaced it with a Confederate flag — but his execution was carried out under provisions of Martial Law, not the Constitution.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hardware-store-worker-shoves-customer-with-bat,2022-02-21
Harvard professor convicted of crimes related to hiding connections to Chinese government,"Harvard University professor Charles Lieber has been convicted of several criminal charges associated with hiding his connections to a recruitment program run by the Chinese government.

Lieber pleaded not guilty to two counts of filing false tax returns, two counts of making false statements, and two counts of failing to file reports for a foreign bank account in China. Lieber was found guilty by a jury on all counts Tuesday, according to Bloomberg.

Lieber's defense attorney Marc Mukasey argued that the prosecution lacked proof that his client committed the crimes of which he was accused.

""If you’re going to blow into somebody’s office, handcuff them behind the back, then 25 agents go to their house and bring the full force of the US government down on them – because you think they made false statements – you better damned well have those statements,” Mukasey said, according to the South China Post.

Lieber was the principal investigator of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University, which received more than $15,000,000 in grant funding from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense. The grants require the full disclosure of any financial conflicts of interest, including foreign governments or foreign entities, according to a press release from the Department of Justice.

The prosecution argued that Lieber hid his involvement in the Chinese government's Thousand Talents Plan from the NIH and his employers at Harvard University. Prosecutors also claim that Lieber kept secret the $50,000 per month and $158,000 in living expenses that he was paid by Wuhan University of Technology in exchange for publishing articles, applying for patents, and organizing international conferences for the University, according to Bloomberg.

The Thousand Talents Plan is a program launched by the Chinese government to recruit researchers with knowledge of technology and intellectual property.

Lieber previously denied the claims, but the prosecution said he was lying to preserve his career.

Lieber's case is one of the most notable cases regarding the U.S. government's ""China initiative."" The China initiative was launched in 2018 by the U.S. Justice Department to combat espionage that would threaten the U.S. economy.

American academics from top universities around the country have asked U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to end the China initiative, claiming that it harms U.S. competitiveness in the field of science and discourages the U.S. from recruiting foreign researchers. In addition to these complaints about the China initiative, academics claim people of Chinese origin are disproportionately targeted by economic espionage investigations, according to Bloomberg.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/harris-travels-to-singapore-vietnam-california-amid-afghanistan-fiasco,2021-12-22
"Heroic football coach shot 10 times while using his body to shield young players from drive-by shooting. Sadly, 1 boy did not survive.","A recent story out of Jacksonville, Florida, demonstrates the courage and selflessness of one young man, just as it demonstrates the horror and devastation caused by criminal violence.

Last Saturday, a young football coach — conflicting reports list him as either 20 or 21 years old — was transporting a handful of players from a tryout held at the Legends Center and Gymnasium in Jacksonville. The coach and four players, ranging in age from 11 to 15, were all in the car. At some point, the car was shattered with bullets from a drive-by shooting, and the heroic coach dove over the players, using his body to protect them from the violence as well as he could.

The coach, whose name has not been released, was shot 10 times in the incident and has since undergone multiple surgeries to address his injuries, his attorney, John Phillips, stated. As of Wednesday, his condition was considered ""critical,"" though whether his condition has changed since then is unclear.

Thankfully, two of the four boys in the car, ages 14 and 15, were uninjured in the attack. However, 13-year-old Prince Holland was shot and killed in the incident, and an 11-year-old boy sustained serious injuries, though he is reportedly expected to recover.

All who knew and loved Prince are heartbroken about his death. His mother, Chantel Brown, has invited the entire community to his memorial service and has requested attendees wear red and gold — the colors of Prince's beloved team, the Kansas City Chiefs — in his honor.

""His little brother cannot see him every day. His big brothers and big sisters cannot see him. I cannot pick up my baby,"" Brown told the crowd of about 100 people at a candlelight vigil held for Prince on Wednesday night. ""That is the hardest thing. I cannot hold him. I cannot kiss him. I cannot even tell him that I love him.""

A family friend identified only as Angel has asked that those who have information about this case come forward to assist in the investigation. ""What if it was your son?"" she asked. ""What if it was your brother? What if it was you? It could have been anybody but instead it was an innocent 13-year-old kid.""



Officials across the state have vowed to find those responsible and give Prince and his family the justice they deserve. Thanks to a $5,000 donation from Phillips and $9,000 from Crime Stoppers, there is currently a $14,000 reward offered to anyone with information leading to an arrest.

""This grief has emboldened us and hardened our resolve,"" said Jacksonville Sheriff T.K. Waters. ""To those responsible for this terrible act, know this: We will not rest, we will not tire, we will not waver.""

""We will not rest until the people responsible are held accountable,"" added Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry.

State Attorney Melissa Nelson has also designated two attorneys from her office ""to focus on these issues and these young men in our community that are committing this violence,"" Waters claimed.

There are currently no suspects in the case.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/harvard-law-prof-suggests-tucker-carlson-trump-media-guilty-of-treason,2022-12-09
Reports: At least 6 killed in air strike targeting Iran-backed militia in Iraq,"Six people were reportedly killed and three wounded in air strikes targeting Iran-backed militia forces in Iraq on Friday, the day after Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. air strike near the Baghdad airport.

At the time of this writing, there are conflicting reports — citing anonymous U.S. officials — over whether the Pentagon ordered the second attack.

What are the details?

Reuters reported Friday that a source in the Iraqi army told the outlet that six burned corpses were found in the wreckage of a convoy north of Baghdad around 1:15 p.m. local time. The vehicles were reportedly carrying members of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias.

The Associated Press reported that an Iraqi government official confirmed the strike on two vehicles, but did not provide information on casualties.

According to the AP, ""an American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity denied the U.S. was behind the reported attack.""

Hours after the AP report was released, Newsweek reported that six Iraqi militia members were killed in a ""second drone strike ordered by President Trump in Baghdad,"" and cited anonymous Pentagon officials who purportedly claimed the Friday attack was targeting pro-Iran militia leader Shubul al-Zaidi.

The Daily Mail reported that Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James Rich (R-Idaho) told Fox News he had been briefed on the second strike north of Baghdad, but declined to comment further until the Pentagon declassified the information.

Mitch McConnell introduces resolution urging President Trump to 'rethink' Syria strategy,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) took to the Senate floor on Tuesday to announce his introduction of a resolution urging President Donald Trump to ""rethink"" his strategy regarding northern Syria, saying it's even stronger than the House resolution of the same vein passed last week.

What are the details?

Sen. McConnell made it clear that he had the support of other top Republican senators, saying in his speech that the measure was backed by Armed Services Committee Chairman James Inhofe (Okla.), Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (N.C.), Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Sen. Jim Risch (Idaho).

Acknowledging the lower chamber's passage of a resolution last week, that condemned the ""abrupt withdrawal of United States military personnel from certain parts of Northeast Syria,"" Sen. McConnell said his resolution goes further.

""I'm introducing a stronger resolution that acknowledges hard truths, and focuses on our strategic interests in the Middle East,"" the Senate Majority Leader said on the Senate floor. ""Our resolution acknowledges the vital role that our Kurdish and Arab Syrian partners have played in rooting out and destroying the ISIS caliphate.

""It condemns Turkey's decision to escalate hostilities in Syria, warns against the abandonment of our allies and partners in Syria and urges President Trump to rethink his invitation for President Erdogan to visit the White House. It also acknowledges Turkey's legitimate national security concerns emanating from the conflict in Syria and the significant risk to the United States if such a strategically consequential ally were to fall further into Moscow's orbit.""

Sen. McConnell continued, ""It recognizes the grave consequences of U.S. withdrawal, the rising influence of Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. And the escape of more than 100 ISIS-affiliated fighters detained in the region,"" adding, with emphasis, ""We specifically urge the president to end — end — the draw-down.""

McConnell also appeared to contradict President Trump on Tuesday, Politico reported, when he denied the president's claim that McConnell told him the much-disputed content of his phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was ""the most innocent phone call I've ever heard.""

"Hollywood director angered after same-sex love scene, the word 'lesbian' edited from in-flight movie","A same-sex love scene and the word ""lesbian"" were edited from in-flight versions of the movie ""Booksmart,"" and director Olivia Wilde called out the company responsible for the changes, according to The Hill.

""Booksmart"" is an R-rated film that, even in edited form, included curse words, but cut out the love scene and other dialogue about lesbian sex acts that included the words ""vagina"" and ""genitals."" Wilde pointed to what she feels is an inconsistent standard for what constitutes inappropriate content.

Airlines enlist the services of either movie studios or third-party companies that provide the airline with both an edited and unedited version of movies, to be used at the airline's discretion. Delta, Emirates, and Etihad Airlines have been confirmed to have shown the edited version.

""First of all, in order to select this movie from hundreds of options, you have to agree to a 'parental advisory' that warns you that viewer discretion is advised,"" Wilde wrote on Twitter. ""Once you click 'proceed' it seems like you've agreed to watch the movie in its original form.""

Wilde found out that's not the case, however, going on to list some content that was removed, including some apparently sexually explicit or suggestive scenes.

""By the way, they didn't cut ANY cursing,"" Wilde continued. ""Every 'f***' is heard loud and clear, sometimes in the same scene where they muted 'vagina.' They showed George (elegantly) deep-throating a microphone but couldn't stomach a consensual love scene between two women.

""What message is this sending to viewers and especially to women? That their bodies are obscene? That their sexuality is shameful?"" Wilde asked.

Delta Air Lines denied that the sexuality of the movie characters had anything to do with the use of the edited version of the movie on their flights.

""Delta's content parameters do not in any way ask for the removal of homosexual content from the film. We value diversity and inclusion as core to our culture and our mission and will review our processes to ensure edited video content doesn't conflict with these values,"" a statement said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hold-breaking-reports-say-5-killed-in-air-strikes-targeting-iran-backed-militia-in-iraq,2019-10-31
Former US women's goalkeeper says Megan Rapinoe would 'bully' teammates into kneeling during the anthem,"In recent years, the United States women's soccer team has become more widely recognized for its pregame political posturing than for its dominance on the field — and now one former team member is going public with criticism for the way things have operated.

What are the details?

In a podcast interview Monday, former U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo opened up about the palpable internal conflict on the team during her time as a member, specifically calling out forward Megan Rapinoe for pressuring others to comply with her progressive activism.

""I think the rhetoric surrounding this team has been both divisive and inclusive. I guess it's kind of where we are in politics in this day and age,"" Solo told Goal.com on ""All of Us: The U.S. Women's Soccer Show.""

""I think the kneeling thing can be very divisive,"" she continued. ""I've seen Megan Rapinoe almost bully players into kneeling because she really wants to stand up for something in her particular way.""

""I think that's really hard being on the main stage right now with so many political issues for athletes, there's a lot of pressure,"" she added.

What's the background?

Rapinoe and several of her teammates on the women's national team have adopted the practice of kneeling during the national anthem when it is played before games as a form of political protest. She and others have also been outspoken on a number of other issues, including equal pay for female athletes.

Until now, there haven't been any reports of forced kneeling or backlash against those who chose not to join in the protest, though it's true that a large majority of players have knelt when permitted. Solo appeared to indicate that at least some form of pressure to conform was present.

The team's brash activism has drawn scrutiny from many fans. During the Tokyo Olympics last month, fellow Americans admitted they rooted against the team during the tournament and actually cheered their semifinal loss to Canada.

Anything else?

Solo has not been a member of the team since 2016, but she and Rapinoe played together for 10 years prior to that, beginning in 2006. The pair won a World Cup and two Olympic gold medals together in that span.

The goalkeeper ended up withdrawing from the team and retiring after off-field incidents damaged her reputation. Solo was arrested in 2014 and charged with assaulting two of her family members. Then in 2016, she was suspended by the U.S. national team after calling the Swedish national team a ""bunch of cowards"" following a face-off in the Olympics.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hold-mitch-mcconnell-introduces-resolution-urging-president-trump-to-rethink-syria-strategy,2021-08-17
House minority report: 'Plausible' that Chinese military possessed COVID-19 prior to pandemic 'as part of bioweapons research',"A congressional investigation into the origins of COVID-19 has raised the possibility that over 1 million Americans and tens of millions of people worldwide died as a result of bioweapons research conducted by elements of the Chinese military (the People's Liberation Army) with the help of U.S. federal grant money.

In their interim report released Wednesday, Republican members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that it is ""plausible"" that Chinese military researchers possessed the COVID-19 virus ""as part of bioweapons research"" prior to its release into the world as a consequence of a safety incident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

The report also suggested that there is ""reason to believe that the [intelligence community] downplayed the possibility"" that the virus was linked to China's bioweapons program.

What are the details?

Several House Republicans issued a joint statement on Wednesday, claiming the minority interim report's ""findings identify more culpability from the Chinese Communist Party, highlight the failures of the Intelligence Community to share pertinent information with the American public and their authorized representatives, and give more credibility to the lab leak theory – which many government officials, Big Tech platforms, and media outlets were quick to label a 'conspiracy theory.'""

The minority report claimed that in ""direct contrast to media skepticism in the early days of the pandemic, the scientific community now largely accepts as feasible that the COVID-19 pandemic may have emerged from a lab-related event involving Chinese scientist experimenting with coronaviruses.""

On the basis of both classified and previously glossed-over declassified intelligence, ""there are indications that SARS-CoV-2 may have been tied to China's biological weapons research program and spilled over to the human population during a lab-related incident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).""



According to the report, it is ""plausible"" that:

General Zhou Yusen's team of Academy of Military Medical Sciences Fifth Institute researchers ""already possessed SARS-CoV-2 prior to the pandemic as part of bioweapons research"";

this PLA-linked team ""was working on vaccine-related experiments involving the virus at the WIV in 2019""; and

""a safety incident at the WIV led to its release into the world (presumably amplified by a super-spreader event at the Huanan Wet Market).""

Zhou, a Chinese military scientist, is said to have worked extensively on coronaviruses in concert with the WIV for years.

The Australian indicated that as ""far back as 2004, the PLA-trained scientist was experimenting with spike proteins in coronaviruses – the point of their infectivity that is often subject to manipulation and gain-of-function research.""

Prior to the pandemic, Zhou and other PLA researchers partnered with WIV scientists on a paper entitled, ""Molecular Mechanism for Antibody-­Dependent Enhancement of Coronavirus Entry,"" submitted to the Journal of Virology on Nov. 27, 2019.

The New York Post reported that Zhou, who received funding from the National Institutes of Health, filed a patent for a COVID-19 vaccine in February 2020, prompting fears that ""the shot was being studied even before the pandemic became public.""

Zhou also happened to die under mysterious circumstances just months later. Despite having been a decorated PLA scientist, he received no posthumous tribute or award, which, according to the Post, amplified intrigue.

Not only has the Chinese Communist Party reportedly admitted that the AMMS — from which Zhou's Fifth Institute team hailed — conducts bioweapons research and coronavirus experiments, it has additional links to the Wuhan lab.

For instance, Colonel Cao Wuchun is listed on a number of WIV project reports as a researcher from the AMMS, reported the Daily Mail.

Although the committee now regards Chinese bioweapons research linked both to the AMMS and the WIV as a plausible cause of the pandemic, it ""has not seen any indications that the Chinese military intentionally released SARS-CoV-2.""

Committee member Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) underscored that the report shows ""how that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) bears more responsibility for the COVID-19 pandemic than what has been publicly known or transparently communicated to the American people.""

The House Republicans Twitter account wrote, ""In 19 days the new House Republican majority will hold Communist China accountable.""

Intelligence community 'downplayed' China's potential responsibility

While the Chinese communist regime has unsurprisingly ""not been transparent in sharing information,"" the report suggested that the American intelligence community, too, has ""thus far failed to inform the public and failed to keep its Congressional oversight committees fully informed about what it knows.""

Despite previous claims that the IC reached a ""broad agreement"" that COVID-19 was not developed as a bioweapon, the report contended that the IC had done so without rating its confidence in that assessment as it had with virtually every other claim in its declassified ""Updated Assessment on COVID-19 Origins.""

The IC document referenced in the report stated, ""We remain skeptical of allegations that SARS-CoV-2 was a biological weapon because they are supported by scientifically invalid claims, their proponents do not have direct access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), or their proponents are suspected of spreading disinformation.""

The minority report claimed the IC ""has denied Congressional oversight of the analytic integrity of its Updated Assessment, particularly its heavy reliance on outside experts who may have had conflicts of interest.""



The IC's skepticism might be based upon the counsel of ""outside experts"" who may be partly culpable for helping set the stage for the pandemic.

Since the IC reportedly failed to turn over its list of outside experts, it is presently unclear if the scientists the report claimed had funneled U.S. Department of Health and Human Services grant money to potential PLA bioweapons researchers at the AMMS Fifth Institute ""were among the experts the IC consulted regarding COVID-19's origins.""

According to the report, the IC ""has ignored dozens of oral and written requests from Committee Members on the subject and to date has shown no interest in fully cooperating with the Committee.""

Wenstrup said that by allegedly withholding ""key information from the American public's authorized elected officials,"" the IC has deepened public mistrust.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hollywood-director-angered-after-same-sex-love-scene-the-word-lesbian-edited-from-in-flight-movie,2022-12-15
House Oversight Republicans give HHS a Feb. 16 deadline to turn over docs on funding for Wuhan lab and Fauci emails,"House Oversight Committee Republicans on Wednesday called on the Biden administration to hand over documents related to federal grant money provided to EcoHealth Alliance that was sub-awarded to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for bat coronavirus research.

A letter signed by Ranking Member Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) and the other committee Republicans invoked federal law to have the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services turn over the documents, which they had previously requested in July. That request went unanswered, the Republicans said.

“A series of events documented in communications from February to April 2020 raise serious concerns about conflicts of interest and abuse of government resources,” the letter states.

“Rather than be transparent with Committee Republicans, HHS and NIH have chosen to hide, obfuscate, and shield the truth. This stonewalling is particularly troubling considering NIH’s direct involvement in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the agency’s policy or practice to destroy potentially pertinent documents related to grant making decisions,"" they asserted.

The letter was first reported by Henry Rodgers for the Daily Caller.

EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit group that supports virus research across the globe, has received millions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer funding for coronavirus research in China as well as many other projects. Between 2014 and 2019, the group provided $600,000 in NIH subgrants to the Wuhan lab to study bat coronaviruses. Those grants have become controversial as evidence emerged that the Wuhan lab was possibly involved in risky experiments that artificially make viruses more transmissible among mammals and potentially among humans.



The Wuhan Institute of Virology is located just 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where scientists initially believed the first outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic happened. Officials from the Wuhan lab later claimed that the virus originated elsewhere and the market was the site of a super-spreader event. But questions remain over the virus' origins, including whether the virus was somehow leaked from the lab as a result of experiments there — a claim disputed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Francis Collins, the former director of the National Institutes of Health, and other prominent scientists and public officials.

The letter notes that the NIH had failed to produce documents on the 2014 grant sub-awarded to the Wuhan lab after multiple inquiries from lawmakers. The Republicans also raised concerns over Fauci's emails, which indicated that in early 2020, top government officials were warned of the possibility of a lab leak causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Fauci and other top officials would go on to vigorously deny that the Wuhan lab, which received U.S. taxpayer funding, played a role in the origins of the pandemic.

Republicans say the NIH and HHS need to provide documents to answer some of the unresolved questions surrounding taxpayer funding for the Wuhan lab. They have also requested unredacted copies of Fauci's emails to be made available to the committee.

“By continuing to refuse to cooperate with our request, HHS and NIH are choosing to hide information that will help inform the origins of the ongoing pandemic, prevent future pandemics, strengthen the United States’ national security posture, and restore confidence in our public health experts and infrastructure,"" the letter says.

""The agencies’ continued obstruction is likely to cause irreparable harm to the credibility of these institutions. By providing the requested documents and information, HHS and NIH will have the opportunity to help our country move forward in a positive, transparent direction following the COVID-19 pandemic,” the lawmakers wrote.

The NIH and HHS were given a Feb. 16 deadline to respond.

"Reports: House Republicans confident Liz Cheney will be ousted from leadership, discussing her replacement","UPDATE (5/4/2020 at 3:25 p.m.):

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was caught on hot mic Tuesday saying he's ""lost confidence"" in Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wy.).

""I think she's got real problems,"" McCarthy reportedly told Fox News host Steve Doocy off-air just before he was interviewed live on ""Fox & Friends"". ""I've had it with ... I've had it with her. You know, I've lost confidence. ... Well, someone just has to bring a motion, but I assume that will probably take place.""

His comments appear to confirm reports that his working relationship with Cheney has deteriorated and that House Republicans may move to oust Cheney from GOP leadership.

Original Story Below:



House Republicans are inching closer to forcing House GOP Conference Chairman Liz Cheney (Wyo.) from her leadership position, with some so confident she will be removed that several congresswomen are being discussed to replace her, according to multiple reports.

""Liz is gone. Just a question of how and when,"" one Republican lawmaker told CNN on condition of anonymity.

Among those being discussed to succeed Cheney as the No. 3 Republican in the House are Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.), and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), Axios reported Tuesday.

Tensions are running high in the GOP conference as several lawmakers are fed up with Cheney's vocal criticism of former President Donald Trump, believing her to be a ""liability"" who is taking Republicans off-message ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.

Recently, Cheney told the New York Post that ""the senators who led the unconstitutional charge"" to challenge the Electoral College results on Jan. 6 had committed a ""disqualifying"" offense and should be left out of consideration for the 2024 presidential nomination. She made those remarks at a policy retreat in Florida, where House Republicans had intended to gather to discuss strategy and develop a cohesive and unified message to bring to the American people.

This week, she accused the former president of ""poisoning our democratic system"" by continuing to insist the results of the 2020 presidential election were illegitimate, calling Trump's claims that the election was stolen ""THE BIG LIE.""

Cheney's repeated insistence that the party must move on from Trump has put her in conflict with other lawmakers who recognize the party base is still firmly in Trump's corner and fear alienating Trump's supporters could keep them from winning congressional majorities in 2022.

In the strongest sign yet that Cheney's future in leadership is in doubt, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) acknowledged Tuesday that her ""ability to carry out the job as conference chair"" has become a concern among several members of the GOP caucus.

""I have heard from members concerned about her ability to carry out the job as conference chair, to carry out the message,"" McCarthy said on ""Fox & Friends."" ""We all need to be working as one if we're able to win the majority. Remember, majorities are not given, they are earned. And that's about the message about going forward.""

In response, a spokesman for Cheney released a statement, saying: ""This is about whether the Republican Party is going to perpetuate lies about the 2020 election and attempt to whitewash what happened on Jan 6. Liz will not do that. That is the issue.""

Previously, McCarthy had defended Cheney from an attempt by some conservative lawmakers to force her out of leadership in retribution for her vote to impeach former President Donald Trump. But as Cheney has continued to attack the former president and her relationship with McCarthy has frayed, the GOP leader's allies have begun hinting to the media that her time in leadership will be over before the month's end.

As for who could replace Cheney in leadership, both Axios and Punchbowl News have reported there is a ""consensus"" opinion that a woman must succeed Cheney if she is tossed out.

In response to those reports, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) issued a statement mocking Republicans for seeking a ""non-threatening female"" to serve under McCarthy and Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.).

""Word is out that House GOP Leaders are looking to push Rep. Liz Cheney from her post as House Republican Conference Chair – their most senior woman in GOP leadership – for a litany of very Republican reasons: she won't lie, she isn't humble enough, she's like a girlfriend rooting for the wrong team, and more,"" Pelosi's office said.

The House Republican conference will meet Wednesday, May 12. It would take a two-thirds vote by secret ballot to remove Cheney from leadership.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-minority-report-plausible-that-chinese-military-possessed-covid-19-prior-to-pandemic-as-part-of-bioweapons-research,2021-05-04
"If black people had rioted on Jan. 6 at Capitol, there would have been a 'vastly different' law enforcement response, House sergeant at arms says","House Sergeant at Arms William Walker said if black people had rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, a ""vastly different response"" from law enforcement would have taken place, The Hill reported.

Walker led the D.C. National Guard during the Jan. 6 rioting and gave his assessment to the House Jan. 6 panel in April, the outlet said, citing a transcript released this week.

“I’m African-American. Child of the sixties. I think it would have been a vastly different response if those were African-Americans trying to breach the Capitol,” Walker said, according to The Hill.

He added that ""as a career law enforcement officer, part-time soldier, last five years full-time, but a law enforcement officer my entire career, the law enforcement response would have been different,” the outlet said.

More from The Hill:

The House panel as part of its investigation examined why it took hours for the Pentagon to eventually send the National Guard to the Capitol as the calamity unfolded.



The committee concluded in its final report that no Pentagon officials deliberately held off on sending the Guard, but rather conflicting messages caused a delay, placing the blame on then-President Trump.



Walker indicated he did not receive a call from the Defense secretary or secretary of the army as rioters began breaching the Capitol, drawing a comparison to the summer of 2020, when Walker said Pentagon officials “constantly” called him to discuss the racial justice protests that unfolded following the killing of George Floyd.

“I think the response would have been different, a lot more heavy-handed response to, I think there would have been a lot more bloodshed,” Walker added, according to the outlet. “You know, as a law enforcement officer, there were — I saw enough to where I would have probably been using deadly force.”

He also said, “You’re looking at somebody who would get stopped by the police for driving a high-value government vehicle. No other reason,” The Hill reported, adding that Walker also noted, ""I’ve had to talk with my five children, and getting ready to have it with my granddaughter, the talk. I don’t know if you know what I mean by the talk, of what to do to survive an encounter with the police.”

Former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving resigned the day after the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol. The Hill said Walker replaced Irving in April.

Anything else?

A group of House Republicans released a damning report last week saying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrat leaders played a critical role in creating the Capitol security plan that ultimately failed Jan. 6.

In fact, Irving at the time ""succumbed to political pressures from the Office of Speaker Pelosi and House Democrat leadership,"" the report said, adding that he coordinated ""closely with the Speaker and her staff and left Republicans out of important discussions related to security"" that Pelosi ""micromanaged.""

""Rather than coordinate in a meaningful way, Irving only provided information to Republicans after receiving instruction from the Speaker's office. In one case, Irving even asked a senior Democratic staffer to 'act surprised' when he sent key information about plans for the Joint Session on January 6, 2021 to him and his Republican counterpart,"" the report said.

While Pelosi has said she has no power over Capitol Police, the report contradicted that.

“This is false,” the report said, according to the New York Post. “Documents provided by [current] House Sergeant at Arms show how then-House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving carried out his duties in clear deference to the Speaker, her staff, and other Democratic staff ... House Rules dictate ... that the Sergeant at Arms is to report directly to the Speaker of the House.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-oversight-republicans-hhs-deadline-docsfunding-wuhan-lab-fauci-emails,2022-12-29
House votes to repeal 2002 Iraq War authorization in effort to reclaim congressional war powers,"The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of revoking the 2002 authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) on Thursday, in a move aimed at returning war powers to Congress that were ceded to the president following 9/11.

What are the details?

The effort, led by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), passed 268-161, with 49 Republicans joining all but one Democrat in voting for the repeal. Proponents argue that the authorization granted under President George W. Bush — for the purpose of military engagement in Iraq — has been abused by occupants of the Oval Office since its passage 19 years ago and utilized to extend far beyond its original purpose.

""Three presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have used this permission to drag out conflicts that will get us into new ones,"" Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) said on the House floor prior to voting in favor of the legislation, The Washington Post reported.

Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), another proponent, argued, ""Repeal is crucial because the executive branch has a history of stretching"" [the authorization's legal authority], the Chicago Sun-Times reported. ""It has already been used as justification for military actions against entities that had nothing to do with Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist dictatorship simply because such entities were operating in Iraq.""

The New York Post reported that Lee told her colleagues, ""Once we pass a repeal of the 2002 AUMF, we must keep up our fight to repeal the 2001 AUMF so that no future president has the unilateral power to plunge us into endless wars.""

""We can't afford to leave this in place indefinitely,"" she added. ""For two decades, it has been in place. This is our opportunity to restore our constitutional role.""

The New York Post reported that opponents of the measure argued that repealing the 2002 AUMF ""could hinder US counterterrorism efforts, noting it was used as part of the legal rationale that allowed President Donald Trump's administration to move forward with the January 2020 drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.""

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said on the floor, ""This feels like yet another political effort to undo one of President Trump's boldest counterterrorism successes: using the 2002 AUMF to remove Soleimani from the battlefield. Soleimani was Iran's mastermind of terror for decades.""

President Joe Biden voted in favor of the AUMF as a senator in 2002, but has since expressed his regret for doing so. The White House supports the repeal effort passed by the House.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-republicans-sure-liz-cheney-ousted,2021-06-18
Hunter Biden reportedly still owns a stake in Chinese private equity firm co-owned by the Bank of China,"Hunter Biden purportedly still owns a stake in a Chinese private equity firm, despite scrutiny about his overseas business dealings. Hunter joined the board of BHR Partners in 2013, when it was created.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in August 2019 that ""BHR was formed in November of 2013 by a merger between the Chinese-government linked firm, Bohai Capital, and a company named Rosemont Seneca Partners,"" which was co-founded by Hunter.

Previously reported by TheBlaze:



In 2015, BHR, in partnership with the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, acquired the U.S. auto company Henniges Automotive for $600 million. Henniges produces technologies that have military applications. The Aviation Industry Corporation of China has been suspected in the past of hacking U.S. networks to steal military airplane designs for their own use.

BHR Partners, which manages over $2.3 billion in assets, is co-owned by the Bank of China, which is one of the four biggest state-owned Chinese banks.

More on BHR from Fox News:



BHR was named as one of China's top 10 Mergers & Acquisitions funds in 2017 by Equity Investment Association of China (EIAC) and the Beijing Private Equity Association (BPEA). BHR went on to receive ""top honors"" at the 2017 China Venture Awards, which also named the CEO Jonathan Li as one of China's ""Top 10 M&A Investors 2016.""

In October 2019, Biden announced that he was stepping down from the board of BHR, and his lawyer claimed that there was no wrongdoing that prompted that decision.

""Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies,"" George Mesires said in his statement.

At the time, presidential candidate Joe Biden applauded his son's decision by saying it ""represents the kind of man of integrity he is and what in fact he has done and why he stepped down.""

""He's decided that he does not think that is good to do. He has said that he does not like the appearance of it,"" Joe Biden said, ABC News reported.

Biden added that there would be no conflicts of interest in his administration. ""No one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in at meetings as if they're a cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country. Period. Period. End of story,"" Joe Biden said in the ABC News report.

A new report from the Daily Caller claims that Hunter still owns his stake in the Chinese firm. The report found that Hunter continues to hold a 10% stake in the firm through his company, Skaneateles LLC, where he is the sole beneficial owner, according to Washington corporate records. The report was based on corporation records filed with China's National Credit Information Publicity System through Qixinbao and Baidu, independent services that provide Chinese market research.

In late December, there were reports from the Daily Mail and Fox News that Hunter was in the process of unloading his stake in BHR, according to an unnamed source familiar with Hunter Biden's business dealings.



In December 2019, Joe Biden pledged that his family would not be involved in overseas business dealings.

""They will not be engaged in any foreign business because of what's happened in this administration,"" Biden said in an interview with ""Axios on HBO,"" while taking a shot at then-President Donald Trump. ""No one's going to be seeking patents for things from China. No one's going to be engaged in that kind of thing. If you want to talk about problems, let's talk about Trump's family.""

Hunter Biden has been scrutinized for his business relationship with foreign companies, especially CEFC China Energy and Ukrainian gas company Burisma, which he was a board member of.

Federal agents reportedly obtained a FISA warrant against Hunter Biden's Chinese business partner,"Federal investigators reportedly obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against one of Hunter Biden's Chinese business partners in 2018, the Daily Caller reported Wednesday.

What are the details?

The revelation came from a Feb. 8, 2018, court filing obtained by the news outlet in which prosecutors provided a notice of intent to Chi Ping Patrick Ho, also known simply as Patrick Ho, that they were prepared to use information obtained from the FISA warrant surveillance against him in court. Here's what the notice of intent said:

The United States, through its attorney Geoffrey S. Berman, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, hereby provides notice to defendant Chi Ping Patrick Ho, a/k/a Patrick C. P. Ho,"" a/k/a ""He Zhiping,"" and to the Court, that pursuant to Title 50, United States Code, Sections 1806(c) and 1825(d), the United States intends to offer into evidence, or otherwise use or disclose in any proceedings in the above-captioned matter, information obtained or derived from electronic surveillance and physical search conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), as amended, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1812 and 1821- 1829.

Before being arrested in November 2017 for money laundering and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Ho served as a top executive for CEFC China Energy Co. and at the time was allegedly in the process of brokering a partnership between the multibillion dollar company and a business group involving Hunter Biden and his uncle, James Biden.

According to the Department of Justice, Ho would be convicted for his role in a ""multi-year, multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe top officials of Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages"" and sentenced to serve three years in prison.

What else?

But what may be of more interest to U.S. readers is that during the same time that Ho was standing trial in the Southern District of New York, CEFC affiliates had wired $5 million to Biden's law firm, according to a Senate report released last month.

The Senate report also noted that — as described in a 2019 report from the New Yorker — not only did Biden maintain a business partnership with CEFC, but he also agreed to represent Ho in court at the request of CEFC's founder and former chairman, Ye Jianming. Then in March 2018, a shell company affiliated with CEFC called Hudson West III wired $1 million to Biden's law firm, Owasco, for ""Dr Patrick Ho Chi Ping Representation.""

Biden's relationship with Ye has also raised eyebrows due to Ye's connection with the People's Liberation Army, China's military. Not to mention the fact in February 2018, Ye was detained by Chinese authorities as a part of a supposed anti-corruption probe.

According to the New Yorker report, Biden said he didn't consider Ye to be a ""shady character at all"" and characterized the situation as ""bad luck.""

Anything else?

Despite his insistence to the contrary, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has come under intense scrutiny over his alleged involvement in his son's overseas business dealings, including the botched partnership with CEFC.

Email exchanges first reported by the New York Post and later verified by former Hunter Biden associate Tony Bobulinski, appear to show that Joe Biden would receive kickbacks from the deal.

""10 held by H for the big guy?"" one email said. Bobulinski would later claim that ""the big guy"" was in fact Joe Biden.

Bobulinski has also alleged that he met face-to-face with Joe Biden about the partnership in May 2017 in Los Angeles and that the former vice president was well aware of the details.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-votes-to-repeal-2002-iraq-war-authorization-in-effort-to-reclaim-congressional-war-powers,2020-10-28
Hunter Biden's legal team withdraws from his child support lawsuit,"Hunter Biden's legal team filed paperwork saying that Biden — who was a no-show for a Monday court hearing — unexpectedly fired them.

Biden, 49, is currently embroiled in a paternity case. Lunden Alexis Roberts, 28, filed a paternity lawsuit in Arkansas against Biden after she gave birth to their child in 2018. She is seeking child support, as well as over $11,000 in attorney's fees and court costs.

What are the details?

According to a Page Six report, Biden's attorneys filed a motion withdrawing from his case just moments prior to his scheduled appearance at a paternity hearing to determine child support.

Former Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel as well as two co-counsels stated an ""irreconcilable conflict"" in the motion. Biden's personal attorney also reportedly ""advised undersigned counsel of discharge.""

Roberts was present at the hearing.

During the hearing, Arkansas Judge Don McSpadden ordered Biden and Roberts to submit financial records ahead of an upcoming Jan. 7 hearing.

In November, Biden — who initially denied paternity of Roberts' child — requested that the court keep his financial records sealed.

Biden requested that the court seal the records over fears of ""embarrassment.""

According to the filing, the ""likelihood that [Biden's] private records will be used in an inappropriate or malicious manner for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with these proceedings is exceedingly high and should not be tolerated by the court.""

A signed statement also noted that Biden is unemployed and hasn't had income since earlier in the year.

""In an effort to demonstrate to this court my good faith, I attest that I am unemployed and have had no monthly income since May 2019,"" Biden's statement read.

Hunter Biden's business group shopped Joe Biden's influence in Colombia in an investment pitch to Chinese energy firm: Report,"Hunter Biden's business group highlighted former Vice President Joe Biden's influence in Colombia in 2017 when seeking a $10 million deal with a Chinese energy firm that sought oil investments in the South American country, the Daily Caller reported Tuesday.

The news appears to further corroborate claims made last week by former Hunter Biden business associate, Tony Bobulinski, who alleged that the Biden family ""aggressively leveraged"" their family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities, including from communist China.

What are the details?

Included in a 42-page investment proposal sent from Hunter Biden's group, EEIG, to the Chinese firm, CEFC China Energy, is a picture of Joe Biden shaking Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos' hand with a blurb about the United States' newfound ""pragmatic"" relationship with Colombia under the Obama administration.

""The relationship between Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos and Joe Biden has been a strong one throughout the Obama administration,"" reads the document, which was obtained by the Daily Caller.

""With this in mind, EEIG has built the framework for partnership between CEFC China and local partners in Colombia, with a solid basis starting at the very foundations of the country's administration,"" it continued.

The photo of Biden and Santos along with the description of their relationship can be found on pages 27 and 28 of the document.

The sales proposal would go on to list several ""target opportunities"" for the partnership, which included investing in both an oil field and a port in Colombia, as well as other opportunities in Oman, Romania, and Luxembourg.

According to the Daily Caller, the investment proposal is part of ""a trove of records"" held by Bobulinski and since turned over to a Senate committee investigating Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings.

What's the background?

Hunter Biden's group, which included his uncle, James Biden, Bobulinski, and three other businessmen — eventually called SinoHawk — ended up not doing business with CEFC China Energy. But according to a Senate report, the firm did secure a separate deal with Hunter and James Biden.

The Senate report said that ""on Aug. 8, 2017, CEFC Infrastructure Investment wired $5 million to the bank account for Hudson West III,"" Hunter Biden's law firm.

The report also noted a significant extortion and counterintelligence risk over the deal, since CEFC's chairman, Ye Jianming, reportedly has ties to the China's military, the People's Liberation Army.

After seeing the report, Bobulinski claimed that it ""connected some dots in a way that shocked me — it made me realize the Bidens had gone behind my back and gotten paid millions of dollars by the Chinese, even though they told me they hadn't and wouldn't do that to their partners.""

Bobulinski, in a video announcement last week, claimed that Joe Biden was directly involved in the business dealings with CEFC.

"Hunter Biden may still be a board member of Chinese firm he vowed to step down from, records show","Hunter Biden, son of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, promised to step down from the board of Chinese firm BHR Partners. However, the Daily Caller News Foundation reported that Hunter Biden is still listed as a director in Chinese business records, indicating that he may not have followed through on his promise.

What Hunter Biden said he would do: In a statement issued by his lawyer, Biden said he would step down in October from the firm to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest in the event his father was elected president.



""To date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR's board of directors,"" the statement read. ""He has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest. Moreover, Hunter played no role in directing or making BHR's investments. Hunter intends to resign from the BHR board of directors on or by October 31, 2019.""

Hunter Biden also promised not to serve on any foreign boards if Joe Biden became president.

What the records show: China's National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System still shows Hunter Biden as a director for BHR. And it doesn't appear that his inclusion is due to lack of updates, because it reflects a March 24 change showing the resignation of Eric Schwerin, a business partner of Biden's, according to the DCNF.

Qixinbao, a service that provides registration info about Chinese companies, also shows Biden as a BHR board member.



Hunter Biden still holds a 10% share in BHR through his own company, Skaneateles.

Why this matters: Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, which date back to his father's time as vice president, have created the appearance of potential corruption in Ukraine with Burisma, and in China with BHR. Biden's promise to step down from BHR is an apparent acknowledgment of the bad optics. Hunter arranged for his father to meet with BHR's CEO in 2013 during a trip to China, just a few months after BHR was formed.



With Joe Biden the presumptive presidential nominee, questions about Hunter Biden's activities, as well as Joe Biden's knowledge and involvement, take on greater significance.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-legal-team-withdraws-from-child-support-lawsuit,2020-04-15
"Hunter Biden to step down from Chinese company, refrain from foreign work if father is elected","Hunter Biden, son of former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, said via statement Sunday morning that he will step down from the board of a Chinese company and will not engage in foreign business if his father is elected president, Bloomberg reported.

The Bidens have been battered with allegations that Hunter improperly leveraged his father's influence as vice president to profit from foreign business deals in Ukraine and China—allegations which both have denied, and which Hunter again denied in the statement issued by his lawyer, George Mesires.

Hunter undertook these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he. Hunter always understood that his father would be guided, entirely and unequivocally, by established U.S. policy, irrespective of its effects on Hunter's professional interests. This was the standard observed throughout Hunter's professional career. When Hunter engaged in his business pursuits, he believed that he was acting appropriately and in good faith. He never anticipated the barrage of false charges against both him and his father by the president of the United States.



Even though everything Hunter did was supposedly legal and ethical, he has committed to discontinuing those legal and ethical practices if his father is elected president.

Hunter makes the following commitment: Under a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests. In any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies.

He will continue to keep his father personally uninvolved in his business affairs, while availing himself as necessary and appropriate to the Office of the White House Counsel to help inform his application of the Biden Administration's guidelines or standards to his business decision-making.



The company Biden is stepping down from is BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management, an LLC that invests Chinese money outside of the country.

Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors. His lawyer said in the statement that Biden joined the company ""based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets.""



According to Mesires, Biden never made any money from the position, nor did he play any role in directing or making investments. Still, he intends to resign at the end of the month.

Joe Biden refuses to say it was wrong for Hunter to serve on Burisma's board while he was VP,"Former Vice President Joe Biden refuses to acknowledge that his son Hunter's business dealings in the Ukraine were wrong, even if they were not technically illegal.

In an interview, Telemundo anchor Jose Diaz-Balart pressed Biden on the matter, but the aspiring Democratic presidential nominee did not budge. In fact, Biden tried to spin his way out when Diaz-Balart questioned Hunter's business ethics by responding that his son's actions were not unlawful. Biden then attempted to shift the focus back to President Trump.

Diaz-Balart: Your son did make a lot of money. There are some reports of $50,000 to $80,000 a month in a Ukrainian company while you were vice president. Also had dealings with a Chinese state government-run company while you were vice president. Was that wrong?



Biden: No, there is nothing asserting that he did anything that was illegal. Nothing.



Diaz-Balart: I'm not saying 'illegal.' Was it wrong?



Biden: Look, here's what I'm not going to do. I'm not going to—and I know you're not intending to do this—play the game to take the eye off the culprit.

Hunter Biden was a paid board member of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, as well as an adviser to a Chinese investment firm, while his father was the U.S. vice president.

Hunter gave a similar response

According to National Review, Hunter Biden in October denied having any kind of ""ethical lapse"" in his business affairs; however, he did apologize for creating a political headache for this father.

""In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it — I know that there was — did nothing wrong at all,"" Hunter said at the time.

""I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That's where I made the mistake,"" he added. ""So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.""

Senators are probing Hunter Biden's dealings

Congressional leaders are not convinced the dealings surrounding Hunter Biden were entirely above-board.

Several U.S. senators are now probing a consulting firm that attempted to use Hunter Biden's name to gain access to the Obama administration while he worked for Burisma.

According to the Washington Times, Sens. Ron Johnson (Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (Iowa) have asked Blue Star Strategies' CEO for information regarding the work it did for the Ukrainian energy company following reports that it considered leveraging Hunter Biden's membership in Burisma's board to secure meetings with Obama administration officials.

'Hysterical' transsexual activists shut down talk by human rights expert about transsexual activists' intolerance,"An expert on human rights law was set to speak Tuesday at McGill University about whether transsexuals should be able to legally change their sex and invade women-only spaces when LGBT activists invaded the space, effectively shutting down the event.

Robert Wintemute, a law professor at King's College London, suggested the censorious uproar was ""hysterical"" and amounted to further evidence that any discussion of the fallout of the transsexual agenda, particularly for women, is increasingly being stifled.

What are the details?

According to the event page, Wintemute was scheduled to give a talk on Jan. 10 entitled, ""The Sex vs. Gender (Identity) Debate in the United Kingdom and the Divorce of LGB from T.""

""Since 2018, there has been a debate in the United Kingdom about whether or not the law should be changed to make it easier for a transgender individual to change their legal sex from their birth sex, and about exceptional situations, such as women-only spaces and sports, in which the individual’s birth sex should take priority over their gender identity, regardless of their legal sex,"" said the event posting.

It added, ""This debate inspired the foundation in 2019 of an organisation, LGB Alliance, which rejects the political coalition of LGB and T and challenges some transgender demands, on the basis that they conflict with the rights of lesbian and bisexual women or the rights of children who might grow up to be LGB adults.""

Wintemute, a McGill alumnus and trustee of the LGB Alliance, was invited to speak on this topic as well as to his record as a human rights and LGB scholar by the university's Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism.

Prof. Frédéric Mégret from the CHRLP suggested there was hope that Wintemute's participation in ""critical conversations"" about these issues might have been worthwhile.

""We understand that these are not consensual topics. However, we believe they can be productively and robustly discussed in an academic setting and could, in fact, be an opportunity to push back against certain views,"" said Mégret.

Robust discussion about women's rights on a university campus was apparently too much to bear for some male transsexual activists.

'Hysterical' mob rule

Canadian state media reported that transsexual activist Celeste Trianon, a biological male, sought to silence Wintemute and shut down the event, claiming the event excluded transsexual people's rights and was altogether ""transphobic.""

""I feel like there's such a tragic irony where someone who is actively working toward dismantling human rights toward one of the most marginalized groups … how such an event can be hosted at the McGill Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism,"" said Trianon.

According to Trianon, a student at another Quebec university, it is ""close-minded"" for anyone to suggest that the conference of ""rights to trans women"" means ""subtracting from the rights"" of real women.

Annie Collin, a real woman prevented from hearing Wintemute speak, told the Montreal Gazette that transsexual activists attacked her friend.

""They pushed her. They threw her phone away. They pretend they're being excluded but they're the people who tell people to get out. And they get madder because someone wants to defend women's rights, homosexuals' and bisexuals' rights. What's the problem about that?""

In a Jan. 6 Instagram post, Trianon claimed the event would ""contribute directly to the systemic elimination of trans voices and lives worldwide, as well as the dismantling of human rights as a whole.""



Trianon further accused the university of ""contributing to the genocide of trans people across the world"" in Jan. 10 letter co-signed by five professors at other Canadian universities.

The letter contended that ""free speech does not mean having to tolerate hate speech.""

This sentiment was evidently shared by the protesters, some of whom prejudged Wintemute's unuttered speech in advance as hateful.

Among the signs hoisted above the mob of anti-speech activists was one that read, ""No debate.""

The activists can be heard in one video chanting, ""We are not here for debate, f*** your systems, f*** your hate.""

Contrary to the mob's accusations that he harbored hate or irrational fears, Wintemute suggested that he would never have anything to do with a group that ""promotes hate,"" noting he had 37 years of experience defending human rights.

The professor has worked 15 successful cases challenging discrimination against gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in various European and British courts.

Wintemute told CTV News that it is ""extremely anti-democratic to interfere with a seminar at a university just because you disagree with the opinions expressed.""

""We're supposed to be a democracy with freedom of expression,"" he said.

Wintemute and the LGB Alliance advocate on behalf of the ""many women who are concerned about the presence of male-to-female persons in women-only spaces, which would include changing rooms, prisons, hospital wards, etc.,"" as well as the real females adversely impacted by the inclusion of men in women's sports.



The event's cancellation served to confirm a trend Wintemute has observed elsewhere.

""I have to thank the protesters for giving me firsthand experience of that intimidation,"" he said. ""Probably the majority of women in this country disagree with some of transgender demands, but they refuse to say so because they will be seen as intolerant.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-to-step-down-from-chinese-company-refrain-from-foreign-work-if-father-is-elected,2023-01-12
Republican members of Congress send letter to ICE seeking answers over $17 million spent on unused hotels for illegal immigrants,"Republican members of Congress are investigating a recent inspector general report indicating that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) wrongfully allocated $87 million in a sole-source contract to a nonprofit in Texas.

ICE collaborated with a San Antonio-based nonprofit called Endeavors to provide housing for illegal immigrants in hotels. Last year, the Epoch Times reported, ICE spent “approximately $17 million for hotel space and services at six hotels that went largely unused between April and June 2021.”

The Congressional Republicans wrote a letter, in early May, to Tae Johnson, the Acting ICE Director, asking him to provide all of the relevant documents and information surrounding the deal.

The letter said, “We write to express alarm at the potential waste of millions in taxpayer money and abuse of the contracting process by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials. According to a recent Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General (OIG) report, ICE officials bypassed the ordinary competitive process to award a large, sole source $87 million contract and then wasted at least $17 million of taxpayer money because hotel rooms intended for migrant families sat empty and were mostly unused.”

It went on to call the $17 million spent “unacceptable” and lamented the potential conflict of interests that might arise through the contract.

It said, “Wasting $17 million in unused hotel rooms paid for by the taxpayers is unacceptable. Unfortunately, these problems are not surprising given the potential conflicts of interest inherent in this particular contract.”

The letter was signed by Reps. James Comer, Michael Cloud, Jody Hicc, Glenn Grothman, Ralph Norman, Nancy Mace, Jim Jordan, Virginia Foxx, Bob Gibbs, Clay Higgins, Pete Sessions, Fred Keller, Andy Biggs, Andrew Clyde, Scott Franklin, Jake LaTurner, Pat Fallon, Yvette Herrell, and Byron Donalds.

The IG report prompted the congress members to speak out and raise ethical concerns about how the decision-making process to award the multi-million-dollar contract to a sole source instead of allocating it through a “competitive procurement process.”

The report said, “Rather than using the competitive procurement process, ICE awarded a solen source contract to Endeavors, which had provided an unsolicited proposal for housing migrant families in hotels.”

The Republicans’ letter to Johnson raises concerns over this potential conflict of interest, noting that Endeavors was able to secure these funds after hiring Andrew Lorenzen-Strait a longtime political ally of the Biden administration.

The letter said, “Endeavors won this contract and even larger contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services through a no bid process after hiring Andrew Lorenzen-Strait as Senior Director for Migrant Services and Federal Affairs, a political ally of this Administration.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter_biden_joe_telemundo_nothing_wrong,2022-05-08
Idaho closer to passing law that would make transgender operations on minors a felony,"Idaho is one step closer to passing a law that would make transgender medical operations on minors a felony, and LGBTQ advocates are expressing their outrage.

The bill goes to a full state House vote after being passed by a House committee Tuesday.

If passed, the law says anyone caught prescribing hormones or puberty blockers or performing gender reassignment operations on minors could be punished by life in prison.

Republican State Rep. Bruce Skaug sponsored the bill and said that instead of seeking irreversible surgery, children experiencing gender dysphoria should seek mental health treatment instead.

“It’s a bill to get proper treatment and to prevent them from lifelong, permanent decisions that will make them sterile and mutilate their bodies,” he explained.

“If we do not allow minors to get a tattoo, drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, sign a legal contract, why would we allow them to go through these physical mutilations because of their feelings at the time,” Skaug said.

The legislation would be an amendment to a previously passed law that bans child genital mutilation.

Billy Burleigh, a former transgender person, supported the bill because he had undergone transitional surgery he later regretted.

""Every time I looked in the mirror, I saw a man staring back at me,"" Burleigh said. ""I tried hard to resolve the conflict, but I couldn't. The bottom line, the therapist and the medical community was wrong in my case.""

The legislation makes exceptions for the rare cases of birth defects or chromosomal disorders.

The Human Rights Campaign opposed the bill and called on the state Senate to vote against the ban.

“Every kid in Idaho deserves the chance to grow up feeling safe and respected for who they are. Denying someone medically-necessary health care simply because you don’t approve of who they are is textbook discrimination,"" the organization said in a lengthy statement.

If the state passes the bill, Idaho will become the fourth state to outlaw such treatments for minors. Arkansas, Tennessee, and Texas have all passed similar legislation and those are facing challenges in court.

"Idaho gov repeals lieutenant gov's executive order banning mask mandates, unloads on her 'irresponsible abuse of power'","Idaho Gov. Brad Little (R) on Friday repealed an executive order overriding local mask mandates, blasting his Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin (R) for issuing the order in his absence.

""The action that took place was an irresponsible, self-serving political stunt,"" Little said in a statement.

The governor accused McGeachin's order of usurping legislative powers with an ""over-the-top executive action"" that ""amounts to tyranny."" His repeal order aims to ""restore local control"" over public health ordinances, permitting Idaho localities to impose mask mandates, including for children, if they deem it necessary to protect public health.

Idaho never adopted a statewide mask mandate because Little believed a top-down order from the state government would violate conservative principles respecting local government.



Earlier this week, Little was out of state to attend a meeting of the Republican Governors Association in Nashville, Tennessee. Idaho law elevates the lieutenant governor to serve as acting governor with all the governor's powers ""in case of temporary inability to perform his duties or in the case of his temporary absence from the state.""

While he was away, McGeachin used her temporary authority to issue the executive order banning local governments from implementing mask mandates.

McGeachin announced last week that she will run in the Republican primary for governor. She did not notify Little, her primary opponent, of her intention to issue the order.

""Taking the earliest opportunity to act solitarily on a highly politicized, polarizing issue without conferring with local jurisdictions, legislators and the sitting governor is, simply put, an abuse of power,"" Little said, blasting McGeachin. ""This kind of over-the-top executive action amounts to tyranny — something we all oppose.""



Little accused McGeachin's order of violating Idaho state law, which provides that school district trustees, cities, counties, and public health districts have the power to enact policies to protect pubic health. The law also prohibits executive orders from changing state law.

""How ironic that the action comes from a person who has groused about tyranny, executive overreach, and balance of power for months,"" Little said.

""Furthermore, the executive order presents some pretty alarming consequences,"" he continued. ""For example, we would not be able to require safety measures for social workers visiting homes of at-risk individuals, or workers in our state testing lab, or employees at congregate facilities that are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of infectious disease, threatening loss of life and added strain on the health care system we all depend on.""

Then his statement got personal:

The executive order also conflicts with other laws on the books.



This is why you do your homework, Lt. Governor.



Let me offer some advice as Idaho's duly elected Governor – governing in a silo is NOT governing.



I am always reluctant to engage in political ploys, especially when I have been steadfast in meeting the simultaneous goals of protecting both lives and livelihoods.



I do not like petty politics. I do not like political stunts over the rule of law.



However, the significant consequences of the Lt. Governor's flimsy executive order require me to clean up a mess.

Responding, McGeachin told supporters in a statement that Gov. Little ""chose to revoke your personal freedom by rescinding my order and imposing mask mandates on thousands of Idaho children.""

""I understand that protecting individual liberty means fighting against tyranny at ALL levels of government — federal, state, and local. It is your God-given right to make your own health decisions, and no state, city, or school district ever has the authority to violate your unalienable rights,"" McGeachin said.

""As your Lt. Governor, I remain undeterred and unwavering in my commitment to defend your rights and freedoms against all who would violate them. Now, more than ever, we must stand together against those who prioritize their own power above individual liberty.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ice-immigration-illegal-corruption,2021-05-28
"Israeli military baits Hamas terrorists using ingenious tactical move, then unleashes massive air attack","The Israeli Defense Forces successfully duped Hamas terrorists into believing Israeli soldiers would initiate a ground attack in Gaza, drawing the terrorists into underground tunnels before unleashing a massive air campaign on them.

What happened?

Late Thursday night, the IDF began assembling ground forces along the Israel-Gaza border, indicating that a ground assault was imminent into the areas where Hamas terrorists have been launching a barrage of missiles into Israel.

At the same time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli ""would exact a very heavy price from Hamas and the other terrorist organizations."" Earlier in the day, Defense Minister Benny Gantz called up 9,000 reserve soldiers, according to the Jerusalem Post.

""IDF air and ground troops are currently attacking in the Gaza Strip,"" the IDF tweeted.

Media outlets across the world then reported the alleged development, including the Washington Post and ABC News, the Jerusalem Post noted. The Post, for example, reported, ""Israeli troops have entered the Gaza Strip as conflict with Palestinians escalates, Israeli military says.""

Did Israeli ground troops actually invade Gaza?

According to Israeli officials, assembling ground troops near the Gaza border and publicly claiming a ground invasion was occurring was tactical deception.

The intended goal was to provoke Hamas terrorists to enter their underground tunnel system, allowing Israeli forces to systematically target the tunnels and Hamas soldiers.

In total, more than 450 bombs were dropped on more than 150 Hamas targets during the air campaign.

From the Jerusalem Post:

Yes, the IDF had deployed troops along the border, but they did not cross into Gaza. What did happen was in the air where 160 aircraft had assembled for a massive bombing run over the Gaza Strip. Their target was what the IDF called Hamas's ""Metro"", an underground network of tunnels which Hamas used to store its weapons and to move throughout Gaza hidden from Israeli aircraft. The ""Metro"" had been built in the years after the 2014 war in the Gaza Strip, also known in Israel as Operation Protective Edge. It was a network of dozens of kilometers of tunnels that crisscrossed Gaza and provided safety from Israeli aerial incursions.



According to reports, due to the deployment along the border and the news coming out in the foreign media of a ground incursion, Hamas and Islamic Jihad sent their first-line of defense into the tunnels to start taking up positions. These were the anti-tank missile teams and mortar squads meant to strike at incoming Israeli ground forces. What these Hamas operatives did not know was that there was no ground offensive. Instead, once they were out of the tunnels, they were exposed to Israeli aircraft. Within minutes, the ""Metro"" attack went ahead. This led to speculation that the tweet about the ground incursion was intentional and made to get Hamas to believe it was safe to enter the tunnels.

Despite nearly one week of fighting, Israeli officials are not interested in a ceasefire as casualties mount on both sides, the Times of Israel reported.

The Jerusalem Post, however, reported that senior Israeli officials are now urging Netanyahu and Gantz to begin working toward a ceasfire.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/idaho-gender-ban-felony,2021-05-15
"Ignoring critics, Tom Cotton doubles down on demands to know what the AP knew about Hamas terrorists in their Gaza building","Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) doubled down on his criticism of the Associated Press Tuesday for allegedly operating its Gaza press bureau in a building shared by Hamas intelligence forces.

Journalists have rebuked Cotton after he defended an Israeli Defense Forces airstrike that destroyed the building housing the AP and other media outlets like Al Jazeera in a speech on the Senate floor Monday.

Israel said it obtained intelligence that Hamas forces were operating there and had alerted journalists and residents that the strike was imminent, allowing for the building to be evacuated before it was destroyed.

Cotton, in his speech, expressed skepticism of the AP's claims of having no knowledge of Hamas' presence in the building despite operating its bureau there for 15 years.

""Why is the Associated Press sharing a building with Hamas?"" Cotton asked Monday. ""Surely these intrepid reporters knew who their neighbors were.""

""Did they knowingly allow themselves to be used as human shields by a U.S.-designated terrorist organization? Did the AP pull its punches and decline to report for years on Hamas' misdeeds?""

HIs questions drew widespread condemnation from members of the media, who accused him of making baseless accusations.

But the fiercely pro-Israel senator from Arkansas fired back at his critics in a follow-up speech on the Senate floor Tuesday.

""One would think that these are simple and reasonable questions, but I directed them to a media organization, so the usual suspects circled the wagon expressing more outrage at my audacity to question the AP's leadership than they do at Hamas for trying to kill Jews by the thousands,"" Cotton said, listing some of the disparaging remarks he's received from journalists on social media.

""The constant refrain of their criticism was that I was attacking the brave reporters of the Associated Press Gaza bureau. My claims were 'baseless', 'reckless', 'without evidence', they claimed. But in fact there's plenty of evidence that some media outlets stationed in Gaza allowed themselves to be used as pawns by Hamas.""

Cotton cited a 2014 article written by a former AP journalist and published in The Atlantic that revealed AP journalists knew about Hamas occupying their Gaza building and had witnessed rockets being fired into Israel from just outside their office. The article's author, Matti Friedman, wrote that Hamas fighters had once burst into the AP's office and threatened the staff, but the AP never reported the incident.

""The AP instead turned a blind eye to terrorism and embraced a culture of silence on behalf of murderers who actively endangered its own reporters and staff,"" Cotton charged. ""What's equally scandalous is the AP continued to locate their offices in a building they knew was dangerous.""

""I'm not sure what's worse, that the AP knew they shared the building with Hamas or that they didn't know,"" he added, before going on to slam the Associated Press.

""Instead of uncovering the truth the AP concealed it. Then, when the IDF carried out its fully justified and wholly appropriate air strike, the AP condemned Israel in one final parting gift to their neighbors, Hamas,"" Cotton said.

""Would the AP allow its reporters to share a building with Al Qaeda? What about ISIS? Because there's little differences between these U.S.-designated terrorist organizations and Hamas.""

"Rep. Ilhan Omar takes anti-Semitism to new level, earning bipartisan condemnation","Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar (Minn.) generated bipartisan condemnation Sunday after she once again flashed her anti-Semitic worldview.

What did she say?

Omar suggested the Republican Party's near unanimous support for Israel is ""all about the Benjamins."" Her comment was triggered by journalist Glenn Greenwald, who criticized House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for promising ""action"" against Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Minn.) for previous anti-Israel rhetoric.

If that was not bad enough, about one hour later, Omar, with shovel in hand, began to dig her hole even deeper. She claimed that AIPAC — the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group — pays Republicans to support Israel.

What was the reaction?

Although Sunday's comments were not Omar's first trip on the anti-Semitic merry-go-round, widespread bipartisan condemnation erupted almost immediately, even from Omar's Democratic colleagues in Congress. Other people called for swift action against Omar, suggesting that removing her from her committee assignments is a worthy punishment for her rampant anti-Semitism.

Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.):

Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.):

Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Ohio):



Chelsea Clinton:

Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wy.):



Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley:

Dr. Zuhdi Jassar:

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.):

Ben Shapiro:

Perhaps the most thorough rebuke came from Dan Shapiro, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Israel for the majority of President Barack Obama's term.

In a lengthy Twitter thread, Shapiro characterized Omar's last comments as a ""vile anti-Semitic trope"" deserving complete condemnation by the Democratic Party. In full, he wrote:

@IlhanMN's outrageous comments equating politicians' support for Israel with being bought off by American Jewish money are a vile anti-Semitic trope. They need to be condemned by all in our party. Some of us remained uncomfortably quiet after her BDS flip-flop &other offensive remarks because we were aware of efforts to work with her: by colleagues, party leaders, her local Jewish community in MN. She indicated to them she had other policy priorities, not Is/Pal issues.



But these efforts have failed. Her support for BDS is apparently her essence: blaming Israel alone for the conflict, absolving Palestinians of all responsibility, delegitimizing Israel's very existence, &accusing its supporters of shallow motives &manipulation by Jewish money. Her approach indicates she doesn't want to be a consensus builder or understand others' views. She wants to push her extreme view, embarrassing her Democratic colleagues who inevitably are asked to respond. She's made herself a lightning rod. It will isolate her. And it should.



There's plenty of room to differ w/Israeli policy, settlement expansion, the drift away from two-states, etc. Criticism of Israel's actions is not, by definition, anti-Israel or anti-Semitic. It should also take account of Israel's legitimate security concerns & many threats. Supporting Palestinians' legitimate aspirations for statehood &sympathy for their current hardships are mainstream &eminently reasonable. Any honest assessment would also take account of their leaders' responsibility for terror, incitement, &rejecting any legitimacy of Israel.



Omar has many colleagues who've modeled how to strike this balance for years: supporting Israel's security &legitimacy &close US-Isr ties, supporting 2 states for 2 peoples, criticizing each side when warranted, differing with/Trump's approach that helps entrench the conflict. Had she come to DC, shown sympathy and empathy for Israelis and Palestinians, learned to assign responsibility in appropriate measure to both sides, considered the totality of US interests in the region, maybe taken a trip to learn, she could have had real influence.



She could have avoided delegitimizing those who disagree with her as being in the thrall of campaign contributions, instead of acting on their own & their constituents' beliefs. Had she done so, she could have also educated a lot of people to consider views they may not have. Now, instead, she'll have much of DC, many in her own party, much of the Jewish community, &plenty of others turning against her. She did that. She chose that.

She had little influence on Dem party positions on Israel/Palestine before. Thankfully, now she'll have even less.



No one is trying to silence her. She can advocate any policy she wants. And if she'll listen, we should keep the door open. Meanwhile, those who strongly disagree with her views and find them ill-informed, offensive, and even anti-Semitic also have to speak up. We must. End.

"Ilhan Omar lashes out at constituent at town hall meeting, somehow makes Ukrainian suffering about herself: 'Unless you are someone like me ...'","A recent town hall meeting left Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) railing about Russian ""internet disinformation"" and calling some of her own constituents ""dangerous propagandists.""

On Thursday, Omar held a town hall meeting where at least one constituent shared his concerns about America's continued financial support for the war in Ukraine.

An account called ""Jose Vega — Vote Diane Sare!"" shared a video of the incident on Twitter.

""JUST IN: Anti War Protester confronts #SquadMember @IlhanMN on her funding of the Ukrainian War that is leading us into nuclear war,"" the tweet with the video reads. ""She was part of the cowardly 30 who rescinded the letter calling for diplomatic talks with Russia!""

The unidentified man in the audience openly criticized Omar for voting to fund Ukrainian forces, even as her party's traditional platform eschews American intervention in foreign wars.

""You are supposed to be a progressive Democrat,"" the unnamed audience member shouted while Omar was speaking. ""Anti-war. Anti-war! Eighty billion to Ukraine is not anti-war!""

When Omar replied that the U.S. funding helped Ukrainians defend themselves, the man claimed that Ukraine, under the direction of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was ""killing its own citizens.""

Omar then pivoted to position herself as a victim and to seemingly co-opt some of the Ukrainian suffering as her own.

""We are helping little children like me,"" said the Democrat, who just celebrated her 40th birthday a few weeks ago.

A few moments later, Omar became angry with the man, who continued to argue with her. She once again turned the subject back to herself and told her constituents that they have little right to weigh in on the votes she casts on their behalf.

""Unless you are someone like me that has been that child,"" she yelled, ""you do not get to tell me what my votes mean and how I get to vote in supporting people who desperately need ...""

Audience clapping rendered the rest of her statement inaudible.

After the meeting was over, Omar continued to attack her anti-war critics online, calling them ""dangerous propagandists"" who spew Russian ""disinformation.""

""I am sorry, you all aren’t 'anti war protesters',"" she said, quote-tweeting Vega, ""you are dangerous propagandists who are literally making a mockery of the anti war movement. I have never had the pleasure of responding to [Russia's] ridiculous internet disinformation in person before. Thank you for the opportunity.""

""I am amazed at the nerve that some people have to not be upset with the country literally waging war, but at the country defending itself and those helping them do that,"" she added in another tweet. ""I was even told by one of these people tonight, 'it’s America that started the Russia war', seriously wtf.""

Despite her current support, Omar initially expressed skepticism about America's role in the Ukraine-Russia conflict and voted against a Ukrainian aid package back in early February. The U.S. has since sent tens of billions of dollars to Ukraine.

Omar's contentious town hall marks the second time in recent weeks that a member of the Squad has been confronted about her support for funding the war in Ukraine. Earlier this month, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was similarly challenged about her pro-war voting record at a town hall event.

"Ilhan Omar 'outraged' at Trump's decision to kill Iranian terrorist, vows to try to stop him","Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) joined the chorus of Democrats expressing opposition to President Donald Trump's decision to order the airstrike that killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani on Thursday night, saying she was ""outraged"" and accusing the president of escalating conflict with Iran as a distraction.

""So what if Trump wants war, knows this leads to war and needs the distraction?"" Omar wrote on Twitter. ""Real question is, will those with congressional authority step in and stop him? I know I will.""

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) replied to Omar by detailing some of Soleimani's violent acts against Americans, asking, ""Why are congressional Dems outraged that he's finally dead?""

""We are outraged the president would assassinate a foreign official, possibly setting off another war without congressional authorization and has zero plan to deal with the consequences,"" Omar replied to Cruz. ""But of course you know that.""

Omar went on to cite a quote from Cruz in 2016 that questioned then-candidate Trump's judgment.

""I don't know anyone who would be comfortable with someone who behaves this way having his finger on the button,"" Cruz said in February 2016 about Trump. ""We're liable to wake up one morning and Donald, if he were president, would have nuked Denmark. That's not the temperament of a leader to keep the country safe.""

Because everyone agrees Soleimani was an enemy and that his death is a victory for America, the political conflict surrounding the attack is focused on Democrats who are upset that Congress was not briefed and asked to approve the attack. Some have also expressed concern about whether or not the Trump administration has a plan to guard against potential retaliation from Iran.

The president made a statement on the operation Friday.

Ilhan Omar says President Trump imposed sanctions to 'starve' the people of Iran. She wants sanctions against Israel.,"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) claimed during a news conference Wednesday that the U.S. sanctions against Iran re-imposed by President Donald Trump were intended to ""starve"" the regime's people, causing observers to note her longstanding calls for sanctions against Israel.

What are the details?

""Since he got into office, the President of the United States has been goading Iran into war,"" Omar said of President Trump. ""First, he cancelled our best shot at avoiding armed conflict — the Iran nuclear deal — then he announced crippling sanctions to starve the innocent people of Iran.""

GOP Rapid Response Director Steve Guest posted a clip of Omar's remarks on Twitter, saying, ""You can't make this up. 2019 Anti-Semite of the Year Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar condemns 'crippling' Iranian sanctions despite being an avid supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel.""



Guest then tweeted a link to an article by The Washington Free Beacon reporting that Omar was named 2019 anti-Semite of the year by the organization, StopAntiSemitism.org.

The Free Beacon quoted StopAntiSemitism.org's news release announcing Omar had been selected for the recognition, where the group explained, ""Among Rep. Ilhan Omar's transgressions, she perpetuated anti-Semitic tropes on Twitter to nearly two million followers and introduced an anti-Semitic resolution in Congress that promoted boycotts of the State of Israel and likened them to boycotts of Nazi Germany.""

The news release went on to say ""The public's vote highlights the growing concern among Americans about the Congresswoman's ability to use and abuse her position of power to propagate hatred in the U.S.""

Omar joined fellow Democrats Reps. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and John Lewis (Ga.) earlier this year in introducing a resolution aimed at bolstering the BDS movement which is an international call for countries, among other things, to ""impose embargoes and sanctions against Israel.""

When Omar announced her resolution in July, she told Al-Monitor it was ""an opportunity for us to explain why it is we support a nonviolent movement, which is the BDS movement.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ilhan-omar-lashes-out-at-constituent-at-town-hall-meeting-somehow-makes-ukrainian-suffering-about-herself-unless-you-are-someone-like-me,2020-01-09

God bless America, and all of you.

BOSTON (MARCH 6, 1770) — Five people are dead and six more wounded after a tense confrontation yesterday at the Custom House between British soldiers and residents in Boston.

Several years of ongoing tension between Boston residents and British troops stationed in the area boiled over after Pvt. Hugh White allegedly struck Boston man Edward Garrick on the side of the head with his musket. Garrick had reportedly been shouting a slew of insults at White and another soldier stationed at the Custom House.

According to witnesses, Garrick then rallied other residents in the area to push back against the soldiers, who were stationed there to maintain order in the area after the passing of the Townshend Acts. As the crowd size reportedly neared 50 and tensions escalated, White called for backup from the nearby barracks.

Capt. Thomas Preston arrived on scene shortly after, accompanied by six other soldiers of the 29th Regiment of Foot, all armed with fixed bayonets. Reports then indicate that the raucous crowd surrounding the soldiers, which grew up to 400 men, began throwing snowballs and ice at the troop of soldiers.

""Come on you rascals, you bloody backs, you lobster scoundrels, fire if you dare, G** damn you, fire and be damned, we know you dare not,"" one unidentified Boston man allegedly said to the soldiers.

""Fire and be damned,"" others in the crowd allegedly chanted at the soldiers.

According to authorities, although Preston gave no command for his troops to fire, an altercation between Pvt. Hugh Montgomery and an angry resident led to Montgomery discharging his weapon, but some conflicting reports indicate Montgomery's weapon went off as he was knocked to the ground. Though Preston told authorities he never told his men to fire, others could be heard yelling ""fire"" into the crowd as the soldiers shot at the angry mob.

Five men died in the altercation, including Crispus Attucks, a former runaway slave. Six others were treated for their injuries and released.

Preston and eight other soldiers were arrested on the scene and charged with manslaughter. A trial date for the soldiers has not yet been set.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ilhan-omar-outraged-at-trumps-decision-to-kill-iranian-terrorist,2020-07-04
American militiamen force British troops to retreat from Concord,"Editor's note: In order to allow our staff to enjoy the 4th of July holiday with their families, TheBlaze will be running a series of articles today commemorating the Revolutionary War, which won America her freedom. God bless America, and all of you.

BOSTON (APRIL 20, 1775) — American militiamen, after a brief retreat from a small skirmish in Lexington resulting in several dead, have pushed British redcoats out of Concord, giving colonists a victory in what may be the first of many military battles between Britain and defiant American colonists.

In a sequence of events that began late night on April 18, 1775, a plan by British Gen. Thomas Gage to capture American leaders and munitions was foiled when American volunteers were warned of an oncoming attack by British regulars in the town of Concord after British troops exchanged fire at Lexington, Massachusetts, with American patriots.

According to anonymous sources, Gage's plan was to furtively move British regulars to first capture Colonial leaders Samuel Adams and John Hancock in the town of Lexington, then advance to Concord where the British planned to seize American stockpiles of gunpowder. Thanks to the efficiency and skill of American intelligence, American forces were forewarned of Gage and his plan. British regulars were slowed by American ""minutemen"" — American militiamen ready to react at a moment's notice — at Lexington and along the route.

American silversmith and spy Paul Revere revealed that he had received word that British forces, led by British Maj. John Pitcairn, were to advance on Lexington to capture Adams and Hancock. Revere, 41, set up a warning system with North Church's Robert Newman that involved displaying one lantern from the church's steeple in the British were planning to advance from land, and two lanterns if by sea.

Sources say that Newman had displayed two around 10 p.m. on Tuesday, leading Revere and two other riders, tanner William Dawes, and Dr. Samuel Prescott to sprint across the countryside, warning colonists of the oncoming British forces from Boston.

Thanks to the early warning, Adams and Hancock were able to escape from Lexington. Their whereabouts are currently unknown.

Instead of marching into the town unimpeded, witnesses say that on early Wednesday morning, April 19, Pitcairn found himself and his 240 troops face to face with 80 American militiamen under the command of Capt. John Parker in the town of Lexington. Reports from eyewitnesses say that for some time, American and British troops faced each other at the ready, but did not fire.

Conflicting reports describe how the battle began, but according to both sides a shot was heard that started a brief skirmish between the minutemen.

""At 5 o'clock we arrived [in Lexington], and saw a number of people, I believe between 200 and 300, formed in a common in the middle of town; we still continued advancing, keeping prepared against an attack though without intending to attack them; but on our coming near them, they fired on us two shots, upon which our men without any orders, rushed upon them, fired and put them to flight; several of them were killed; we could not tell how many, because they were behind walls and into the woods,"" said British Lt. John Barker.

Militiaman Cpl. John Munroe remembers it differently, however.

""After the first fire of the regulars, I thought, and so stated to Ebenezer Munroe ... who stood next to me on the left, that they had fired nothing but powder; but on the second firing, Munroe stated they had fired something more than powder, for he had received a wound in his arm; and now, said he, to use his own words, 'I'll give them the guts of my gun.',"" Munroe said. ""We then both took aim at the main body of British troops the smoke preventing our seeing anything but the heads of some of their horses and discharged our pieces.""

This is the first exchange of gunfire between American and British forces during the rising tensions between the mother country and the American colonists. According to reports, eight Lexington men were killed, and 10 were wounded. Only one British soldier was wounded.

After some difficulty, Pitcairn was able to reassemble his men and march on Concord. Reports say that the British entered the town with little difficulty and began searching for the hidden American munitions. Due to good intelligence and forewarning, however, the American militia were able to hide away a good deal of their munitions, meaning that the British were not unable to find much.

Meanwhile, Concord militiamen gathered just outside of Concord and their strength further increased as volunteers from the neighboring towns rallied around militiaman Col. John Barrett on Punkatasset Hill overlooking Concord.

Witnesses say that once Barrett's forces had reached sufficient strength — over 1,000 men according to reports — he led American militiamen into Concord over the North Bridge, overwhelming the redcoats and forcing their retreat from Concord, and back to Boston. American militiamen reportedly shadowed British troops during their retreat, killing some 125 redcoats, including officers. During the course of the retreat, American forces continued to swell as militia from neighboring towns continued to join the rebel ranks.

By the time the British retreat neared Charlestown, the American militia substantially outnumbered the British regulars and might have completely obliterated the British force. However, American Col. Timothy Pickering, who had assumed command of a large militia force from Salem and Marblehead, allowed the British to escape to defensible positions in Charlestown, where they were reinforced by Gen. Gage.

Col. Pickering alleges that he allowed the British to escape on the orders of Gen. William Heath, a charge that Gen. Heath denies. At present, Gen. Heath has been relieved by Gen. Artemas Ward, who has placed the British forces in Boston under an effective siege.

Militiamen say that while a battle was not intended in Lexington, their victory in Concord has them energized and ready to take on the British forces in the future.

PHILADELPHIA (JULY 4, 1776) — Two days ago, the Continental Congress, assembled in Philadelphia, voted to declare that the 13 British colonies of America are “Free and Independent,"" establishing at once the “united States of America"" as a separate nation entirely.

“We … the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do,"" Congress announced.

On July 4, delegates of the 13 colonies adopted the “Declaration,"" formally severing the colonies from the authority of king of England. This momentous declaration will doubtless serve to escalate the military conflict between Britain and her colonies. Sources close to Congressional leaders indicate that the formal declaration was considered necessary to enlist the aid of the French army, which the colonists consider necessary to winning any military conflict with Britain.

Relying on the “self-evident"" truths that “all men are created equal"" and “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,"" the members of Congress firmly proclaimed the right of the American people to self-governance and listed a number of “repeated injuries and usurpations"" imposed on the colonies by the British crown.

Among those grievances listed are the king's failure to allow the colonists — despite having been full citizens of England — to have adequate representation; the king's decision to repeatedly close the colonies' legislative bodies for choosing with “manly firmness"" to reject “his invasions on the rights of the people""; quartering British soldiers in American homes; unjustly “imposing Taxes … without our Consent""; “cutting off … Trade with all parts of the world""; and for waging war against his own people.

Despite its clear declaration of independence from the British kingdom, Congress insisted it has not desired such extreme action, but that it has become necessary because of the unrelenting “Oppressions"" of the crown.

“In every stage of these Oppressions,"" Congress wrote, “We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.""

TheBlaze has learned on July 8, Gen. George Washington, commander of the Continental Army, learned of the “Declaration"" in a letter from Congress President John Hancock.

“That our affairs may take a more favorable turn, the Congress have judged it necessary to dissolve the connection between Great Britain and the American colonies, and to declare them free and independent states; as you will perceive by the enclosed Declaration, which I am directed to transmit to you, and to request you will have it proclaimed at the head of the army in the way you shall think it most proper,"" Hancock reportedly wrote to Washington.

Where these “united States of America"" go from here is greatly in dispute, with most European leaders speculating the rebellion will soon be crushed by the British, who have since won a series of important battles against the American forces. However, regardless of how this chapter in history ends, the leaders of the world's newest nation have made it clear where they have placed their trust: in God and each other.

“And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor,"" congressional members wrote.

The full text of the ""Declaration of Independence"" appears below:

In Congress, July 4, 1776. The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.



We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, —That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.



He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.



He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.



He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.



He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.



He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.



He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.



He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.



He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.



He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.



He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.



He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.



He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.



He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:



For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:



For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:



For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:



For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:



For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:



For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:



For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:



For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:



For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.



He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.



He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.



He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.



He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.



He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.



In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.



Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.



We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/independence-day-boston-massacre,2020-07-04
Britain passes the Coercive Acts; they should be called the Intolerable Acts,"Editor's note: In order to allow our staff to enjoy the 4th of July holiday with their families, TheBlaze will be running a series of articles today commemorating the Revolutionary War, which won America her freedom. God bless America, and all of you.

LONDON (1774) — In response to the activities of Dec. 16, 1773, the British Parliament has passed a series of punitive acts to be revoked only upon the compensation of the East India Company for goods that were allegedly irreparably damaged by American colonists.

The harsh legislation began after a group calling themselves the Sons of Liberty deposited nearly 350 crates of tea into Boston Harbor to protest the Tea Act. The legislation closed the port of Boston, appointed a new military government under Gen. Thomas Gage, and rendered British soldiers immune from prosecution for criminal violations.

In keeping with the Boston Port Act, the British Navy plans to establish a blockade of Massachusetts Bay until the town's unruly residents agree to pay for the tea that was dumped into Boston Harbor in protest. The Massachusetts Government Act has likewise established martial law and curbed the rights of rebellious colonists to gather into groups.

The so-called Administration of Justice Act, passed on May 20, was the final blow in a succession of punishments meted out to the province of Massachusetts, which has been the focal point of American hostility toward the mother country. It renewed the ability British troops exercised under the expired Quartering Act to take residence in unoccupied buildings at the will of the colonial governor.

Parliament continues debate on the Quebec Act, which would allow the French of that region to be governed by the Roman Catholic church and extend its territory into colonial western claims. Under this act, colonists in Boston and the Massachusetts Bay area would not be permitted to govern themselves, and would be cut off from their own independent trade by the British Navy, forcing them to rely on surrounding colonies for food and supplies.

The Quebec Act would punish the citizens of Massachusetts by allowing the French of Quebec to be subject to their own civil laws while Massachusetts would remain under the firm grip of the British Parliament.

Meanwhile, Boston merchants will soon be unable to trade goods because the British will occupy the harbor. Parliament still expects the East India Company to be repaid in full.

A small minority in Parliament, led by Edmund Burke, has begun to speak out against Parliament's treatment of the colonies. In a recent speech, Burke claimed that these Coercive Acts would make British rule intolerable to the American colonies, and might lead to future military conflict and war.

Burke warned that colonists outside of Massachusetts might sympathize with their plight and would likewise fear that Britain would soon intend to meddle in their affairs in a similar manner. Burke offered an impassioned speech in Parliament in favor of a motion to repeal the Tea Tax outright, but the motion was easily defeated in spite of Burke's protests.

It has been suggested in a variety of writings that an inter-colonial conference of some kind be convened to discuss the implications of Parliament's actions for all of the American colonies. One may take place as early as this autumn, though some colonies as yet remain mostly uninterested.

American colonists unsettled by British Parliament’s far-reaching Stamp Act tax,"Editor's note: In order to allow our staff to enjoy the 4th of July holiday with their families, TheBlaze will be running a series of articles today commemorating the Revolutionary War, which won America her freedom. God bless America, and all of you.

BOSTON (MARCH 23, 1765) — The British government levied a new tax yesterday on the North American colonies in the wake of the territories won from the French in the Seven Years' War.

Parliament passed the Stamp Act without any debate. The act, proposed by Prime Minister George Grenville, a Whig, will impose a tax on all American colonists, requiring them to pay an additional fee for every piece of paper purchased.

The tax will apply to all ship's papers, legal documents, licenses, newspapers, and other publications. Playing cards are subject to taxation, too.

This new policy is particularly noteworthy, given it is the first tax levied directly on American colonists by British lawmakers.

The purpose of the tax is twofold, according to Dr. Samuel Smith, chair of Liberty University's history department. He told TheBlaze the tax is a show of force by Britain, reminding the colonies where the authority lies. In addition, it will help the motherland pay down the debt incurred during the Seven Years' War, which lasted from 1756 to 1763.

“This stamp is a visible reminder of royal presence,"" Smith said. “From the British perspective, it is a way to remind Americans who is in charge.""

He went on to predict the Stamp Act would evoke “a very emotional response.""

The new tax comes on the heels of the controversial Sugar Act, which was passed by the British Parliament just one year prior. The Sugar Act, a renewal of the Sugar and Molasses Act of 1733, added a three-penny import tax on refined sugar and molasses brought into the colonies from non-British sources, significantly shrinking the trade market for the colonists.

“Now, all of the sudden, Parliament is saying, 'We virtually represent the colonies. Even though you didn't vote for us, we virtually represent you because we're the top-tier legislative body,'"" Smith said.

Part of the money raised by the Stamp Act will also be used to maintain several regiments of British troops in North America — an effort to quell conflicts between the colonists and Native Americans.

Those who violate the Stamp Act, refusing the pay the fees associated with the policy, could be tried — and even convicted — without a jury of their peers in Britain's vice-admiralty courts.

Many American colonists, though, do not believe Britain has authority over them, according to Smith, who noted the frustration brewing over the tax. Though they respect Parliament, the professor noted, the settlers are convinced British lawmakers “do not have jurisdiction to tax the colonists because the colonists had not voted for them.""

Colonists are becoming increasingly frustrated with Britain, and this latest tax isn't improving the relationship. The North American settlers are frustrated not only with the added cost, but also with the fact that they are being taxed by a legislative body that does not represent them.

In response to the Stamp Act, some colonists are beginning to shun the British market, opting instead to create and sell products within their own colonies.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/independence-day-declaration-of-independence,2020-07-04
"Inspired by Black Lives Matter, Oakland officials voted to defund their police. But with homicides now spiking, second thoughts are in the air.","Oakland's city council in July unanimously voted to form a task force to figure out a way to reduce the police department budget by 50% over the next two years.

The move was a response to ""the urgency of the Black Lives Matter movement,"" the San Francisco Chronicle reported, adding that a 17-member Reimagining Public Safety Task Force was created to get things going.



But the paper said the desire to defund the police and the need for police butted right up against each other.

You see, since the beginning of 2020 to the end of October, homicides in Oakland numbered 84 — an increase of 26 over the same time period last year, SFist reported.

More from the Chronicle:

Then a wave of gun violence engulfed the flatlands in East Oakland, home to the city's most impoverished neighborhoods. Homicides spiked. Policymakers — and even the most devoted reformers — had to confront a paradox: that the Black and Latino neighborhoods most threatened by police violence are also the ones demanding better and more consistent law enforcement.



Task force members agreed that police brutality against Black and brown people is too common, that gun violence needs to end and that the city needs more services to address the underlying causes of crime. But while advocates wanted swift, dramatic change, others felt conflicted. In neighborhoods with high crime and slow police response times, Black residents winced at what sometimes felt like preaching from outsiders.



A poll released last week by the Chamber of Commerce showed that, citywide, 58% of residents want to either maintain or increase the size of the police force. That figure climbs to 75% in District 7, an area of East Oakland where gunfire exploded this summer.



Notably, the poll showed that support for increasing the size of the police force is higher among Black voters, at 38%, than white voters, at 27%.

One task force member who believes the police budget is too high added to the paper that he cringed when ""100 new white folks"" lined up at a recent council budget hearing and argued that police are ""harmful to Black and brown people.""

Indeed, one resident told the paper that there are those who actually live in East Oakland who are hesitant to call for defunding police and view such a demand as an activist movement spearheaded by those who have no idea what it means to live day to day in the neighborhood.

""Our response times are already slow based on them stating, 'We just don't have the manpower to answer the volume of calls we're receiving,'"" the resident told the Chronicle. ""If cutting the budget in half means losing officers when we already are short officers, I just think that's a disaster waiting to happen.""

Biden administration cancels sale of oil and gas leases as gas prices hit staggering record high,"The Biden administration disclosed Wednesday the Department of Interior will cancel three critical oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska's Cook Inlet.

The news comes as gas prices smash all-time records. As of Thursday afternoon, the national average price of gasoline was $4.41 per gallon, according to AAA. For diesel, the average price per gallon hit a staggering $5.55.

What are the details?

The Interior Department said in a statement that it ""will not move forward with the proposed Cook Inlet OCS oil and gas lease sale 258,"" and officials blamed a ""lack of industry interest in leasing in the area."" The decision means more than 1 million acres of potentially oil-rich lands will remain untapped.

Meanwhile, the department also canceled two lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico.

""The Department also will not move forward with lease sales 259 and 261 in the Gulf of Mexico region, as a result of delays due to factors including conflicting court rulings that impacted work on these proposed lease sales,"" explained a statement from the Interior Department, Axios reported.



CBS News reported that anti-oil environmental groups welcomed the news. On the other hand, pro-oil groups blasted the Biden administration.

While it is true that it takes years for oil production to begin after a lease is sold, Frank Macchiarola of the American Petroleum Institute explained the decision to cancel the lease sales is yet another example of the Biden administration's hostility toward fossil fuels.

""The President has spoken about the need for additional supplies in the market, but his administration has failed to take action to match that rhetoric,"" Macchiarola told CBS News. ""In the kind of price environment that we're seeing, there are negative consequences to shutting off oil and gas development, both politically and practically.""

Anything else?

The Interior Department additionally emphasized to Fox Business that three-quarters of the nearly 11 million acres of ""offshore federal waters already under lease"" are not being used by oil companies, recycling a key Biden administration talking point from March.

While that may be true, Anne Bradbury, CEO of the American Exploration & Production Council, has described the talking point as a ""red herring"" precisely because of the arduous and lengthy process between a lease approval and the safe extraction of oil.

""It's really a distraction from the fact that this administration has paused leasing on federal lands, something that we're concerned about and something that we think needs to continue right away,"" Bradbury said. ""The fact is that industry is producing at a higher level on existing leases on federal lands than in the last 20 years and these leases take many years to explore, to develop and produce on.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/independence-day-stamp-act,2022-05-12
"International airlines cancel flights to Ukraine, fearing Russian violence","Airlines are canceling and diverting flights to Ukraine as the international community increasingly dears an imminent Russian invasion.

Notably, the Dutch airline KLM a subsidiary of Air France KLM has ceased service to Ukraine. Reuters reports that the Dutch airline announced that it would no longer be chartering flights to Ukraine shortly after the government of the Netherlands told Dutch citizens to leave Ukraine as soon as they possibly can.

Germany’s largest commercial airline and the second-largest airline in Europe, Lufthansa, began rescheduling flights to Kyiv in late January, citing the ongoing “problems” preventing airline staff from staying overnight in the Ukrainian capital.

Reuters reports that the United States Federal Aviation Administration has also instituted a ban on U.S. airlines flying over specific parts of Ukraine’s eastern region.

The Associated Press reports that SkyUp, a Ukrainian charter airline, said that a flight from Madeira, Portugal to Kyiv was diverted to the capital city of Moldova after the plane’s lessor banned flights into Ukrainian airspace.

In 2014, a Malaysia Airlines flight, providing service from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian and Dutch officials accused Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine of shooting down the jet with a surface-to-air missile manufactured by the Russians.

There were no survivors.

On Saturday, President Joe Biden had an hourlong phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden allegedly told Putin that there would be “widespread human suffering” should Russia invade Ukraine.

Biden also reportedly told Putin that Western nations were committed to finding a diplomatic way to end the ongoing debacle but that they stand ready for military intervention should it become necessary. Biden said the West is “equally prepared for other scenarios” should diplomacy fail.

The United States and its allies in NATO currently have no plans to send troops to Ukraine.

Russian leadership continues to deny that it intends to invade Ukraine, but it continues to amass military forces along the Ukrainian border. Russian troops have also been sent to Belarus to conduct military exercises.

The United States believes that Russia has amassed enough firepower along the Ukrainian borders that they could invade the country on short notice.

Should armed conflict occur following a Russian invasion of Ukraine the aftermath will affect far more than just Russia and Ukraine.

Western nations in NATO and the European Union are prepared to issue sanctions on Russia which will kneecap its economy and greatly impact the distribution of energy supplies throughout the continent.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/inspired-by-black-lives-matter-oakland-officials-voted-to-defund-its-police-force-but-with-homicides-spiking-second-thoughts-are-in-the-air,2022-02-13
International outrage builds after multiple reports accuse Eritrean troops of massacring 'many hundreds' of Ethiopian civilians last year,"The United States State Department joined many other countries and international organizations who expressed outrage after two separate reports — one released by Amnesty International and the other by CNN — accused troops from the African nation of Eritrea of indiscriminately massacring large numbers of Ethiopian civilians during fighting that occurred in Ethiopia's Tigray region late last year.

The Tigray region in the northern portion of Ethiopia was the site of a bloody military conflict last year after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military campaign against the Tigray People's Liberation Front, the quasi-communist political party that ruled Ethiopia for decades, up until 2018. According to numerous eyewitnesses cited in both reports, troops from neighboring Eritrea took place in the conflict on Abiy's side, a claim that the Ethiopian government only recently admitted (and which the Eritrean government still denies).

According to the Amnesty International report, during the course of the conflict, Eritrean troops killed ""hundreds"" of Ethiopian civilians indiscriminately during a 24-hour period in late November of 2019, which it called a potential ""crime against humanity."" The killings allegedly took place in the Ethiopian city of Axum on November 28th, in apparent reprisal for a militia attack that had allegedly been carried out by militants based in Axum.

Separately, a report released by CNN on Saturday alleges that Eritrean forces slaughtered possibly over 100 unarmed Orthodox Christians at Maryam Dengelat, an Orthodox monastery complex in Edaga Hamus. CNN's report, based on the testimony of dozens of eyewitnesses, alleges that Eritrean forces opened fire on unarmed parishioners as they attended mass during the Orthodox festival of Tsion Maryam, which commemorates the day that Ethiopians believe the Ark of the Covenant was brought to the country from Jerusalem.

The Eritrean government strongly denied Amnesty International's report and claimed that Amnesty International made no attempt to get the Eritrean side of the story. CNN's report states that it attempted to obtain comment from the Eritrean government, which did not respond. The Ethiopian government, which has itself been accused of ethnic cleansing in Tigray, said in response to the report that it welcomed ""international technical assistance"" into investigations of possible human rights abuses in the area.

The United States State Department noted that there have been many ""credible"" reports that Eritrean troops are, in fact, involved in the conflict, and called upon Eritrean forces to be withdrawn from Tigray ""immediately.""

By all accounts, the escalating violence in the north of Ethiopia has generated a flood of refugees that has been unseen since the widespread famine and violence that ravaged the region for much of the 1970s and 80s, and the burgeoning humanitarian crisis may have ripple effects throughout the rest of northeastern Africa and the Middle East.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/interior-department-cancels-three-oil-lease-sales,2021-02-27
Iowa superintendent who refused to open schools could have license revoked,"A school superintendent in Iowa could lose his license for defying an order from Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) to open schools for in-person learning.

The Iowa Board of Education Examiners could revoke Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Thomas Ahart's administrator's license after complaints were filed over his decision to keep students learning 100% online for the first two weeks of the school year.

The educational examiners' investigation, reported by the Des Moines Register, found that Ahart broke the law by ""failing to submit and/or implement a lawful return-to-learn plan for the 2020-2021 school year.""

The examiners warned that Ahart may be forced to surrender his license or agree to accept a ""lesser sanction.""

Iowa schools were closed last March and instruction was moved online after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. Over the summer, Gov. Reynolds signed an executive order requiring schools to meet in-person at least 50% of the time, giving school districts in areas with at least 15% coronavirus test positivity rates the ability to apply for a waiver to stay closed.

Des Moines Public Schools applied for a waiver but the application was denied. In September, the school district sued to keep classes 100% online but a judge dismissed its request for an injunction against Reynolds' order.

When the schools were supposed to open in September, Ahart kept Des Moines public schools closed and the 31,000 students who attend them attended classes completely online, in violation of the mandate.

Iowa passed a law in January requiring that schools offer 100% in-person learning and a virtual learning option for families who prefer that.

The Des Moines Public School Board released a statement from Dwana Bradley and Rob Barron, the chair and vice chair of the school board, in support of Ahart:

The actions taken by Des Moines Public Schools in the midst of a global pandemic were done so to keep our community healthy and to save lives. During much of the past year, guidance from the state and federal government and public health officials was often conflicting and changing.



Superintendent Ahart took no action without the support and authorization of the School Board as we worked to educate students and lower the spread of COVID-19 in Iowa's largest city. Trying to save the lives of Iowans, during a period unlike anything any one of us has ever experienced, should not be met with an attack on Dr. Ahart's career.



The fact is, DMPS has been in compliance with the in-person learning requirements for the past five months AND are making up the instructional time from the beginning of the year under a plan that has been approved by the State. As the Chair and Vice Chair of the School Board, we support Dr. Ahart's work in carrying out the direction of the Board.



This complaint does nothing to benefit the children of our school district and move us past the pandemic.

Ahart is also supported by the teachers union.

""Dr. Ahart had the choice to violate the Governor's interpretation of the law or put students and staff in, what he and the Des Moines School Board deemed, unnecessarily more dangerous conditions.,"" Des Moines Education Association President Josh Brown in a statement.

Iran issues 'battlefield' threats after President Trump deploys military forces to Middle East,"Iran has responded to President Donald Trump's decision to deploy more American troops to the Middle East amid escalating tensions in the region.

Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Major General Hossein Salami said Saturday that Iran is ""ready for any type of scenario"" and that any country that attacks Iran will become a ""battlefield.""

""Whoever wants their land to become the main battlefield, go ahead,"" he said, according to AFP. ""We will never allow any war to encroach upon Iran's territory.""

He later threatened that ""limited aggression will not remain limited.""

Salami's threats come after Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced Friday the U.S. would deploy additional forces to the Middle East in hopes a show of force prevents further escalation.

""The president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces which will be defensive in nature and primarily focused on air and missile defense,"" Esper said.

""As the president has made clear, the United States does not seek conflict with Iran,"" he explained. ""That said we have many other military options available should they be necessary.""

According to NBC News, U.S. officials have also accelerated the delivery of advanced military equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Although tensions have been increasing in the region for months, officials around the world are on high alert after a major Saudi oil plant was attacked last week. U.S. officials blamed Iran for the attack, although Houthi rebels in Yemen, which receive aid from Iran, claimed responsibility for the attack.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/international-outrage-builds-after-multiple-reports-accuse-eritrean-troops-of-massacring-many-hundreds-of-ethiopian-civilians-last-year,2019-09-21
"Iran seizes oil tanker, ramps up uranium enrichment to near-nuclear weapon levels","Iran has begun enriching uranium at 20% — a technical step away from the 90% level needed to produce a nuclear weapon — at its underground facility at Fordo, officials in the country announced Monday.

What are the details?

The regime had previously been enriching uranium at 4.5%, which is still in violation of its 2015 nuclear agreement, though at a significantly lower level, NBC News reported.

The move is the latest in a series of escalating actions against the West and comes on the same day that Iran's Revolutionary Guard seized a South Korean oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz.

The news also comes just days after satellite photos obtained by the Associated Press showed new construction under way at the facility. Under the nuclear pact, Iran is not permitted to enrich uranium at over 3.5% and is not permitted to enrich uranium at all at its Fordo site, which is located deep within a mountain near the holy city of Qom.

In exchange for limiting enrichment, Iran receives sanctions relief from other parties to the deal: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, and China.

President Donald Trump removed the United States from the agreement in 2018, arguing the regime could not be trusted and was in fact continuing to construct a bomb in spite of the pact's restrictions.

What else?

Iran has been ramping up its aggressive rhetoric and actions against the U.S. in the waning days of the Trump administration, making some worry that a military conflict may soon commence.

Just last week, top Iranian officials suggested they may attempt to assassinate Trump in retaliation for U.S. forces killing terrorist leader Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike a year ago. Soleimani was the commander of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, which is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S.

At the same time, U.S. military leaders said they were bracing for an attack as the anniversary of Soleimani's death approached.

Anything else?

Officials in Iran apparently feel much better about their prospects with new leadership coming to the White House.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani recently bragged he has ""no doubt"" the incoming U.S. administration under Democratic President-elect Joe Biden will ""bow"" to Iran and rejoin the nuclear deal forged when Biden was vice president.

While on the campaign trail, Biden indicated he would rejoin the deal as a starting point for future negotiations with the terror-sponsoring regime.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iowa-superintendent-refused-to-open-schools-could-have-license-revoked,2021-01-04
Is war coming between Russia and Ukraine? Here's what that could mean for you,"President Joe Biden held a rare video conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday as tensions mount between Russia and neighboring Ukraine.

For months now, Russia has built up troops on its border with Ukraine, sparking fears in the international community that the former Soviet superpower intends to invade. Satellite images reported by Insider in November showed Russian personnel and equipment including tanks, artillery, and armored troop carriers deployed to the Pogonovo training area and Yelnya in Russia and Novoozernoye in Crimea.



A recent U.S. intelligence estimate first reported by the Washington Post found that Moscow is planning a multi-front offensive against Ukraine as soon as early next year involving up to 175,000 troops. Russia has demanded that the U.S. guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO and that the military alliance further refrain from certain military activities in and around Ukrainian territory.

Moscow has denied having plans to invade, despite having the clear capability to do so.

Though few analysts in either the West or the East believed a breakthrough would happen in the talks, Biden was reportedly ready to attempt to dissuade Putin from invading. The president was expected to threaten Russia with various sanctions and other punishing economic actions should it go through with any plans to attack Ukraine. U.S. intelligence believes that Putin has not made up his mind to launch a military offensive, and Biden was reportedly set to tell him the U.S. is prepared to take ""substantive economic countermeasures"" that will inflict ""significant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy"" should an invasion happen, a senior administration official told reporters Monday.



The two world leaders spoke for about two hours, beginning at 10:07 a.m. ET and ending at 12:08 p.m. ET, the White House said.

Is Russia about to go to war?

There are good reasons to hope for peace and good reasons to believe Russia means war.

The troop buildup on Ukraine's borders is not unprecedented. Russia sent roughly 100,000 troops there last April as part of a military exercise before pulling those troops back and announcing that they had ""demonstrated their ability to provide a credible defense for the country."" Military leaders and Western analysts interpreted Russia's actions at the time as saber-rattling.

It may be the case that Russia simply wants to bring the U.S. to the table to make demands. After April's military exercise, Biden met with Putin in person for a summit in Geneva last June. Since then their last publicly known conversation was in July.

Russia has previously complained about ""aggression"" from Western countries because of U.S. and NATO naval patrols in the Black Sea and U.S. and British soldiers being present in Ukraine on training missions. Putin said last week that during Tuesday's meeting he would ask Biden for specific agreements that would prohibit NATO from expanding eastward or deploying weapons near Russia's borders.

But Biden is not likely to agree to Russia's demands that NATO must not admit Ukraine to the alliance. And Ukraine's desire to build stronger ties with the West may be what ultimately provokes Russia to act.

Ukraine is at the center of a geopolitical rivalry between the East and the West. The nation was the second-most populous and powerful of the 15 communist states that made up the Soviet Union, with important agricultural, industrial, and military resources. But it has deep ties to Russia that go back all the way to the Middle Ages — Russia traces its founding to the Ukrainian city of Kyiv.

The country itself is divided. Its western half has a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population that favors greater relations with Western Europe. But a largely Russian-speaking population in the east wants closer ties with Russia. There is ongoing violent conflict in the eastern Donbass region of Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists are fighting against the pro-Western government.

Russia would like to see Ukraine come under its control once again. Putin once famously said that the collapse of the Soviet Union was ""the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century."" He seeks to restore Russia to the perceived greatness of the Soviet Union as a superpower, after decades of humiliation following the collapse of the union.

In 2014, under the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Ukraine, Russia annexed Crimea, a peninsula that was in the eastern region of Ukraine, becoming the first European state to annex the territory of another sovereign state since World War II.

Russia could attempt to take more territory from Ukraine under the same pretext, especially if it views the pro-Western government's desire to join NATO as a national security threat. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told CNN that there will be a ""really bloody massacre"" should Putin invade, said the West must draw a red line in Ukraine, and warned that provoking Russia ""will not work.""

Reznikov stressed that an invasion would have ""disastrous"" consequences for the rest of Europe, estimating that as many as 4 to 5 million Ukrainians could become refugees. He also emphasized that Ukraine is a major producer of food for Europe and Africa and that war would disrupt production of those supplies.

What remains unclear is whether the U.S. and the rest of the West are prepared to impose steep costs on Russia for taking such action — although the West previously demonstrated an unwillingness to fight Russia over Crimea.

What would war between Russia and Ukraine mean for me?

The United States' interests in Ukraine are to ensure that the country is stable and sovereign, to act as a buffer against Russia and discourage Putin from taking further military action against other European states.

Before the Russian annexation of Crimea, the U.S. provided Ukraine with an average of more than $200 million in foreign aid per year, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. After Russia's aggressive action in 2014, Washington bolstered aid to Kyiv to more than $600 million annually. The U.S. also provides Ukraine with military training, weapons, and equipment, and NATO allies hold joint military exercises with Ukrainian forces each year.

The U.S. does not recognize Russia's claims to Crimea and has imposed economic sanctions on Russia that will not be lifted until control of the peninsula is returned to Ukraine.

Ukraine wishes to join NATO. In 2020, the country became one of six enhanced opportunity partners, a special status for close NATO allies. But it is not an official NATO ally.

War between Russia and Ukraine would test U.S. and NATO commitments. Biden's administration has already made clear there will be economic consequences for Russia's action. And Congress and other European states would almost certainly approve more foreign aid for Ukraine in the event of war, which could mean additional unfunded government spending.

But that is likely to be the extent of the Western response. It is highly improbable that military intervention from the U.S. or any other state on behalf of Ukraine is politically feasible, or even desired. The U.S. has stated its goal of helping Ukraine defend its ""sovereign territory,"" but military action is not on the table. American troops will not be deployed to fight the Russians any time soon.

If war does break out, it could lead to further disruptions in global energy markets, as Ukraine is a major producer of oil and gas. And if Ukraine's defense minister's predictions about refugees come to fruition, the U.S. may agree to accept some Ukrainian refugees.

President Biden faces the daunting task of balance. He must put enough pressure on Russia to maintain U.S. commitments to Ukraine's sovereignty and independence while avoiding making a promise or threat the U.S. will ultimately not be able to deliver. If he fails, the U.S. will look weaker, America's enemies may be emboldened to take further aggressive action, and potential allies throughout the world would be sent a signal that the United States cannot back up its promises.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iran-issues-battlefield-warning-after-president-trump-deploys-military-forces-to-middle-east,2021-12-07
'Like al Qaeda on steroids': Intelligence officials warn that ISIS is again growing rapidly in Iraq,"Two years after losing its last territory in Iraq, the Islamic State is now rapidly growing a new and more sophisticated presence in the country, intelligence officials told BBC News Monday.

According to Lahur Talabany, a top Kurdish counterterrorism official, the ISIS militants have also now become more skilled and more dangerous than al Qaeda.

""They have better techniques, better tactics, and a lot more finances at their disposal,"" he said. ""They are able to buy vehicles, weapons, food supplies and equipment ... technologically they're more savvy. It's more difficult to flush them out. So, they are like al Qaeda on steroids.""

Talabany, who is head of the Zanyari Agency, one of two intelligence agencies in Iraqi Kurdistan, said he is not sure where exactly the terrorist organization's treasure trove of money has come from but that ISIS seems to have ""a lot more money than al Qaeda had in the old days.""

ISIS has apparently taken advantage of the dispute between Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government by taking control of large swathes of land that have been left unmanned during the conflict. The huge territory, from Diyala to Mosul, which encompasses nearly all of northern Iraq, is now being patrolled by ISIS forces, he said.

Learning from past mistakes, ISIS has gone underground to avoid being targeted, preferring to conduct operations from Iraq's Hamrin Mountains.

""This is the hub for ISIS right now,"" Talabany said, according to the BBC. ""It's a long range of mountains, and very difficult for the Iraqi army to control. There are a lot of hide-outs and caves.""

What's the background?

At its height, ISIS controlled roughly a third of both Iraq and Syria. But in March, the terrorist group was driven from its last territory in either country when Syrian Democratic Forces in a U.S.-led coalition defeated ISIS at Al-Baghuz Fawqani. Later, in another major blow to the terrorist group, leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed during a U.S. special forces raid in Syria.

ISIS had been defeated as both a standing army and a caliphate with their territory gone and leader dead, but many feared that the terrorist group would soon reorganize and grow again.

In an announcement regarding the news of ISIS' territorial defeat in March, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the mission ""hasn't changed"" and that ""we still have work to do to make sure radical Islamic terrorism doesn't continue to grow.""

If the recent intelligence is accurate, then it appears that ISIS has indeed changed tactics and rebuilt.



""We see now the activity increasing, and we think the reorganization stage is over now,"" Talabany said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iran-uranium-enrichment-seizes-tanker,2019-12-23
"Israel, Hamas reportedly agree to ceasefire beginning at 2 a.m. Friday","An end to the violent 11-day conflict between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip appears to be imminent as reports surfaced Thursday afternoon that Israel's security cabinet had unanimously approved a ceasefire.

The two sides were said to be ironing out specific details Thursday on when the ceasefire would be implemented and for how long, and now multiple reports indicate that it will begin at 2 a.m. local time (or 7 p.m. ET Thursday).

Channel 12 News in Israel indicated that the ceasefire was mediated through discussions with neighboring country, Egypt, and that the two sides had come to an agreement on halting the military attacks. Though Israel reportedly made it clear that the ceasefire is subject to full cooperation from Hamas.

""According to sources who attended the cabinet meeting, the [Israel Defense Forces] will immediately cease its attacks in the Gaza Strip. If Hamas continues to fire, the IDF will return to attack and the ceasefire will be canceled immediately,"" the outlet reported.

A Hamas official reportedly told Reuters the ceasefire will be ""mutual and simultaneous.""

The development comes following reports Wednesday that the two sides were hopeful a ceasefire could be reached, even as airstrikes and rocket fire continued on in the region.

""I think that the ongoing efforts regarding the ceasefire will succeed,"" Hamas political official Moussa Abu Marzouk said Wednesday. ""I expect a ceasefire to be reached within a day or two, and the ceasefire will be on the basis of mutual agreement.""

President Joe Biden — who had voiced support for Israel's right to defend themselves to the ire of some progressive lawmakers within the Democratic Party — had ramped up pressure on Israeli leaders to end the fighting in recent days.

Over the course of 11 days of intense fighting, hundreds of rockets have been fired at Israel from Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. Many were successfully intercepted by the country's acclaimed Iron Dome defense system, however, some breached the barrier and struck civilian areas. In response, Israel returned fire.

In all, at least 12 Israelis, including two children, and at least 232 Palestinians, including 65 children, have died as a result of the conflict.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/is-war-coming-between-russia-and-ukraine-heres-what-that-could-mean-for-you,2021-05-20
Breaking: Israel and Hamas militants reportedly agree to ceasefire,"The deadly conflict between Israel and Hamas militants will be coming to an end soon after a ceasefire was reportedly reached between the two parties.

The ceasefire was reported Wednesday by Channel 12 News in Israel.

A senior Hamas official appeared to confirm the news during an interview on Lebanon's al-Mayadeen TV according to Reuters.

""I think that the ongoing efforts regarding the ceasefire will succeed,"" said Hamas political official Moussa Abu Marzouk.

""I expect a ceasefire to be reached within a day or two, and the ceasefire will be on the basis of mutual agreement,"" he added.

CNN's Manu Raju also reported that Hamas officials told CNN that a ceasefire was ""imminent, possibly within 24 hours.""

The conflict has been raging for 10 days during which hundreds of rockets have been fired at Israel from militants in the Gaza Strip. While the nation's vaunted Iron Dome defense system was able to intercept most of the rockets, some were able to slip past onto civilian areas. Palestinians and their allies also rioted and attacked Israelis in several cities across the country.

Israeli authorities say 12 deaths have been documented from the conflict, while on the Palestinian side officials say 228 have perished.

Critics of Israel in the U.S. were angered greatly when President Joe Biden said in a statement that Israel had a right to defend itself against such rocket attacks. Among those was the only Palestinian-American in Congress, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who confronted Biden as he arrived in Michigan to tour a Ford plant.

Earlier on Wednesday the White House said in a readout between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the president had made it clear he expected ""significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire.""

Netanyahu appeared to push back on that demand in a public statement assuring Israeli citizens that he was ""determined to continue this operation until its aim is met.""

Israel's military posts video showing how it has taken down more than 60 miles of Hamas tunnels,"For the last week and a half, Hamas terrorists have been indiscriminately launching rockets into Israel from Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces have been responding with targeted attacks on Hamas assets and personnel — who often hide among civilians and the media.

One of the IDF's top targets has been Hamas' underground tunnel system often referred to as the ""Metro."" The terrorist organization uses the Metro for storing weapons, conducting military operations, surreptitiously moving about Gaza, and carrying out training exercises.

Just last week, the IDF pulled off what became a headline-grabbing attack on a section of the Metro system. The agency duped Hamas into believing IDF troops were initiating a ground attack into Gaza, baiting the terrorists to head to the tunnels. Once the Hamas members were underground, Israel launched a massive air campaign, burying untold numbers of terrorists in their own infrastructure.

The IDF posted a video Wednesday explaining just how effective attacks have been on the Hamas Metro — as well as how extensive the terrorists' tunnel system has been, the New York Post said.

According the video, the Israeli military has taken out 62 miles (100 kilometers) of Metro tunnels so far.

""The Hamas terror organization invested the majority of its finances and efforts over the last decade in digging out a complex tunnel system across the Gaza Strip,"" the video said, adding that the ""extensive project"" was ""in the configuration of a 'metro' network — tunnels connected to each other at intersections and bypasses.""

The Metro, the IDF said, began just as ""individual shafts"" used as hiding places for Hamas operatives after launching rockets.

""The network of tunnels grew and branched off until it became a 'metro' of an internal tunnel system throughout the Gaza Strip,"" the military continued. ""The system enabled military training, mobility, the capacity to carry out and manage military operations without exposing themselves, storage for weaponry, and more.""

The IDF then showed locations of Metro access points and illustrated stages of airstrikes on the system.

IDF spokeswoman Capt. Libby Weiss told the Post that the Metro is ""one of Hamas' most strategic projects, created over the course of years and dug under the people of Gaza near homes, schools and mosques.""



""As a result of IDF activity, more than 62 miles of this network have been destroyed — that's the equivalent of almost a quarter of the NYC subway system,"" Weiss said. ""Rather than investing in the economic development of the Gaza Strip, Hamas sunk tens of millions of dollars in this system.""

IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told the Post that because the tunnels run under civilian areas, the military's airstrikes have been targeting roads above the tunnels in order to ""minimize damage to buildings.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/israel-hamas-agree-to-ceasefire,2021-05-19
Israel reveals 'smoking gun' evidence proving Hamas worked in AP building; reporter contradicts AP president's claims,"Former Associated Press reporter Matti Friedman directly contradicted Associated Press President and CEO Gary Pruitt, who claimed Saturday the AP was unaware that Hamas terrorists were using the same building in Gaza City where AP and other media outlets housed their Gaza bureaus.

What did Pruitt claim?

After Israeli Defense Forces targeted a high-rise building in Gaza Saturday, which housed an AP bureau along with offices for other media outlets including Al Jazeera, the IDF revealed Hamas intelligence forces also occupied the building.

In a statement, Pruitt claimed his staffers ""had no indication"" Hamas worked from the building, and demanded Israel reveal evidence to prove terrorists, in fact, occupied the building.

""The Israeli government says the building contained Hamas military intelligence assets. We have called on the Israeli government to put forward the evidence,"" Pruitt said.

""AP's bureau has been in this building for 15 years. We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building,"" he added. ""This is something we actively check to the best of our ability. We would never knowingly put our journalists at risk.""

But what did Friedman say?

The former AP journalist revealed in a 2014 article for the Atlantic that AP journalists knew about the presence of Hamas terrorists, explaining how Hamas uses the media to disseminate its narrative about the Israel-Palestine conflict.

When Hamas's leaders surveyed their assets before this summer's round of fighting, they knew that among those assets was the international press. The AP staff in Gaza City would witness a rocket launch right beside their office, endangering reporters and other civilians nearby—and the AP wouldn't report it, not even in AP articles about Israeli claims that Hamas was launching rockets from residential areas. (This happened.) Hamas fighters would burst into the AP's Gaza bureau and threaten the staff—and the AP wouldn't report it. (This also happened.) Cameramen waiting outside Shifa Hospital in Gaza City would film the arrival of civilian casualties and then, at a signal from an official, turn off their cameras when wounded and dead fighters came in, helping Hamas maintain the illusion that only civilians were dying. (This too happened; the information comes from multiple sources with firsthand knowledge of these incidents.)



[Paul] Colford, the AP spokesman, confirmed that armed militants entered the AP's Gaza office in the early days of the war to complain about a photo showing the location of a rocket launch, though he said that Hamas claimed that the men ""did not represent the group."" The AP ""does not report many interactions with militias, armies, thugs or governments,"" he wrote. ""These incidents are part of the challenge of getting out the news—and not themselves news.""

Friedman also explained that Hamas knows ""international coverage from the territory could be molded to its needs"" and that reporters can ""be intimidated when necessary and that they would not report the intimidation.""

What did Israel say?

A source close to Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi told the Jerusalem Post that Israeli officials provided the U.S. government with evidence to corroborate their claim that Hamas military assets operated from of the building.

""We showed them the smoking gun proving Hamas worked out of that building,"" the source said. ""I understand they found the explanation satisfactory.""

In fact, officials in multiple Israeli government agencies confirmed the call that took place between President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday was to, in part, show American officials the intelligence confirming Hamas' presence inside the building.

During the call, Biden reaffirmed his ""strong support for Israel's right to defend itself against rocket attacks from Hamas,"" Reuters reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire,2021-05-16

Gadot posted a short statement to her Twitter account on Wednesday after several days of lethal violence in her home country.

""My heart breaks,"" wrote Gadot. ""My country is at war. I worry for my family, my friends. I worry for my people.

""I pray for better days,"" she concluded.

Some supporters of the Palestinian cause replied with vicious vitriol to Gadot's call for peace.

""Gal gadot is an ugly zionist who can't act and is beyond pathetic. time and time again she shows yall that she sides with the ethnic cleansing of palestinians and yall act brand new everytime. f*** that woman,"" responded one Twitter user.

""I'm glad Gal Gadot said what she said. People should see how Israelis have been laundering the genocide of Palestinians under a disingenuous call for the end of a conflict that has never existed, it's always been an extermination campaign,"" claimed activist Asheya Siddiqi.

""Just another reminder that Gal Gadot is a Zionist and has long supported the ethnic cleansing and violence towards Palestinians,"" said another critic.

""Gal Gadot is wrong. Israel is not at 'war' with Palestine. Israel is butchering Palestine. Again,"" responded UK musician James Kennedy.

"Israel destroys Gaza building housing Associated Press, says Hamas intel worked from building","The building that housed the Associated Press' Gaza City bureau was destroyed by Israeli military forces on Saturday, prompting questions about why the media organization allegedly rented office space in the same building where Israeli officials said Hamas terrorists operated.

What happened?

According to the Associated Press, Israeli military alerted the high-rise building's owner on Saturday the building would be imminently destroyed. Within an hour of the warning, three missiles struck and completely destroyed the building.

More from the AP:

For 15 years, the AP's top-floor office and roof terrace were a prime location for covering Israel's conflicts with Gaza's Hamas rulers, including wars in 2009 and 2014. The news agency's camera offered 24-hour live shots as militants' rockets arched toward Israel and Israeli airstrikes hammered the city and its surrounding area this week.

...

The building also housed the offices of Qatari-run Al-Jazeera TV, as well as residential apartments. The Israeli military said it targeted the building because it contained assets of Hamas intelligence agencies, which it said were using media offices as ""human shields."" It did not provide evidence for the claims.

The Israeli Defense Forces said the building was targeted because it housed ""Hamas military intelligence assets.""

""After providing advance warning to civilians & time to evacuate, IDF fighter jets struck a multi-story building containing Hamas military intelligence assets,"" the IDF said. ""The building contained civilian media offices, which Hamas hides behind and deliberately uses as human shields.""

What was the reaction?

While journalists expressed outrage over the AP bureau being destroyed, others wanted to know why, as the IDF claimed, the AP shared a building with Hamas terrorists.

""Will someone ask the @AP if they were paying rent to a designated terrorist organization or were they accepting a gift from a designated terrorist organization?"" conservative radio host Erick Erickson said.

""Are we just going to ignore the fact AP and Al Jazeera worked in the same building as Hamas terrorists?"" Steve Guest, an adviser to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), said.

In response to Piers Morgan calling the airstrike ""appalling,"" conservative writer David Harsanyi said, ""You're not appalled that AP shares a building with Hamas?""

What did the AP say?

AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt said he was ""shocked and horrified"" by the Israeli airstrike.

""We are shocked and horrified that the Israeli military would target and destroy the building housing AP's bureau and other news organizations in Gaza,"" he said in a statement. ""They have long known the location of our bureau and knew journalists were there. We received a warning that the building would be hit.""

""This is an incredibly disturbing development. We narrowly avoided a terrible loss of life. A dozen AP journalists and freelancers were inside the building and thankfully we were able to evacuate them in time,"" Pruitt added.

Israeli leadership urged Ukraine to accept Putin's peace offer and cede territory to Russia,"Israeli leadership urged their Ukrainian counterparts to accept the peace offer made to them by Vladimir Putin.

On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over the phone and urged the Ukrainian president to accept an offer extended by Russia to end the military conflict, the Jerusalem Post reported.

An official with the Ukrainian government said that Zelenskyy did not accept Bennett’s advice.

Bennett reportedly said, “If I were you, I would think about the lives of my people and take the offer.”

To which Zelenskyy responded with, “I hear you.”

The same Ukrainian official told the Jerusalem Post that “Bennett told us to surrender. We have no intention of doing so. We know Putin’s offer is only the beginning.”

Russian leadership said that it would end its invasion if Ukraine ceased military actions, changed its constitution to ensure geopolitical neutrality, recognized Crimea as Russian territory, and recognized the Russian-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

The Israeli Prime Minister’s office has claimed that Israel’s mediation efforts force both Ukrainian and Russian leadership to seek a more cautious and balanced approach to the conflict. In this spirit, Israeli leadership asked the Russian government to cease its requests for military and defense aid from other nations.

According to the Ukrainian official, however, Zelenskyy is growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of results from Bennett’s mediation. The official said that Zelenskyy feels as though Bennett is functioning more as a middle-man who passes along messages from parties in Russia and Ukraine without doing much to help the two nations find an agreeable compromise.

“We don’t need a mailbox,” the official said, “We have enough of those. If Bennett wants to be neutral and mediate, we would expect to see him appoint someone to work on it day and night and try to get a compromise.”

The Ukrainian ambassador to Israel — Yvgeni Kornichuk — is expected to meet with Knesset Chairman Mickey Levi to discuss the details of Zelenskyy’s planned address to Knesset members.

Previously, Kornichuk said that Israel’s mediation efforts were a valuable resource for the Ukrainian government.

He said, “Thank you for the peace effort. This is priceless for us. This is much more important than sales of weapons and of munitions, which we are still fighting for, but we understand [your reasons for not sending them].”

In a Saturday briefing, Zelenskyy reaffirmed his belief that Israeli leadership serves an important role as a mediator.

He said, “I believe [Bennett} can play an important role, because Israel is a country with a lot of history and parallels [to our situation], as well as having a large migration of Jews from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/israeli-actress-gal-gadot-issues-statement-calling-for-peace-and-anti-israel-activists-melt-down,2022-03-12
'It's out of control': Parents slam school district for dismissing concerns about rampant violence following several 'extremely disturbing videos' of students brawling,"Parents with children in Baltimore County Public Schools held a rally on Tuesday to raise awareness about increased violence on campus following multiple viral videos of students fighting. Parents accused school officials of dismissing their concerns while incorrectly insisting the brawls are becoming less frequent.



""It's to the point where it's out of control,"" Darren Badillo, a member of the Baltimore County Parent and Student Coalition, told WBFF. ""We want these kids to be held accountable.""

According to Badillo, there were 23 violent incidents last year. So far this year, Badillo said there have been at least 18 altercations between students.

Baltimore County Public Schools recently held a virtual town hall to discuss parents' concerns regarding the violent assaults on campus. Badillo argued that repeated fighting proves that the district is not doing enough.

""We need to stop with these virtual meetings. You know, the pandemic is over. You know, the public needs to be and they want to come together,"" he said.

The Baltimore County Parent and Student Coalition held a ""stop school violence"" rally on Tuesday, where several parents voiced their concerns.

The coalition president, Amy Adams, told Fox News Digital, ""We were hoping this year would be a better, more stable environment within the schools, but the issues are persistent as evidenced by the extremely disturbing videos.""

Maryland Governor Larry Hogan told WBFF that the amount of fighting occurring in the Baltimore County district is ""outrageous.""

""We put hundreds of millions of dollars into the schools specifically for school resource officers,"" said Hogan.

The governor stated that he believes the answer to stopping the violence is ensuring more school resource officers are on campus. However, according to Baltimore County executive Johnny Olszewski, the schools have been adding more resource officers.

""Just this last budget we added four SRO's on top of the fact that we have floating school resource officers for our elementary schools. We have police officers in every middle school and high school,"" said Olszewski.

The parents accused the school of not having any consequences for students who initiate fighting.

Baltimore County Public Schools Superintendent Darryl Williams fired back at parents in a letter sent home with students. In the letter, Williams insisted violence in the schools is down 11% from this time last year, and out-of-school suspensions are up.

""The intolerable actions of 8.2 percent of students who have engaged in fights and other aggressive behaviors this school year create the impression that violent behavior is the norm and accepted in our schools, and that there are no consequences for aggressive behavior,"" said Williams. ""That is categorically false.""

Adams stated that the school system's response to concerned parents has been disappointing. She said, ""They attempt to dismiss our concerns as a 'false narrative' and use data to show that incidents are decreasing, but we hear from staff that many incidents are not documented. So how accurate is the tracking data?""

The Baltimore Sun reported that Baltimore County Public Schools officials announced a new violence intervention program on Tuesday that is set to launch in January. The program will aim to teach students how to resolve and deescalate conflicts.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/israeli-airstrike-destroys-ap-bureau-gaza,2022-10-26
"It's Valentine's Day, and college students are asked if they'd date those with opposite political views — i.e., Trump supporters","It's Valentine's Day — when the focus of the nation's collective eye (and heart, of course) is on romantic relationships.

With that in mind, Campus Reform's Eduardo Neret hoofed it over to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., to ask students if they'd consider dating folks who held opposite political views.

Now given the campus' reputation for left-leaning sentiments, the most common answer seemed to be some form of — you guessed it — ""No, I hate Donald Trump.""

What did they say?

Upon being asked the question, the first person in the clip took direct aim at the guy who made quick work of Hillary Clinton in 2016, noting that she couldn't date someone who ""supports who's currently in the White House.""

Another student hedged a bit, admitting that dating someone with opposite political views would take some ""really strong extenuating circumstances"" — whatever that means.

Yet another student said she wouldn't even consider dating ""moderates.""



Dating someone with opposing political views would invite ""too much conflict in the relationship,"" another student said.

One student said he'd draw the line if a dating partner was ""pro-life"":

And there was more Trump disdain to come, with one student noting that ""honestly, if they're just overall Trump supporters,"" the dating dealbreaker has arrived.



“If they were a Trump supporter, I don't think I could date them 'cause I feel like in my opinion that shows a little bit about their character,"" yet another student said.

On that note, another student offered that ""at some point your political views could mean you're a bad person.""

But not every student saw things that way: “I think just because you disagree on some topical political issues doesn't mean you have a radically different set of values.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/israeli-leadership-urged-ukraine-to-accept-putin-s-peace-offer-and-cede-territory-to-russia,2020-02-14
"Japan drops pacifist pretensions, unveils $320 billion plan to ready its military for possible conflict with China","Japan announced Friday that it will double its military spending and acquire counterstrike weaponry fit for engaging China in a shooting war.

This move, previously urged by assassinated former Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, signals both a recognition of the geopolitical threat posed by China and a shift away from the pacifist posture adopted by postwar Japan.

What are the details?

The Japanese cabinet approved the new ""National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy and Defense Buildup Program,"" on Friday, thereby committing to increase military spending to 2% of the nation's GDP.

This increase will amount to approximately $320 billion (43 trillion yen) over the next five years, hitting an annual total of nearly $80 billion by 2027, reported the New York Times.

U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said in response to the move, ""Today, Prime Minister Kishida ushered in a new era in the defense of democracy. I want to congratulate him on his leadership in meeting the strategic challenge in a comprehensive fashion. In short, he has put a capital 'D' next to Japan’s deterrence.""



""The Prime Minister is making a clear, unambiguous strategic statement about Japan’s role as a security provider in the Indo-Pacific,"" added Emanuel.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida indicated after the Friday cabinet meeting that Japan had hit a ""turning point"" requiring it to beef up its defense capabilities.

""In Japan’s neighboring countries and regions, there is more obvious shift toward attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by might,"" said Kishida.

Closely aligned with the U.S., the country borders three nations exhibiting varying degrees of hostility: China, Russia, and North Korea.

North Korea remains a major concern, particularly after the communist regime — hell-bent on accelerating its nuclear program — fired ballistic missiles over Japan. However, Tokyo is aware that Kim Jong Un's communist regime is not the greatest threat in the region.

China, alternatively, intends to become the world's biggest superpower by 2050. It is aggressively expanding its reach, increasing its military spending, and ever keen to seize the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands.

Japan's updated National Security Strategy states that the country faces ""the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II,"" with China posing ""the biggest strategic challenge"" to Japan's efforts to maintain peace, safety, and stability for itself and others in the region.

This conclusion mirrors that reached by the Pentagon in its October National Security Strategy report, which stated that ""by the 2030s the United States will, for the first time in its history, face two major nuclear powers as strategic competitors and potential adversaries"": Russia and communist China.

Of the two, China is reckoned to be the far greater threat, as it is “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order, and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.""

With the island nation of Taiwan only 70 miles away, the Japanese government needs to be vigilant, particularly in light of Chinese dictator Xi Jinping's recent claim that Beijing ""will never promise to renounce the use of force ... and [reserves] the option of taking all measures necessary"" against Taiwan and ""interference by outside forces.""



Peace through strength

Whereas Japan previously had a strict self-defense-only postwar principle, Kishida noted that the current Self-Defense Force ""is insufficient"" to engage successfully in this new environment. Thus ""a major change to Japan's postwar security policy"" is required.



The Associated Press reported that Japan's planned counterstrike capability will be implemented in 2026 at the earliest and will likely depend upon the deployment of long-range Tomahawk missiles.

The deployment of such weaponry will mark an end to a 1956 Japanese government policy prohibiting counterstrike capability except as a final defense measure.

Extra to obtaining standoff missiles that could trip up potential attempts by Beijing to crush its neighbors at a distance, Japan seeks to have Mitsubishi Heavy Industry produce a surface-to-ship guided missile.

Christopher Johnstone, Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, ""An effective Japanese counterstrike capability would set the stage for a far deeper level of command-and-control integration with the United States than exists today.""

U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement, ""Japan’s goal to significantly increase defense investments will also strengthen and modernize the U.S.-Japan Alliance. The new strategy reinforces Prime Minister Kishida’s deep commitment to international peace and nuclear nonproliferation.""

Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese communist regime, denounced Japan's new strategic plan, saying that Tokyo was ""groundlessly discrediting China.""



""Hyping up the so-called China threat to find an excuse for its military build-up is doomed to fail,"" said Wang.

Just days before the Japanese cabinet's approval of the new plan, China sent two destroyers and various other naval vessels through straits near Japan in an apparent signal of the People's Liberation Army's “capabilities in safeguarding China’s national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/it-s-out-of-control-parents-slam-school-district-for-dismissing-concerns-about-rampant-violence-following-several-extremely-disturbing-videos-of-students-brawling,2022-12-16
Japan moves to accept Ukrainian refugees and rebuild its military as countries continue to respond to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,"Japan announced this past week that it would accept Ukrainian refugees displaced by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and will send bulletproof vests to Kiev.

Historically, Japan has resisted taking in refugees and has maintained a pacifistic approach to foreign conflicts since the end of World War II. The Washington Post reported that Japan decided to break with its more isolationist tendencies “without ‘gaiastu,’ or foreign pressure.”

It is believed that Russia’s recent attack on a Ukrainian power plant inspired the Japanese government to accelerate debates over its pre-existing defense and national security policies. The Japanese government has been growing wary of China’s rising presence on the global stage and has been reevaluating its approach to stave off the growing territorial threat that China poses.

Akihisa Shiozaki, a member of Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party, indicated that the Japanese government is growing increasingly skeptical of the United Nations’ ability to reign in the aggression of its member states.

He said, “It’s a big awakening that there are limitations to what the U.N. can do, limitations to what diplomacy can do, limitations to what economic sanctions can do.”

Regarding the shift in Japan’s policy approach, Shiozaki said, “It’s not about rewriting the boundaries of what Japan can do, but filling in the details of what we may not fully anticipate, or may have overlooked in our preparation.”

He added that Japan’s willingness to accept Ukrainian refugees enables the Japanese government to begin preparing for future refugee crises that may arise.

He said, “In considering future crisis scenarios in East Asia, including the Taiwan contingency, it is necessary to build and maintain the capacity to respond to refugees in times of emergency, even in peacetime.”

Japanese leaders are looking to their former ally, Germany, to see how a pacifist nation might reinstitute defensive measures.

Yoichi Funabashi, the chairman of the Asia Pacific Initiative think tank, said, “Japan is watching now, very much attentively, how Germany is responding to the Ukraine crisis and how fundamentally Germany is transforming to adapt itself to new reality.”

Within a week of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that Germany would vastly increase its spending on defense.

And, it appears, that Japan is following suit.

At a recent press conference, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said, “Japan needs to implement a fundamental upgrade of its defense capabilities.”

Shinzo Abe, the former Prime Minister of Japan, said in a recent T.V. interview that the ongoing reconfiguring the of the global power structure should be cause for the Japanese government to reconsider its approach to self-defense.

Abe said, “We should firmly consider various options when we talk about how we can protect Japan and the lives of its people in this reality.”

He also suggested that Japan should offer to hold nuclear weapons on behalf of the United States as a preemptive defensive measure.

Abe said, “In NATO, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy take part in nuclear sharing, hosting American nuclear weapons. We need to understand how security is maintained around the world and not consider it taboo to have an open discussion.”

Twitter mocks Jen Psaki for nonsensical gender identity answer to question about stock market chaos,"Those who were seeking guidance from the White House on chaotic and dramatic developments in the stock market were befuddled by the nonsensical answer from the White House press secretary Wednesday.

Social media erupted after a scheme from users on a Reddit stock market thread threatened to damage Wall Street hedge funds by driving up the price of the stocks from GameStop, a company many had heavily bet against.

When White House press secretary Jen Psaki was questioned about the incident, she offered a bizarre response.

""Well, I'm also happy to repeat that we have the first female Treasury secretary and a team that's surrounding her,"" Psaki said.

""Often questions about market we'll send to them, but our team is of course, our economy team including Secretary Yellen and others are monitoring the situation,"" she continued.

""It's a good reminder though, that the stock market isn't the only measure of the health of our economy, it doesn't reflect how working and middle class families are doing,"" Psaki added.

The odd answer elicited mockery and jeers from many on social media.

""Pitch-perfect expression of the defining neo-liberal mentality here. We have an extraordinary political & cultural conflict involving inter-generational wealth, vast disparities of power, and a deeply corrupt financial system, and this is all the Biden WH has to say about it,"" responded Glen Greenwald.

""Dude. No f***ing way. She first begins to answer the question by bringing identity politics into it. Literally saying 'we have the first female treasury secretary', as if that has any bearing on anything being asked. Omfg,"" replied another user.

""Oh, the FIRST FEMALE treasury secretary. Well, in that case, why ask any questions? Let's all put on our COVID masks, circle up (six feet apart), and meditate together instead,"" replied independent journalist Kevin Gosztola.

""[J]en psaki reminded reporters that yellen is the first female treasury secretary like how you jingle keys in front of a baby. i can't. these people are just transparently manipulative lol,"" replied musician Soul Khan.

While some Wall Street firms signaled that they had given in by Wednesday and swallowed a significant loss in the debacle, others cautioned that retail investors will likely lose a lot of money trying to jump onboard the bandwagon.

NYC workers weld gates shut at park in Jewish community over social distancing — so they cut the lock in defiance,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was excoriated online over the extreme steps ordered to keep a park shut in a large Jewish community, but the neighborhood residents forced it open in defiance.

The incident was the latest in a series of troubling examples of a double standard against the Jewish community while others are praised while ignoring social distancing guidelines.

Various videos appeared on social media of workers from the New York City Park Department welding the gates shut at the Middleton Playground in Brooklyn on Monday.

Many on social media blamed Mayor de Blasio and demanded that the park reopen. Critics pointed to the lack of criticism for the many Black Lives Matter protests where participants ignored social distancing guidelines.

Later on Monday, members of the community took matters into their own hands and cut the locks keeping them out of the park.

The parks department told the New York Post that it had gone to the unusual extreme of welding the park gates shut because locks had been cut numerous times previously.

""At this playground, a temporary measure was used to shut the playground after it was breached,"" said spokeswoman Anessa Hodgson to the Post. ""It will be unwelded today and replaced with a lock.""



But within hours, dozens of Hasidic locals cheered as three men snipped open one of the gates with bolt cutters.

The defiant act found a lot of support online, including that of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who replied, ""Bravo.""

Experts have been cautioning against reopening too quickly from the lockdowns over the coronavirus, but many have criticized the competing and often contradictory guidance from experts on the proper virus response.

Miami man with gun stop anti-Semitic attack on Jewish family,"Florida police are investigating an alleged hate-fueled incident where a group of young men terrorized a Jewish family, who were visiting from Teaneck, New Jersey. The men shouted anti-Semitic threats at the family, but stopped the intimidating harassment when a man with a gun intervened, according to several reports.

Eric Orgen and his family were visiting Bal Harbour, located a few miles north of Miami Beach. Orgen, his wife Karen, his 16-year-old daughter, and Mark Schwartz, the deputy mayor of Teaneck, had just left a synagogue in the area and were walking on the sidewalk of Collins Avenue.

Four men said to be in their 20s in a white SUV allegedly drove up to the family and began screaming anti-Semitic remarks, ""F*** you, Jew"" and ""Die Jew."" They also said they were going to rape his wife and daughter, according to a Facebook post written by Orgen. The group reportedly threw garbage and a water bottle at the family while yelling, ""Free Palestine!""

""They just started screaming some derogatory things towards Jewish people out the window,"" Orgen told WPEC-TV. ""My first thought was just making sure my wife and daughter were behind me so I could take the brunt of anything that was going to happen.""

A driver of an Audi was right behind the SUV and allegedly witnessed the hateful harassment. The motorist, who was armed, got out of his car and ""pulled his gun to protect us and chased them as they drove away,"" Orgen claimed. ""So thankful that a total stranger stepped up to protect us!""

Orgen reported the incident to local law enforcement, which is investigating the alleged incident.

""It's a scary world we live in but the world is big enough for everyone to live peacefully. We all bleed red,"" Orgen told WSVN-TV, adding that he believed the incident was a hate crime.

Bal Harbour Mayor Gabriel Groisman issued a statement on the reported incident.

""Bal Harbour Police Department is actively investigating the incident, and I am confident that they will track down the perpetrators,"" Groisman wrote on Facebook. ""We have ZERO TOLERANCE for criminal conduct in our municipality, and we will do everything in our power to keep all residents and visitors in Bal Harbour safe.""

Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava issued a statement regarding recent anti-Semitic incidents in South Florida that began following the commencement of the most recent Israel-Gaza conflict.

""Acts of hate and violence against any community are not tolerated in Miami-Dade County,"" Cava said. ""Hate and intolerance contradict the foundations of our community – a place where so many generations of people found a safe home after fleeing their own countries to build a new life with their families.""

""As a member of the Jewish community and the first Jewish Mayor of Miami-Dade, acts of antisemitism in our County cut especially close to home,"" she continued. ""They also deepen my commitment to ensure Miami-Dade remains a place where all people are welcomed, respected, and made to feel at home, regardless of where they come from or their faith.""

On May 14, Miami police arrested Joseph Bounds, who was driving a van that was covered in anti-Semitic slurs and swastikas disrupting a pro-Israel rally in Boca Raton. The vehicle flew Palestinian flags, and had hateful remarks such as ""Jews killed Jesus,"" ""Jews are not white,"" ""vax the Jews,"" and ""Hitler was right."" There were at least six men raising their arms in the Nazi salute, according to the Miami Herald.

Jewish college student is given ultimatum: Cancel your trip to Israel or you will be kicked out of student government,"A Jewish student at McGill University and a member of the school's student government is being threatened to cancel her trip to Israel or face impeachment.

Second-year student Jordyn Wright had planned to participate in a trip to Israel this winter break sponsored by Hillel Montreal called ""Face to Face."" The trip, Wright says in a Facebook post about the incident, would consist of ""visiting Israel and the Palestinian territories to meet with politicians, journalists, and locals from all sides to better understand a very nuanced geopolitical conflict.""

She continued, ""As a Jew, my connection to Israel is a core aspect of my identity, and I hoped that this trip would help me to experience Israel through a new lens.""

But during a Nov. 28 student government meeting, Wright was told that if she proceeded with plans to go on the trip, there would be consequences. Wright said that due to her intention to participate in the trip, the council ""voted to call for my resignation from my positions in student government.""

She claims that she was also given an ultimatum by the school's Science Executive Committee: ""Either I withdraw from the trip, or I resign from my position. If I do not resign, I am being implicitly threatened with impeachment upon my return.""

""This is not the first time that Jewish students at McGill have been bullied out of student government,"" Wright admitted in the post. ""Two years ago, three students were voted off of the SSMU Board of Directors simply for being Jewish or connected to pro-Israel organizations. Last year, a Political Science summer exchange course taught at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was the source of a controversy in which pro-Israel students were harassed and cyber-bullied.""



According to The College Fix, Wright has said that, in defiance of the threats, she plans to go on the trip.

A news release by the student government argues that the real issue they had with Wright's trip was that it was a free trip from Hillel Montreal. Accepting gifts such as this ""compromises [student government representatives'] ability to be perceived as impartial when representing the entire student body on the Board of Directors,"" they say.

Other members are not so sure. In an open letter to the board of directors, some students are defending Wright, saying they ""believe the direction of the debate was focused on a specific member, Jordyn Wright … in a way that was startling and unwarranted. We are not surprised that Councillor Wright subsequently expressed that she felt targeted and attacked during this session, and we agree that the nature of the motion and its amendments as adopted by the session were hostile, directed, and should be a matter of wider concern.""

The letter further calls the recent incident a ""mistake"" that must be ""rectified.""

Hillel Montreal published a Facebook post of its own in support of Wright, saying it is ""deeply concerned and gravely disappointed"" by the motion passed by the student government at McGill.

Immigrant Jewish vendor removed from immigrant street food festival following pressure from anti-Israel bigots,"In what appeared to be a blatant display of anti-Semitism, the organizers of a popular street food festival in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, decided to remove a Jewish vendor from its ""Father's Day"" event following pressure from anti-Israel activists.

The event, called ""A Taste of Home,"" was designed to celebrate international cuisine from immigrant communities. But following rumors of protest, one immigrant-based business, Jewish vendor Moshava, was told it was no longer welcome.

What happened?

In a social media post over the weekend, one of the event's organizer's, ""Eat Up the Borders,"" announced that ""in order to best serve our guests, we decided to remove one of our food vendors for Sunday's event so that we could deliver an optimal experience for all,"" adding that ""this decision came from listening to the community we wish to serve and love.""

Notwithstanding its decision to disinvite Moshava from the event, EUTB reiterated its commitment to ""give vendors from all nationalities a platform to showcase their talents.""

Moshava responded to the news in an Instagram post on Saturday, expressing that it was ""deeply saddened"" by the organization's decision.





""We have some unfortunate news to share with all of you. We won't be attending 'The Taste of Home' event, this Sunday, on Father's Day. We are deeply saddened by this,"" the restaurant said. ""The organizers of the event heard rumors of a protest happening because of us being there and decided to uninvite us from fear that the protesters would get aggressive and threaten their event. We were really hoping that the organizers [EUTB and Sunflower Philly] would step up to the plate and defend local, small and immigrant based businesses, no matter where they are from (as per their so called 'mission statement') but By the looks of it fear, violence, and intimidation got the best of them.""



""We really do hope that in the future you don't succumb to such antisemitic and dividing [rhetoric] and keep true to your words of a safe environment for all religions and nationalities- not just all of them except Israeli and Jewish ones,"" Moshava added.

What else?

News of Moshava's removal sparked immediate backlash online, as thousands of commenters replied to the Israeli restaurant's post with varying degrees of outrage.

The news even caught the attention of Democratic Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, who called the organizers' decision to surrender to the ""threats of bigots"" and remove Moshava ""completely unacceptable.""

Following the blowback, EUTB and fellow organizer Sunflower Philly, a local art-centered nonprofit, decided to pull the plug on the entire event.

""Our mistake this time, with not only our event partners, but in general was not educating ourselves. And not properly making sure that everyone is properly represented. So that's where we made the decision to cancel the event,"" said Melvin Powell, the executive director of Sunflower Philly, in a statement.

Anything else?

In a follow-up post after the event's cancellation, Moshava thanked all those who reached out in support of their cause and noted that the restaurant is ""actively working"" with event organizers to try to ""educate and grow together in a safe space for everyone.""

""Although we were disappointed with how the situation was greatly mishandled we do not believe the organizers intention came from an antisemitic place but the threats they were receiving to their event were,"" the restaurant added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jewish-family-miami-antisemitic-gun,2021-06-21
"Jews attacked by pro-Palestinian protesters in Toronto, anti-Semitic chants hurled in London","There were two disturbing incidents directed against Jews this weekend as tensions flared from the current Israel-Gaza conflict. Anti-Semitic chants were shouted from a pro-Palestine caravan in London and Jews were attacked during a pro-Palestine rally in Toronto.

There was a large pro-Palestinian rally at Nathan Philips Square in downtown Toronto on Saturday, where more than 5,000 Canadians showed their support for Palestine in the Israel-Gaza conflict.

There was also a much smaller pro-Israel rally that took place in Toronto. The pro-Israel demonstration needed police protection from the members of the pro-Palestine protest.

At one point on Saturday, members from both protests were together in the streets. Video shows pro-Palestinian members violently attacking Jews, striking them with makeshift weapons such as a flagpole with a Palestine flag.

(Content Warning: Graphic video):

The Toronto Police issued a statement on the assault:



The Toronto Police Service is aware of a separate assault on a man by several people that has been circulating on social media today. This incident took place outside of Nathan Phillips Square and is being actively investigated by police. The public are also asked to please contact 52 Division with any information, including images or videos. The Service will provide an update as soon as possible.

Toronto Mayor John Tory said he had seen the video.



""I have been in touch with (Toronto Police) Chief James Ramer and have made available to him a video of a particularly disturbing incident which had been sent to me,"" Tory said, according to CP24. ""Hate, anti-Semitism and violence have no place in our city.""

There was another ugly incident this weekend when a pro-Palestinian caravan drove around London shouting anti-Semitic chants. There was a convoy of at least seven vehicles plastered with pro-Palestinian messages and Palestinian flags. The caravan was honking their cars and a person is heard screaming, ""F*** the Jews! F*** their daughters! F*** their mothers! Rape their daughters! We have to send a message!""

At least four people have been arrested for being involved with the caravan.

""The four were arrested on suspicion of 'racially aggravated public order offenses,' according to the Metropolitan Police,"" the Times of Israel reported.

""This behavior was utterly shocking and will not be tolerated. I understand that this would have caused considerable concern within the community and we have arranged extra patrols in the St. John's Wood and Golders Green areas this evening,"" a Metropolitan Police superintendent said in a statement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jewish-student-israel-trip-ultimatum,2021-05-16
Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh provokes liberal wrath for unapologetically defending unborn life,"University of Michigan football head coach Jim Harbaugh invoked the wrath of pro-abortion advocates after speaking at a pro-life event where he defended unborn lives.

Harbaugh is a devout Catholic.

What did Harbaugh say?

Speaking at a Plymouth Right to Life dinner on Sunday, Harbaugh delivered a ""pro-life testimony"" in which he forcefully defended unborn humans.

""I believe in having the courage to let the unborn be born,” Harbaugh said, the Detroit Catholic reported.

""I love life. I believe in having a loving care and respect for life and death. My faith and my science are what drives these beliefs in me,"" Harbaugh added before quoting Jeremiah 1:5 and saying, ""Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. Before you were born, I set you apart. I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.""

The former NFL coach of the year later said that he does not believe the government has a compelling interest to permit abortion.

There are many things one may hold to be immoral, but the government appropriately allows because of some greater good or personal or constitutional right.



Ultimately, I don’t believe that is the case with abortion. Yes, there are conflicts between the legitimate rights of the mother and the rights of the unborn child. One resolution might involve incredible hardship for the mother, family and society. Another results in the death of an unborn person.

Harbaugh told the dinner crowd that he has been pro-life since a young age, and admitted that his view shapes his relationship with his family, friends, and even the players he coaches.

""In God’s plan, each unborn human truly has a future filled with potential, talent, dreams and love,"" Harbaugh said. ""I have living proof in my family, my children, and the many thousands that I’ve coached that the unborn are amazing gifts from God to make this world a better place. To me, the right choice is to have the courage to let the unborn be born.""

What was the reaction?

Even though Harbaugh has never hidden his pro-life views, his remarks evoked a sharp reaction from pro-abortion advocates, who ferociously condemned him.

""This might be a difficult concept for Jim Harbaugh of any anti-choice person to grasp … but if you don’t want an abortion, just don’t get one. Not that hard,"" sports commentator Jemele Hill reacted.

""F*** Jim Harbaugh and everyone who believes this way. Forcing people to give birth is not courage,"" one person reacted.

""As a die hard Michigan fan, F*** Jim Harbaugh,"" one Michigan fan reacted.

""No one who actively attempts to deny women their most basic rights should ever be allowed to hold a position of influence at a public university. That incudes (sic) University of Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh and his anti-woman fundraising. He's a public employee. Fire his a**,"" another person said.

""Funny because Jim Harbaugh has had no problem traveling to other states to lose things before,"" one person mocked.

""F*** Jim Harbaugh, may the University of Michigan 86 him before his contract goes full-term,"" another person reacted.

""Lucky for Jim Harbaugh that no matter how many times Ohio State f**** him, he can't get pregnant,"" another person mocked.

""F*** you, Jim Harbaugh, you sanctimonious prick,"" one person said.

""I hope Michigan donors immediately cease supporting Harbaugh,"" another person reacted.

While pro-abortion activists may want Harbaugh to lose his job, he is staying put for years to come as Michigan's head football coach.

In February, Harbaugh signed a 5-year contract extension worth $36.7 million. And considering he just led Michigan to its first Big Ten conference title in nearly two decades, Harbaugh isn't going anywhere.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jewish-vendor-removed-immigrant-food-festival,2022-07-19
Jim Jordan surprises activist with evidence to squash his credibility after activist claimed Justice Alito leaked court ruling,"Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) exposed on Thursday the credibility of the man who accuses Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito of leaking a court ruling in 2014.

What is the background?

Former pro-life advocate Rob Schenck claims Alito told a mutual friend the outcome of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby before the court announced its ruling. Schenck disclosed his allegations in a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts this summer, which the New York Times reported on last month.

The Supreme Court, however, has defended Alito, who has maintained his innocence. Other key players in the story, such as the mutual friend, also deny that Alito leaked the ruling, and the Times could not uncover any definitive proof corroborating Schenck's claims.

What did Jordan do?

During a House Judiciary Committee hearing focused on Supreme Court ethics and Schenck's claims, Jordan addressed Schenck directly and demonstrated that he has a history of being untruthful.

After confirming with Schenck that he maintains his claims about Alito, Jordan reminded Schenck of a book he wrote four years ago. In that book, Schenck wrote about another Supreme Court case that involved his brother.

Jordan read an excerpt from the book, which says:

With a single rap of the gavel, Chief Justice William Rehnquist announced: ""We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-1065, Reverend Paul Schenck and Dwight Saunders vs. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York."" Paul and I winked at each other, knowing we had made history with that ""Reverend"" in his name. It had been a minor victory when we persuaded the court that ""Rev."" should remain before Paul's name, even though we had been told repeatedly that legal briefs never included such titles. Paul knew that even if the justices didn't see it that way, our supporters and opponents needed to. ""Reverend Paul Schenck"" ensured we could cast the conflict as a religious liberty case and not one about blockading clinics.

Jordan then drove home his point.

""You thought it was important that ... the title 'reverend' be in front of Paul's name, is that right?"" the congressman asked.

""Because we saw [the case] as a religious liberty matter and that would make it clear that it fit in that category,"" Schenck responded.

""Did Chief Justice Rehnquist really say that the way I just read it from your book?"" Jordan followed up.

The question clearly rattled Schenck, who began hedging.

""Uhhh,"" he said with a shaky voice. ""I can't say that I remember.""

When Jordan noted that Schenck was certain about minute details just a few years ago, Schenck admitted, ""I would have to go back and review that.""

""We did go back, and I've got the transcript right here,"" Jordan fired back.

SHOCK MOMENT: Jordan Confronts Dem Witness With Transcript & Audio, Accuses Him Of Lying To Congress www.youtube.com

Not only did Jordan produce the court transcript from the case involving Schenck's brother — revealing that, in fact, then-Chief Justice Rehnquist did not refer to his brother as a ""reverend"" — but he obtained audio of Rehnquist that confirmed the accuracy of the transcript. Jordan thus demonstrated that Schenck lied in his book.

"Hunter Biden agrees to pay child support, delaying contempt proceedings","Hunter Biden, son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, has agreed to pay child support to the mother of one of his children, earning a delay in contempt proceedings from a court that ordered him to hand over his financials.

What are the details?

Lunden Roberts, 28, an Arkansas woman who was formerly a stripper in Washington, D.C., has been fighting for Biden to provide support for the 17-month-old boy they share. Earlier this month, Arkansas Circuit Clerk Judge Holly Meyer officially declared Biden, 49, to be the child's biological father, citing a DNA test, following months of Biden claiming otherwise.

After Biden apparently failed to hand over sufficient financials, Judge Meyer ordered him last week to appear before her court Jan. 29 to explain why he shouldn't be held in contempt, Page Six reported.

But that contempt hearing has now been pushed back to March 1, after Biden agreed to pay Roberts child support in a court filing posted Monday.

The amount of temporary monthly support has been redacted in the document, and Judge Meyer wrote that the amount may be amended later ""to rectify any inequities that might result from setting support without having all of the relevant information.""

The judge added, ""The Court reserves the judgment on temporary and final child support until after adequate discovery is completed and relevant evidence is available for a child support determination.""

Judge Meyer previously issued a protective order to keep Biden's financials private in the lawsuit. The case is high-profile, given questions over the income Biden received from foreign business deals — particularly from Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma, where Biden served as a board member during and after his father's time as vice president and point man to the nation during the Obama administration.

Biden is accused of using his father's name and influence to gain a spot on the board — in a position that paid at least $50,000 a month — despite his apparent lack of credentials and background for the job.

Anything else?

Burisma has been under multiple corruption investigations in Ukraine, and Biden's connection to the firm continues to fall under scrutiny as House Democrats seek the impeachment of President Donald Trump over allegations that the president sought to have Biden's involvement with the firm investigated.

On Monday, White House defense team member and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi made Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma a focus of her argument before the Senate, Townhall reported.

Bondi told the upper chamber, ""Multiple House Democrat witnesses, including those from the Department of State, the National Security Council, and others, unanimously testified there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest.""

Joe Biden cancer nonprofit gave millions to top executives,"The Biden Cancer Initiative, the nonprofit that former Vice President Joe Biden established two years ago after leaving the White House, spent nearly two-thirds of its budget on staff compensation.

The Biden Cancer Initiative, a nonprofit to support cancer prevention and research, doled out high salaries to executives, according to a report from the Washington Free Beacon. The organization's president, Greg Simon, was paid $224,539 in 2017 and $429,850 in 2018.

Biden Cancer Initiative salaries made up nearly 65% of its total expenditures. The organization raised and spent $4.8 million over the two years it was in operation, and more than $3 million of that amount went to salaries, compensation, and benefits, according to 2017 and 2018 tax forms. The Biden Cancer Initiative spent $1.7 million on other expenses, including $740,000 for conferences, conventions, and meetings.

Charity Navigator, a website that rates charities for effectiveness, said charities ""spending less than a third of their budget on program expenses are simply not living up to their missions.""

The Biden Cancer Initiative did not cut a single grant check to other organizations. However, the nonprofit was not established as a grant-providing entity.



Many of the executives who were paid six figures at the Biden Cancer Initiative previously worked for the Obama administration's ""Cancer Moonshot"" program, that was created to ""accelerate cancer research"" and ""aims to make more therapies available to more patients, while also improving our ability to prevent cancer and detect it at an early stage.""

The report questions if the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee's organization ""allowed associates to profit off their access to him.""

The organization's mission was to ""develop and drive implementation of solutions to accelerate progress in cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis, research, and care, and to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes.""



Biden and his wife Jill left the organization's board in April 2019 to avoid a conflict of interest as he prepared to launch his presidential campaign. The Biden Cancer Initiative suddenly shuttered on July 11, 2019.

""Today, we are suspending activities given our unique circumstances. We remain personally committed to the cause, but at this time will have to pause efforts,"" Greg Simon, president of the Biden Cancer Initiative, said. ""We thank the community for their incredible response to our mission to improve the cancer journey for patients and to improve outcomes for all patients for generations to come.""

Fortune reported in July 2019 that the ""nonprofit had trouble maintaining momentum"" without the involvement of the Biden's. ""And the roles played by Biden allies and health care-related firms in aiding the foundation's activities have raised questions about their potential interests if Biden won the presidency.""



An Associated Press report from June of last year warned about the possible influence issues with Biden's close ties to health care companies. ""The nonprofit's reliance on health care industry partners poses concerns.""

Several of the health care companies Biden touted while the initiative was operating had financial and regulatory interests with the federal government.

Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University, asked if Biden was elected as president, would his administration ""give favorable treatment for anyone who supported his foundation in the past?""

Biden considers sending cash payments to Central American countries amid border crisis: report,"President Joe Biden is considering a new plan that would send American taxpayer money to countries in Latin America in hopes an economic boost would alleviate problems that force citizens in those countries from migrating north to the United States.

News of the plan broke as Biden continues to grapple with a record-breaking migrant surge and intensifying border crisis that his administration has attempted to downplay.

In fact, Customs and Border Protection data revealed that 172,000 migrants attempted to illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border in March alone, the highest number in more than one decade and an increase of 71% compared to February 2021.

What are the details?

According to Reuters, the Biden administration is considering a ""conditional cash transfer program"" to help solve problems in the Northern Triangle region Central America, which includes the countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.

Roberta Jacobson, the White House's southern border coordinator, revealed the existence of the plan. Jacobson did not, however, say exactly who might receive taxpayer dollars and how much money would be spent on solving economic problems in the Northern Triangle.

""We're looking at all of the productive options to address both the economic reasons people may be migrating, as well as the protection and security reasons,"" Jacobson said.

""The one thing I can promise you is the U.S. government isn't going to be handing out money or checks to people,"" she added.

However, an official with knowledge of the plan told Reuters ""the options for cash transfers would be to channel funds to individuals through international or local non-governmental organizations that would vet them.""

What is the background?

Biden has already asked for ""$4 billion in development aid to Central America over four years to address underlying causes of migration,"" Reuters reported.

Biden's budget proposal, which released this week, requested $861 million for the first installment of that effort. Reuters called Biden's request ""a sharp increase from the roughly $500 million in aid this year.""

More from Reuters:

A spokesman for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which administers foreign aid, told Reuters in a statement that it is already using cash transfers in programs ""to help people meet their basic needs"" in the wake of severe hurricanes in Central America in late 2020. USAID is considering expanding the efforts going forward, the spokesman said.



The United States in the past has used the USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives to fund work-for-cash programs in post-conflict nations such as Colombia. Such programs can include labor-intensive rural road-building projects.

Anything else?

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan announced Friday that Jacobson would be leaving the Biden administration by the end of April.

The New York Times called the timing of the news ""striking,"" but Jacobson downplayed the significance of her departure.

Joe Biden explodes after reporter confronts him with simple question about Ukraine 'conflict of interest',"Joe Biden snapped at a reporter Friday who confronted him about whether his diplomatic work with Ukraine as vice president constituted a conflict of interest because of his son's business dealings in Ukraine at the same time.

""How was your role as vice president in charge of policy in Ukraine and your son's job in Ukraine, how is that not a conflict of interest?"" the reporter asked during the SEIU Unions for All Summit in Los Angeles.

In response, Biden raised his voice, angrily pointed his finger at the reporter, and demanded that the media focus on Trump instead.

""It's not a conflict of interest. There has been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else — period,"" he snapped. ""I'm not going to respond to that.""

""Let's focus on the problem,"" he continued. ""Focus on [President Trump], what he's doing that no president has ever done — no president!""

The Ukraine controversy is clearly taking a toll on Biden as Friday's incident was not the first time he has lost his cool over questions related to the work of his son, Hunter, in Ukraine, which came while Biden managed high-level diplomacy with the nation.

While campaigning in Iowa last month, Biden snapped at Fox News reporter Peter Doocy, who questioned Biden about the apparent conflict of interest.

In response, Biden stuck his finger close to Doocy's face and told him to ""ask the right questions.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-cancer-initiative-nonprofit,2019-10-05
Joe Biden says he broke his foot after exiting the shower and grabbing his dog's tail,"Former Vice President Joe Biden finally revealed exactly how he broke his foot, and it is not your garden variety way of suffering such an injury. Also in the CNN interview, Biden said he would call on Americans to wear face masks for 100 days, and talked about his family's business dealings.

On Saturday, there was news that the 78-year-old Democrat was injured, and the initial reports stated that Biden had suffered a twisted ankle from playing with his dog. On Sunday, the former vice president visited an orthopedist in Newark, Delaware, who found that Biden had sustained a hairline fracture.

""Initial X-rays did not show any obvious fracture, but his clinical exam warranted more detailed imaging,"" said Kevin O'Connor, Biden's physician. ""Follow-up CT scan confirmed hairline (small) fractures of President-elect Biden's lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones, which are in the mid-foot. It is anticipated that he will likely require a walking boot for several weeks.""

On Thursday, Biden appeared on CNN and told the story of how he hurt his foot.



""What happened was I got out of the shower. I got a dog and anybody who's been around my house knows — dropped, little pup dropped a ball in front of me. And for me to grab the ball,"" Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper.

""And I'm walking through this little alleyway to get to the bedroom,"" Biden stated. ""And I grabbed the ball like this and he ran. And I'm joking, running after him and grab his tail. And what happened was that he slid on a throw rug. And I tripped on the rug he slid on. That's what happened. Oh man, not a very exciting story.""



Biden was allegedly playing with his dog named ""Major,"" one of his two German shepherds. The other is named ""Champ.""

Biden's campaign stated that the former vice president might have to wear a walking boot for ""several weeks,"" but he was seen without the medical boot on Thursday when he arrived at The Queen theater in Wilmington, Delaware, for the CNN interview.

Also in Thursday's CNN interview, Biden vowed that his family's business dealings would not conflict with any White House responsibilities.

""My son, my family, will not be involved in any business, any enterprise, that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict, with the appropriate distance from, the presidency and government,"" Biden said.



There has been much speculation about purported overseas business dealings by Biden's son and brother following the release of emails that were reportedly from Hunter Biden's laptop.

On the topic of the coronavirus, Biden said he would call on Americans to wear face masks for 100 days.

""Just 100 days to mask. Not forever — 100 days,"" Biden said. ""I think we'll see a significant reduction if that occurs with vaccinations and masking, to drive down the numbers considerably.""

In October, Biden hinted that he would implement a mask mandate on federal property.

Philly Archbishop says Biden should be denied Holy Communion,"The archbishop emeritus of Philadelphia proclaimed that Joe Biden should be denied the sacrament of Holy Communion. The former archbishop maintains that his opinion is not ""political,"" but rather a ""pastoral concern.""

Charles Chaput said that despite Biden being Catholic, the former vice president should not receive Holy Communion. Chaput asserts that Biden's support for the ""grave moral evil"" of abortion should disqualify him from Holy Communion.

Chaput voiced his viewpoint in First Things, a religious journal aimed at ""advancing a religiously informed public philosophy for the ordering of society.""

""Public figures who identify as 'Catholic' give scandal to the faithful when receiving Communion by creating the impression that the moral laws of the Church are optional,"" Chaput wrote. ""And bishops give similar scandal by not speaking up publicly about the issue and danger of sacrilege.""



""Those bishops who publicly indicate in advance that they will undertake their own dialogue with President-elect Joseph Biden and allow him Communion effectively undermine the work of the task force established at the November bishops' conference meeting to deal precisely with this and related issues,"" Chaput explained. ""This gives scandal to their brother bishops and priests, and to the many Catholics who struggle to stay faithful to Church teaching. It does damage to the bishops' conference, to the meaning of collegiality, and to the fruitfulness of the conference's advocacy work with the incoming administration.""

""This is not a 'political' matter, and those who would describe it as such are either ignorant or willfully confusing the issue,"" he continued. ""This is a matter of bishops' unique responsibility before the Lord for the integrity of the sacraments. Moreover, there is also the pressing matter of pastoral concern for a man's salvation.""



""At minimum, every bishop has the duty of privately discussing these vital moral issues and the destructive effect of receiving Communion unworthily with public figures who act contrary to Church teaching,"" he concluded. ""Reception of Communion is not a right but a gift and privilege; and on the subject of 'rights,' the believing community has a priority right to the integrity of its belief and practice.""



The debate is ignited because Washington, D.C., Cardinal Wilton Gregory proclaimed that he would administer Holy Communion to Biden.

Cardinal-designate Gregory told the Catholic News Service, ""I'm not going to veer from that,"" in regards to Biden receiving Holy Communion.

He said there is a need for dialogue within the church among people who think differently.

""Conflict within the church is not a new reality; it goes back to apostolic times,"" Gregory said. ""What seems to be new is the capacity for people to broadcast the conflicts and to allow social communications to intensify the conflict.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-explodes-when-reporter-confronts-him-with-simple-question-about-ukraine,2020-12-05
Hunter Biden business partner confirms email about Joe and China,"A man claiming to be a former business partner of Hunter Biden has released a statement alleging that the email that the New York Post published about a ""lucrative"" deal with a Chinese company is ""genuine."" The professed business associate also claims that Joe Biden not only knew about his son's overseas dealings, but also profited from an agreement with a Chinese energy firm.

Tony Bobulinski is the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings, which he claimed formed a partnership with the now-bankrupt Shanghai-based China Energy Fund Committee, which was run by Ye Jianming, who has been missing since 2018.

""I am the CEO of Sinohawk Holdings which was a partnership between the Chinese operating through CEFC/Chairman Ye and the Biden family,"" Bobulinski said in the statement that was published by the New York Post on Thursday. ""I was brought into the company to be the CEO by James Gilliar and Hunter Biden.""

In an email allegedly obtained from Hunter Biden's laptop, it details ""remuneration packages"" in a business venture for six people only identified as initials and nicknames. The email, which was written by James Gilliar of the international consulting firm J2cR, names Hunter Biden as the ""Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC (China Energy Co)."" His pay was noted to be ""850.""

""In addition, the email outlined a 'provisional agreement' under which 80 percent of the 'equity,' or shares in the new company, would be split equally among four people whose initials correspond to the sender and three recipients, with 'H' apparently referring to Biden,"" the Post reported.



As terms of the deal, the email states, ""10 held by H for the big guy?"" The ""big guy"" was not identified in the email, but Bobulinski claims that it is a reference to Joe Biden. There is a person identified as ""JB"" referenced in the email; Bobulinski alleged that it references Jim Biden, Joe's brother.

""Hunter Biden called his dad 'the Big Guy' or 'my Chairman,' and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing,"" said Bobulinski, who is a Navy veteran. ""I've seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I've seen firsthand that that's not true, because it wasn't just Hunter's business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line.""

Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, has repeatedly denied that he ever involved himself with his son's business affairs, claiming he's ""never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.""

Bobulinski added that he is cooperating with an investigation into Hunter Biden's business overseas dealings led by U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).



""The committee is working to validate information being revealed by multiple sources. As part of those efforts, we have reached out to several individuals named in recently revealed emails, including Tony Bobulinski. We look forward to their cooperation in helping us uncover the truth,"" Johnson told Just the News.

Last month, Johnson and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) released a report titled ""Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Corruption: The Impact on U.S. Government Policy and Related Concerns.""

""The Johnson Report connected some dots in a way that shocked me — it made me realize the Bidens had gone behind my back and gotten paid millions of dollars by the Chinese, even though they told me they hadn't and wouldn't do that to their partners,"" Bobulinski said.

Bobulinski claims that he is ""not a political person,"" and ""what few campaign contributions I have made in my life were to Democrats.""

""I don't have a political axe to grind; I just saw behind the Biden curtain and I grew concerned about what I saw,"" he said. ""The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities even though some were from communist controlled China.""

The email was sent on May 13, 2017, when Biden was no longer vice president.

Another of Hunter Biden's alleged business associates is allegedly giving up information that could potentially be a problem for the Biden campaign.



Bevan Cooney, who is currently serving a prison sentence for fraud, reportedly provided access to his Gmail account to Breitbart investigative reporter and New York Times bestselling author Peter Schweizer. ""These associates sought to trade on Hunter Biden's relationship with, and access to, his father and the Obama-Biden White House in order to generate business,"" the report alleges.

""We're not looking at printouts. Not looking at PDFs. We're actually in his Gmail accounts themselves, sifting through these emails,"" Schweizer told Glenn Beck this week. ""And there's a shocking amount of information about deals involving China, involving Russia, involving all sorts of things they were trying to pull off.""

On Tuesday, Schweizer claimed that Cooney ""has been removed from the federal facility in Oregon where he is being detained.""

The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment, telling the Washington Examiner, ""For safety and security reasons, we do not discuss specific inmates' conditions of confinement.""

On July 31, 2019, Cooney was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison for ""defrauding a Native American tribal entity and various investment advisory clients of tens of millions of dollars in connection with the issuance of bonds by the tribal entity and the subsequent sale of those bonds through fraudulent and deceptive means,"" the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney's Office said.

On Tuesday, Joe Biden dismissed the allegations stemming from the leaked emails from his son's laptop that was reportedly left at a computer repair shop.

""This is the same garbage – Rudy Giuliani Trump's henchmen,"" Biden told WISN-TV during an interview. ""It's a last-ditch effort in this desperate campaign to smear me and my family.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-foot-dog-masks-interview,2020-10-22
"Joe Biden spews 'anti-Irish' slur, confuses wife's father for grandfather, greatly exaggerates Iraq trips, tells implausible story of uncle awarded Purple Heart in gaffe-riddled speech","The latest gaffe-filled speech from President Joe Biden featured him confusing his wife's father for her grandfather, making an implausible claim of how his uncle was awarded the Purple Heart, and greatly exaggerating how many trips he made to Iraq and Afghanistan. President Biden also struck a nerve in the same speech when he denigrated Irish people.

Biden delivered a speech to U.S. veterans during a town hall event on Friday in New Castle, Delaware.

Biden praised 102-year-old World War II veteran Ray Firmani for flying 25 missions over Germany. Firmani responded, ""Thank you so much.""

Then Biden inexplicably and incorrectly delved into his family's heritage.

The 80-year-old Biden told Firmani, ""Thank you. I may be Irish, but I’m not stupid.""

President Biden continued, ""I married Dominic Giacoppa’s daughter. So, you know, I got a little Italian in me now, you know?""

However, Jill Biden's father is Donald Carl Jacobs from Hammonton, New Jersey. Jill's grandfather is Domenic Giacoppo – who is a second-generation immigrant from Italy.

Jill's mother is Bonny Jean Godfrey, who is of English and Scottish descent. Jill's grandmother Mabel Sarah Blazer is of German descent.

Some reactions on Twitter declared Biden's comment about the Irish to be demeaning.

Daily Signal senior reporter Mary Margaret Olohan decried Biden's remarks as a ""hate crime"" against Irish people.



Washington Examiner investigative reporter Jerry Dunleavy explained, ""Biden loves this Bidenism (he’s said it in the past before) — just casual old school anti-Irish stereotyping, but he thinks it’s a fun part of his gift of the gab because he considers himself Irish (his great-great-great grandfather moved to America from Ireland in the 1800s.).""

Businessman Eoghan McCabe tweeted, ""Irishman here. I feel neutral because I think he actually is stupid.""

Biden made the exact same disparagement about the Irish as well as confusing Jill Biden's grandfather and father on St. Patrick's Day in March.

Also during Friday's speech, Biden made a gaffe or outright lied about how his uncle received the prestigious Purple Heart award.

Biden told the American veterans:

You know, I — my dad, when I got elected Vice President, he said, “Joey, Uncle Frank fought in the Battle of the Bulge.” He was not feeling very well now — not because of the Battle of the Bulge. But he said, ""And he won the Purple Heart. And he never received it. He never — he never got it. Do you think you could help him get it? We’ll surprise him.”



So we got him the Purple Heart. He had won it in the Battle of the Bulge. And I remember he came over to the house, and I came out, and he said, “Present it to him, okay?” We had the family there.



I said, “Uncle Frank, you won this. And I want to… He said, ""I don’t want the damn thing."" (Laughter.) No, I’m serious. He said, ""I don’t want it.' I said, ""What’s the matter, Uncle Frank? You earned it."" He said, 'Yeah, but the others died. The others died. I lived. I don’t want it.""

However, Biden’s father, Joseph R. Biden Sr., died on Sept. 2, 2002. Joe Biden officially became vice president on Jan. 20, 2009.

Frank Biden died in 1999.

The New York Post reported, ""Frank Biden’s tombstone does not identify him as a Purple Heart honoree, nor does his obituary. A partial registry of known Purple Heart recipients also doesn’t note anyone by that name receiving the award, though that database is not comprehensive.""

Forbes reported, ""There doesn't appear to be any record of Biden giving his uncle the honor—the president hasn't mentioned the story in the past, there have been no news articles written about it and Frank Biden's name does not appear on a list of recipients held by the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor, though the list is incomplete.""

Biden also greatly exaggerated how many times he has visited Iraq and Afghanistan.

Biden claimed, ""And, you know, I think that there’s a — I’ve been in and out — not as a, obviously, combatant — but in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq and these areas 38, 39 times as — not as President, only twice as President, but from the time I was a senator, but particularly when I was Vice President.""



Biden exaggerated his number of visits to the Middle Eastern countries back in 2019, and at the time the Biden campaign admitted that the correct number of trips is 21.

The Daily Mail noted that Biden was last in Iraq in 2016, and last visited Afghanistan in 2011. Biden has not visited Afghanistan or Iraq as president.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-holy-communion-archbishop,2022-12-18
Joe Biden: My staff should've told me Hunter's job in Ukraine was a conflict of interest,"Former Vice President Joe Biden shifted accountability to his staff when asked during a recently released NPR interview about his son Hunter's ethically questionable appointment to the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.

Biden has sometimes been angrily defensive, and other times claimed ignorance, when questioned about whether Hunter's position in Ukraine was represented as a conflict of interest. Hunter was appointed to the board while Biden oversaw Ukraine policy in the Obama administration.

NPR's Rachel Martin challenged Biden during the interview about his son's actions, saying Biden knew it ""didn't look good"" for his son to take a lucrative position in Ukraine that he had no apparent qualifications for.

""The optics weren't good,"" Martin said. ""And you talk a lot about what it means to be a Biden and the integrity that is imbued in that family name. But there were former White House aides of yours who tried to warn you about the potential conflicts of interest.""

Biden disputed the assertion that his staff raised concerns on the issue.

""Nobody warned me about a potential conflict of interest. Nobody warned me about that,"" Biden responded.

Martin then pointed out that George Kent, a State Department official who served as deputy chief of mission in Ukraine under the Obama administration, testified during an impeachment hearing that he brought up concerns about Hunter to Biden's staff.

Biden claimed he never heard anything about it and speculated that his staff didn't bring it up to him because his other son, Beau, was dying from brain cancer.

""Well, my son was dying, so I guess that's why he said it, because my son was on his deathbed,"" Biden said. ""But that, that's not the reason why — they should have told me.""

Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine, as well as what his father did or did not know about it, remains a relevant question as House Democrats proceed toward impeaching President Donald Trump for allegedly leveraging the power of the presidency to pressure Ukraine into publicly announcing an investigation into the Bidens after Joe Biden launched his presidential campaign.

Joe Biden parody campaign website tricks supporters — and the search results don't look good for Biden,"Former Vice President Joe Biden is dominating early polls testing support for Democrats seeking their party's 2020 presidential nomination.

But a Biden parody campaign website, mocking his ""legislative accomplishments"" and history of being too physical, has mastered Google's infamous search engine algorithm, topping search results for ""Joe Biden.""

What are the details?

Not only does the parody website — JoeBiden.info — top Google search results for Biden's name, but the former vice president's actual campaign website, JoeBiden.com, is buried deep within Google search results for his name, not even appearing on page one.

The realistic-looking parody website features images of Biden touching women and children, a common criticism of the former vice president.

""Uncle Joe is back and ready to take a hands-on approach to America's problems! Joe Biden has a good feel for the American people and knows exactly what they really want deep down,"" the website says. ""He's happy to open up and reveal himself to voters and will give a pounding to anybody who gets in his way!""



The website also touts Biden's ""legislative accomplishments"" in such a way that puts his legislative history in direct conflict with the values he espouses today. The website notes that Biden was against same-sex marriage, against abortion, and initially supported the Iraq War.

The website also highlights questionable comments Biden made in the past, including one directed at former President Barack Obama in 2007.

""I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,"" Biden said of Obama, who at the time was running for president.



The bottom of the website notes that it is ""political commentary and parody"" and is ""intended for entertainment and political commentary only.""

Who created the website?

The person who created the website told CNBC that he is an American citizen who, politically speaking, is ""closest to a libertarian.""

Though the creator did not reveal his identity, he told CNBC that thousands of people have mistaken the website for Biden's actual campaign website.

""I get thousands of Biden supporters coming to the site every day who fail to realize that it is a parody — asking for volunteer information, donation information, suggestions on how to handle the [Anita Hill] situation, or criticizing his use of 'All men are created equal' — no joke,"" the person said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-irish-italian-gaffe-speech,2019-05-07
Joe Biden remains isolated in Delaware as Putin flexes his nukes,"Despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine continuing to escalate, President Joe Biden remains at his private estate in Delaware.

Fox News reported that Biden remains at his private residence in Delaware and that the media is having difficulty making contact with the administration.

On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military command to put Russia's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert.

Putin blamed ""aggressive"" rhetoric from NATO members and thoroughgoing economic sanctions against Russia for why he chose to increase Russia's preparedness to use nuclear weapons.

Putin said, ""Western countries aren't only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country.""

""Senior officials of the leading NATO countries also allow aggressive statements against our country,"" the Russian president continued, ""Therefore I order the minister of defense and the chief of the general staff [of the Russian armed forces] to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty.""

Last week, Putin warned that countries who interfere with the Russian invasion of Ukraine will face ""consequences you have never seen.""

Rebekah Koffler, a former DIA intelligence officer, said, ""[Putin] is right now threatening a nuclear escalation. This is a veiled threat – or maybe such a veiled threat – he just met with his chief of general staff and minister of defense. He is escalating the conflict into the nuclear domain in order to de-escalate – that is, topple Kyiv's regime quickly.""

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said, ""It is not entirely clear if Mr. Putin has designs beyond the Ukraine, and it's because that's not perfectly clear that we continue to look for ways to bolster our NATO capabilities and to reassure our allies. I mean, one of the reasons we're doing this is because we want to make it clear to him that we will defend every inch of NATO territory.""

The Republican congressman from Illinois, Adam Kinzinger, referred to Putin's nuclear escalation as a ""bluff"" and suggested that Putin was merely posturing to make people fear Russia's capabilities.

He said, ""This breathlessness over nukes is mind blowing. We used to call his bluff. This is the Soviet Cold War play to make the public fear Russia.""

On Saturday, Western leaders issued a joint statement committing them to ending Russia's ability to access and use the SWIFT financial telecommunication network. By doing so, the West isolated Russia's economy, making it virtually impossible for them to conduct trade with their international partners.

Joe Biden signs bills authorizing $40 billion in aid to Ukraine and to increase access to baby formula while in Asia,"On Saturday, President Joe Biden signed legislation that would authorize giving Ukraine an additional $40 billion in financial support as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine drags on.

This new legislation previously passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support, CNBC reported, and deepens the U.S.’s commitment to Ukraine at a time of uncertainty as the Russian invasion enters its fourth month.

Ukraine has successfully defended its capital city of Kyiv as the Russian military refocuses its forces in the country’s eastern regions. Reportedly, American officials are warning that the Russian invasion could drag on for even longer.

The $40 billion aid package is intended to provide support for Ukraine through September and is considerably larger than an earlier emergency financing package that approved $13.6 billion.

Of the $40 billion, $20 billion is allocated for military assistance, ensuring the Ukrainian military has access to advanced weapons that will be used to slow the Russian military’s offensives; $8 billion is being allocated for general support of the Ukrainian economy; $5 billion will be used to address “global food shortages” that may arise from the recent collapse of Ukraine’s agricultural industry; and, more than $1 billion will be used to provide aid to Ukrainian refugees.

Biden signed the spending package while in the middle of his trip to Asia. According to a White House official, a separate U.S. official brought a copy of the unsigned bill on a commercial flight to Seoul for Biden to sign.

The fact that Biden signed the spending bill while abroad reflects the U.S.’s growing sense of urgency to continue providing support for Ukraine while overlapping international challenges pressure the president. While the Biden administration is reportedly working to reconfigure policy to confront China, it also is working to redirect American resources to accommodate Ukraine amid the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.

While on his trip to Asia, Biden also signed an unrelated measure intended to increase access to baby formula while supplies remain scare in the U.S. This legislation is said to allow government benefits from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — also known as WIC — to be used to buy more types of infant formula.

According to Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, the Biden administration knew that a baby formula shortage was imminent as early as this past February.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-parody-website,2022-05-21
"Joe Biden snaps on Iowa voter who brings up Hunter and Burisma: 'You're a damn liar, man'","Former Vice President Joe Biden got very upset Thursday morning with an Iowa man who asked him about his son, Hunter, and his questionable appointment to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

Biden was at an event in New Hampton taking questions from attendees when a man got on the microphone and raised concerns about Biden's age, and about Biden's role in getting his son the lucrative position in Ukraine.

After prefacing his comments by expressing a belief that President Donald Trump has done wrong in Ukraine, the man turned the focus onto Biden.

The man accused Biden of sending his son to Ukraine to sit on the board of Burisma, where he was paid at least $50,000 per month despite having no relevant experience, and said Biden was just as guilty of ""selling access to the president"" as Trump is.

Biden cut the man off there, saying ""You're a damn liar, man."" The man said he heard those claims on television, specifically citing MSNBC.

The tense exchange then took a bizarre turn, during which Biden claimed ""I'm not sedentary"" and challenged the man to physical contests.

""You want to check my shape man, let's do push-ups together here, man. Let's run,"" Biden said. ""Let's do whatever you want to do. Let's take an IQ test. Ok?""

Biden later strangely accused the man of being ""too old to vote for me."" And at the 1:54 mark in the above video, it also sounds like Biden calls the man ""fat.""



It is simultaneously surprising and not surprising that Biden responded so poorly to the topic of Hunter and Burisma. Surprising because it is the most significant question for which he and his staff should have a prepared response, considering that Biden's Ukraine dealings are an important part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry and will certainly be used against him by Trump in the general election, should Biden advance that far.

Unsurprising because at various points throughout his campaign, Biden has seemed at times hostile, confused, and incoherent, and reports are that he is notoriously resistant to coaching from his staff.

Questions about the potential conflict of interest represented by his son being appointed to the Burisma board while Biden was vice president and point man on Ukraine are not likely to go anywhere. It is perhaps better to come up with a good answer for them rather than to attack voters for bringing it up.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-remains-isolated-in-delaware-as-putin-flexes-his-nukes,2019-12-05
"Joe Biden says, 'I wouldn't vote for me if I believed Tara Reade'","Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has been accused of sexual assault by former Senate staffer Tara Reade, said Americans should not vote for him if they believe the allegations against him.

""If they believe Tara Reade, they probably shouldn't vote for me,"" Biden said when asked what he'd say to women who believe Tara Reade and are struggling with the idea of supporting him, according to NBC News' Mike Memoli. ""I wouldn't vote for me if I believed Tara Reade.""

Reade has accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in an office building on Capitol Hill in 1993 when Reade worked in Biden's Senate office.

During an interview with Megyn Kelly, Reade said she wished Biden would drop out of the presidential race because of the alleged assault, although she doesn't expect him to do so. She criticized his campaign for saying all women should be able to speak safely while she receives harassment and death threats for coming forward.

Biden has called out inconsistencies in the story she has told about the alleged incident in media appearances dating back to more than a year ago, when she said Biden made her uncomfortable by touching her shoulders.

""Look at Tara Reade's story, it changes considerably,"" Biden said, according to Time.

Kelly asked Reade about multiple occasions when Reade has posted or shared positive things about Biden on social media, including a time when Reade tweeted about Biden, ""My old boss speaks truth. Listen.""

Reade said she has been conflicted about Biden.

""I've always been conflicted about Joe Biden, I didn't want to talk badly about him,"" Reade told Kelly. ""And I wasn't ready to tell my story with Joe Biden at that point at all.""

Reade also voted for former President Barack Obama two times with Biden as his running mate, but she said she was just excited about Obama, and Biden just ""happened to be on the ticket.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-signs-bills-authorizing-40-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-and-to-increase-access-to-baby-formula,2020-05-15
"Joe Rogan blasts 'woke' virtue-signaling big tech CEOs for censorship, slams big pharma execs as the 'lyingest liars that ever lied'","In a recent podcast episode, Joe Rogan welcomed Daryl Davis — a black musician and author who has been befriending members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis in an effort to persuade them not to hate people because of their skin color. Davis said he had convinced more than 200 Klansmen to turn in their robes to him.



Also appearing in ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" episode was Bill Ottman – internet entrepreneur, free speech activist, and CEO of the blockchain-based social media network Minds.

Davis and Ottman are both involved in the ""Change Minds Initiative,"" which argues that de-platforming people from social media only radicalizes people more. The Change Minds Initiative will attempt to ""facilitate engagement, free expression, communication, and active input from parties who promote non-violence, critical thinking, creativity, and empathetic engagement.""

Davis and Ottman were two of the six authors who penned a paper on the effect of censorship and how ""deplatforming actually intensifies extremism.""

""The research found significant evidence that censorship and deplatforming can promote and amplify, rather than suppress, cognitive radicalization and even violent extremism,"" the paper reads. ""Shutting down accounts accused of violating hate-speech policies and misinformation often shifts those banned individuals to alternative platforms where their narrative of long-suffering victimhood is further refined.""

""What is deplatforming supposed to achieve? If the goal is to curtail the radicalization to violence there is little evidence to support this conclusion,"" the paper states.

""The limited empirical evidence that exists on the role that online speech plays in the radicalization-to-violence journey suggests that people are primarily radicalized through experienced disaffection, face-to-face encounters and offline relationships,"" the authors argue. ""Extremist propaganda alone does not turn individuals to violence. Other variables are at play.""

""The focus on social media usage as a radicalization vector may be overstated,"" the paper suggests. ""More attention on the role mainstream news coverage through TV and print media may be required.""

The paper cited a study from George Washington University in 2019: ""The key to understanding the resilience of online hate lies in its global network-of-network dynamics. Interconnected hate clusters form global 'hate highways' that — assisted by collective online adaptations — cross social media platforms, sometimes using 'back doors' even after being banned, as well as jumping between countries, continents, and languages.""

Davis writes in the paper, ""We increasingly see the authors of controversial views suspended from, kicked off, or put in a platform's 'jail' for expressing opinions. Exiled dissidents may seek alternate and sometimes nefarious platforms. Thus is born a breeding ground for conspiracy theories and plots. It’s an ugly spiraling mess.""

In the recent episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" Ottman expressed, ""Even the Left, like outlets like Vox, are now admitting that deplatforming causes more severe radicalization. This is being admitted across the board.""

""So the fact that big tech apps are not looking at this data and applying it to their policy, it makes you almost have to speculate that they're intentionally causing it,"" Ottman suggested. ""I mean, because they these are very smart people that work at big tech sites. They know about data science, they know the spread of information.""

Rogan disagreed, ""I don't think they're intentionally causing it."" The prolific podcaster added that he didn't think social media companies were not intentionally trying to radicalize people.

Rogan theorized, ""First of all, there's an ideology that is attached to all the big tech companies, whether it's Google or Facebook or Twitter, you have to be what they think is 'woke,' right?""

Rogan said, ""You have to subscribe to a certain line of thinking, and anybody that deviates from that line of thinking should be suppressed, minimized or banned.""



""The CEOs have to virtue signal,"" Rogan continued. ""All the people that are executives have to virtue signal, and they have to say, 'We're doing our best to stop harmful talk.'""

""But what they call 'harmful' like a lot of it is like disagreeing with pharmaceutical companies, which is just f***ing crazy,"" he exclaimed, then slammed big pharma executives, ""Like these are the lyingest liars that ever lied.""



Rogan then picked apart the argument that he is not supposed to platform people with views some people don't like.

""I have people on this podcast all the time that I don't agree with at all or I agree with them very little, and I want to see what's going on in their head,"" he stated.

Rogan said he doesn't have ""bad people"" on his Spotify show.

He added that he has people with right-wing and left-wing ideologies on his podcast and doesn't think anyone ""should be suppressed.""

Ottman interjected, ""You cannot change someone's mind if you do not platform them. It is impossible for someone with horrible ideology to change.""

Davis commented on people being kicked off social media platforms on the basis of ""disinformation."" He then brought up the examples of the Renaissance-era astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus being ""scorned and ridiculed"" for saying that the sun is the center of the solar system and Galileo Galilei being vehemently charged with heresy and put on house arrest for also believing in Copernican heliocentrism.

Rogan brought up the First Amendment and big tech censoring users, ""And the idea that you the f***ing tech dorks are going to step in and say, 'No, this is dangerous thinking.'""

Ottman added, ""The battle-tested First Amendment, hundreds of years of precedent, legal precedent. Talk about a good content policy.""

""They think that their lawyers are better at drafting healthy conversation than the First Amendment,"" Ottman said on the massively popular podcast. ""And that's just not that's not true.""

Davis said, ""You combat bad information by providing more good information.""

Davis stressed, ""A missed opportunity for dialogue is a missed opportunity for conflict resolution. It’s as simple as that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-snaps-on-iowa-voter,2022-03-17
John Bolton has dirt on 'many relevant meetings and conversations' not yet discussed in impeachment probe: lawyer,"A lawyer for former national security adviser John Bolton said Friday that his client has information about ""many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed"" in the House's impeachment probe into the Trump administration's interactions with Ukrainian officials earlier this year.

Bolton's attorney, Charles Cooper of Cooper & Kirk, PLLC, teased the information in a letter sent to the House of Representatives' general counsel regarding House Democrats' efforts to get Bolton and his former deputy Charles Kupperman to testify before the ongoing impeachment inquiry.

In the letter, Cooper explained that his clients are prepared to testify over the objections of the president — who has asserted testimonial immunity in the matter — pending a judge's decision on whether or not they can.

On Thursday, House Democrats announced that they wouldn't subpoena Bolton after his legal team threatened to file a lawsuit on the matter when he didn't show for a scheduled voluntary deposition.

""We regret Mr. Bolton's decision not to appear voluntarily, but we have no interest in allowing the Administration to play rope-a-dope with us in the courts for months,"" a House Intelligence Committee official stated Thursday. On Wednesday, the House withdrew a subpoena for Kupperman in response to his lawsuit over his testimony.

In the Friday letter, Cooper wrote that he is ""dismayed that the Committees have chosen not to join us in seeking resolution from the Judicial Branch of this momentous Constitutional question as expeditiously as possible"" because it is important to both clients ""to get a definitive judgment from the Judicial Branch determining their Constitutional duty in the face of conflicting demands of the Legislative and Executive Branches.""

Bolton — who left the White House in September — reportedly took issue with administration officials' efforts to get Ukrainian officials to look into the 2016 election and an energy company that used to employ Hunter Biden, even comparing the matter to a ""drug deal.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-biden-vote-believed-tara-reade,2019-11-08
Bolton updates White House message about US in Syria: Troops will remain until objectives are met and Turkey makes guarantees,"In Jerusalem, national security adviser John Bolton told reporters that U.S. troops will remain in Syria until the situation with ISIS is resolved and U.S. Kurdish allies are granted guarantees from Turkey. This represents a departure from previous Trump administration statements regarding an imminent departure from Syria.

What are the details?

""There are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal,"" Bolton said Sunday, according to Politico. ""The timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.""

On Monday, Bolton traveled to Turkey to negotiate regarding the government's treatment of the Kurdish people in Syria. One of the biggest questions regarding a rapid U.S. withdrawal from Syria concerns what happens to the United States' Kurdish allies after U.S. troops leave.

Turkey has had an ongoing conflict with the PKK, a Turkish militant group, within its own borders. Because of this, Turkey views all ethnic Kurds as terrorists and has been using the instability caused by the Syrian civil war to attack Kurdish positions outside of Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has promised to ""descend on them [the Kurds] with more comprehensive and effective [strength].""

Bolton said a promise from Turkey that it would not attack the Kurds in Syria after U.S. forces left would be a condition of the withdrawal. A Kurdish leader told The Associated Press that his people were unclear on what the U.S. planned to do, and that they had asked for clarification.

""We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States, at a minimum so they don't endanger our troops,"" Bolton told reporters.

In an interview with Bloomberg that was published Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. campaign in Syria ""hasn't changed one lick."" He added that a ""component of that is being altered, the reduction of the forces in Syria is being changed, but the mission set hasn't changed a bit.""

What has Trump said?

Although he initially announced the rapid pullout of U.S. troops from Syria, Trump later expanded the timeline from 30 days to four months. Bolton's comments imply that the process leading up to the withdrawal could last even longer.

On Sunday, Trump insisted that he had ""never said we were doing it that quickly."" He also said that the U.S. ""won't be finally pulled out until ISIS is gone.""

On Dec. 19, Trump declared that ISIS was defeated and that the U.S. would be pulling all its troops out from there. Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), criticized the move, arguing that this would give ISIS time to regroup and would also endanger U.S. Kurdish allies.

We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2018

In a separate tweet Monday, Trump bashed the New York Times for having ""knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria,"" claiming that he had always said that troops would be ""leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and do all else that is prudent and necessary!""

The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria. No different from my original statements, we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!.....

John Cena gets demolished online after profusely apologizing to China for calling Taiwan a 'country',"John Cena, the WWE star-turned actor, was bashed online Tuesday after he posted a video to Chinese social media network Sina Weibo apologizing to the Chinese people for referring to Taiwan as a ""country.""

Oh, and Cena delivered his mea culpa in Mandarin, the official language of China.

What happened?

While promoting the release of ""F9"" — the latest installment in the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise — Cena told Taiwanese broadcaster TVBS that Taiwan would ""be the first country to see Fast & Furious 9.""

The problem with Cena's statement, according to communist China, is that he acknowledged Taiwan as a sovereign country separate of China. The communist government claims Taiwan as its territory, but Taiwan claims to be a sovereign, self-governing republic. Conflict over Taiwan's status stems from the 20th century Chinese civil war, which has never technically ended.

Taiwan's independence, unfortunately, is mostly unacknowledged on the world stage — most countries have not established official diplomatic relations with Taiwan — and China aggressively polices speech regarding Taiwan. The communist government considers the recognition of Taiwan's sovereignty as crossing the proverbial ""line in the sand.""

What did Cena say?

Uploading a video to China's Twitter-like social media platform Sina Wiebo, Cena profusely apologized — although it was not good enough for many Chinese people.

""Hello, China. This is John Cena. I did many, many interviews for Fast & Furious 9. In one of the interviews I made a mistake,"" Cena said, according to Newsweek.

""I love and respect China and Chinese people. I'm very, very sorry for my mistake. Sorry, sorry. I'm very sorry,"" he added. ""You must understand I love and respect China and Chinese people. Sorry. Goodbye.""

The video was reportedly flooded with thousands of comments from Chinese users who thought Cena's apology was not sufficient.

""Please say in Chinese, 'Taiwan is part of China,' otherwise we won't accept [your apology],"" the top comment on the video said, Newsweek reported.

""Then at least say Taiwan is China's. You're avoiding the issue and talking nonsense. You can't benefit from [the Chinese market] and trash it at the same time,"" another critic said.

The movie debuted in China last Friday, Newsweek reported.

What was the reaction?

John Kerry's response to Ukraine invasion: 'I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate',"John Kerry cautioned Wednesday that Russia's war on Ukraine will distract the international community from one of the Biden administration's top national security priorities: climate change.

The former secretary of state and current U.S. special envoy for climate was discussing Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine during an interview on BBC Arabic when he said the war will have ""massive emissions consequences"" for the entire world.

""I'm very concerned about, I'm concerned about Ukraine because of the people of Ukraine and because of the principles that are at risk, in terms of international law and trying to change boundaries of international law by force. I thought we lived in a world that had said no to that kind of activity. And I hope diplomacy will win,"" Kerry said.

""But massive emissions consequences to the war but equally importantly, you're going to lose people's focus, you're going to lose big country attention because they will be diverted and I think it could have a damaging impact,"" he continued. ""So, you know hopefully President Putin would realize that in the Northern part of his country, they used to live on 66% of the nation that was over frozen land.

""Now it's thawing, and his infrastructure is at risk. And the people of Russia are at risk,"" he added. ""And so I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.""

Kerry's comments echo comments he made in an interview Sunday, when he told GZERO Media's Ian Bremmer that a Russian invasion of Ukraine will have a ""monumental impact on the ability and willingness of people to do what's necessary"" to fight climate change.

""Ukraine, one way or the other — we're going to resolve it, ultimately, over X number of years. But the climate crisis remains existential, just as it was before the Ukraine crisis came up,"" Kerry said, before the invasion began.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its sovereign neighbor Ukraine Thursday with ground, air, and naval forces in the largest military campaign by one state against another in Europe since World War II.

Ukrainian cities have been attacked with shelling and airstrikes. Civilians have either attempted to flee or made makeshift bomb shelters in subway systems. Reports indicate there are hundreds of casualties, although the exact numbers of injured or dead remain unknown in this chaotic, ongoing war.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed Thursday that the Russian army destroyed 74 Ukrainian military facilities, including 11 airbases, just hours after launching the invasion.

Ukraine said Thursday morning that at least 40 soldiers and 10 civilians had been killed in the conflict.



In the context of widespread suffering in Ukraine caused by Russian President Vladimir Putin's war, Republican lawmakers blasted Kerry's statements about climate change.

""Climate change religious zealot John Kerry is worried that the first major ground war in Europe in 80 years & #Putin’s threat of nuclear consequences is getting more attention than his climate agenda,"" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted.

""As Sec. of State, John Kerry did nothing to stop the invasion of Crimea, all for an unenforceable agreement to fight the air. Now that his chickens came home to roost, he’s more worried about emissions from war & distraction from the climate than the slaughter in #Ukraine,"" said Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.).



""Putin is killing innocent Ukrainians and John Kerry is asking him to stay 'on track' for the climate? Despicable,"" Rep. August Pfluger (R-Fla.) remarked. ""Russian energy is some of the worst for the environment. The Biden Admin climate religion has made our world less safe.""

Jon Stewart calls out Congress for not attending hearing for 9/11 survivors,"Comedian Jon Stewart called out members of Congress for not attending a hearing on continued funding for the September 11 Victims Compensation Fund.

What did he say?

The former ""Daily Show"" host has for years championed the cause of the survivors of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, calling attention to the diseases contracted by first responders and others who breathed in the smoke from the Twin Towers.

""Behind me, a filled room of 9/11 first responders,"" Stewart said emotionally. ""And in front of me, a nearly empty Congress. Sick and dying, they brought themselves down here to speak — to no one. Shameful. It's an embarrassment to the country, and it is a stain on this institution.""

Stewart said that the ""disrespect"" shown by Congress to the survivors who came to the hearing was ""utterly unacceptable."" More than 150 firefighters who responded to the Sept. 11 attacks have died after the fact from health complications. Thousands more first responders and people who were near in proximity to the World Trade Center have health complications thought to be caused by exposure to chemicals during the attack.

The September 11 Victims Compensation Fund gives federal assistance to survivors who can prove that they have suffered due to health problems contracted during the attack. It is currently running out of funding.

""There is not an empty chair on that stage,"" Stewart said, ""that didn't tweet out 'Never forget the heroes of 9/11. Never forget their bravery. Never forget what they did what they gave to this country.' Well, here they are,"" he gestured to the survivors sitting behind him. ""And where are they?""

Stewart also criticized Congress for not passing legislation to help the survivors. ""They responded in five seconds. They did their jobs,"" he said. ""Eighteen years later, do yours!""

But Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) defended the actions of his colleagues, saying that half the seats were empty because Stewart and the survivors were only testifying before a subcommittee.

GOP senator uses leftists' playbook against them over their demands for Clarence Thomas to be held accountable for wife's text messages,"Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) rebuked Democrats for demanding that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas be held responsible or accountable for his wife’s text messages by stealing a move from the leftist playbook.

What is the background?

Progressive Democrats are calling for Thomas to resign or be impeached after CBS News and the Washington Post reported that his wife, Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, exchanged 29 text messages with Mark Meadows after the 2020 election.

The text messages, which neither cite Justice Thomas nor refer to the Supreme Court, were mostly sent in November 2020 and urged then-President Donald Trump to continue fighting the certification of the election. One text message was sent the day after the Jan. 6 riots.

Democrats immediately seized on the text message as evidence that Justice Thomas has engaged in unethical or compromising behavior. However, no evidence has surfaced corroborating the accusations. Justice Thomas and his wife have long maintained they keep their work separate and do not discuss work-related matters.

What did Hawley say?

Hawley told a CNN reporter on Monday that Democrats' reaction is ""kind of misogynistic"" because they are intertwining Justice Thomas and his wife in a way that progressive and feminist ideology would not otherwise permit.

""She’s an independent, adult woman, it just seems a little strange to me all of these calls for her husband to be what, like, minding her better? Frankly, I think it’s kind of misogynistic,"" Hawley said.

""She’s a private individual,"" he added when asked if the text messages concern him. ""He’s a justice on the US Supreme Court, but I think this idea that he is somehow automatically responsible for everything she says — what does that mean? Does she have to get his permission?""

On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) similarly condemned the move to force Justice Thomas' resignation or impeachment.

""This is a political hit, part of liberals' years-long quest to delegitimize the court,"" McConnell said from the Senate floor.

Still, top Democrats are calling on Thomas to recuse himself from certain cases related to Jan. 6, and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has claimed that Ginni Thomas' text messages raise ""a serious question about conflict of interest for Justice Thomas.""

Journalist exposes how Democrats have upped violent rhetoric leading up to midterm elections,"Democratic office holders and their partisans in the mainstream media who are relying on scare tactics to motivate voters in the fall elections are following President Joe Biden's lead in demonizing Republicans as ""MAGA"" extremists and using potentially dangerous rhetoric that could incite real-world violence.

The party that once embraced tolerance and has long claimed to stand against hate is stirring up fear and animosity toward the opposition, with the president leading by calling Republicans a ""threat"" to the nation.

It's an election-year strategy to stoke outrage with the potential to incite violence. Just last week, 18-year-old Cayler Ellingson was killed in cold blood in North Dakota by a drunken man who thought he was a ""Republican extremist."" In Michigan, an 83-year-old woman passing out pro-life pamphlets was shot in the shoulder while leaving a residence during a heated conversation. The individual who shot her was not a part of the conversation, according to Right to Life Michigan.



Journalist Tom Elliott posted a thread on Twitter Sunday observing how ""radicalized progressives"" have ""upped the rhetorical ante to a level all-but-begging for violence"" in the weeks preceding those violent attacks.

Elliott, who founded the news clip service Grabien, shared video of numerous Democrats and left-wing cable news pundits ""recklessly hyping conflict"" ahead of the November elections.

MSNBC host Tiffany Cross, for example, told her viewers on Sept. 4, “These days it feels like we’re not just that the brink of Civil War, but that one has already begun.”

On the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Hillary Clinton said there were ""lessons still to be learned from what happened to us on 9/11"" that could be applied to dealing with ""extremism of any kind."" Her comments came as Democrats spent weeks labeling ""MAGA Republicans"" as extremists.

Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) on Sept. 14 gave a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate declaring that opposing the pro-life movement ""is literally a call to arms in our country.""

A day earlier, Senate candidate Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) called for Americans to ""kill and confront"" the ""extremist"" movement in the Republican Party.

Ryan's call to action against Republican ""extremists"" followed MSNBC host Tiffany Cross on Sept. 3 telling viewers: ""Obviously Republicans, I think, are the biggest threat to democracy. We don't separate right-wing extremists and Republican Party any more.""

""We are at war with these people. These folks are evil. They have allowed evil into their house with Donald Trump,"" MSNBC contributor Roland Martin told Cross during that segment.

The White House has set the tone for this rhetoric. On Sunday, White House adviser Keisha Bottoms emphasized on MSNBC that Biden has been ""very clear"" that the ""MAGA Republican agenda"" is ""essentially, destroy the United States of America.""

""These are just things I happened to catch while casually observing the news. Of course they're merely the tip of an iceberg,"" Elliott wrote on Twitter.

""Democrats are dangerously overdue accepting that their losing power doesn't actually demand a popular, likely violent uprising,"" he said.

Behar on Thursday — the very day Russian forces invaded Ukraine — expressed her concerns that the ongoing conflict might affect her plans to visit Italy for a lavish vacation.

The panel began by discussing the escalating war during the broadcast, prompting co-host Sunny Hostin to express her fears for those Ukrainians who might end up injured or dead due to the ongoing conflict.

""What I also thought about was the fact that estimates are 50,000 Ukrainians will be dead or wounded and that this is going to start a humanitarian crisis, a refugee crisis in Europe,"" she explained. ""We’re talking about 5 million people that are going to be displaced. It’s heartbreaking to hear what is going to happen.""

Even co-host Whoopi Goldberg added that the conflict was ""so disheartening.""

""The people in Russia, they don't want this war,"" she added. ""[Putin] wants it because he's trying to hold on.""



Behar, however, appeared to care little for human suffering, casualties, and displacement and said that she was concerned that her trip to Italy might be derailed.

""Well, I'm scared of what's going to happen in Western Europe, too. You know, you plan a trip, you want to go there,"" she attempted to reason. ""[I wanted] to go to Italy for four years. I haven't been able to make it because of the pandemic — and now this. It's like, what's going to happen there, too?""

What was the reaction?

Much of social media condemned Behar's remarks.

Leading the criticism was Barstool Sports writer Kevin Clancy, who castigated Behar for her apparent selfishness.

""The true horror of the worldwide pandemic and Russia invading Ukraine? Joy Behar hasn't been able to take her trip to Italy,"" Clancy wrote on Twitter. ""Thoughts and Prayers for Joy. We hope she makes it through this tragedy.""

New York Post and Fox News writer Karol Markowicz added, ""Did Putin even stop to think how his invasion would affect Joy Behar's trip to Italy?""







Washington Times columnist Tim Young spat, ""Joy Behar is elitist trash.""

He later added, ""Joy Behar is the perfect liberal Karen... she doesnt care about people getting killed in Ukraine, just that this might interrupt her trips to Italy.""

A widely liked tweet from user Joanne Mason read, ""God grant me the absolute confidence and egocentricity of Joy Behar complaining that a war ruined her vacation plans while the bombs are still literally dropping.""

Even Behar fans turned their backs on the co-host over the remarks.

One user wrote, ""She sounded so damned entitled when she said that and I actually like her.""

""I'm old and say dumb stuff sometimes too, but holy hell, she was being just startlingly oblivious,"" another user added.

Twitter user Sarara chimed in, ""Can you even imagine being so privileged, so removed from reality, so far up your own colon that you’d respond to a massive humanitarian crisis by complaining about your hypothetical vacation being disrupted? Seriously, what the hell @JoyVBehar?""

Behar has yet to issue a clarification or apology for the offending and insensitive remarks.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/josh-hawley-uses-left-playbook-against-democrats-thomas-scotus,2022-02-25
Juan Williams: Peace deals ‘accelerating’ the ‘chance of war’ in the Middle East,"Fox News contributor Juan Williams made the case Tuesday that recent peace deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain brokered by President Donald Trump are actually ""accelerating"" the ""chance of war"" in the Middle East.

President Trump has been lauded by many for his role in brokering the deals, which officially normalized relations between Israel and the two Middle Eastern countries. The president was even nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for securing the deal between Israel and the UAE.

But Williams, a Trump critic, interpreted the news of peace much differently.

Williams presented his argument on Fox News' ""The Five"" while the panelists were discussing recent remarks made by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), in which she called the deals a ""distraction.""

""It is [a distraction],"" Williams said. ""The real trouble here is between the Palestinians and the Israelis, and that situation has not been helped. What we're doing here in this situation is we have the Bahrainians and the United Arab Emirates, they already had diplomatic, security and trade ties with Israel ... and it opens the door to some possibilities.""

""The real action here is the United States giving arms, giving serious arms to UAE potentially to go after the Iranians,"" he argued. ""And so what we're doing is stirring up a proxy war, and that doesn't diminish the chance of war or disruption in the Middle East — it accelerates it.""

You can watch his comments in the video below starting at the 5:10 mark:

'The Five' blast Pelosi for calling Middle East peace deal a 'distraction' youtu.be

""So I think we have to just look honestly at this,"" he continued. ""We have to note that it's taking place in the midst of an intense American election and that what's going on at the White House. I don't think anybody is fooled by it. There certainly is reason for hope, but let's not fool ourselves.""



It is true that some conflict has already arisen as a result of the peace deals. On Tuesday, as the deal was being signed at the White House, Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip launched a rocket attack on Israel, injuring two people.

But it is particularly difficult to make the case that peace agreements should be to blame for violence. Violent offenders should be blamed for violence, which, in this case, would be the Palestinian militants.

After Williams finished, fellow Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich, chided his comments, saying, ""Well you would hope the normalization of Arab countries against the Israeli state that they wanted to annihilate previously would be a good thing, but we'll move on.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/journalist-exposes-how-democrats-have-upped-violent-rhetoric-leading-up-to-midterm-elections,2020-09-16
Judge considering blocking Indiana abortion law,"On Monday, abortion rights groups urged an Indiana judge to block the state's recent ban on most abortions reports Reuters.

Kenneth Falk, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana, told Judge Kelsey Hanlon that the ban violated rights to privacy and liberty that Falk said were guaranteed by Indiana’s constitution. ""The most devastating harm here ... is the loss of personal autonomy,"" Falk said.

The ban was approved by the Indiana legislature in August and signed by Governor Eric Holcomb. The ban, which has limited exceptions, made Indiana the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. The ban took effect last Thursday, reports WTHR.

The lawsuit seeking to block the ban was brought by the ACLU on behalf of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, and other groups.

The ACLU sued under Indiana’s 2015 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which restricts government action that interferes with a person’s religious exercise.

“Indiana’s RFRA law protects religious freedom for all Hoosiers, not just those who practice Christianity,” Falk said in a statement when the suit was announced. “The ban on abortion will substantially burden the exercise of religion by many Hoosiers who, under the new law, would be prevented from obtaining abortions, in conflict with their sincere religious beliefs.”

Falk asked the judge to restore Indiana’s previous abortion laws, which prohibited most abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy and greatly restricted abortions after the 13th week, reports ABC7.

Indiana Solicitor General Tom Fisher argued that ""unborn children will literally die"" without the new law, and stated that the legislature has the ability to limit actions that may harm others. “Abortion was never understood to be a right secured to the people either in common law or under the constitution,” Fisher said.

Fisher also made the argument that the ACLU’s privacy argument was too broad.

“The point is, the right that the plaintiffs are demanding have no limits,” Fisher told the court. “Today it's abortion, tomorrow it's something else. And regardless of what one thinks about abortion, the question is, 'Is there anything that’s not protected by the point the plaintiffs are claiming?' They talk about the right to privacy, but that’s not mentioned in the Constitution and has no meaningful boundaries or meaningful content.”

After hearing arguments, the judge decided not to make an immediate decision but said she would make a decision “expeditiously.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joy-behar-shredded-for-complaining-that-ukraine-invasion-could-interfere-with-her-swanky-european-vacation-plans,2022-09-20
Jussie Smollett TV show 'Empire' to end after next season in wake of police accusation that he faked hate crime,"TV show ""Empire"" — which had starred Jussie Smollett until Chicago police accused the gay actor and singer of staging a fake hate crime against himself earlier this year — will end after next season, Variety reported.

""We are turning the final season into a television event,"" Fox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier said, according the magazine, adding that there are ""no plans"" for Smollett return for the show's sixth and final season.

However, Collier also told Variety ""the writers room for next season hasn't even gathered yet.""

What's the background?

Smollett claimed a pair of masked attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country"" — a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" 2016 campaign slogan — put a noose around his neck, and poured a substance that smelled like bleach on him while beating him in a Chicago street around 2 a.m. Jan. 29 in near zero temperatures.

The mainstream media, celebrities, and prominent Democratic politicians — including presidential candidates Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.), both of whom called it an ""attempted modern-day lynching"" in separate tweets — jumped on social media to decry the alleged hate crime.

But police arrested Smollett in February, accusing him of staging the entire thing and paying two black men to help him pull it off.

In fact, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, who also is black, tore into Smollett after the actor's arrest and said Smollett ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

CPD Supt. Johnson: Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career youtu.be

Smollett pleaded not guilty to 16 counts of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report — and then in a shocking move, prosecutors dropped all charges against Smollett in late March. In addition, a ""judge granted a motion to seal the case,"" and a Smollett spokesman said the actor's ""record will be fully expunged.""

That didn't stop Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel from angrily blasting the decision to drop Smollett's charges, saying the move was ""not on the level"" and a ""whitewash of justice.""

Chicago Mayor On Smollett: 'This Was A Whitewash Of Justice' | NBC News youtu.be

Emanuel promised to send a bill to Smollett for the investigative work Chicago authorities took on in relation to his case, and when he missed the deadline to pay the $130,000 bill in early April, the city said it was suing the actor.

Meanwhile, it was widely reported that Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the Smollett case after rumblings that she interfered in the investigation — but then it came to light that she never actually recused herself at all.

In the aftermath, associations from every police department in Cook County announced ""no confidence"" in Foxx, and the Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association accused her of making ""repeated misleading and deceptive statements to the public"" and having ""failed in her most fundamental ethical obligations to the public.""

In response, Foxx wondered whether racism and sexism was behind criticism she was been receiving.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/juan-williams-israel-peace-deals-war,2019-05-13
Jussie Smollett doesn't like being compared to sixth-grader who lied about white boys cutting off her dreadlocks. Not one bit.,"Jussie Smollett put himself back in the spotlight by blasting a social media post that compared the former “Empire"" actor to a black girl who admitted Monday to lying about white boys attacking her and cutting off her dreadlocks.

Smollett — who denied he orchestrated a racist, anti-gay attack against himself in January despite Chicago police arresting him and charging him with felony disorderly conduct for filing a false police report — responded to an Instagram post Monday from celebrity gossip outfit ""The Shade Room.""

'Jussie really is a trendsetter'



In the post, Derrick Jaxn — a social media guru who also is black — noted below a photo of the girl who lied about her cut dreadlocks that ""Jussie really is a trendsetter.""

How did Smollett respond?

Smollett soon hit back:

With all due respect, brother, y'all can clown me all you want, but my story has actually never changed, and I haven't lied about a thing. Y'all can continue to be misinformed, internalized sheep, who believe what actual proven liars feed you, or you can read the actual docs. Either way, Imma be alright. I know me and what happened. You don't. So carry on. All love.

Jaxn later commented, ""Justice for Jussie.""



How did others react?

Comments on the post were mixed. Many backed Smollett and said they still believe him while others took issue with the actor and the girl who lied about her dreadlocks being cut.

""I do not like when fellow black people use the whole racism issue for clout or whatever,"" one commenter wrote.

What's the background?

Smollett claimed masked men yelled ""MAGA country"" — a reference to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again"" — at him, put a noose around his neck, and poured liquid on him that smelled like bleach. The alleged attack took place on a Chicago street at 2 a.m. Jan. 29 amid near-zero temperatures; no video of the alleged attack has been found.

Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson later said Smollett paid Nigerian brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo $3,500 with a check to pull off the ""staged"" attack — and then brutally took Smollett to task after the actor's arrest, saying he ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.""

A grand jury in early March indicted Smollett with 16 counts of disorderly conduct in connection with the staged-attack allegations. But a few weeks later all the charges against Smollett were dropped.

Then-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel angrily blasted the dropped charges against Smollett and called it ""not on the level."" A civil complaint from the city of Chicago against Smollett says police logged more than 1,800 overtime hours investigating his attack claims, which cost the city $130,106.15, NBC News said.

Associations from every police department in Cook County announced ""no confidence"" in Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx. In addition, the Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association accused Foxx of making ""repeated misleading and deceptive statements to the public"" and having ""failed in her most fundamental ethical obligations to the public.""

It was widely reported that Foxx recused herself from the Smollett case after rumblings that she interfered in the investigation — but then it came to light that she never actually recused herself at all.

In June, a Cook County judge ordered the appointment of a special prosecutor, saying ""the unprecedented irregularities identified in this case warrants the appointment of independent counsel to restore the public's confidence in the integrity of our criminal justice system.""

But it came to light Monday that the special prosecutor, Dan Webb, wrote a $1,000 check to Foxx's campaign in 2016. Still, Webb's affidavit on the matter noted that Foxx's attorney ""made it clear that he and Kim Foxx do not consider this political contribution an issue, and stated that Kim Foxx will not claim any conflict of interest, or have any other objection related to this contribution.""

Kamala Harris and husband Doug Emhoff kiss with masks on despite being vaccinated and outside. It's just the latest confusing mask gesture by the Biden admin.,"At times, the Biden administration has presented confusing and contradictory mask-wearing habits, which has sparked questions about President Joe Biden's COVID-19 vaccine messaging and recent CDC guidelines. In the latest inconsistent mask gesture, Vice President Kamala Harris determined that she needed a face mask to kiss her own husband while outside after they had both been vaccinated for coronavirus.

Harris and husband Doug Emhoff traveled to Joint Base Andrews, where she was taking a plane to Providence, Rhode Island, and he was flying to Allentown, Pennsylvania. Before Harris departed, the fully vaccinated couple kept their face masks on when they gave each other a goodbye kiss while outside on the tarmac.

Harris and U.S. second gentleman Doug Emhoff both received a second round of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine on Jan. 26.



The masked kiss occurred a week after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines on mask-wearing outside: ""Fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask outdoors, except in certain crowded settings and venues.""



CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said, ""If you are fully vaccinated and want to attend a small outdoor gathering with people who are vaccinated and unvaccinated, or dine at an outdoor restaurant with friends from multiple households, the science shows if you are vaccinated, you can do so safely unmasked.""

President Joe Biden bucked the COVID-19 recommendations by the health agency. Biden said last week that wearing a mask, including people who are vaccinated and outdoors, is ""a patriotic responsibility for God's sake.""



Biden has presented conflicting messaging on face masks to the American people in recent weeks.

During a photo op with former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter this week, Biden and first lady Jill Biden are both maskless while nestled close to the Carters, who are both in their 90s.

On Monday, Biden pulled down his mask to talk to a young boy outside York High School in Yorktown, Virginia.



Biden, who received a second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Jan. 11, wore a face mask during a climate summit with world leaders last week that was held remotely on video conferencing app Zoom.

When asked why Biden was the only world leader to wear a face mask during the video call, White House press secretary Jen Psaki replied, ""Because he is sending a message to the world that he is putting in place precautions and continuing to do that as leader of the United States.""

On April 30, Biden wouldn't even leave the podium without finding his mask; today he's mask-less and fist-bumping Amtrak officials

Last month, Biden wore a mask while visiting Arlington National Cemetery, despite not a single person remotely in his vicinity.

On Inauguration Day, hours after signing an executive order mandating that face masks must be worn on all federal property, Biden and his family were without masks posing for photos at the Lincoln Memorial, which is on federal land.

Biden told Americans to mask up for the first 100 days of his administration.



""The first day I'm inaugurated to say I'm going to ask the public for 100 days to mask,"" Biden proclaimed in December. ""Just 100 days to mask, not forever. 100 days.""

Kamala Harris says to 'leave Joe Biden alone' on Ukraine — Nikki Haley blasts 'embarrassing' defense,"Democratic presidential candidates are having a difficult time speaking definitively about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son's business in Ukraine.

Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said she didn't know whether her own proposed ethics policy would preclude a vice president's child from serving on the board of a foreign company.

Over the weekend, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) was asked a similar question — and responded by telling everyone to ""leave Joe Biden alone.""

Reporter: If you were elected president, would you allow the son or daughter of your vice president to serve on a board of an oil company outside this country?""

Harris: Probably not. The problem that we've got, again, with this issue is that it's a distraction from the fact that, look, as far as I'm concerned, leave Joe Biden alone. Just leave him alone. On the issue of what this president has done that has been about corrupting America's democracy, being in cahoots with a foreign leader, to yet again, try and manipulate the election of the President of the United States.

Harris admits that she would not allow her vice president to do what Biden did during the Obama administration — indicating that she believes something was improper about the arrangement — yet she demands that everyone stop asking questions about it, even though Biden's strong chance at becoming the Democratic presidential nominee could possibly be diminishing.



Democrats have struggled to push for President Donald Trump's impeachment while avoiding in-depth discussion about Biden's own potential abuse of power. The problem for them is that the two are inextricably linked, and you can't really dig into Trump without digging into Biden.

Hunter Biden was named to the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma in 2014, earning $50,000 per month. In 2016, Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid from Ukraine unless Ukrainian officials fired prosecutor Viktor Shokin — who reportedly happened to have conducted an investigation of Burisma and Hunter Biden before he was fired.

Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the situation during a July phone call, which is being used by Democrats as potential grounds for impeachment.

Former U.S. Ambassador to United Nations Nikki Haley called Harris out for this deflecting response on Twitter.

""Leave Joe Biden alone? So are you telling us @KamalaHarris that what Biden did was ethical and moral?"" Haley wrote. ""Where are the questions about the conflict of interest that occurred from Biden's actions and the issues with his son? This response is embarrassing.""

Katie Couric covered up RBG’s harsh condemnation of anthem kneelers to ‘protect’ her from public backlash,"Journalist Katie Couric has admitted that she covered up Ruth Bader Ginsburg's poignant condemnation of players who kneel for the national anthem in effort to ""protect"" the late Supreme Court justice from public criticism.

What are the details?

In her soon-to-be-released memoir, ""Going There,"" Couric said she was faced with a ""conundrum"" when writing up her sit-down interview with Ginsburg in 2016 after the late justice offered a scathing rebuke of football players like Colin Kaepernick, the Daily Mail reported.

During the interview, Ginsburg controversially argued that not standing for the anthem shows a ""contempt for a government that has made it possible for their parents and grandparents to live a decent life.""

She added: ""Which they probably could not have lived in the places they came from ... as they became older they realize that this was youthful folly, and that's why education is important.""

But in the final version of the article, published by Yahoo News, Couric resolved only to include quotes from Ginsburg in which the justice called anthem protests ""dumb and disrespectful"" and referred to those who engage in the demonstration as ""stupid"" and ""arrogant.""



""I think it's a terrible thing to do, but I wouldn't lock a person up for doing it. I would point out how ridiculous it seems to me to do such an act,"" Ginsburg reportedly said, comparing the action to burning the American flag.

""If they want to be stupid, there's no law that should be preventive. If they want to be arrogant, there's no law that prevents them from that. What I would do is strongly take issue with the point of view that they are expressing when they do that,"" she said.

Why did Couric make the edits?

Following the interview, the head of public affairs for the Supreme Court reportedly emailed Couric to say that Ginsburg, who was 83 at the time, had ""misspoken"" and to ask that the relevant portion be removed from the story.

According to the Daily Mail, in her memoir, Couric recalls being ""conflicted"" over the decision since she was a ""big fan of RBG"" but believed Ginsburg's comments were ""unworthy of a crusader for equality.""

Couric reportedly reached out to several for advice and received varying answers. One of Couric's friends, New York Times journalist David Brooks, allegedly argued that Ginsburg likely didn't understand the question despite the fact that she was still serving on the nation's top court.

Ultimately, Couric decided to cut the controversial remarks from the article.

In the memoir, the journalist explained she made the decision because she ""wanted to protect"" Ginsburg and believed the issue of racial justice to be a ""blind spot"" for her.

The revelation has since sparked outrage among Couric's critics, many of whom argue that the episode once again demonstrates the media's favorable treatment of liberal public figures.

Ginsburg passed away last September from metastatic pancreatic cancer at the age of 87. She had served on the Supreme Court for 27 years.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-kiss-mask-biden,2021-10-13
Kenosha rioter points a gun right in the face of Blaze Media reporter while he was shooting video,"A rioter in Kenosha, Wisconsin, brandished a gun and pointed it directly in the face of Blaze Media reporter Elijah Schaffer Monday night — while he was filming.

The harrowing moment encapsulates the intense lawlessness of the current scene in Kenosha, where rioters have taken to the streets and set the city ablaze in response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old black man, over the weekend.

""HOLY SH*#: while interviewing this #BLM rioter in Kinosha [sic] he pulls out a real pistol and points it at my camera while explaining what we would do to cops if they rolled up on us right now,"" Schaffer wrote on Twitter.

""It's been a while since I had a gun pointed at me even if it was just to make a point,"" he added.

Rioters undoubtedly view the incident as yet another example of police in America using excessive force on a black person. However, there are conflicting reports, and an investigation into the matter is needed.



Blake suffered from seven gunshot wounds, but he is being treated at a Milwaukee hospital and is expected to survive.

Nonetheless, starting on Sunday night, following video of the shooting being widely disseminated, the town erupted in violent protest.

Schaffer has posted several more videos on his Twitter account of the rampant violence taking place, which includes the burning of dozens of personal vehicles, a work truck, and a youth correctional facility.

Even a small business building totally unrelated to the shooting was caught in the crossfire of the angry mob.



Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) deployed the National Guard to help local law enforcement quell the riots Monday night.

Shortly after video of the shooting went viral, without any investigation having been conducted, Evers spoke out in condemnation of the police officers involved and in support of protesters.

""While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country,"" Evers tweeted.

The three officers involved in the Blake shooting have been placed on administrative leave.

According to NBC News, the Milwaukee Police Association said Monday that while video of the shooting ""may show some troubling things, protesting must remain calm. It must remain peaceful.""

The association added that officials should not rush to judgment: ""By rushing to judgment, without knowing all of the facts, this will only fuel the cause of others to protest in a manner that isn't peaceful.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-says-to-leave-joe-biden-alone-on-ukraine-nikki-haley-blasts-embarrassing-defense,2020-08-25
"Kids at Philadelphia Islamic Center sing about beheading Jews, becoming martyrs","""We will defend the land of divine guidance with our bodies, and we will sacrifice our souls without hesitation,"" said the young child. ""We will chop off their heads, and we will liberate the sorrowful and exalted Al-Aqsa Mosque. We will lead the army of Allah fulfilling His promise, and we will subject them to eternal torture.""

Those are the translated words in a shocking video posted online by the Muslim American Society (MAS) Islamic Center in Philadelphia this week. It was posted on Facebook to celebrate it, then later treated as an oversight. Ultimately, the person in charge of the program was ""dismissed.""

Watchdog group the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) alerted the media to the video, and uploaded a copy to YouTube. In it, children at the Center sing songs and read radical statements about Palestine and Israel. The translations, verified by MAS, are truly appalling.

""These are not isolated incidents; they are happening in major centers of the country – including in Pennsylvania,"" MEMRI said in a statement released to Fox News and other outlets.

The Muslim American Society released a statement on Friday, saying the group ""rejects"" the ""statement"" made in the incident, and blamed it first on a lack of vetting.

""While we celebrate the coming together of different cultures and languages, not all songs were properly vetted,"" said Friday's statement from the Muslim American Society. ""This was an unintended mistake and an oversight in which the center and the students are remorseful. MAS will conduct an internal investigation to ensure this does not occur again.""

That statement was itself later revised, and now reads in part, ""our investigation revealed that the school that organized the event on April 17, 2019 is a separate entity renting space from MAS Philadelphia,"" and said that ""the video from the school was uploaded to the chapter's Facebook page without verifying the content of the video for appropriateness.""

The Philadelphia chapter of the Anti Defamation League released their own statement, calling the video ""extremely disturbing"" on Saturday. ""Children should not be indoctrinated to hate,"" it said. ""These young people should never have been asked to make speeches and dance and lip-sync to songs that glorify violence against Jews and the State of Israel. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is deeply complex and painful on all sides, and the only chance for a peaceful future is to teach our children to pursue peace.""

MAS recently sent out an action alert to its membership, calling for support for Rep. llhan Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib. The alert said that the two ""have been under attack for speaking out against special interest lobbying on Capitol Hill.""

Coincidentally, the special interests they're referring to are Israel and Jewish interest groups like AIPAC.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/katie-couric-ruth-bader-ginsburg-anthem,2019-05-05

"South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem dresses down Joe Biden after he tweets, 'Help is on the way'","Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem took a swipe at Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Twitter Wednesday after Biden vowed to assist struggling Americans.

The former vice president tweeted a promise to the American people the day before, saying, ""My message to everyone struggling right now is this: Help is on the way.""

Noem shot back by reminding followers that an offer to ""help"" coming from Biden, or any government official for that matter, ought to be received with a healthy amount of skepticism.

The South Dakota governor quoted classic remarks made by former President Ronald Reagan during a 1986 press conference, in which he said, ""The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: 'I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.'""

As the Daily Wire noted, Reagan made the comments while speaking about farmers who had been injured by the government's ""help."" Here is the quote with some surrounding context:



Some sectors of our farm economy are hurting, and their anguish is a concern to all Americans. I think you all know that I've always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help."" A great many of the current problems on the farm were caused by government-imposed embargoes and inflation, not to mention government's long history of conflicting and haphazard policies. Our ultimate goal, of course, is economic independence for agriculture and, through steps like the tax-reform bill, we seek to return farming to real farmers. But until we make that transition, the government must act compassionately and responsibly.

The same insinuation may be true today if what Biden considers to be ""help"" is a national mask mandate and stricter lockdown enforcement amid the coronavirus pandemic. Americans struggling financially under lockdowns would likely not view those policies as helpful.



Noem has said she would not comply with a national mask mandate should a Biden administration impose one. Instead of mandates and lockdowns, the governor has opted for a freedom first approach to combating the virus.

Since the start of the pandemic, she has been outspoken against political leaders taking advantage of the health crisis to assume more power for themselves.

""I took an oath when I was in Congress obviously to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I believe in our freedoms and liberties. What I've seen across the country is so many people give up their liberties for just a little bit of security and they don't have to do that,"" the governor said during an April interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham. ""If a leader will take too much power in a time of crisis, that is how we lose our country.""

"As US troops leave, Kurds invite Syrian forces to take over strategic city","With U.S. military forces set to withdraw entirely from Syria in the near future, the United States' Kurdish allies are caught between the forces of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, against whom they had rebelled, and an offensive by the Turkish government that has vowed to wipe them off the map.

Faced with this choice, the Kurds have reached out to Assad's government and invited his forces into the strategic city of Manbij, CBS News reported.

What's the situation?

The civil war in Syria has been going on for nearly eight years at this point. Rebel forces initially made progress, but support from Russian and Iranian forces eventually gave Assad the upper hand. Now he seems poised to retake his entire country.

Turkey has taken advantage of the instability in Syria to launch a series of attacks against the Kurds. Turkey has had issues with a Kurdish militia known as the PKK inside its own borders. While the U.S. considers the PKK to be a terrorist group, it considers other Kurdish groups to be invaluable allies. Turkey, meanwhile, views all ethnic Kurds as an extension of the PKK.

In October, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to ""descend on them [the Kurds] with more comprehensive and effective [strength].""

What's happening in Manbij?

This isn't the first time Manbij has appeared in the news. In May, Turkey threatened to take the city of Manbij, a crucial Kurdish position, even though U.S. forces were still inside it. This threatened to cause a major incident between the U.S. and its NATO ally Turkey, until Kurdish troops in June offered to leave the city. While this successfully prevented a Turkish attack, Kurdish forces remained in control of the city six months later.



For now, U.S. troops are still in Manbij. Turkey also announced Dec. 21 that it will briefly halt its assault on the Kurds in Syria, but stressed that it was only a temporary postponement. That leaves the Kurds with a limited amount of time to try to ensure their own survival.

""The aim is to ward off a Turkish offensive,"" senior Kurdish official Ilham Ahmed said, according to CBS News. ""If the Turks' excuse is the (Kurdish militia), they will leave their posts to the government.""

Ahmed said that the Kurds have been negotiating with Assad's government and the Russians to hand over control of the city before Turkish forces can attack it.



Syria's military announced on Friday that it had taken control of the city already, but this has not been independently confirmed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kobe_bryant_killed,2018-12-28
"LA County escalates COVID lockdown battle with John MacArthur's church, terminates parking lot lease","Los Angeles County has sent notice to Grace Community Church that the county is terminating the church's parking lot lease, the latest development in a continued legal conflict between the church and the county over the church's refusal to comply with COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.

Grace Community Church, pastored by prominent evangelical John MacArthur, has been open for in-person services since late July in defiance of the state's COVID-19 restrictions. MacArthur has stated publicly that state and local government officials have overstepped their authority by restricting churches, and that the severity of the pandemic doesn't justify the restrictions.

Grace Community Church n Sun Valley now has 30 days to vacate the lot or risk having any private property left there be confiscated. The church has leased the parking lot from the county for decades.

Los Angeles County has been seeking to shut the church down with a restraining order since it reopened, but the Los Angeles County Superior Court struck down that request.

Jenna Ellis, an attorney for the Thomas More Society which is helping represent Grace Community Church, called the move ""harassment.""

""Los Angeles County is retaliating against Grace Community Church for simply exercising their constitutionally protected right to hold church and challenging an unreasonable, unlawful health order,"" Ellis said in a statement emailed to TheBlaze. ""In America, we have a judicial system to ensure that the executive branch does not abuse its power, and Grace Community Church has every right to be heard without fear of reprisal. The Democrats' message to Americans is clear — if you don't bow to every whim of tyranny, the government will come after you. The Church has peacefully held this lease for 45 years and the only reason the County is attempting eviction is because John MacArthur stood up to their unconstitutional power grab. This is harassment, abusive, and unconscionable.""

With the release of CDC data showing that only 6% of people who have died from COVID-19 had no co-morbidities, MacArthur said in a sermon Sunday that ""there is no pandemic"" and that he isn't surprised that such high levels of deception have been used to shut down churches that preach the gospel.

""We've all been suspicious of the fact that we've been meeting together now for weeks and weeks and weeks, and we don't know anyone who's ill. Nobody in our congregation has ever been to the hospital with this,"" MacArthur said. ""We know there are reasons for this that have nothing to do with the virus. There's another virus loose in the world and it's the virus of deception, and the one who is behind the virus of deception is the arch-deceiver, Satan himself. And it's not a surprise to me that, in the midst of all this deception, the great effort that is going on is to shut down churches that preach the gospel.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kristi-noem-reagan-quote-biden,2020-09-01
Lab-leak denying EcoHealth Alliance president recuses self from COVID-19 investigation amid conflict-of-interest claims,"EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak has recused himself from a U.N.-partnered commission that is investigating the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus after vigorously working to discredit the lab-leak hypothesis and failing to disclose his organization's ties to the Chinese lab at its center.

Daszak is a highly influential scientist who since the onset of the pandemic has fiercely attacked anyone who suggested the possibility that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was manufactured and somehow leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Between 2014 and 2019, his organization funneled $3.4 million in National Institutes of Health grants to the Wuhan lab to study bat coronaviruses. A naturalized U.S. citizen, Daszak was the only American representative of a 10-member World Health Organization team sent to investigate the origins of the virus. He is also a member of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission, an interdisciplinary initiative established by the Lancet medical journal to make recommendations on how to prevent and contain future pandemics.

The Lancet COVID-19 Commission announced Tuesday that Daszak recused himself from the investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic after it came to light that his nonprofit group had funded research at the Wuhan lab that some claim could be related to the virus' origins.

""The Lancet COVID-19 Commission will carefully scrutinize the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in advance of its final report, with the overriding aim of recommending policies to prevent and contain future emerging infectious disease outbreaks. The Commission's technical work will be conducted by independent experts who were not themselves directly involved in US-China research activities that are under scrutiny. Dr. Peter Daszak has recused himself from the Commission's work on the origins of the virus,"" the statement said.

""The Commission urges all scientists who were involved in the US-China research to explain fully and transparently the nature of their work. In the meantime, the Commission will tap global experts in biosafety and other fields to help assess the relevant hypotheses on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, and to recommend ways to prevent and contain future outbreaks, whether from naturally occurring zoonotic events or research-related activities.""

There is controversy surrounding Daszak because of his failure to be fully transparent about the nature of his work. Aside from failing to disclose his organization's ties to the Wuhan lab and his interests in the research performed there, Daszak worked both in public and behind the scenes to organize a campaign to discredit the lab-leak theory.

Publicly, Daszak has made misleading statements about the nature of the work conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and accused those who've suggested it's possible the virus leaked from the lab there of promoting conspiracy theories.

Privately, he led a campaign to give the appearance of authoritative scientific weight to his preferred natural origin hypothesis and ostracize opposing views. Last year, Daszak organized and drafted a statement signed by 27 prominent public health scientists that denounced ""conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin."" The letter contained a declaration by the authors of no competing interests, despite Daszak's personal interest in ensuring that the research he supported in Wuhan continued uninterrupted by accusations that it caused the COVID-19 pandemic.



The statement was published by the Lancet in February 2020 and became the dominant media narrative about the origins of the virus throughout 2020. Big tech social media companies took action to de-platform all dissenting opinions, labeling claims that contradicted the ""science"" as ""misinformation."" As Vanity Fair noted in its explosive report on the various investigations into the origins of the virus, the Lancet statement ""effectively ended the debate over COVID-19's origins before it began.""

On Monday, the Lancet published an addendum acknowledging Daszak's potential conflicts of interest regarding the February 2020 statement.

""In this letter, the authors declared no competing interests. Some readers have questioned the validity of this disclosure, particularly as it relates to one of the authors, Peter Daszak,"" the Lancet wrote. ""In line with guidance from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, medical journals ask authors to report financial and non-financial relationships that may be relevant to interpreting the content of their manuscript.

""There may be differences in opinion as to what constitutes a competing interest. Transparent reporting allows readers to make judgments about these interests. Readers, in turn, have their own interests that could influence their evaluation of the work in question,"" the journal stated, adding that it invited each of the 27 authors of the February 2020 letter to ""re-evaluate their competing interests.""

The Lancet then provided an updated disclosure statement from Daszak (edited for readability):

[Peter Daszak]'s remuneration is paid solely in the form of a salary from EcoHealth Alliance, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation. EcoHealth Alliance's mission is to develop science-based solutions to prevent pandemics and promote conservation. Funding for this work comes from a range of US Government funding agencies and non-governmental sources. All past and current funders are listed publicly, and full financial accounts are filed annually and published.



EcoHealth Alliance's work in China was previously funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Neither PD nor EcoHealth Alliance have received funding from the People's Republic of China.



PD joined the WHO–China joint global study on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 towards the end of 2020 and is currently a member. As per WHO rules, this work is undertaken as an independent expert in a private capacity, not as an EcoHealth Alliance staff member. The work conducted by this study was published in March, 2021.



EcoHealth Alliance's work in China includes collaboration with a range of universities and governmental health and environmental science organisations, all of which are listed in prior publications, three of which received funding from US federal agencies as part of EcoHealth Alliance grants or cooperative agreements, as publicly reported by NIH. EcoHealth Alliance's work in China is currently unfunded. All federally funded subcontractees are assessed and approved by the respective US federal agencies in advance and all funding sources are acknowledged in scientific publications as appropriate.



EcoHealth Alliance's work in China involves assessing the risk of viral spillover across the wildlife–livestock–human interface, and includes behavioural and serological surveys of people, and ecological and virological analyses of animals. This work includes the identification of viral sequences in bat samples, and has resulted in the isolation of three bat SARS-related coronaviruses that are now used as reagents to test therapeutics and vaccines. It also includes the production of a small number of recombinant bat coronaviruses to analyse cell entry and other characteristics of bat coronaviruses for which only the genetic sequences are available.



NIH reviewed the planned recombinant virus work and deemed it does not meet the criteria that would warrant further specific review by its Potential Pandemic Pathogen Care and Oversight (P3CO) committee.



All of EcoHealth Alliance's work is reviewed and approved by appropriate research ethics committees, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Institutional Review Boards for biomedical research involving human subjects, P3CO oversight administrators, and biosafety committees, as listed on all relevant publications.

Dr. Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economics professor and the the chairman of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission, wrote a related op-ed Tuesday explaining the state of the debate on the origins of the virus. While the op-ed does not mention Daszak by name, it does discuss the issues the commission will consider in its investigation of the origins of the virus, from which Daszak recused himself, and states: ""The Commission's overriding aim is to recommend policies to prevent and contain future disease outbreaks, and its technical work will be conducted by independent experts who were not themselves involved directly in the US-China research under scrutiny. The scientists who were involved should explain fully the nature of their work.""



Sachs emphasized that both the lab-leak hypothesis and the natural origin hypothesis ""are viable at this stage of the investigation.""

""Those who have claimed that a natural origin is the only viable hypothesis overlook the extensive research activity that was underway in the field and in laboratories on SARS-like viruses, including in Wuhan, China, where the first outbreak was identified, and in the United States,"" Sachs wrote. ""Those who claim that a research-related infection is the only viable hypothesis overlook the frequency of natural zoonotic transmissions of viruses, such as the SARS outbreak. There are many ways that a natural event could have occurred with SARS-CoV-2 somewhere in China and then been brought to Wuhan by an infected individual or an animal brought to market.""

He clarified that research seeking to prove the virus has natural origins remains inconclusive. It's still possible that the virus was transmitted to humans from some animal, though scientists have not yet identified an animal host. It's also possible that the virus originated from coronavirus research without being artificially created, which would be the case if a researcher contracted it in the field, brought it back to the lab, developed mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, and it spread from there.

The third possibility is that the virus was engineered in the Wuhan lab through gain-of-function research, which involves modifying viruses to be more transmissible among humans.

""The public and policy community have become increasingly aware of the intensive research on SARS-like viruses that was underway in the US, China, and elsewhere, both in collecting viral samples from the field and in studying their infectivity and pathogenicity (ability to cause disease) in the laboratory,"" Sachs wrote. ""We have learned that much of this work can be classified as 'gain of function' (GoF) research ... Experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) involving the modification of bat-origin coronaviruses to express proteins that are likely to enhance entry into human cells are viewed by many scientists as falling squarely into the category of GOFROC.""

Sachs acknowledged that the NIH funded U.S. and Chinese scientists to work collaboratively on collecting SARS-like viruses, taking them back to the Wuhan lab for study, though he did not mention EcoHealth Alliance by name.

""If there was indeed a laboratory-related release of SARS-CoV-2, it may well have occurred in a project funded by the US government, using methods developed and championed by US scientists, and as part of a US-led and US-financed program to collect and analyze potentially dangerous viruses, including in China,"" Sachs wrote.

He called on the NIH and on the Chinese government to release more information on the research that was funded and conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He also called for ""an international and independent investigation"" to learn the truth and for both the U.S. and Chinese governments to cooperate ""fully and transparently"" with such an inquiry.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kurds-invite-syrian-forces-to-take-over-strategic-city,2021-06-22
Labor secretary asked for solutions to inflation crisis. But he can't name single one — and offers only excuses.,"Labor Secretary Marty Walsh was asked Friday what short-term measures the Biden administration can take to reduce inflation and stop the growing economic crisis dead in its tracks.

But Walsh offered only excuses — and no solutions.

What is the background?

The latest report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the consumer price index rose to an annual rate of 7.5% in January, the highest rate in 40 years. Unfortunately, economists believe inflation will continue to grip Americans, especially as prices of good continue to grow while wage growth remains stagnant.

What did Walsh say?

During an appearance on ""Bloomberg the Open,"" host Jonathan Ferro questioned Walsh over short-term solutions to the inflation crisis. But Walsh was unable to name a single measure the Biden administration is taking to provide relief for Americans.

Instead, Walsh only pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain, and the Russia-Ukraine war as inflation-driving problems.

""Well, I think if you’re talking about inflation, I think what’s happening here is— I mean, we’re in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, certainly, that’s one. We’re in the midst of dealing with supply chain issues. Now we have a major conflict in the world — that all eyes of the world are on the Ukrainian people and Ukraine,"" Walsh said.

""And I think that as we move forward here — and the question earlier — as oil supply gets cut back from Russia, if that’s what ultimately happens, we’re going to see an increase in gas prices. And I think that there’s a point here that we have to just continue to move forward,"" he continued.

In fact, Walsh was extremely vague, saying ""lots of conversations"" and ""lots of actions"" will be had and taken in the coming weeks and months to address inflation, but he did not offer any specific details.

""The president has been very clear on bringing down inflation, he talked about it at the State of the Union. But we’re living in very interesting dynamic and times are happening here,"" Walsh said. ""So, again, there’s lots of conversations and lots of actions that we’ll be taking over the next weeks and months.""

The relevant portion of the interview begins at 30:57:

During his State of the Union address, Biden pushed his social agenda plan — the ""Build Back Better"" plan, which has since been rebranded as ""Building a Better America"" — as the solution to inflation and other economic woes.



Although any form of Biden's social spending plan is unlikely to ever pass Congress, economists believe the plan would contribute to inflation — not relieve economic problems.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/la-county-john-macarthur-church-parking-lot,2022-03-04
Country group Lady Antebellum changes name because of 'blindspots' they didn't know existed,"Following the George Floyd protests, there have been cultural upheaval transpiring at breakneck speed. Christopher Columbus statues are being torn down, police TV shows are being canceled, rappers have taken control of autonomous zones, and cartoons dogs are being lambasted. With the woke mob ready to cancel anyone and anything, one country-pop music group took it upon themselves to try to avoid being maligned for their band name.

Grammy-winning group Lady Antebellum announced Thursday that it had changed its band name. From now on, Lady Antebellum will go by the name of ""Lady A."" The country-pop trio, who are best known for their 2009 hit song, ""Need You Now,"" said they made the change because""blindspots we didn't even know existed have been revealed.""

Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley, and Dave Haywood released a letter to their fans about the change.



""We've watched and listened more than ever these last few weeks, and our hearts have been stirred with conviction, our eyes opened wide to the injustices, inequality and biases Black women and men have always faced and continue to face everyday,"" the letter read.

""After much personal reflection, band discussion, prayer and many honest conversations with some of our closest Black friends and colleagues, we have decided to drop the word 'antebellum' from our name and move forward as Lady A, the nickname our fans gave us almost from the start,"" the band announced.



The Merriam-Webster dictionary states that the definition of ""antebellum"" is ""existing before a war, especially: existing before the American Civil War.""

""Antebellum means 'before the war,' but it wasn't widely associated with the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865) until after that conflict was over,"" the dictionary said. ""The word comes from the Latin phrase 'ante bellum' (literally, 'before the war'), and its earliest known print appearance in English dates back to the 1840s.""

The term does not make reference to either side of the Civil War: the Confederate States of America or the United States of America. The word only pertains to anything before the Civil War.

""When we set out together almost 14 years ago, we named our band after the southern 'antebellum' style home where we took our first photos,"" the band explained. ""As musicians, it reminded us of all the music born in the south that influenced us…Southern Rock, Blues, R&B, Gospel and of course Country. But we are regretful and embarrassed to say that we did not take into account the associations that weigh down this word referring to the period of history before The Civil War, which includes slavery.

""We are deeply sorry for the hurt this has caused and for anyone who has felt unsafe, unseen or unvalued,"" the letter continued. ""Causing pain was never our hearts' intention, but it doesn't change the fact that indeed, it did just that. So today, we speak up and make a change. We hope you will dig in and join us.""

There has been a renewed interest in dismantling Confederate statues in the past week, including beheading four Confederate statues in Virginia and tearing down a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis along Richmond's Monument Avenue.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lab-leak-ecohealth-alliance-president-recuses-self-covid-investigation,2020-06-11
"Lancet finally publishes 'alternative view' raising COVID lab-leak theory, arguing no direct evidence for natural origins","Following the publication of two letters that asserted the lab-leak theory of the origins of COVID-19 lacked scientific evidence, the Lancet scientific journal has published an ""alternative view"" from 16 scientists who say there is no direct evidence in support of the natural origins theory and both hypotheses remain plausible.

In this new letter, an international team of health experts called for ""objective, open, and transparent scientific debate about the origin of SARS-CoV-2.""

""As scientists, we need to evaluate all hypotheses on a rational basis, and to weigh their likelihood based on facts and evidence, devoid of speculation concerning possible political impacts,"" the authors wrote.

The authors directly challenged the assertions of two letters previously published by the Lancet in which multiple prominent public health scientists said there was no credible evidence supporting the lab-leak theory and that the most likely explanation for the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic was the virus leaping from an animal host to human beings.

The first Lancet letter, published in February 2020, was signed by 27 scientists and ""strongly condemned conspiracy theories"" that the coronavirus had originated in a Wuhan lab.

""The statement has imparted a silencing effect on the wider scientific debate, including among science journalists,"" the authors of the new letter wrote.

Indeed, last year social media companies took action to deplatform claims that COVID-19 did not have natural origins, asserting that such claims were ""misinformation"" that contradicted the ""science."" The justification for this censorship was based largely on the opinions of the scientists who signed the first Lancet letter.



Emails obtained by U.S. Right to Know revealed that the February 2020 Lancet statement was organized by Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit group that received federal funding to research bat coronaviruses in partnership with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. That research included gain-of-function experiments, which genetically manipulate viruses to make them more transmissible among mammals, and particularly among humans.

At the time, Daszak did not disclose his close association with the WIV or his potential conflict of interest.

In July 2021, the Lancet published a second letter from 24 of the authors of the first letter in which they doubled-down on their assertion that the lab-leak theory was not supported by scientific evidence.

""In fact, this argument could literally be reversed,"" the authors of the new letter wrote. ""As will be shown below, there is no direct support for the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2, and a laboratory-related accident is plausible.""

The new letter poked holes in the claims made by scientists who support the natural origins hypothesis and showed how the assumptions of scientists who dismissed the lab-leak hypothesis were erroneous.

""Based on these indirect and questionable arguments, the authors conclude in favour of a natural proximal origin,"" the authors wrote.

""Although considerable evidence supports the natural origins of other outbreaks (eg, Nipah, MERS, and the 2002–04 SARS outbreak) direct evidence for a natural origin for SARS-CoV-2 is missing,"" they said, pointing out that the search for an animal host that transmitted COVID-19 to humans has turned up nothing.

The authors went on to show how evidence suggests ""a research-related origin is plausible.""

""A research-related contamination could result from contact with a natural virus during field collection, transportation from the field to a laboratory, characterisation of bats and bat viruses in a laboratory, or from a non-natural virus modified in a laboratory,"" the letter stated.

The authors also noted there are ""well-documented cases of pathogen escapes from laboratories.""

In conclusion, the authors stated that both the natural origins and lab-leak hypotheses remain plausible, and that is why scientists must be free to debate both ideas without being labeled conspiracy theorists.

""An evidence-based, independent, and prejudice-free evaluation will require an international consultation of high-level experts with no conflicts of interest, from various disciplines and countries; the mandate will be to establish the different scenarios, and the associated hypotheses, and then to propose protocols, methods, and required data in order to elucidate the question of SARS-CoV-2's origin,"" the authors wrote.



""As shown above, research-related hypotheses are not misinformation and conjecture,"" they stated. ""More importantly, science embraces alternative hypotheses, contradictory arguments, verification, refutability, and controversy. Departing from this principle risks establishing dogmas, abandoning the essence of science, and, even worse, paving the way for conspiracy theories. Instead, the scientific community should bring this debate to a place where it belongs: the columns of scientific journals.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/labor-secretary-cannot-name-single-inflation-solution,2021-09-22
Lancet COVID-19 Commission disbands over ties to EcoHealth Alliance,"An independent commission affiliated with the Lancet scientific journal formed last year to investigate the origins of COVID-19 has been disbanded over concerns about its link to EcoHealth Alliance, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Peter Daszak, the president of EcoHealth Alliance, was formerly the head of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission before recusing himself in June after failing to fully disclose his long-term relationship with researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. EcoHealth Alliance has faced scrutiny from lawmakers, scientists, and investigators for providing the WIV with grant money from the National Institutes of Health to study bat coronaviruses in the months and years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Those who hypothesize that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in a laboratory question whether gain-of-function experiments conducted at the Wuhan lab played a role in the beginning of the pandemic. Given EcoHealth Alliance's support for such research, there was a clear conflict of interest in having Daszak lead an investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lancet COVID-19 Commission Chairman Dr. Jeffrey Sachs, an economics professor at Columbia University, said he disbanded the commission because ""I just didn't want a task force that was so clearly involved with one of the main issues of this whole search for the origins, which was EcoHealth Alliance.""

According to Sachs, the scientists involved with the commission's work will continue to study the origins of the virus for a report that will be published in mid-2022. Their work will be broadened to include ""input from other experts on biosafety concerns including government oversight and transparency regarding risky laboratory research,"" the Journal reported.

Sachs explained that labs around the world have the technology to perform gain-of-function experiments — which genetically alter viruses to become more transmissible among mammals, and particularly among humans — but said international regulations and standards for this risky research is lagging behind the science.

""A lot is going on around the world that is not properly scrutinized or explained to the public,"" Sachs said.

There is no definitive explanation for the origins of COVID-19. There is evidence both for and against the theories that the virus has a natural origin, as well as the possibility of a research-related origin. Nevertheless, Daszak and five other members of the Lancet COVID-19 Commission denounced the lab-leak hypothesis as a conspiracy theory and were vocal supporters of the natural origins theory as the only scientifically plausible beginning for COVID-19, though there was not sufficient scientific evidence to advance this claim.

World Health Organization-led investigations into COVID-19's origins have been stonewalled by China, and a U.S. intelligence report on the origins of the virus presented by President Joe Biden in August was inconclusive because of a lack of data from China.

The Journal reported that in the coming months a new national COVID-19 commission will be formed to investigate the origins of the virus, led by Philip Zelikow, a professor of history at the University of Virginia and the former executive director of the 9/11 Commission. The commission will reportedly form a task force ""that will include experts in emerging disease epidemics and scientists with experience in and concerns about high-risk laboratory research.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lady-antebellum-change-name-slavery,2021-09-27
Massachusetts woman gets 2 life sentences for stabbing her 2 children to death in a 'voodoo ritual',"A Massachusetts woman was given two life sentences for stabbing her two children to death in what she said was a ""voodoo ritual.""

Latarsha Sanders stabbed to death Edson Brito, her 8-year-old son, and La'Son Brito, her 5-year-old son, in February 2018 and then mopped up the floor, placed them in their beds, and covered them with bedsheets.

She later asked her neighbor to call for an ambulance — but not for them, for herself. That neighbor, who was a first responder, discovered the gruesome scene and called the police.

Investigators interviewed Sanders, who told them conflicting stories but eventually admitted that she had killed the boys as a part of a ritual and said she had stabbed them each 50 times. An autopsy found that one had been stabbed 80 times and the other had been stabbed 20 times.

Police found the kitchen knife she used to stab the children in her sink.

Sanders' family said she had a history of talking about rituals and conspiracy theories involving the Illuminati, numerology, and sacrifices.

Sanders, who is now 48 years old, was sentenced to two life sentences for the murders by Plymouth Superior Court Judge William Sullivan. She was also sentenced to 9-10 years for one count of witness intimidation.

""The pain of the father, the sisters, the brothers, the aunts, uncles, grandmother of La’Son and Marlon, that pain falls on their hearts every day, and that’s a life sentence for them,"" said Sullivan in court.

While the woman's husband was in support of the sentencing, her family members said they fully supported her because they recognized that she was insane at the time of the murders.

Sanders has the right to appeal the sentences.

"Law professor wants to edit Bill of Rights to enact restrictions on free speech, make Second Amendment about 'bodily autonomy'","A law professor proposed Monday that two major edits must be made to the United States Constitution in order to place new restrictions on the First Amendment and Second Amendment.

Mary Anne Franks — a law professor at the University of Miami Law School — published an essay in the Boston Globe advocating that both amendments be edited to promote the collective good, arguing that each is too individualistic in its current form.

""The First and Second Amendments tend to be interpreted in aggressively individualistic ways that ignore the reality of conflict among competing rights,"" Franks wrote.

""This in turn allows the most powerful members of society to reap the benefits of these constitutional rights at the expense of vulnerable groups,"" she added. ""Both amendments would be improved by explicitly situating individual rights within the framework of 'domestic tranquility' and the 'general welfare' set out in the Constitution’s preamble.""

What about the First Amendment?

Franks proposed the First Amendment be edited to make explicit that freedoms of expression that harm equality should be met with accountability.

She proposed the First Amendment should say:

""Every person has the right to freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and petition of the government for redress of grievances, consistent with the rights of others to do the same and subject to responsibility for abuses. All conflicts of such rights shall be resolved in accordance with the principle of equality and dignity of all persons.""

""Both the freedom of religion and the freedom from religion shall be respected by the government. The government may not single out any religion for interference or endorsement, nor may it force any person to accept or adhere to any religious belief or practice.""

What about the Second Amendment?

Franks advanced the same charge that gun control advocates routinely levy at the Second Amendment: That it is ""idiosyncratic and anachronistic.""

According to Franks, the Constitution should not conflate self-defense with ""the right to use a weapon."" Rather, it should promote the ""right to bodily autonomy,"" language that pro-abortion advocates use.

In fact, Franks wants to rewrite the Second Amendment to protect reproductive health. She proposed:

""All people have the right to bodily autonomy consistent with the right of other people to the same, including the right to defend themselves against unlawful force and the right of self-determination in reproductive matters. The government shall take reasonable measures to protect the health and safety of the public as a whole.""

Is this realistic?

Despite her artful interpretation of what the law should be, Franks' proposals are unlikely to ever become the rule of law.

The framers of the Constitution instituted a process that makes amending the Constitution exceptionally difficult. Not only is a proposed amendment required to receive two-thirds approval in both the House and the Senate, but it also requires three-fourths approval from all states. The last constitutional amendment was ratified in 1992.

The other amendment process outlined in the Constitution is via a constitutional convention called by two-thirds of state legislatures. However, the Constitution has never been amended through this process.

Considering the gravity of the rights enumerated and protected in the First Amendment and Second Amendment, and given the considerable difficulty of amending the Constitution, Franks' ideas are unrealistic at best.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lancet-covid-commission-disbands-ecohealth-alliance-ties,2021-12-21
"Lawmaker requests special counsel investigation into Hunter Biden, 'potentially incriminating contents' of laptop","Could Hunter Biden be the subject of the next special counsel investigation? That's what Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) wants.

Buck sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr on Monday requesting that the Department of Justice initiate a special counsel investigation into the son of the media-declared president-elect, centering on Hunter Biden's ""conduct"" and the ""potentially incriminating contents"" on the laptop in the FBI's possession that purportedly belongs to Biden.

A special counsel investigation is critical for maintaining confidence in national security, Buck said.



""This investigation is critical to defending the integrity of our republic and ensuring a potential Biden Administration will not be the subject of undue foreign interference,"" Buck wrote. ""Americans have the right to know whether Mr. Biden's reported ties to foreign governments will make him the subject of blackmail attempts or other nefarious efforts to undermine U.S. national security or otherwise improperly influence American foreign policy.""

Buck went on to compare the necessity of a special counsel investigation now to when Robert Mueller was tasked with leading a special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

""As you know, the Attorney General is granted the statutory authority to appoint a Special Counsel under 28 U.S.C. § 515 and 28 CFR § 600 to investigate and prosecute any matter that would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances,"" Buck wrote.

""Similar to when the DOJ appointed Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III, it is critical that this investigation continue free from political interference, no matter who is in the White House. We must guarantee the integrity of our government and the security of our republic,"" the Colorado Republican added.

Barr has already appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the Russia investigation, as a special counsel, essentially preventing the incoming Biden administration from interfering in Durham's work.

What's the background?

The New York Post published a bombshell story in mid-October reporting that the paper had obtained the hard drive to a laptop that allegedly had belonged to Hunter Biden. The laptop, which had been dropped off at a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019 and never picked up, turned out to be in the possession of the FBI for unknown reasons.

The story was significant for many reasons. Most importantly, emails on the hard drive, purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden, showed that Joe Biden had been more involved in Hunter Biden's overseas work than the former vice president previously admitted.

Biden, however, has denied any wrongdoing.

Still, Democrats claimed the laptop story was ""Russian disinformation"" meant to sway the election in President Donald Trump's favor just weeks before the election. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe later refuted such allegations.

""Let me be clear, the intelligence community doesn't believe that, because there's no intelligence that supports that, and we have shared no intelligence with Chairman [Adam] Schiff or any other member of Congress that Hunter Biden's laptop is part of some Russian disinformation campaign — it's simply not true,"" Ratcliffe said in October.

Details about the laptop and why the FBI seized it remain murky. Fox News reported that investigators took the laptop in connection to a money-laundering investigation. Details about that investigation were not made public, nor has the FBI confirmed that such an investigation took place.

The most recent development in the story happened last month, when the computer repair shop owner closed his business and allegedly disappeared after receiving death threats.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/latarsha-sanders-voodoo-murder-sentence,2020-12-08
Lawyers for man at center of latest John Durham filing demand court scrub allegations from record: 'Taint the jury pool',"The Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer at the center of special counsel John Durham's latest court filing demanded late Monday that certain portions of that filing be scrubbed from the court record.

In a court motion, lawyers for Michael Sussmann claimed that Durham's filing is meant to ""politicize this case, inflame media coverage, and taint the jury pool.""



""Unfortunately, the Special Counsel has done more than simply file a document identifying potential conflicts of interest,"" Sussmann's attorneys argued. ""Rather, the Special Counsel has again made a filing in this case that unnecessarily includes prejudicial—and false—allegations that are irrelevant to his Motion and to the charged offense, and are plainly intended to politicize this case, inflame media coverage, and taint the jury pool.""

The attorneys further argued that Durham's filing used ""inflammatory and prejudicial rhetoric.""

Sussmann's legal team, therefore, demanded the court ""strike the Factual Background portion of the Special Counsel’s motion pursuant to the Court’s inherent power to ‘fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.'""

What is the background?

Sussmann was indicted last year after Durham's investigation, which focuses on the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, discovered that Sussmann lied to the FBI in September 2016 about a ""secret channel of communications between the Trump Organization and a Russian bank.""

The Clinton campaign seized on the allegations in the days leading up to the 2016 presidential election, claiming that Donald Trump used a secret server in Trump Tower to communicate with the Kremlin-linked Alfa Bank. Those allegations were proved false.

But a new filing by Durham alleged that lawyers connected to the Clinton campaign paid a technology company to access servers in Trump Tower to fabricate a ""narrative"" linking Trump to Russia, thereby substantiating allegations that Trump was colluding with Russia. The information was included in the ""factual background"" portion of the filing, which Sussmann's lawyers want scrubbed from the court record.

Durham alleges that Sussmann worked with a tech executive, a law firm retained on behalf of the Clinton campaign, and other cyber researchers to prepare information that he would later turn over to then-FBI General Counsel James Baker in September 2016.

When meeting with Baker, Sussmann allegedly said that he was not working on behalf of any particular client. However, Durham alleges that Sussmann billed the Clinton campaign for the meeting. Sussmann's lawyers deny that Sussmann met with the FBI on behalf of Clinton's campaign.

"Left-wing college students: President Trump is biggest threat to world peace — even bigger than leaders of Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China","A bunch of left-wing students attended the College Convention 2020 in New Hampshire last week — which featured numerous Democratic presidential candidates as speakers — and a reporter from The College Fix was there, too, and asked the students one question:

Among the following five world leaders — Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, Russian President Vladimir Putin, China's General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi Jinping, and U.S. President Donald Trump — which one is the ""greatest danger to world peace?""

Do you really need a magic 8-ball?

Dear readers, we're talking about progressive college students — young men and women who never met a communist or totalitarian leader they didn't like and would search for needles in endless haystacks for reasons to criticize Trump.

So, yeah, the Fix said the vast majority of interviewed students said their president is the biggest threat to world peace.

One student said Trump's ""erratic behavior"" and ""how unpredictable he is"" makes him a bigger danger than the other world leaders.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

A scraggly dude managed the following reply: ""I think having our president be Donald Trump, it is severely dangerous to our country and the world — peace.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Got it.



Another student said even though the American government employs checks and balances, ""we've all seen that [Trump] decides to do whatever he wants. I think Iran is terrifying, but I think that Trump really was the one who triggered [the present conflict with Iran]. I don't think we would be as afraid of Iran and North Korea if it wasn't [for] Trump who is breaking all these rules in the United States and taking scary political action.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

One student acknowledged that he believes Trump is the biggest threat, but he appeared to blame the power of the office, as he said his answer would have been former President Barack Obama or former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had she been elected.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

""Trump,"" another student said without hesitation. ""I just hate him. I think he's irrational. I think he makes decisions that put us in a dangerous position, like what we're in right now with Iran, like we have no idea what's about to happen. He's definitely a threat to the world.""

Bloodthirsty left-wing Twitter mob attacks Asian immigrant author,"Amélie Wen Zhao was off and running.

Raised in Beijing and now working in Manhattan's financial district, Tablet reported that Zhao scored an enviable young adult fiction book deal last year with an advance of at least $500,000. Her first novel in a planned trilogy — ""Blood Heir"" — was set for publication this June, the outlet said.

But not anymore.

Thanks to yet another ""pile-on"" by a posse within the bloodthirsty Twitter mob — this particular gang accused the author of anti-black racism in her novel, Tablet said — Zhao fell on her sword and announced Wednesday in an all-too-familiar-sounding apology to the digital pitchfork crowd that she was killing her own book.

How did this happen?



The outlet said a ""whisper campaign"" was launched against Zhao, courtesy of a white female ""YA reviewer with just 800 or so Twitter followers"" who tweeted, ""I have nothing to lose by it and have the time, I'll tell you which 2019 debut author, according to the whisper network, has been gathering screenshots of people who don't/didn't like her book. Amelie Wen Zhao.""

This rumor-spreader — who ""claimed confidential sources let me know privately"" about Zhao's alleged screenshot gathering — added that ""POC [people of color]"" made the claims, Tablet reported.

""If a confused friend ever asks you to sum up the culture of YA Twitter in one sentence, 'Imagine a white woman explaining that she is spreading unverifiable rumors about a first-time author of color in order to protect people of color' will do nicely,"" the outlet quipped.

More from Tablet:



I mentioned the whisper campaign on Twitter without naming names, thinking it might fizzle out, and then forgot about it. But by the time I again dipped a toe into YA Twitter a few days later, on Tuesday night, things had exploded: YA Twitter was attacking Zhao's still unpublished Blood Heir on multiple fronts. As usual, the standards of argument appeared rather strange and lacking, at least to an outsider. L.L. McKinney, a YA author who recently published her own debut novel, highlighted for her 10,000-plus Twitter followers the fact that one of Blood Heir's blurbs read, in part, ""In a world where the princess is the monster, oppression is blind to skin color, and good and evil exists in shades of gray…."" ""….someone explain this to me. EXPLAIN IT RIGHT THE FUQ NOW,"" she tweeted. ""I don't give a good god damn that this is an author of color,"" she said later in the tweetstorm. ""Internalized racism and anti-blackness is a thing and I…no."" The argument, such as it is, appears to be that because in our world, oppression isn't blind to skin color, to write about a fantasy world in which it is is an act of ""anti-blackness."" (McKinney didn't respond to a request for comment submitted via her agent.)



But perhaps the most damaging, drawn-out broadside came from Ellen Oh, an established YA writer who is herself of Asian descent, and who co-founded We Need Diverse Books. Oh published an extended tweetstorm to her 11,000-plus Twitter followers in which she noted that ""colorblindness is extremely tone deaf."" Then she proceeded to address Zhao without mentioning her by name. ""Now I'm going to talk directly to Asian writers,"" she wrote, particularly ""Asian writers who did not grow up in western countries"" like Zhao. ""Your lack of awareness may not be your fault given your lack of cultural context, but it IS your fault if you do not educate yourself when it is expressly brought up to you."" The admonishment continued, ""And if you have the luxury of getting this important criticism before your book is actually published, it is YOUR responsibility to make it right. Do right by the audience that your book will be reading. Do right by the kids who will be reading your book.""



While the colorblindness accusation was part of the campaign against Zhao, the most potent claims of anti-black racism stemmed from a rumor that swept through the community based on the advanced copies of Blood Heir that had already been released. It was alleged that the novel contains scenes involving chattel slavery, or something like it, including one in which a black character named May sings to the protagonist Ana immediately before dying. The assumption that May is black fueled a lot of anger—the criticism seemed to be that Zhao was positioning a black character as disposable, as a plot device.

Jesse Singal, the author of the Tablet piece, said he emailed Oh — ""the YA writer whose tweets to Zhao as a fellow author of Asian descent had castigated her for her lack of awareness and cultural context"" — for further comment. Singal noted that while Oh offered a civil response, it ""didn't really contain any new or compelling evidence 'Blood Heir' can be fairly called a racist book.""

'I am so sorry for the pain this has caused'

The outlet noted that after about a week, Zhao caved to the Twitter mob. Here's her apologetic statement:

Singal's reaction to Zhao's apology is a breath of fresh air. He charges that the YA fiction posse in the Twitter mob are ""celebrating their role as the righteous disciplinarians who, by revealing the text's coded racism, compelled Zhao to unpublish her book and seek forgiveness.""

""This episode is yet further evidence of two conflicting truths about contemporary online outrage dynamics: It demonstrates both that corporations should, as a general rule, simply ignore angry people online, in part because they are rarely a representative sampling of consumers or operating from a good-faith place of full context, and that online mobs trafficking in misinformation and outrage can have significant real-world effects,"" he added.

Others responding to Zhao's apology and decision to kill her own book went further.

""Kiera Drake did the same thing you are doing and her career is over,"" one commenter observed. ""You will never make the mob happy. You should have gone ahead and published it. We need books about human trafficking now. There are currently 30 million people in slavery today, 6 million are children.""

""So....we're essentially now burning books before they are even written?"" another commenter said. ""Sad. Publish what you want. An immigrant from a non-free speech country essentially being shamed out of free speech. Terrible on so many levels.""

""She was coerced by a mob,"" another said. ""Don't minimize the smears she endured and act like she made a dispassionate decision. This [is] a textbook case of bullying.""

""Imo, publish your book immediately and on schedule,"" another commenter offered. ""Literature is supposed to push boundaries and reveal truths through often shocking and realistic scenes and dialogue, not censor itself for overally sensitive infants. To me, it sounds like you were doing just what was needed.""

""Important note: Never indulge the mob,"" yet another said. ""Not only will being this nice not help you against them (nice words now won't stop them in the future), its consequences will be rained down on the next person tenfold.""

Leftist college students protest black speaker for MLK event since he's with 'largest defense contractor in the world' — and MLK was 'anti-war',"Leftist students at Kennesaw State University protested a black speaker for the Georgia school's Martin Luther King Jr. Week Legacy Luncheon because Roderick McLean is vice president of defense contractor Lockheed Martin Marietta — and King was ""anti-war,"" the students said.

What are the details?

Marisol Mendez, president of Students for Justice in Palestine at KSU, told the school newspaper, The Sentinel, that inviting McLean to speak at the Jan. 16 event sullied King's legacy of non-violence.

""Inviting someone who represents the military-industrial complex to a celebration that honored MLK's legacy was disrespectful,"" Mendez added to the paper. ""MLK was anti-war and anti-imperialist, and this action shows that KSU does not truly respect MLK, the marginalized groups on our campus, or our voices.""

A KSUnited statement regarding the decision to invite McLean said, ""Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, which manufactures military equipment such as missile defense systems and F-35 fighter jets. This same military equipment is then used to rain bombs down on helpless people caught in war in their country of birth.""

It added that ""it may seem honorable for KSU to recognize McLean's achievements as a Black engineer who went to an HBCU, which represents Black success in an historically oppressive society. However, his standing as a keynote speaker at an MLK Legacy luncheon also represents KSU's direct support of war, which opposes Dr. King's message of non-violence ... MLK was an anti-racist, anti-capitalist, and anti-war revolutionary, and to pick and choose aspects of his philosophies is a common tactic used by elitists to water down Dr. King's legacy to fit their own interests.""

The statement included a list of demands for future MLK Jr. weeks, including returning full control of the week to students from marginalized communities, making the luncheon open to the general public, and creating an anti-racist education center at KSU, the Sentinel said.

The statement was signed by 13 groups, including Young Democratic Socialists of America at KSU and Students for Justice in Palestine at KSU.

What else did protesting students do?

KSUnited held a die-in demonstration outside the Convocation Center where the luncheon was held, the paper said, adding that students taped signs to their chests that read, ""3 percent of US military spending could end world hunger"" and ""Lockheed Martin supplied weapons for the conflicts in Yemen and Syria.""

President of KSUnited Alexa Vaca told the Sentinel that the demonstration was focused on political education and not counterprotesting.

""We did it before the luncheon and as people were walking in so that they could see a depiction of victims of war and the cost of war,"" Vaca said.



How did college officials react?

KSU said the luncheon was intended to honor King's legacy despite student disagreement.

"Leftists lash out at 'cowards' in RNC for threat to prohibit Republican candidates from participating in presidential, VP debates due to bias against GOP","After the Republican National Committee on Thursday threatened the Commission on Presidential Debates that it would ""prohibit future GOP nominees from participating in future CPD-sponsored debates"" over what the RNC sees as unfairness and bias against Republicans, leftists predictably lashed out.

Who said what?

Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison tweeted that “Republicans can’t win a fair fight and they know it"":

Joy Behar — loyal leftist co-host of ""The View"" — asked in a tweet, ""Are they afraid that their candidates can’t keep up?""

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki — when asked for a reaction to the news — quipped that ""it's a question best posed to the RNC on what they’re so afraid of"":

Veteran Democratic politico Jon Cooper asked, ""Who agrees these Republican cowards FEAR THE TRUTH?""

Journalist David Leavitt concluded that GOP candidates ""don’t want to answer critical questions"":

New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen surmised that the GOP ""wants out"" of ""a common world of fact, about which candidates for president can be questioned"":

Columnist Tim O'Brien tweeted that the RNC's move is ""another example of Republicans’ antipathy toward public institutions and civic processes leading them to just…walk away. Doesn’t bode well for accountability or transparency"":

Comedian Titus attempted to summarize the RNC's stance like so: ""Alright guys, our candidates can’t form complete sentences, answer questions or think on their feet, so instead of finding good candidates, let’s refuse to let the morons speak, cool?""

Writer Molly Jong-Fast said the RNC's decision ""makes me think the GOP is doubling down on its anti-democratic instincts"":

Nick Knudsen, executive director of nonprofit DemCast, echoed Jong-Fast's sentiments: ""The GOP is fully withdrawing from democracy"":

Anything else?

RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted in regard to her letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates said that ""for years"" the organization that's supposed to be nonpartisan ""has shown bias against Republicans. Since they continue to stonewall commonsense reforms, the RNC is leveling the playing field to make debates fair for future nominees.""

Among the reforms the RNC wants:

term limits on the CPD's board of directors;

hold at least one debate prior to the start of early voting;

create a code of conduct for CPD officials prohibiting them from making public statements about candidates or taking part in political activities with candidates;

establish criteria for disqualifying debate moderators with conflict of interest regarding candidates; and

establish a code of conduct for debate moderators in regard to what extent they will interact with nominees.

In the 2020 debates between then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden and then-President Donald Trump, it would seem that the moderators made more headlines than they should have.

In the first debate, moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News asked Trump to condemn ""white supremacists and right-wing militia"" even though Trump had done so repeatedly and even vowed the week before to designate the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist organization. However, Wallace didn't ask Biden to condemn Antifa — and Biden, in fact, actually claimed during the debate that the violent leftist group is ""an idea, not an organization."" Interestingly, Wallace announced last month his departure from Fox News to join CNN.

The CPD tapped Steve Scully — then-political editor for C-SPAN — to moderate the second Trump-Biden debate, but it was soon reported that Scully had served as an intern for then-Sen. Joe Biden in college and later worked on the late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy's staff. What's more, C-SPAN suspended Scully after he admitted he lied about his Twitter feed being hacked in regard to a question he posted to former Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci after Trump accused Scully of being a ""nevertrumper."" Soon the second debate was canceled after Trump complained about the format being changed to a virtual event due to the coronavirus pandemic.

And despite a report that the third debate moderator, Kristen Welker — chief White House correspondent for NBC News — has deep ties to the Democratic Party, she won high praise from both sides of the aisle for her job moderating the third debate.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/left-wing-twitter-mob-attacks-asian-author,2022-01-14
Lesbian Episcopal priest — who calls abortion a 'blessing' and abortionists 'modern-day saints' — named head of National Abortion Federation,"Rev. Katherine Ragsdale — an openly gay Episcopal priest — was named president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, the organization announced last week. She's served as interim president and CEO since September 2018, the NAF said.

In 2011, Ragsdale — then dean and president of the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts — married the Rev. Mally Lloyd, Canon to the Ordinary in the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, in St. Paul's Cathedral in Boston.

More from the NAF on Ragsdale:

Ragsdale is an Episcopal priest who has been outspoken about abortion rights, LGBTQ equality, and public policy issues affecting women and families throughout her career. She has testified before the U.S. Congress as well as numerous state legislatures about the importance of abortion access and was a featured speaker at the 2004 March for Women's Lives in Washington, D.C. Prior to joining NAF, she served for 17 years (9 of them as chair) on the national board of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. Rev. Ragsdale has preached about how abortion is a blessing and has been active in clinic defense work and other activities to support abortion providers for more than 35 years.

“Abortion providers are some of my personal heroes and modern-day saints,"" Ragsdale said as part of the NAF's Oct. 31 announcement. ""It is an honor to be able to serve and support NAF members as they provide compassionate health care amid increasing attacks and challenges.""

'Abortion is a blessing'

""Throughout my career, I have preached that abortion is a blessing,"" she was quoted as saying as part of the NAF's announcement of her interim president status last year.

Ragsdale — also known as the ""High Priestess of Abortion"" — in 2015 announced she was stepping down as dean and president of Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after what RealClearReligion called a ""stormy tenure, conflicts with faculty, and larger debates over the future of theological education."" She was the second-ever female head of the school and the first lesbian to lead an Episcopal seminary, the outlet said.

Lindsey Graham and Elon Musk feud over Ukraine and electric car subsidies,"Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk engaged in a Twitter feud over the war in Ukraine and electric car subsidies.

Graham lashed out at Musk over his suggestion to resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine, currently in its seventh month, in a tweet posted on Tuesday.

Musk suggested that the region of Crimea be given to Russia while other annexed regions undergo another election under the supervision of the United Nations. He put it to a non-scientific vote on Twitter, where it lost 59.1% to 40.9% with more than 2.7 million votes.

""This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then,"" he said in a second tweet. ""Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war.""

Many criticized Musk's suggestion as far too deferential to Russia, with Graham repudiating it forcefully.

""My concern with his Russian 'peace' proposal is he is legitimizing one of the greatest crimes of the 21st century by Putin,"" tweeted Graham after first praising Musk.

""Russia must adhere to the boundaries they agreed to in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum where Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons force — the third largest in the world — in return for assurances their territorial integrity would be protected,"" he continued.

""To do otherwise is an insult to Ukraine and will set in motion even more chaos throughout the world,"" he concluded.

In a second Twitter thread about Ukraine and Musk, Graham added a threat to review electric car subsidies that benefited Tesla.

""While we’re at it, maybe the Congress should revisit the electric vehicle tax credit boondoggle. It is where the credit is now solely benefiting electric vehicle manufacturers who have increased prices equal to the tax credit!"" he tweeted. ""It could be a good way to help save money by applying those funds to assisting Ukrainians in defending their homeland!""

That apparently caught Musk's attention because he responded to the threat.

""First of all, Tesla hasn’t had that consumer tax credit for years & we didn’t ask for this one – GM & Ford did,"" he replied.

Ukrainian president Zelenskyy replied to Musk with his own Twitter poll implying that the plan was abandoning the cause of Ukraine.

Musk is in a legal battle with Twitter over his bid to purchase the popular social media platform.

"Lindsey Graham promises Senate will investigate Ukraine whistleblower, the Bidens, FISA abuse","Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Sunday that the Senate will investigate the Ukraine whistleblower, the Bidens, and FISA warrant abuse following the conclusion of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial.

The whistleblower

Speaking with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Graham said the whistleblower should testify before Congress because he wants ""to understand how all this crap started.""

""The Senate Intel Committee under Richard Burr has told us that we will call the whistleblower,"" Graham said. ""Why is it important? ... If the whistleblower is a former employee, associate of Joe Biden, I think that would be important. If the whistleblower was working with people on [Rep. Adam] Schiff's staff that wanted to take Trump down a year-and-a-half ago, I think that would be important. If the Schiff staff people helped write the complaint, that would be important.

""We're going to get to the bottom of all of this to make sure this never happens again,"" Graham vowed.



The Bidens

Graham said, ""I'm going to bring in State Department officials and ask them, why didn't you do something about the obvious conflict of interests Joe Biden had?""

""I can prove beyond any doubt that Joe Biden's effort in the Ukraine to root out corruption was undercut, because he let his son sit on the board of the most corrupt company in the Ukraine, and we're not going to give him a pass on that,"" Graham went on to say.

""Eventually, we will get to Hunter Biden. And I want to know why the Obama administration did nothing about this obvious conflict of interest,"" he continued. ""Joe Biden should have given up the Ukrainian portfolio, or Hunter Biden should be taken off the board, because they ruined America's ability to effectively deal with corruption in the Ukraine by having Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma. That's just a fact.

""We're going to get to the bottom of it,"" Graham vowed.

Graham explained the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would handle the Bidens.

FISA abuse

Graham said, ""When it comes to FISA, I'm going to call [Rod] Rosenstein, Sally Yates, [Andrew] McCabe and [James] Comey to find out how a warrant was issued against Carter Page on four different occasions without an adequate foundation and find out how the Department of Justice and the FBI became so out of balance when it came to Trump.""

Liz Cheney's husband and Hunter Biden's attorney are partners at the same firm,"The husband of Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and an attorney for Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden, are apparently partners at the same law firm, Latham & Watkins.

Cheney's husband, Philip Perry, has worked at the law firm since 2007. According to Perry's biography listed on the firm's website, he also worked as general counsel in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as well as the White House Office of Management and Budget during the George W. Bush administration, when Cheney's father, Dick Cheney, was vice president.

Perry specializes in law regarding biotechnology, federal government regulation, and homeland and national security, according to his biography.

Perry's fellow partner at Latham & Watkins, Chris Clark, has been representing Hunter Biden in some federal tax cases since December 2020. Clark ""represents Robert Hunter Biden in a Grand Jury investigation regarding tax issues,"" his biography reads.

Clark's other notable clients include Elon Musk and Mark Cuban, according to his biography.

Another partner of the firm has also been hired by the Biden administration. In January 2021, Nicholas McQuaid was appointed to lead the criminal division at the Department of Justice, despite stern objections from Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).

Liz Cheney has issued a statement denying any conflict of interest between her husband's work and Clark's association with the president's son.

""Latham & Watkins has 3000 lawyers and thousands of clients. Mr. Perry has no role at all in any matter involving Hunter Biden,” Cheney's spokesman said.

Latham & Watkins has long supported Democratic candidates, according to the New York Post, which referred to the firm as ""a Democratic powerhouse."" The firm as a whole donated $500,000 to Joe Biden's presidential campaign in 2020, and Clark donated nearly $4,000 to Biden himself.

Meanwhile, Liz Cheney's role as the sole representative from the state of Wyoming will soon come to an end. She was soundly defeated by Republican challenger Harriet Hageman in the state primary held on Tuesday.

LA City Council votes to create 'unarmed response' teams to answer 'nonviolent' 911 calls instead of cops,"The Los Angeles City Council voted 14-0 Wednesday to establish unarmed crisis response teams that would answer nonviolent 911 calls instead of police, KTTV-TV reported.

What are the details?

""Today marks a seminal moment in our City's history in our efforts to reimagine public safety,"" Council President Nury Martinez said in a press release, according to the station. ""Through this unarmed response pilot for non-violent calls, we will help Angelenos get the mental health and other support services they need from trained professionals. We will also free up police officers to do the work they are trained to do. Ultimately, this will also allow us to provide our Black and Brown communities with the resources they deserve.""

The vote comes in response to the ""defund the police"" movement sparked by George Floyd's death in May.

""Calling the police on George Floyd about an alleged counterfeit $20 bill ended his life,"" longtime Councilmember Herb J. Wesson, Jr. said, according to KTTV. ""If George Floyd had been met with unarmed, trained specialists for the nonviolent crime he was accused of, he would be turning 47 years old today. This plan will save lives, and I'm so proud of my colleagues on the Council for voting to move this forward.""

What kinds of calls would the response team answer?

The station, citing the press release, said the kinds of calls the unarmed response team would answer include mental health, substance abuse, suicide threats, behavioral distress, conflict resolution, and welfare checks.

Anything else?

Sgt. Jeretta Sandoz of the Los Angeles Police Protective League told KTTV that she's skeptical of the idea, since it's based on a program in Eugene, Oregon — and Eugene is not Los Angeles.

Sandoz told the station that the Eugene program ""serves a population of under 250,000, and that includes 83 percent white and almost all English-speaking.""

KTTV also said it isn't clear how much the unarmed response teams program would cost or who would be in charge.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lindsey-graham-promises-senate-will-investigate-ukraine-whistleblower-the-bidens-fisa-abuse,2020-10-16
Louisville photographer supportive of Black Lives Matter killed by activist who shot into protest camp,"A photographer who was sympathetic to Black Lives Matter and who had been documenting protests in Louisville, Kentucky, was shot and killed in a protest camp Saturday night when one protester fired into the camp, allegedly due to a conflict with another protester, the Courier Journal reported.

Tyler Gerth, 27, was reportedly shot in the face as an innocent bystander when Steven Nelson Lopez showed up at the protest camp and fired his gun into the air before shooting into the camp. Other armed bystanders returned fire at Lopez, shooting him in the leg and preventing further potential casualties.

Lopez had been a participant in the Louisville protests for at least the previous 12 days, having been sighted there multiple times by protesters and reporters. He has been charged with murder and first-degree wanton endangerment.

Other protesters said Lopez had been escorted away from the camp multiple times leading up to the Saturday night shooting after getting into altercations. Lopez had previously been arrested on June 17 for inciting a riot and disorderly conduct. He was armed with two fully loaded handguns at the time of his previous arrest.

A witness recorded video of Lopez shooting into the crowd on Saturday.

Gerth was a photographer who regularly posted pictures of Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of Breonna Taylor's death at the hands of Louisville Metro Police. He was apparently not the target of Lopez's attack on the protest camp.



""Tyler was incredibly kind, tender-hearted and generous, holding deep convictions and faith,"" Gerth's family wrote in a statement. ""It was this sense of justice that drove Tyler to be part of the peaceful demonstrations advocating for the destruction of the systemic racism within our society's systems. This, combined with his passion of photography led to a strong need within him to be there, documenting the movement, capturing and communicating the messages of peace and justice.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liz-cheney-s-husband-partner-in-firm-defending-hunter-biden,2020-06-30
"Russia's second-largest oil company breaks with Putin, calls for end to war as stock price craters. Now, its website is down.","Russian oil giant Lukoil, the country's second-largest oil producer, shocked onlookers by publicly breaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, calling for an end to the ongoing invasion in Ukraine.

What are the details?

In a statement to shareholders Thursday, the massive company — which produces more than 2% of the world's oil and employs more than 100,000 workers — called for a ""fast resolution"" to the war.

""We stand for the immediate cessation of the armed conflict and duly support its resolution through the negotiation process and through diplomatic means,"" Lukoil's board of directors said in the statement posted on its website, the New York Times reported.

""We express our sincere empathy for all victims, who are affected by this tragedy. We strongly support a lasting ceasefire and a settlement of problems through serious negotiations and diplomacy,"" the board added, according to CNN.

As of Friday afternoon, the statement could not be viewed because Lukoil's website was down.

Why does it matter?

The Times noted that Lukoil likely issued the statement to protect its extensive operations abroad, which include some 200 gas stations in the U.S., predominantly in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

Lukoil's market value collapsed by 99% on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday as Moscow's market remained closed for a third straight day. The firm was reportedly selling as a penny stock.

MarketWatch reported that the collapse of Moscow-based energy giants such as Lukoil and natural-gas giant Gazprom came even as U.S. and European sanctions specifically exempted the Russian energy sector.

""But traders have taken matters into their own hands, with very little demand for Russian-sourced oil,"" the outlet said.

Consumers reportedly boycotted the company's gas stations in the northeastern U.S. this week. Lawmakers in Newark went further by voting to suspend Lukoil licenses in the city.

What else?

However, even if the oil producer's motivations were to protect its assets, its statement reflects a wider movement as a growing number of Russia's business class members continue to distance themselves from the country's warmongering president.

At the very least, ""It says they realize it’s going to be difficult for them to engage in international commerce, let alone retail sales in the U.S.,"" Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, told the Times.

""I’d call a Russian brand for gasoline the 21st-century equivalent of the scarlet letter,"" he added.

According to Reuters, Lukoil's chairman and CEO, Vagit Alekperov, is one of Russia's richest men. Alekperov, a former Caspian Sea oil rig worker, and his deputy, Leonid Fedun, reportedly own a majority of the firm's shares.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/los-angeles-unarmed-response-teams,2022-03-04
Macron and Putin agree that a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis is needed after a weekend phone call,"During a Sunday phone call, French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed for the need to find a diplomatic solution to the ongoing crisis on Ukraine’s border.

Reuters reported that the French and Russian foreign ministers will meet in the coming days to hold diplomatic talks and seek to hold a summit where Russia, Ukraine, and NATO allies establish a new European security order.

A statement from Macron’s office said that the two presidents discussed “the need to prioritize a diplomatic solution to the current crisis” and that “if conditions are met,” a diplomatic path will allow for the establishment of this new security order the New York Times reported.

The Kremlin, however, appears not to believe that Western leaders are seeking a diplomatic resolution. Shortly after Putin’s conversation with Macron, the Kremlin said that leaders of Western nations were pushing the Ukrainian government to pursue a “military solution” to the ongoing conflict.

Earlier this month, ABC News reported that the Kremlin wants guarantees from Western nations and NATO allies that Ukraine and other formerly Soviet nations will not join defense alliances that purposefully exclude Russia.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government insisted that it does not plan to launch an offensive against the Russian-backed separatists in its eastern region despite Russian insistence to the contrary.

The French and Russian presidents agreed to resume diplomatic talks within the Normandy Format. The Normandy Format is a negotiating channel created a little less than a decade ago by France, Germany, Ukraine, and Russia to resolve a similar conflict when Russia attempted to annex Crimea in 2014.

The defense minister of the Russian-allied and Ukraine-bordering nation of Belarus announced that Russia’s military deployment in Belarus would be extended as the two nations continue their joint military exercises along the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.

Despite Russia’s insistence that it has no intention of pursuing an armed conflict, American leadership remains unconvinced. The United States continues to insist that it has intelligence indicating an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine.

And, despite the increasingly menacing presence of Russian troops along Ukraine’s borders, Ukrainian national security officials believe that Russia is unlikely to pursue conventional means of warfare.

Oleksiy Danilov, President Zelenskyy’s top national security adviser, believes that Russia is most likely to pursue a series of intense cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns while increasing economic pressure to foster social discontent within Ukraine.

Amidst the chaos, Zelenskyy seeks to meet with Putin so that the two might reach a diplomatic solution between themselves.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/louisville-photographer-supportive-of-black-lives-matter-killed-by-activist-who-shot-into-protest-camp,2022-02-20
Major US Christian denomination declares Israel an apartheid state,"One of the largest mainline protestant denominations in the U.S. has voted to declare Israel an apartheid state, becoming the first major American Christian denomination to do so.

The governing body of the Presbyterian Church USA on Friday passed a resolution that said the laws, policies, and practices of the Israeli government toward Arabs living in the region known as Palestine ""fulfill the international legal definition of apartheid.""

Delegates to the church's biannual General Assembly, which took place in Louisville, Kentucky, and online, voted 266-116 to adopt the resolution. The church government — which oversees 1.19 million members — also voted to designate a Nakba Remembrance Day on its calendar — the Palestinian commemoration of Israeli independence in 1948, which Palestinians regard as the destruction of Palestinian society.

The resolution accuses Israel of ""establishing two sets of laws, one for Israelis and one for Palestinians, which give preferential treatment to Israeli Jews and oppressive treatment to Palestinians."" It also repeats accusations that Israel expropriated Palestinian land for Jewish-only settlements and that the country has forced Palestinians into ""separate reserves and ghettos.""



Palestinian activists celebrated the vote. ""This is an excellent stand by the US Presbyterian Church declaring Israel Apartheid State,"" said Atef Dalgamouni, one of the ""founding fathers"" of the Al Jazeera news network.

But some Christian and Jewish leaders condemned the General Assembly's declaration. Rabbi Eric J. Greenberg, director of United Nations Relations and Strategic Partnerships for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said the resolution was ""an insult to Jews and Christians alike which damages interfaith relations.""

""PCUSA leadership has violated G-d's commandment not to bear false witness, rendered itself irrelevant in the world of peacemaking, and made a mockery of honest dialogue and interfaith relations,"" Greenberg said after the vote, according to CBN News.

Jonathan Greenblatt, president of the Anti-Defamation League, also criticized the resolution.

""This resolution does not seek to heal or resolve, but rather deepens divides between people of different faiths and hinders the peace process,"" Greenblatt said. ""We encourage the #PCUSA to use its influence in a way that constructively contributes towards a peaceful future for all.""

The American Jewish Congress before the vote had urged the PCUSA's General Assembly to reject the resolution.

Church leaders defended the resolution on Monday, remarking that the denomination strongly supports the right of Israel to exist while also supporting ""the right of Palestine to be an independent and sovereign state within the pre-1967 borders, the right of return to refugees or a negotiated compensation, the removal of all illegal Israel settlements in occupied Palestinian territories or a 1:1 swap of land, a shared Jerusalem, an end to Israel’s military occupation of Palestinian territories, either the total removal of the Separation Wall or the removal of those portions of the wall that are on Palestinian land, and equal rights for Palestinians who are citizens of Israel.""

""We are aware that this decision will affect some of our interfaith relations, especially with a portion of the American Jewish community. We want to say this loud and clear: We are committed to continuing dialogue with our interfaith partners and to combating antisemitism and all forms of violence, discrimination and human rights violations,"" Rev. Dr. J. Herbert Nelson II said in a letter explaining the church's position.

""To increase awareness of violence against people of other faiths in the United States, the 225th General Assembly has approved a Study Document Denouncing Antisemitism and Islamophobia. At the same time, we are convinced that there is a fundamental difference between antisemitism and the right to critique the policies of Israel deemed illegal under international law,"" Nelson wrote.

The Presbyterian Church of the United States in America is the largest Presbyterian denomination in the U.S. It holds a liberal position on church doctrine, supports gay marriage, and ordains women and practicing homosexual and transgender ministers. At its founding in 1983, the denomination boasted 3.1 million members, but it has since fallen to 1.2 million, a 62 percent loss.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/lukoil-calls-for-end-to-ukraine-war,2022-07-11
Man charged after drug-infused bachelor party turns deadly,"A young man from Alabama is now in custody after he allegedly brought cocaine laced with fentanyl to a bachelor party earlier this year, and one of his friends died as a result.

Back on May 14, several University of Alabama fraternity brothers, who had graduated together a few years ago, gathered in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, for a bachelor party. At some point during the party, some of the partygoers snorted cocaine and almost immediately went into medical distress.

When emergency medical teams arrived on the scene, they found Thomas Gleason, 26, unconscious on the floor. While they attempted to administer aid to Gleason, three other unidentified males ""collapsed and became unresponsive,"" a report from the Walton County Sheriff’s Office stated.

The three other affected attendees eventually survived the incident, but Gleason tragically passed away a few days later.

Bob Gleason recalled making the heartbreaking trip from Connecticut to Florida with his wife, Pam, after their son had been rushed to the hospital.

""By the time we got to Charlotte (for a layover), the doctor was like, ‘Do you want us to keep him alive?'"" Gleason said.

By the time they got to the hospital, Tom Gleason remained alive only because of a ventilator. Once it was switched off, he died within minutes.

Investigators determined that Gleason died from ""a lethal dose of fentanyl,"" which they say had been mixed in with the cocaine that he had snorted. Gleason's fraternity brother and fellow party attendee, John ""J. D."" Nabors, 26, of Mountain Brook, Alabama, was allegedly the person who brought the cocaine to the party and distributed it among his friends.

On November 15, a grand jury decided to indict Nabors on felony charges of distributing a controlled substance causing death. He turned himself in to the Walton County Jail last Wednesday. He has been released on $25,000 bond and is scheduled to appear again in court on January 17.

For his part, Bob Gleason does not believe that his son's death was just a tragic accident.

""It wasn’t like these guys went down the street and found a dealer,"" Bob Gleason told reporters. ""They trust [Nabors] because he was their fraternity brother. They got it from a trusted friend, and this is what happened.""

Bob Gleason alleged that Nabors either wittingly or unwittingly poisoned his friends with ""straight fentanyl.""

""When the toxicology came back, Tom wasn’t even drunk,"" Bob Gleason added elsewhere. ""He had his wits about him, and so did everybody else. But the fentanyl level was off the charts.""

Still, the Gleason family hopes that Tom's story may help spare others from a similar fate.

""It would surely be Tom's wish, that his passing serves as a lifelong mandate to all those that knew him, as well as all those that they in turn love; to never drink, eat or ingest anything whose origin cannot be identified,"" an obituary for Tom Gleason read in part.

The name of the groom whose bachelor party the friends were celebrating has not been given. He is not believed to be one of the men affected by fentanyl that evening. There are conflicting reports regarding whether the wedding was called off entirely after Gleason's death or whether it has just been postponed.

'Bizarre': Man knocks over mother's casket after trying to run over sister at funeral,"On August 6, police responded to a report of a large family fight at the Rolling Hills Memorial Park cemetery in Richmond, California. The family drama nearly produced a second corpse.

Sgt. Aaron Pomeroy told SFGate that the conflict was centered on bad blood between a brother and sister. When the two began feuding at the funeral, the sister's boyfriend reportedly tried to defuse the situation, at which point ""the brother began beating on the boyfriend.""

In the resulting fracas, which reportedly involved up to 20 family members, one individual allegedly struck the suspect, the deceased woman's son, with a cane. Richmond Police said that the suspect, a 37-year-old from Bay Point, subsequently got into his vehicle with the intent to run down his sister.

After driving over several headstones, the suspect is said to have then struck a 33-year-old woman — not his sister — with the vehicle. In the process, he allegedly knocked over his mother's casket, destroyed vases, damaged grass, and broke a water main, thereby flooding the funeral director's grandmother's plot.

His victim was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

The suspect was charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon and vandalism of a tomb. After having his wounds tended to, he was booked into the Richmond Police Department Jail.

The fight incurred approximately $20,000 in damage.

The manager of the cemetery, Kamilah Thompson, called it a ""bizarre incident"" and stressed to KNTV that the dead interred at Rolling Hills Memorial are ""safe.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/major-u-s-christian-denomination-declares-israel-an-apartheid-state,2022-08-11
Man stabbed to death in fight over Popeyes' popular chicken sandwich,"A man was stabbed to death at a Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen restaurant in Maryland in a fight that started because one person allegedly cut in front of another in line while trying to get the chain's popular chicken sandwich, NBC News reported.

The victim has not been identified, though he is reportedly 28 years old. And while the fight is known to have begun over cutting in line, it's not clear yet what role the victim played in the start of the conflict at the Oxon Hill location just outside Washington, D.C.

""For you to get that angry over anything — for that type of anger to develop into this type of violence, again is a very sad and tragic day,"" Prince George's Police Department spokeswoman Jennifer Donelan said.

A Popeyes statement left open the possibility that the conflict was unrelated to the chicken sandwich.

""We do not yet know whether this was the result of a dispute over one of our products or something unrelated, but there is no reason for someone to lose their life on a Monday night in a parking lot,"" a company representative told NBC News. ""Our thoughts are with the victim's family and friends and we are fully cooperating with local authorities.""

WTTG-TV reporter Evan Lambert, however, reported that two men were waiting in a line specifically dedicated to customers ordering the chicken sandwich. One man cut in front of another, resulting in the stabbing. The attacker has not been arrested.

The Popeyes chicken sandwich became a hot item in part due to viral hype from a friendly social media feud with Chick-fil-A. Locations all over the country were soon swarmed with customers daily until the sandwich was totally sold out in just two weeks, when the original stock was supposed to last for months.

So desperate were some people to obtain the sandwich that when Popeyes ran out, some customers threatened store employees and another even sued the company, NBC News reported. Last month, according to KTRK-TV, armed customers rushed a Houston location demanding sandwiches, and pulled their guns on employees when the store was out of stock.

Some locations are already selling out, setting up the possibility for more conflicts in the days and weeks to come.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-charged-after-drug-infused-bachelor-party-turns-deadly,2019-11-05
"Man convicted of mosque bombing blames right-wing blogs, says he's a transgender woman and calls for leniency based on gender dysphoria","An Illinois man who was convicted of bombing a mosque said that he was transitioning into a transgender woman and that right-wing blogs and his own gender dysphoria are to blame for his actions.

Michael Hari was convicted in December 2020 of orchestrating the 2017 attack at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minnesota. Hari was the leader of an anti-government militia group called the White Rabbits. Some of those militia members testified against Hari in court.

Hari, who goes by Emily Claire Hari, is facing life in prison over the bombing but his defense attorney asked the court for leniency based on Hari's inner turmoil about his gender identity.

""She strongly desired making a full transition but knew she would be ostracized from everyone and everything she knew,"" wrote attorney Shannon Elkins in court documents cited by the Star Tribune.

""Thus, as she formed a ragtag group of freedom fighters or militia men and spoke of missions to Cuba and Venezuela, Ms. Hari secretly looked up 'sex change,' 'transgender surgery,' and 'post-op transgender' on the Internet,"" Elkins explained. ""As she purchased military fatigues for their 'missions' she also purchased dresses and female clothing for a planned trip to Bangkok, Thailand for male-to-female surgery. She was living a double life.""

While no one was hurt in the bombing, the community was traumatized by the violence and Hari was convicted of using a destructive device in a crime of violence and damaging property because of its religious character, among other charges.

Hari, who continues to deny his guilt, blames right-wing blogs and news outlets for his radicalization against Muslims.

""This degrading, anti-Muslim, and Islamophobic rhetoric and misinformation has spread throughout the United States over the past several years through social media and the internet,"" Elkins wrote.

Elkins asked the court to deny the terrorism enhancement requested by federal prosecutors and instead sought a 30-year prison sentence, the mandatory minimum allowed for the charges.

Hari had been convicted previously for kidnapping his daughters in a custody dispute and taking them to Belize in Central America.

Hari will be sentenced on Sept. 13.

Man who slashed Baby Trump balloon: 'First time I’ve ever seen a liberal get mad about chopping up a baby',"The man who destroyed the Baby Trump balloon on display Saturday at a college football game in Alabama said he did it to take a stand in the political conflict between Democrats and Republicans — a battle which he said is really between good and evil, according to AL.com.

Hoyt Deau Hutchinson, who was charged with felony first degree criminal mischief for slashing the balloon with a material cutter, noted that the reaction from liberals to the destruction of the anti-Trump balloon was somewhat ironic.

""It comes a point when you gotta take a stand,"" Hutchinson, 32, said when he called in to the ""Rick & Bubba Show."" ""We don't have two parties anymore. We have good versus evil. When you got one party that says it's OK to kill babies and by the way, this is the first time I've ever seen a liberal get mad about chopping up a baby.""

The balloon was in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump's attendance at the college football game between Alabama and Louisiana State University. Hutchinson was angered when he drove by and saw the balloon.

He bought an Alabama T-shirt to blend in with the crowd, then approached the balloon as if he was interested in taking a picture with it — then sliced a large gash into the 20-foot balloon, which depicts President Trump as an infant holding a cellphone.

Hutchinson started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for his legal fees, and he had received more than $45,000 as of Wednesday morning. Any money beyond what he needs for the fees would go to the Trump re-election campaign, he said.

""I'm not young but I'm not old. I'm sort of middle-aged,"" Hutchinson said. ""I feel like a lot of people my age don't keep up with the news and politics the way they should. I watch the news every night. I watch Fox News every night. Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity are my favorite two anchors. I see this stuff going on out west and up north and all other places. I get so mad about people not taking a stand. The left wants to use religion against you like you shouldn't act like this and stuff, but I'll tell you this — the Devil knows the Bible as good as we do.""

Sen. Marco Rubio plans constitutional amendment involving SCOTUS. Here's everything you need to know.,"As Democrats face the reality that President Donald Trump may leave a generational impact on the Supreme Court, some Democratic leaders have publicly suggested reforming the high court to reduce presidential power in dictating the court's ideological makeup.

Now Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has a plan to stop Democrats in their tracks with a new constitutional amendment.

What are the details?

In an op-ed for Fox News, Rubio explained that for a ""divided nation [to] overcome corrosive tribalism,"" principled leaders must stop the intentional deterioration of fundamental American institutions like the Supreme Court.

""To this end, I am proposing a constitutional amendment to prevent the next political and cultural flashpoint: the packing of the Supreme Court for partisan gains,"" Rubio wrote.

Rubio said his amendment, with the sole purpose of preventing ""the delegitimizing"" of the court, will keep the number of seats on the high court at nine.

""There is nothing magical about the number nine. It is not inherently right just because the number of seats on the Supreme Court remains unchanged since 1869. But there is something inherently good and important about preventing the further destabilization of essential institutions,"" Rubio explained.

The Florida lawmaker went on to emphasize the importance of restoring public trust in bedrock American institutions, which Democrats are delegitimizing by exploiting rampant political tribalism.

""Our nation may not be on the brink of civil war or dissolution, but we are suffering a crisis of confidence and we cannot withstand further erosion of trust in one another and our institutions,"" Rubio said. ""The rhetoric used by some of my Democratic colleagues that suggests our institutions are increasingly unable to resolve modern society's conflicts is dangerous.""

""The perceived illegitimacy of institutions — from local election boards all the way up to the Supreme Court — threatens to undermine the very nature of our nation,"" he added. ""These institutions are the way Americans traditionally mediate disputes among a very diverse population. We must fight to maintain and restore them.""

Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.) plans to introduce a sister bill in the House.

What is court packing?

The idea of court packing is not new. In fact, former President Franklin Roosevelt (D) sought to reform the court. However, his efforts were in bad faith; he only sought reform to, as Rubio explained, ""appoint additional justices who would not stand in the way of his ambitious political agenda.""

Today, the same motive empowers Democrats. It gained steam in progressive circles in 2016 after Merrick Garland, former President Barack Obama's nominee to replace Antonin Scalia on the court, was not given a single hearing in the Senate. Then, after Trump successfully placed two conservative justices on the court — Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — court packing went mainstream in the Democratic Party.

So much so, in fact, that major candidates running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are now publicly advocating for court packing. As Rubio noted, Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) have sought to delegitimize the court after Trump's successful appointments. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has accused Republicans of ""stealing"" court seats and said ""all options are on the table"" once Democrats regain executive power, a vague reference to court packing.

Meanwhile, other Democratic presidential candidates like South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke have suggested placing five conservative justices and five progressive justices on the court, who then collectively choose another five justices, according to The Hill.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-who-bombed-mosque-blames-right-wing-blogs-says-he-s-a-transgender-woman-and-calls-for-leniency-based-on-body-dysmorphia,2019-03-20
"Rubio says leftists are 'blinded by hatred of Trump,' debunks arguments against Iranian terrorist strike","Over the last 48 hours, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has debunked a series of false claims and conspiracy theories being promotedby far-left activists, Democratic presidential candidates, and members of the media regarding America's killing of Iranian terrorist Qassem Soleimani.

Responding to Democrats' claims that President Donald Trump unconstitutionally circumvented Congress in targeting Soleimani, the senior senator from Florida said in a tweet on Thursday night that the nation's commander-in-chief ""doesn't need Congressional approval (even under unconstitutional War Powers Resolution) to respond to or prevent attacks against our armed forces.""

Rubio also noted that despite repeated warnings from the United States and ongoing Iranian aggression, ""some are so blinded by hatred of Trump that they argue he has done something sinister."" Adding, ""Its crazy. Total derangement.""

Debunks series of false claims

Rubio then fired off a tweet thread addressing a series of false claims made by detractors of the president. The first one dealt with arguments that Iran was ""under control"" during the Obama administration.

FICTION: Under the Obama #IranDeal everything was calm & under control with #Iran but Trumps maximum pressure campaign has brought us to the brink of war



FACT: Obama deal helped Iran fund the acceleration of its missile program & its support for Shia terrorist proxies

He then rebutted charges that targeting Soleimaini was ""reckless.""

FICTION: Trump has taken reckless & impulsive action with no planning or forethought for what comes next



FACT: Trump acted on previously expressed red lines that were crossed,after exhausting all other options & fully aware that Iran will now respond,if only to save face

Others have argued that diplomacy would have been more effective with Iran, an argument that Rubio also tackled.

FICTION: Iran's clerical leaders can be influenced & swayed with diplomacy & economic incentives



FACT: Iran's leaders are Shia/Persian expansionists whose overarching goal is an arc of dominance covering Iraq, Syria, Lebanon & Bahrain at the expense of Sunnis, Israel & the U.S.

While some say that Trump is ""desperate"" to start another war, Rubio defends the president arguing his use of force was a last resort.

FICTION: Trump is desperate to start a war in the Middle East



FACT: Trump has had several opportunities to justifiably respond militarily to Iran & did not. He has tried everything short of capitulation to avoid armed conflict with Iran.

Numerous activists and reporters have described Soleimani's death as an ""assassination,"" a characterization Rubio dismisses.

FICTION: Trump ordered the assassination of a foreign ""General"" and as a result has placed us on the brink of war.



FACT: Soleimani was an active enemy combatant, more dangerous than evil men such as Bin Laden & Baghdadi & who operated without regard for the law of war

Rubio insists that while armed conflict should be avoided, sometimes the only way to do so is through ""decisive action.""

FICTION: Armed conflict can always be avoided



FACT: Sadly, sometimes the only way to avoid armed conflict is surrender or capitulation. And sometimes the best way to avoid a broader conflict is limited but decisive action that leaves a clear cost-benefit calculus for an adversary

The Florida senator also debunked claims that Trump did not have the authority to target the Iranian terrorist.

FICTION: Trump has no authority to order military action against Iranian proxies & IRGC elements without congressional approval



FACT: President has a duty to defend against (& if possible prevent)attacks against our Armed Forces under both the Constitution & War Powers Resolution

Another common argument by the left is that the killing of Soleimani will result in more American deaths, but as Rubio countered, Iran had been targeting Americans and U.S. allies for years.

FICTION: Strike on Soleimani is the reason Iran will now unleash attacks on Americans



FACT: Iran has been attacking Americans for years & was planning more attacks in the near term via various proxies. Because they believed our threats of retaliation was idle talk.

President Trump took 'decisive and defensive action to protect American lives'

In a statement, Rubio also described Trump as taking ""decisive and defensive action to protect American lives and our nation's interest"" in the Middle East.

""Qassem Soleimani was an active enemy combatant and de facto commander of Iran's global terrorist proxy network, who was directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans and continued to plot attacks against U.S. diplomats and American service members,"" Rubio said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-who-slashed-baby-trump-balloon-first-time-ive-ever-seen-a-liberal-get-mad-about-chopping-up-a-baby,2020-01-04
Dem. presidential candidate Marianne Williamson offers plan to deal with US 'gun crisis': It includes banning bullets and creating a Dept. of Peace,"Left-wing activist, author, and Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson has a plan to fight the United States' current ""gun crisis"" — and it includes banning bullets and expanding the size of the U.S. federal government.

The liberal peacenik — known for her plan to ""harness love"" to defeat President Donald Trump, her New Age-y understanding of America's ""soulful ache"" (as Alyssa Milano put it), and her yodeling — gained serious notoriety after the first two Democratic primary debates.

Following the first debate in Miami in June, Republicans noted her quirkiness and made a push to get GOP supporters to make $1 donations to Williamson's campaign to help her clear the minimum-donors threshold for the second debate in Detroit, hoping that Williamson's presence would embarrass the Democratic Party. With their help, the former spiritual counselor for Oprah Winfrey qualified for the Motor City madness in July.

Her weirdness led her to be the most Googled candidate during the second Democratic debate and has gained her fame among the far-left reaches of the Democratic Party.

However, she failed to qualify for the third debate on Sept. 12 in Houston.

What's this about bullets?

In a Washington Post op-ed titled, ""America doesn't just have a gun crisis. It has a culture crisis."" published in the wake of the Odessa, Texas, shooting, Williamson first offered the usual litany of liberal demands following a mass shooting: universal background checks, close the alleged gun-show loophole, get rid of bump stocks, and ban scary-looking semi-automatic rifles that anti-gun politicians and activist have successfully labeled ""assault weapons.""

But she added something interesting to her things-to-ban list: bullets.

""Of course, we need universal background checks; we need to close all loopholes; we need to outlaw bump stocks; and we need to outlaw assault weapons and the bullets needed to shoot them,"" she wrote (emphasis added).

So-called assault weapons do not require special or unique ammunition. The rounds used in those rifles are the same rounds used in ""normal"" rifles.

Were the words Williamson wrote — and the Post published — an error based on a misunderstanding of firearms or an admission of the anti-gun crowd's plan for undermining Second Amendment rights? No one knows, because Williamson didn't elaborate and the Post apparently did not want her to.

A new federal department

Williamson lamented the state of America's ""violent culture,"" though nothing that ""as individuals, Americans are not a violent people."" She said U.S. politicians need to stop worrying only about symptoms and start getting to the root problems:

Most politicians stick to a discussion of symptoms only. Politics should be the conduit for our most expanded conversation about societal issues, not the most superficial one. Conventional politics does not lend itself to a discussion of the deeper issues that plague us. Yet go deeper we must.



America does not just have a gun crisis; it has a cultural crisis. America will not stop experiencing the effects of gun violence until we're ready to face the many ways that our culture is riddled with violence.

Where is the U.S. riddled with violence? Williamson explained ... sort of:



Our environmental policies are violent toward the Earth. Our criminal justice system is violent toward people of color. Our economic system is violent toward the poor. Our entertainment media is violent toward women. Our video games are violent in their effect on the minds of children. Our military is violent in ways and places where it doesn't have to be. Our media is violent in its knee-jerk shaming and blaming for the sake of a better click rate. Our hearts are violent as we abandon each other constantly, breeding desperation and insanity. And our government is indirectly and directly violent in the countless ways it uses its power to help those who do not need help and to withhold support from those who do.



The darker truth that Americans must face now is this: Our society is not just steeped in violence; we are hooked on violence.

Williamson went on to state that, though gun control ideas are something to work toward, the United States' tendency for ""brute force"" rather than diplomacy shows that there's little hope the current governmental structure can actually provide a solution to violence. For proof, she noted that the Pentagon budget vastly outsizes that of the State Department. She wrote:

Though gun-safety legislation should be fervently pursued, a political establishment so steeped in the ways of brute force is hardly equipped to be the purveyor of a solution to the problem of violence in this country. With a nearly $740 billion military budget but only $40 billion proposed for the State Department budget, our outsize commitment to brute force and ever-withering commitment to soul force is obvious. With the Air Force seeking 100 stealth B-21 Raiders, each with a price tag of $550 million and each equipped to carry both nuclear and conventional weapons, while 12.5 million children in the United States live in food-insecure homes — the idea of politicians who allow this to happen being the ones who are going to save us from the epidemic of violence in America is almost laughable.

Williamson has a solution, however. She wants to expand the size of government by creating a new U.S. Department of Peace.

Among the Department of Peace's responsibilities would be ""to coordinate and harness the powers of conflict resolution; restorative justice; violence prevention; trauma-informed education; mindfulness in the schools; child and family wrap-around services; social and emotional learning; and a world-class peace academy to train and to deploy thousands of peace-builders, plus national conferences and a presidential task force for peace creation.""

What exactly would the Department of Peace do to make these platitudes a reality?

Williamson did not offer any specifics.

How much would the Department of Peace cost?

Williamson did not offer any cost estimates.

Would the Department of Peace impact the deficit and the debt?

Williamson did not say whether her proposed new department would increase the annual deficit, which is estimated to be $960 billion in 2019 and $12.2 trillion over the next 10 years. She also did not elaborate on how expanding the size of government would impact the federal debt, which is currently more than $22.5 trillion, or 110 percent of GDP.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marco-rubio-constitutional-amendment-scotus,2019-09-03
Marine GoPro video shows chaotic Kabul evacuation in Afghanistan,"Raw and shocking footage of the U.S. evacuation from Kabul shows much more chaotic scenes than many were led to believe happened during the Afghanistan withdrawal.

Real-life, behind-the-scenes video clips were released last week by Marine Cpl. Mike Markland. The Marine, who was at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, captured the grittiness and desperation of the hurried evacuation of the Afghan capital as the Taliban marched toward power.

Markland stitched together video clips from a GoPro camera attached to his helmet to show exactly how tumultuous and unorganized the evacuation at the Kabul airport was. The firsthand footage reveals ""two straight weeks of worsening conditions"" on the ground as seen from the viewpoint of the Marine from 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment.

Markland posted the video on his Instagram, but it has since been deleted. Task & Purpose published the video, as well as Markland's commentary from social media, which has also been removed.

""I hope this answers questions but also provokes you to ask more,"" Markland captioned the since-deleted Instagram video. ""To my brothers and sisters who were there I made this for you and your family. When you have the lack of ability to explain all that happened in those two weeks, show them this. Stand tall and wear the last two weeks on your chest.""

""I haven't found a way to explain it with any words I know,"" the Marine admitted.

""Many of us joined because we liked fighting and were good with adversity and conflict,"" Markland reportedly wrote. ""Two weeks in Kabul at HKIA put all of that to the test. I can't say enough how proud I am of the Marines I serve with.""

""Odds were stacked against us. Circumstances undeniably out of our control, but we never let it deter our tenacious approach towards our mission at hand. Adversity and challenges happened 24/7,"" Markland said.

The Marine noted that ""almost all had no predesignated plan.""

""We did our absolute best and remained stoic through the sleepless nights and round-the-clock work with minimal food and water,"" he continued. ""Staying up for two or more days straight at a time grinding but remaining intensely vigilant.""



The at-times tough-to-watch video shows Afghans in utter despair to leave their country as their fate with the Taliban in control would be crushing at best.

The Afghans are densely packed into small areas with barbed wire fences at the borders of the holding area outside the Kabul airport. Marines shoot crowd munitions to attempt to calm the frantic masses. When crowd munitions aren't effective, Marines are seen firing off warning shots from their firearms in an attempt to control the large crowds.

Babies are seen being handed to the Marines for safety. Lacking medical equipment, wounded people are taken to get treatment on a ladder. Men and women are seen bursting into tears. In one clip, a man in civilian clothes bashes another person with the stock of his AK-47.

Despite the sheer inhumanity of the bedlam, there are moments of hopeful humanity as Marines give fist bumps to smiling Afghans.

Marines bond in a circle as the song ""Halftime"" by Nas blares in the background. They pass around the camera, make silly faces, throw a pineapple at each other, and enjoy friendly bicycle races.

In the middle of the 7-minute video, U.S. service members are seen disabling American military equipment and vehicles. The video shows stacks of AK-47s, PK machine guns, M-16s, and other weapons likely abandoned by the Afghan military after the country collapsed.

The end of the video pays tribute to the 13 U.S. service members who died in the suicide bombing in Kabul.

Markland's video paints a far more shambolic Kabul exit than the sanitized photos and videos provided by the Department of Defense.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marco-rubio-destroys-leftist_arguments,2021-09-05
China gets fast apology after Taiwan listed among 'countries' in Snickers product launch — the latest high-profile mea culpa toward communist regime,"Mars Wrigley apologized Friday for a Snickers product launch that referred the ""countries"" of South Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan, Reuters reported. The sticking point is that China has long considered Taiwan part of its communist regime, while Taiwan is not of the same mind.

What are the details?

Videos and images of an event promoting a limited-edition Snickers bar said to be available only in the aforementioned places went viral on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo on Friday, the outlet added.

Mars Wrigley on its Snickers China Weibo account published an apology and said the relevant content had been amended, Reuters reported.

Chinese state news outlet the Global Times said Mars Wrigley ""has verified & aligned the official site and social media accounts to ensure accurate content. Snickers owner Mars Wrigley said it respects China's [national] sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

Far from the first apology to China

Mars Wrigley's apology to China was the latest in a long line of mea culpas delivered to the superpower as it continues to gain financial, cultural, and military strength:

John Cena — the WWE star who became an actor — was heavily criticized last year after he posted a video to Chinese social media apologizing to the Chinese people for referring to Taiwan as a ""country"" while promoting an installment of the ""Fast & Furious"" movie franchise.

Luxury brand Christian Dior apologized to China in 2019 for omitting Taiwan from a map used for a recruitment and internship demonstration at a Chinese college.

In 2019, the National Basketball Association and then-Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey apologized to China for Morey's now-deleted tweet expressing support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, a move that cost the team significant business partnerships in China.

Then-Houston Rockets star James Harden also offered an apology to China in the wake of Morey's Hong Kong support: ""We apologize, you know,"" Harden said. ""You know, we love China.""

The Daily Mail reported that VF Corporation, which owns the North Face brand, and PVH, which owns Calvin Klein, removed statements from their websites expressing concern about human rights violations in Xinjiang after threats of getting shut out of the Chinese market.

Computer chip maker Intel was forced to apologize over a letter it sent to suppliers urging them not to source their products or labor from Xinjiang, the Daily Mail noted, adding that Nike and H&M faced backlash last year following statements they made about forced labor in the region.

But there are plenty of critics of those who kowtow to China. For example, ""Real Time"" host Bill Maher in February ripped NBA icon LeBron James, Olympian Eileen Gu, and Cena for seemingly putting profits over principles when it comes to speaking out against China's human rights abuses.

Other critics of China apologists have included sportscaster Bob Costas, CNN anchor Jake Tapper, Hollywood producer and comedian Judd Apatow, UFC star Colby Covington, and ex-NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom.

Anything else?

Meanwhile, China launched missile strikes in the Taiwan Strait on the heels of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan on Tuesday, which she said ""should be seen as a strong statement that America stands with Taiwan. We came to Taiwan to listen to, learn from and show our support for the people of Taiwan, who have built a thriving Democracy that stands as one of the freest and most open in the world.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticized China's missile launches as a ""significant escalation,"" the Daily Mail reported.

NBC News reported that the rising tensions in the region look far different from a similar situation in 1995-96 when ""the U.S. Navy sent warships through the Taiwan Strait and there was nothing China could do about it.""

“It’s a very different situation now,” Michele Flournoy, a former undersecretary of defense for policy in the Obama administration, told NBC News. “It’s a much more contested and much more lethal environment for our forces.”

The network said Chinese President Xi Jinping now has ""serious military power at his disposal, including ship-killing missiles, a massive navy and an increasingly capable air force. That new military might is changing the strategic calculus for the U.S. and Taiwan, raising the potential risks of a conflict or miscalculation, former officials and experts say.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marianne-williamson-gun-control-ban-bullets,2022-08-05
"CNN reporter attempts to fact-check conservative colleague, but it goes horribly wrong: 'Got jack to say'","Mary Katharine Ham, one of the few conservative commentators at CNN, blasted a top CNN reporter Friday after he attempted to fact-check her criticism that the media underreported on the 2017 attempted assassination of Republican congressmen.

What is the background?

The focus of Ham's criticism lay on the substantial attention the media have devoted to the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 riots at the United States Capitol as opposed to the 2017 shooting.

In fact, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) highlighted the apparent disparity of attention given to the riots over the left-wing political activist who targeted Republican Congress members practicing for a charity baseball game in 2017. That shooting critically wounded Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), who was House Majority Whip at the time, and left three others injured by gunfire.

The perpetrator was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Last year, the FBI classified him as a domestic terrorist.

What happened?

Responding to a New York Times reporter who downplayed DeSantis' remarks, Ham explained that she lives near the baseball field where the attempted assassination of GOP lawmakers occurred and in ""under 48 hours, the news vans were gone.""

""I was on TV, live from the baseball field where they played the game a day later, after almost being canceled by mass murder, but my topic was 'Mike Pence reportedly hired a lawyer,'"" Ham explained.

She added that her observation does not downplay covering the anniversary of Jan. 6, but noted that ""Scalise's return to Congress was very sparsely covered, and the anniversary was barely mentioned.""

In response, CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski fact-checked Ham.

""It looks you discussed the baseball game?"" he responded, posting a screenshot photo of Ham.

Ham quickly responded to her CNN colleague. She explained that the segment he posted was not the one she was referring to and highlighted a larger problem with Kaczynski's attempted fact-check. Where was his criticism of Chris Cuomo and Jeffrey Toobin?

""Hi, Andrew. Yes, this is within 24-48 hrs that this was a story. This segment was based on the galactically stupid Sanford contention that it was *Trump’s rhetoric* that caused it, bc of course. Pointed out Nats Park hit bc it was overlooking the game & yet not focused on this,"" Ham began.

""Do you need the rest of my itinerary from that day and the day after, which again, were basically the only days this was a national story, which was my point?"" she added. ""Got jack to say about Cuomo and Toobin, but gotta fact-check me when he’s got nothing.""

Regarding Cuomo and Toobin, Ham continued, ""One jacked off in front of female colleagues and one violated every conflict of interest rule in journalism, lied about it, and got fired, but I’m the issue bc I think the Congressional baseball shooting was covered too lightly and taxes are too high. Sure, dude.""

In other comments, Ham explained how the media downplayed the political motivations of the perpetrator who opened fire on Republican lawmakers by contrasting the media's focus on the perpetrator of the 2011 shooting that critically wounded then-Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.).

""Media incredibly made Giffords’ schizophrenic shooter w no political motive into an indictment of [Sarah] Palin/right while a Bernie bro’s motives trying to murder a Congressional delegation were apolitical/ignored,"" Ham said.

She explained again, ""The coverage of motives in Giffords was just so egregious, the Palin stuff and rhetoric (and they've stuck with it!). Then an actual professed Bernie bro plots the murder of a Congressional delegation for a month & it's like 'moving right along.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marine-kabul-evacuation-afghanistan-withdrawal-video,2022-01-08
"Masked, hooded crook demanding cash pistol-whips restaurant employee. But knocked-down worker turns the tables, pulls his own gun, and shoots suspect dead.","A Georgia restaurant worker turned the tables on an armed crook who pistol-whipped him last Monday night when the employee pulled his own gun and fatally shot the suspect.

What are the details?

Police in Warner Robins — which is about a half-hour south of Macon — said a man wearing a mask and a hood and armed with a gun entered the American Philly N Wings on Watson Boulevard around 9:45 p.m., WMAZ-TV reported.

Image source: YouTub screenshot

The gunman — identified as 23-year-old Joshua Hickey — jumped the counter demanding money and pistol-whipped a male employee amid a struggle for the gun, police told the station.

""The restaurant worker was struck [and] hit the ground,"" police Sgt. Justin Clark noted to WMAZ. ""As he was coming back up, he drew his own legally-owned firearm and fired three shots at Mr. Hickey. Mr. Hickey was struck twice and fled on foot.""

Officers found Hickey on Vernon Drive and took him to a hospital where he died, the station said.

Police concluded that the restaurant employee was acting in self-defense, WMAZ said. There were conflicting reports about the condition of the employee. WMAZ said the employee was not hurt, but WGXA-TV reported that the ""victim of the robbery had minor injuries.""

The restaurant staff declined to comment to WMAZ.

Anything else?

The National Crime Victimization Survey says two specific types of crime increase in December: robbery and personal larceny, WMAZ said, noting that those crimes actually spike by 20% in December.

""Theft in general does tend to increase around the holidays. As far as our robbery numbers, though, from last year versus this year, we're right on par to have about the same, which is 70, currently,"" Clark added to the station.

Therefore, whether you work at a business or you're just shopping or eating out, Clark warned viewers to be vigilant as the year winds down, WMAZ said: ""Be aware of your surroundings, be aware of people coming in and out, pay attention to your doors, and things like that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mars-wrigley-apologizes-to-china-for-calling-taiwan-a-county,2022-12-12
Trump's former defense secretary Jim Mattis denounces the president and his response to the riots,"Jim Mattis, former secretary of defense in the Trump administration, fired off a scathing criticism of President Donald Trump over the response to nationwide protests and rioting.

""I have watched this week's unfolding events, angry and appalled,"" Mattis said in the statement Wednesday.



""Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people—does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us,"" Mattis said. ""We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We can unite without him, drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society. This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.""

Mattis defended the protesters by excoriating efforts to paint the broad movement with the criminal actions of a smaller number of rioters and looters.

""The words 'Equal Justice Under Law' are carved in the pediment of the United States Supreme Court. This is precisely what protesters are rightly demanding,"" Mattis explained.

""It is a wholesome and unifying demand—one that all of us should be able to get behind. We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers. The protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values—our values as people and our values as a nation,"" he added.

Mattis also criticized the federal call to have the military bring order to the riots on American soil.

We must reject any thinking of our cities as a ""battlespace"" that our uniformed military is called upon to ""dominate."" At home, we should use our military only when requested to do so, on very rare occasions, by state governors. Militarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington, D.C., sets up a conflict—a false conflict—between the military and civilian society. It erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect, and of which they themselves are a part. Keeping public order rests with civilian state and local leaders who best understand their communities and are answerable to them.

""We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution,"" he concluded.

"Mayor Emanuel smashes Smollett, prosecutors for conflicting claims: 'They better get their story straight'","Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Wednesday morning doubled down on his outrage following prosecutors' stunning move the day before to drop all charges against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett who was accused of filing a false police report and orchestrating a hate crime against himself in late January.

""You have the state's attorney's office saying he's not exonerated, he actually did commit this hoax. [Smollett is] saying he's innocent, and his words are true,"" Emanuel told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America."" ""They better get their story straight. Because this is actually making ... fools of all of us.""

On Tuesday, Emanuel lashed out at the dropped charges decision, calling it a ""whitewash of justice.""

""From top to bottom, this is not on the level,"" he added. ""There needs to be a level of accountability throughout the system, and this sends an unambiguous message that there is no accountability, and that is wrong.""

What did the prosecutor who dropped Smollett's charges have to say?

Joseph Magats — the first assistant Cook County state's attorney who dropped Smollett's charges — told WBBM-TV Tuesday regarding the actor, ""I do not believe he is innocent.""

Magats took over the case after Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself. Foxx reportedly asked Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson to let the FBI investigate Smollett's hate crime allegations after the former chief of staff to former first lady Michelle Obama told Foxx that Smollett's family was concerned about the police probe, WMAQ-TV reported, citing several media outlets.

Magats took into consideration Smollett's lack of a criminal history and that his disorderly conduct charges were ""low-level"" felonies, ABC News said.

And Magats also took issue with Emanuel's ""whitewash of justice"" accusation.

""Not true, it's just not,"" he told WBBM. ""It's not a whitewash, [Smollett] did community service, he has forfeited his bond, it's just not a whitewash.""

A spokesman for the Rainbow PUSH Coalition — founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson — told WBBM that Smollett performed a total of 16 hours of service over two days. Magats added to the station that Smollett's community service — which he said took place after the actor's indictment — was a factor in his decision to drop the charges against Smollett.

Smollett case reportedly wiped off database 'as if it never existed'

In the meantime, ABC News' senior national correspondent Terry Moran issued a ""celebrity justice"" tweet concerning Smollett on Tuesday, saying ""Cook County clerk's office tells ABC they were shocked that no written motions were filed with the court in connection with today's surprising dismissal in the Smollett case. On top of that, the case has been wiped off their database as if it never existed.""

'None of this adds up'

Emanuel told Stephanopoulos that Smollett's community service seemed a flimsy factor for dropped charges against him and that ""none of this adds up.""

""Let's get to the bottom of this. Let's find out what happened,"" Emanuel said. ""Especially [in] a city that embraced not only him as an actor but more importantly the values of being ... whoever you are, whoever you love, whatever your background is, you have a home here. He took that, turned it around, and tried to self-promote himself. And the fact is, he's walking around with no sense of contrition, no sense of remorse, and the fact is also the state's attorney is saying he's actually guilty of this hoax, he's walking around saying, 'No, I'm innocent. Everything I said is true.' One is right, one is wrong.""

Smollett spoke to reporters after charges against him were dropped Tuesday and said he has been ""truthful"" from the beginning.

""I've been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one,"" Smollet said. ""I would not be my mother's son if I was capable of one drop of what I have been accused of. This has been an incredibly difficult time, honestly one of the worst of my entire life. But I am a man of faith, and I am a man that has knowledge of my history, and I would not bring my family, our lives, or the movement through a fire like this. I just wouldn't.""

One of Smollett's attorneys, Tina Glandian, criticized prosecutors, telling ABC News that if they ""believed the charges they never would have dismissed the case.""

""I'm saying their actions speak louder than words,"" she added to the network. ""They could have proceeded in a variety of ways. We were ready to move forward. We appeared in court and pled [sic] not guilty. We were ready to fight the charges and they're the ones who voluntarily discontinued the matter, so I think that speaks volumes.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/masked-hooded-crook-demanding-cash-pistol-whips-restaurant-employee-but-knocked-down-worker-turns-the-tables-pulls-his-own-gun-and-shoots-suspect-dead,2019-03-27
Mitch McConnell warns against 'premature American exit' from Afghanistan amid reports of Trump troop drawdown,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned Monday against rushing to pull more U.S. service members from Afghanistan and other countries in the Middle East, saying that a ""premature American exit"" would harm U.S. allies and help its enemies.

His comments come as several outlets reported that President Donald Trump is planning a significant troop drawdown before Inauguration Day.

What are the details?

Politico reported that according to an unnamed defense official, ""The White House has told the Pentagon to begin planning to bring the troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq down to 2,500 each by Jan. 15, just days before President Donald Trump leaves office.""

The outlet further noted:

The military is in the midst of drawing down from roughly 8,600 to 4,500 troops in Afghanistan under the terms of a peace agreement with the Taliban announced in February. The new order would roughly halve the number of American troops in the country again, to 2,500 ahead of the full withdrawal planned by May 2021 in exchange for a set of guarantees from the Taliban.

News of the purportedly pending drawdown was first reported by CNN, and came just days after Trump fired Department of Defense Secretary Mark Esper.

Speaking from the Senate floor on Monday, McConnell did not directly criticize the president. Rather, he said that in Congress, ""a small minority in both parties seem to think it is in America's power to unilaterally remove conflicts by simply walking away from them.""

The majority leader went on to praise the Trump administration for making ""tremendous headway in creating the conditions that will secure the enduring defeat of the terrorists,"" but argued that there is still work to be done before the U.S. withdraws its troops too aggressively.

""The consequences of a premature American exit would likely be even worse than President Obama's withdrawal from Iraq back in 2011,"" McConnell said, according to The Hill. ""It would be reminiscent of the humiliating American departure from Saigon in 1975. We'd be abandoning our partners in Afghanistan.""

He added, ""A disorganized retreat would jeopardize the track record of major success this administration has worked to compile.""

Not everyone agreed with McConnell's remarks.

Sean Davis, co-founder of The Federalist, tweeted in reaction to the majority leader's comments, ""We've been in Afghanistan for 20 year[s]. Withdrawal is long overdue, not 'quick.' It's a myth that there's no bipartisan consensus in Washington.

Megan Rapinoe has had 'major blow-ups' with her family over their Trump support,"Megan Rapinoe, the captain of U.S. Soccer's women's national team, told The Guardian that her family's conservative political views have caused some major conflicts over the years.

The soccer star became a household name in political circles during the Women's World Cup, after she was seen in a video saying ""I'm not going to the f***ing White House"" in response to an interview question.

Rapinoe said she thinks her father voted for President Donald Trump and that she doesn't understand how her parents can hold the views they do while having and supporting two lesbian daughters. From The Guardian:

Perhaps Rapinoe is the expression of their sublimated liberalism, the things that her parents can't say, I suggest. ""I know. And I'm very similar to how they are, even though I think my dad voted for Trump and I'll say: 'I don't get it. How are you simultaneously as proud as punch of me, and watching Fox News all the time, [who are doing] takedowns of your daughter?' That's why I'm like: 'You guys need to go to therapy.'""

The political differences have also led to some significant disputes, although Rapinoe said she remains very close to her family.

Do they fight now? ""There's been some major blow-ups. There's definitely been some dust-ups."" At the same time, she says: ""I'm very close to my family. It's not like: 'Ugh, I'm from a conservative town and I never talk to them any more.' I talk to my parents all the time, every day. And I feel like I have seen progress and growth. I would love it if people understood you should never say racist things and be OK with gay people, or whatever it is. But, obviously, it doesn't happen that quickly.""

Rapinoe, after her comments about not visiting the White House, became involved in a public feud with President Trump, causing her status as a politically divisive figure to, at least temporarily, rival her notoriety as an accomplished soccer star as she became a frequent guest on various cable news, late night and daytime television shows.

The U.S. women won their fourth World Cup title, beating the Netherlands 2-0 on July 7 in France.

Right now, Rapinoe and the women's national team are in a legal battle with the United States Soccer Federation, which the team is suing for pay discrimination.

In an excerpt obtained by Variety, McCain revealed why she chose to leave hit daytime TV talk show ""The View"" after spending four years as the long-running production's only conservative co-host.

Explaining that it was a ""privilege to be part of such an iconic piece of TV history,"" McCain said it was ultimately the show's ""f***ed up"" behind-the-scenes culture that pushed her to prioritize her mental and emotional health above a job.

In the excerpt, McCain said co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar were guilty of bullying and abusing her both on- and off-camera, specifically during the Trump presidency.

McCain explained she made the decision to leave after the birth of her daughter, Liberty — who was born in September 2020 — and ultimately announced she'd be leaving the production in July. Her last day on the show was Aug. 6.

Everything changed, she explained, after she gave birth to her first child and developed a severe form of anxiety due to postpartum hormones. Despite the acute illness — of which McCain insists the show's producers were aware — the chronic attacks and off-camera bullying continued following her three-month hiatus.

""On my second day back, as I was still getting my sea legs back and adjusting to my new schedule and life between breast-pumping and researching for my hot topics, Joy and I began squabbling a bit about the state of the Democratic Party on air,"" McCain said. ""To make light of things and to ease the tension, I said, 'Joy, you missed me so much when I was on maternity leave! You missed fighting with me!'""

McCain said Behar's response cut her to the bone.

""I did not. I did not miss you,"" Behar yelled. ""Zero.""



McCain explained nothing she ever experienced on camera ""ever hit this hard.""

""I felt like I'd been slapped. She yelled out at me sharp and intensely, and I believed her,"" McCain added. ""Now, I know I'm not always a perfect angel, but I would never speak to any woman that way who had just returned after giving birth. There are some things in life and some moments of time in life which are sacred. There are also times in life where you aren't as strong as you usually are.""

McCain said when the show broke for commercial, she, too, broke.

""I burst into tears,"" she said. ""[U]ncontrollable sobbing. I was super hormonal and deeply hurt.""

She told producers, ""If you guys didn't want me to come back, I wouldn't have come back!""

""I told him he might need to pull my camera away for minute because I wasn't sure if I could get myself together in time to go back to interviewing people,"" the excerpt continued. ""I get my boobs begin to leak from lactation. I was embarrassed and shaking. I felt like I wasn't in control of my body. I didn't want millions of viewers to see that. After sobbing for what felt like an eternity, I wiped my face, took deep breaths, and double-checked that my nipples were not in camera range. I tried to smile and focus as the show resumed.""

""That experience,"" she continued, ""of crying and leaking and trying to pull it together in seconds so I could go back on-air with women who appeared to hate me was an intensely heartbreaking experience. I can't explain it further other than I felt like in that moment I took a look at my life outside of myself and I thought clearly — this s*** isn't worth this. Nothing in life is worth this.""

McCain added she finished out the segment and the show and took refuge in her office.

""I rushed down stairs, closed my door, threw up in the garbage can and I finished the crying session I'd had to interrupt before,"" McCain continued. ""While I wept, I no longer felt safe working at 'The View.' It is one of the most singular feelings of loneliness and anguish I have felt in my entire life. It was a perfect storm of hormones, postpartum anxiety and a lot of demons on 'The View' coming out to bite me.""

McCain said she decided to be upfront and honest with producers about how Behar's remark hurt her — but was told that she wouldn't be getting an apology.

""I never talked to Joy one on one again after that day,"" she admitted.

What else?

Another portion of the excerpt says, ""[T]here's stuff that happens on 'The View' that shouldn't be allowed,"" she added. ""For whatever reason, there's a deep level of misogyny about the way 'The View' is covered and written about in the media, where tabloids are always writing about the co-hosts hating each other backstage. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy because the atmosphere of 'The View' breeds drama: Producers can't control hosts, manage conflict, or control leaking. My take on the show is that working at 'The View' brings out the worst in people. I believe that all the women and the staff are working under conditions where the culture is so f***ed up, it feels like quicksand.""

McCain said when she first joined the show in 2017 she felt a kinship with Goldberg.

""She had made a promise to my father that she would look after me, and she kept her word for the first two years that I was on the show,"" McCain explained. ""The thing about Whoopi, though, is that she yields so much power in culture and television, and once she turns on you, it can create unfathomable tension at the table.""

Goldberg's reported ""disdain"" for McCain only grew over the years, the conservative broadcaster explained, fostered only by McCain's Republican ideologies.

The treatment, she insisted, only grew more severe as former President Donald Trump's presidency progressed.

""It was as if I had become an avatar for everything they hated about the president,"" she said. ""It felt like the co-hosts and staff only knew one Republican — me — and took out all their anger on me, even though I didn't even vote for Trump. ... During my time on 'The View,' I felt like I was being often being punished and singled out for being a conservative. I'd hear a lot of complaints that the staff, including the other co-hosts and producers, had problems with my 'personality.' Until I got pregnant, I could handle it and manage it. No matter how hard the days were, I accepted the tradeoff. I was on the most watched TV show on daytime TV with a platform to speak to — and for — millions of women in this country. This was the deal with the devil I knowingly made.""

The show, she reasoned, ""is billed as being honest and open"" as well as an ""arena for women to share and discuss their views on politics and the most important topics of the day.""

""A space where women support — and respectfully challenge — each other,"" she added. ""But the truth is that the environment of the show is toxic. Here I was, thinking that I had been through so much with these women. Together, we had helped bring the show back from the dead. We won an Emmy. We became America's 'most watched daytime talk show.' We were on the covers of magazines. After giving birth, I didn't feel like myself. I felt extremely vulnerable. Joy seemed to smell that vulnerability like a shark smells blood in the water, and she took after it. Why was this worth it to her? I will never know. But, so much for working moms looking out for each other.""

The excerpt concluded, ""Look, it's not all bad. I'll be attached to it for the rest of my life, for better or worse. I'm not mad about what happened to me. Other hosts who've left are like, 'F*** The View.' I don't feel that way. I'm not bitter or angry. I want change. The idea of show dedicated to women having conversations that society reserves for men is important and necessary in our culture. But there are some things about the show that feel stuck in 1997 when 'The View' first went on air. In this era of dismantling toxic work environments and refusing to accept the poor treatment of employees, how is 'The View' still immune?""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mcconnell-warns-against-premature-exit-from-afghanistan-amid-reports-of-trump-troop-drawdown,2021-10-19
Megyn Kelly tells Glenn Beck: Biden allegation is a 'haunting case',"News veteran Megyn Kelly appeared on ""The Glenn Beck Program"" on BlazeTV and discussed her recent interview with Joe Biden sexual assault accuser Tara Reade.

Reade claims that Biden penetrated her with his fingers against her will while the two met in a Senate basement hallway in 1993.

Biden, however, has insisted that while all women should be believed, the incident Reade alleges simply never took place.

An abused woman determined to see the case through

During a Tuesday sit-down with Glenn Beck on ""The Glenn Beck Program"" on BlazeTV, Kelly detailed key parts of her interview with Reade, which she said contains some very credible allegations by Reade. Beck said Kelly was extremely thorough in her discussion with Reade, with ""no question left on the table.""

""How did you find [Reade] personally?"" Beck asked.

Kelly, who said Reade was ""delightful,"" pointed out that Reade is only just getting started in her fight against Biden but seems determined to see it through.

""She was perfectly kind, warm; she's been through the wringer. You could see that, too."" Kelly said. ""This is not a woman of great means. And, you know, when I got to her, she had, I think, the night before hired — well, not hired. She's not paying him. Gotten a lawyer and a PR person, for the first time in this whole thing. So she, for the first time, felt a little more steady. You know, she's had no protection. And she's out there. She's on a very thin reed.""

Kelly explained that Reade, because of the accusations, has taken the full force of social media's angst. Social media, in turn, has dredged up all sorts of alleged information that is irrelevant to the case and seems only to be circulating such personal information in an attempt to smear Reade and her credibility.

According to Kelly, a variety of social media users have circulated Reade's banking history, such as bounced checks, have made death threats against the former Senate staffer, and even shared personal photos of the former Senate staffer's close family.

""I think she was expecting to have her credibility questioned,"" Kelly added.

She later said that Reade was taking the full brunt of social media scorn, however, over the allegations.

""People are so nasty — social media is so awful,"" Kelly added. ""So I think she's a little rattled, but all things considered, she was holding it together.""

When personal lives become partisan fodder

Kelly later told Beck that Reade is in a particularly precarious situation because she has come out with an accusation against a political leader in an election year.

Pointing to Christine Blasey Ford's accusations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Kelly said that while the #MeToo movement has been beneficial in many cases, it has also become problematic in many ways.

The news veteran said that society has ""overcorrected,"" and in many cases, the accused hasn't received fair due process.

""That's not OK, either,"" she insisted.

If Reade is telling the truth, however, Kelly said that she will be the perfect person to expose ""the hypocrisy"" of some Democrats.

Kelly said that viewers of the interview will ""walk away with a good sense as to whether they're seeing a truth-teller or not.""

Beck then went on to ask Kelly her own personal thoughts on Reade's allegations and whether she believes Reade to be genuine in her allegations against the Democratic presidential front-runner.

""I want to continue reporting on this case, and I shouldn't choose a side,"" Kelly said. ""I definitely have my own belief, but it's irrelevant.""

November 2020 isn't here yet

Beck, who said that Kelly told him that this is a ""haunting case in more ways than one,"" pressed, ""What do you mean by that?""

Kelly said that if the allegations against Biden are true, then it's ""deeply disturbing information"" on the presidential candidate.

""What kind of a man would, in passing, in a Senate hallway, when seeing a young staff assistant, sexually assault her, right?"" Kelly said. ""Do you really want this man as president?""

Kelly continued, countering, ""If it's not true, what has happened to the country where someone can make an allegation? It can besmirch a former vice president, a former U.S. senator, and all the media now, finally is talking about it. ... It's just very easy to put that ring around someone's neck. Maybe unfairly.""

Kelly also added that it deeply upsets her to know that people who profess to be women's advocates are insisting that Reade is lying simply because Biden is a beloved Democrat.

""[This case] exposed how false these people who are pretending they're women's advocates are,"" she said. ""It upsets me as a woman, as someone who has actually stood for female empowerment for my entire life. I don't call myself a feminist, but I defy anyone to challenge me on standing up for female empowerment.""

""I have done it,"" she insisted. ""And I have the career that proves it.""

Kelly said that she's disturbed by how people previously vilified Kavanaugh day in and day out across the news spectrum, but have given Biden — because he is a Democrat — what seems to be a media pass.

""The nonsense by these people who were protesting against Brett Kavanaugh were vicious against him. ... The 180 that they have done now that the allegations are against a Democrat trying to take down Trump ... is disgusting to me. Disgusting.""

The Tara Reade Interview



Kelly released the interview on Friday, containing Reade's accusations, including some new, lurid information.

During the encounter, Biden reportedly told Reade, ""I want to f*** you.""

""I pulled this way, away from his head, and so he was kissing my neck area,"" Reade told Kelly during the exchange. ""And he whispered, did I want to go somewhere else, in a low voice. He said some other things, I can't remember everything he said, but he said something vulgar.""

Reade, who said that she was wearing crotchless underwear during the incident, said that she was reluctant to reveal that part of the encounter because she didn't want her mother to know. Reade said that she wore the lingerie panties to work that day and planned on meeting up with her boyfriend at the time after work concluded.

""It took [my mother] a while to get it out of me because I kept, I was embarrassed about the underwear I was wearing,"" Reade told Kelly.

Reade said that she previously praised Biden when he was running for office with former President Barack Obama because she wasn't ready to come out with her story at that time.

""During that time — I'm an expert witness on domestic violence issues, as you know, so that was, like an account, you know, part of that awareness of domestic violence and other violent acts,"" Reade responded. ""I've always been conflicted about Joe Biden, I didn't want to talk badly about him. And I wasn't ready to tell my history with Joe Biden at that point at all.""

Elsewhere during the interview, Reade called for Biden to drop out of 2020 presidential race. She also promised that she would go under oath and subject herself to cross-examination in order to testify about the alleged incident.

Mexican president says he wants to 'get rid of' his country's army,"Progressive Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador says that if he had his druthers, he would disband his country's entire army and replace it with a new militarized police force.

What are the details?

According to Reuters, Lopez Obrador told Mexican newspaper La Jornada Monday, ""If were up to me, I would get rid of the Army and turn it into the National Guard, declare that Mexico is a pacifist country that does not need a military and that the defense of the nation, if necessary, would be done by all.""

The leftist leader conceded, however, that such a move is not politically viable.

""I can't do it because there is resistance,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""One thing is what is desirable and another thing is what is possible.""

President Lopez Obrador's admission comes just a day after his country held a ceremony celebrating the newly established National Guard, a law enforcement institution aimed at tackling Mexico's rising violent crime, ABC News reported.

But critics say the National Guard is simply a federal force that could strip the power from local law enforcement entities. Alejandro Schtulmann, president of the Mexico-city based political risk firm EMPRA told ABC, ""They are just rebranding something so that it's not called the army — but it's the army.""

Mexico's National Guard was ratified by its congress in March and was launched with 70,000 members. President Lopez Obrador hopes to increase its strength to 150,000 troops across the nation.

According to VICE, it ""will eventually incorporate members of the marines, army and federal police,"" and the outlet cited an expert who explained, ""it's kind of like if the FBI, Customs and Border Protection, National Guard and Coast Guard operated under a single command.""

Lopez Obrador has already deployed National Guard troops to patrol Mexico's borders in an attempt to reduce the flow of Central American migrants traveling through the country en route to the U.S.

Anything else?

For decades, Mexico's army has been used to help fight the nation's powerful domestic drug cartels rather than engaging in international conflicts. Last year, the country's murder rate hit its highest level in 20 years, and is on track to climb even higher before the end of 2019.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/meghan-mccain-memoir-abuse-the-view,2019-07-01
Miami-Dade School Board overwhelmingly rejects proposal requiring recognition and observance of October as 'LGBTQ History Month',"On September 7, the Miami-Dade School Board, which oversees a school system with over 331,000 students, held a public meeting at its headquarters in downtown Miami. Over the course of six hours, various personalities and groups took turns expressing their support or criticisms for a proposal advanced by board member Lucia Baez Geller, who represents District 6. Geller's resolution, H-11, if enacted, would have had the school board ""recognize and observe October 2022 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) History Month,"" as well as provide social studies instruction on gay history.

At 9:45 p.m., the board voted 8-1 against the proposal.

Part of the reason cited for voting down the proposal was that it was likely in conflict with Florida's Parental Rights in Education Bill, which reinforces parents' natural rights to make decisions concerning their children's upbringing.

Geller did not handle the decision well and was visibly upset. She claimed, ""There is an election year and the anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric is a tool used by some to spread misinformation.""



School board chair Perla Tabares Hantman, who plans to retire in November, stated, ""We have to be in accordance with the law.""

Although last year, the board — differently constituted — voted 7-1 to recognize October as a gay-themed month (also proposed by Geller), Geller drew heat this week by pushing further for a gay-themed curriculum change.

Geller suggested that just as students are required to learn about the War of Independence, the Civil War, the world wars, and the civil rights movement, they should similarly learn about cases pertinent to gay activism in the United States.

Accordingly, H-11 would have had students specifically study and learn about Supreme Court cases Obergefell v. Hodges (where bans on same-sex ""marriage"" were ruled unconstitutional) and Bostock v. Clayton County (where discrimination against employees on the basis of gay orientation or transsexuality was ruled unconstitutional) in social studies classes.

In her September 2 letter to the board, Geller asserted that October should be a time ""established to remind all cultures within our wider community of the important roles that LGBTQ people have taken in shaping the social, historical, legal, and political worlds we live in today.""

She further highlighted how a gay-focused month would constitute ""an effective means of educating and calling to action our community to work together by fighting prejudice and discrimination ... and increasing visibility and raising awareness.""

Board member Christi Fraga, who represents District 5, was the lone dissenter in last year's successful vote to observe a gay-themed October. According to WPLG, Fraga suggested on Wednesday that H-11 creates a ""hostile"" environment and emphasized it isn't up to teachers to ""decide what will be taught in classrooms during this time.""

Pastor Max Tovar, who led a prayer outside the meeting and asked the board members to reject the motion, told the Miami Herald that H-11 was ""a Trojan horse.""

Others, reported the Guardian, indicated that the realization of Geller's proposal would amount to sexual abuse of children.

The chair of Moms for Liberty Miami-Dade, Eulalia Maria Jimenez, suggested the alteration of the social studies curriculum to complement an already gay-themed month requiring observance by students was tantamount to ""indoctrination."" In an Instagram post, the group had written, ""Help us protect the children against grooming agenda HB-11.""

A transsexual supporter of H-11 present at the meeting suggested such language was dehumanizing to the gay community.



The president and founder of the gay activist group PRISM FL, Maxx Fenning, went a step further, suggesting that a refusal to render October a gay month and require its observance by children was akin to Nazi persecution.

Another activist group, Equality Florida, expressed shock and alarm in response to the school board's determination, writing, ""Tonight's vote is more proof of the sweeping, dangerous effect of Florida's discriminatory Don't Say LGBTQ law.""

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis-backed candidates flipped the Miami-Dade school board last month. Concerning that win, the 1776 PAC tweeted, ""Miami Dade is now the LARGEST county in America with a conservative school board majority. Congrats to Roberto Alonso and Monica Colucci.""

"Michelle Obama slams Trump as 'racist', defends BLM, advocates for Joe Biden in 'closing argument'","Former first lady Michelle Obama blasted President Donald Trump's policies as ""racist"" and beneficial to the rich and powerful in a campaign video making her ""closing argument"" for Democratic nominee Joe Biden 28 days from the presidential election in November.

In a 24-minute speech published on YouTube, the former first lady adopted talking points lifted from progressive election strategists who urged Democrats to link ""racism and class conflict"" in the left's appeal to voters.



""Right now, our country is in chaos because of a president who isn't up to the job,"" Obama said.

Writing in the New York Times last month, progressive researchers Ian Haney López, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and Tory Gavito, founder of the left-wing Texas Future Project, called on Democrats to adjust their message to reach Hispanics and other voter groups the Biden campaign is struggling to consolidate support from.

""Democrats should call for Americans to unite against the strategic racism of powerful elites who stoke division and then run the country for their own benefit,"" López and Gavito wrote. ""This is not to deny the reality of pervasive societal racism. But it does direct attention away from whites in general and toward the powerful elites who benefit from divide-and-conquer politics.""

They proposed Democrats adopt a message like this:

We had come so far, but now Covid-19 threatens our families — for instance with health risks, record unemployment and losing the businesses we worked hard to build. To overcome these challenges, we need to pull together no matter our race or ethnicity. But instead of uniting us, certain politicians make divisions worse, insulting and blaming different groups. When they divide us, they can more easily rig our government and the economy for their wealthy campaign donors. When we come together by rejecting racism against anyone, we can elect new leaders who support proven solutions that help all working families.

That is exactly the message Obama used in her speech.



""Let's be very real, America is divided right now, and a lot of people are being sold lies from those who want to get rich or stay in power, or sometimes both,"" she said. ""We must all empathize with those who might not look like us or vote like us. We have got to put ourselves in one another's shoes.""



""Think about it,"" she continued. ""You've worked hard all your life and for too long you've watched the rich get richer. You've lost your farms and your livelihoods to corporate greed, you've seen your beloved towns shattered by joblessness, you've watched families destroyed by drug addiction and mental health challenges. All of this, long before this virus hit. And it is frustrating to hear some folks say that you've been the beneficiary of privilege, that the color of the skin gives you a head start. That is the reality for far too many hard-working decent Americans.

""But right now, the president and his allies are trying to tap into that frustration and distract from his breathtaking failures by giving folks someone to blame other than them,"" she said.

Obama defended Black Lives Matter protests and said ""the president and his allies"" are ""stoking fears about black and brown Americans, lying about how minorities will destroy the suburbs, whipping up violence and intimidation — and they're pinning it all on what's been an overwhelmingly peaceful movement for racial solidarity.""



Obama claimed ""only a tiny fraction of demonstrations had any violence at all"" and labels the president's calls for law and order in U.S. cities beset by civil unrest ""racist.""

She accused Trump of failing to take the coronavirus pandemic seriously, appealing to U.S. parents who are concerned for their children's safety as schools reopen.



""If you're a parent like me, you're feeling the consequences of this president's failure to take this pandemic seriously — from his constant downplaying of the importance of masks and social distancing to his relentless pressure on schools to open without offering a clear plan or meaningful support to keep students and teachers safe,"" Obama said.

She said Trump, with all the resources of the United States government, failed to provide a plan to ensure Americans were tested for coronavirus and health care workers received the medical equipment they needed to handle a surge of sick patients. She said the president lied to the American people about the severity of the virus and attempted to ""gaslight the American people by acting like this pandemic is not a real threat.""

Obama attacked Trump for allegedly calling U.S. military war dead ""losers"" and ""suckers,"" comments Trump denies making that were divulged to the press by anonymous sources. She also criticized the president and Republicans in Congress for failing to deliver additional stimulus aid to Americans facing economic hardship caused by the pandemic.

Former Vice President Joe Biden ""has the character and the experience to put an end to this chaos, start solving these problems, and help lighten the load for families across the country,"" Obama said.

Obama made several appeals to race in her speech, asking undecided voters for ""empathy.""

""As a black woman, who has like the overwhelming majority of people of color in this nation done everything in my power to live a life of dignity and service and honesty, the knowledge that any of my fellow Americans is more afraid of me than the chaos we are living through right now — well that hurts. It hurts us all. It is a heaviness that sits on our hearts,"" Obama said.



So I want to appeal for some empathy here too. I want everyone who is still undecided to think about all those folks like me and my ancestors. The moms and dads who worked their fingers to the bone to raise their kids right. The teenagers who wear hoodies while working hard to get their diplomas. The millions of folks who look like me and fought and died and toiled as slaves and soldiers and laborers to help build this country. Put yourselves in our shoes for just a moment. Imagine how it feels to wake up every day and do your very best to uphold the values that this country claims to hold dear — truth, honor, decency — only to have those efforts met by scorn not just by your fellow citizens but by a sitting president. Imagine how it feels to have suspicion cast on you from the day you were born simply because of the hue of your skin. To walk around your own country scared that someone's unjustified fear of you could put you in harm's way, terrified of what four more years of this kind of division might mean for the safety of you and those you love. Living with the knowledge that no matter how hard we try, how much good we do in the world, there will be far too many who will never see our humanity, who will project on us their own fears of retribution for centuries of injustice and thus only see us as a threat to be restrained, and we know what happens next. A racial slur from a passing car. A job promotion that never comes. A routine traffic stop gone wrong. Maybe a knee to the neck.

""Racism. Fear. Division. These are powerful weapons. And they can destroy this nation if we don't deal with them head-on,"" Obama said.

""Search your hearts, and your conscience, and then vote for Joe Biden like your lives depend on it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mexican-president-says-he-wants-to-get-rid-of-his-countrys-army,2020-10-06
Michigan city becomes first to elect all Muslim officials. They insist religion will not interfere with their governance.,"A Michigan city known for its large immigrant population just became the first in the U.S. to be run entirely by Muslim elected officials.

What are the details?

Residents of Hamtramck, Michigan, located just outside Detroit, recently elected a Muslim mayor and three more Muslim city council members, the Detroit Free Press reported. So, beginning in January, all six of the city council positions will be held by Muslim members.

""Five of them are immigrants and one is a convert to Islam with ancestral roots in eastern Europe,"" the Free Press added, noting that Hamtramck — which used to be a Polish Catholic enclave — now boasts a majority population of residents who claim either Arab or Asian ancestry.

According to census data, more than two-thirds of the city's roughly 28,000 residents speak a language other than English in their homes.

Various Muslim groups told the Free Press that Tuesday's historic election made Hamtramck the first city in the nation to elect all Muslims to its political posts. Likewise, the Council on American-Islamic Relations confirmed that assessment to Axios.

What are they saying?

Council members insisted in conversations with the Free Press that they would not let Islam influence their governing decisions.

""It's important to remember that although we all happen to be practicing Muslims, we are elected through the processes set forth by the United States, Michigan, Wayne County, and Hamtramck,"" Amanda Jaczkowski, one of the three newly elected Muslims, said.

She continued, ""We will all take an oath ... to protect the Constitution of the United States, and that includes the concept of separation of church and state. I believe strongly in that separation, and although I will bring the Islamic values of honesty and integrity to the table, the policies that I promote and affirm will be what is best for all people of Hamtramck.""

""Religion is not inside the [City Hall] building,"" current Councilman Mohammed Hassan added. ""It's outside in the mosque and temple and the church. Not in City Hall.""

Another newly elected council member, Khalil Refai, made it clear that this focus would be on local policy issues.

""I ran for office to solve everyday issues facing our community,"" he said. ""Fixing our sewers and lead pipes, finding creative ways to increase city revenue, and creating a more transparent, inclusive City Hall are all important issues we heard during the campaign. I am looking forward to solving these issues with my colleagues. I am a proud Hamtramckan, and I love living in a community that has people with many different religious backgrounds.""

What else?

The incompatibility between Islamic Sharia law and American constitutional law has been a subject of controversy in recent years as more and more Muslims are elected to governing posts in the United States.

While many Muslims — including some members of the U.S. Congress — appear to serve without issue, some argue that conflicts between the two systems can and will continue to arise.

As an example, earlier this year, a Texas judge denied a U.S. citizen due process rights and instead ordered her to appear before an Islamic Sharia tribunal to arbitrate a divorce from her husband.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/miami-dade-school-board-rejects-lgbtq-history-month-curriculum,2021-11-11
"Michigan judge blocks prosecutors from enforcing 1931 abortion ban, belittles pro-life testimony","A Michigan judge has blocked state prosecutors from enforcing a nearly 100-year-old abortion ban that would have gone back into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

In a decision siding with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Judge Jacob Cunningham on Friday issued a temporary restraining order following a two-day evidentiary hearing. He said the people of Michigan ""would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not issued.""

Cunningham ruled that criminalizing abortion ""squarely contradicts our medical professionals duties, oaths, and a standard of medical care.""

""The variable danger of death, serious injury, infertility, abuse, forced pregnancy, poverty, etc. — all testified at the evidentiary hearing — all stem from imposition of the statute ... The harm to the body of women and people capable of pregnancy in not issuing the injunction could not be more real, clear, present and dangerous to the court,"" Cunningham said.

The abortion ban — a 1931 law that remained dormant until the Supreme Court ruled in its Dobbs decision that states may regulate abortion — makes performing an abortion a felony punishable by up to four years in prison. The law is opposed by state Democratic leaders and county prosecutors who have promised they would not enforce the law were it to go back into effect.

But Republican prosecutors in Kent, Jackson, and Macomb Counties said they would consider bringing criminal charges against abortion providers who violate the law. Democrats went to court seeking to block prosecutors from enforcing the law until the issue is resolved by either the state Supreme Court or by voters adopting a proposed constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights in November.

""This court finds it is overwhelmingly in the public's interest to let the people of the great state of Michigan decide this matter at the ballot box, assuming the constitutional amendment initiative is on the ballot on Nov. 8,"" Cunningham said Friday.

Reading his decision from the bench, Cunningham said he found the state's pro-abortion witnesses ""extremely credible."" However, he dismissed the testimony of pro-life witnesses called by the defense, Dr. Priscilla Coleman and Dr. Gianina Cazan-London.



Dr. Coleman, an expert in psychology of abortion, decision-making, and mental health outcomes, testified about her research and publications on the mental health impact to women who have abortions, WJBK reported.

""On cross-examination, in the court's eyes, Dr. Coleman's credibility was seriously called into question and her statistics and conclusions of her testimony revealed unhelpful and biased information for the court's instant inquiry,"" Cunningham said. ""Notable was Dr. Coleman's indication that although there were 'very few' psychological studies and instances of rape or incest, resulting in birth, she nevertheless concluded - stunningly - that only 20% of those mothers harbor resentment towards that child.""

He dismissed Dr. Coleman's testimony as ""not credible"" and afforded it no weight.



Likewise, he said Dr. Cazan-London, a pro-life OB/GYN, had a ""personal bias"" because she cares for pregnant women, specializes in high-risk pregnancies, and once assisted in an abortion procedure.

""On cross-examination, Dr. Kazan London was significantly discredited in the court's mind regarding a personal bias in this area. The court also observed her demeanor significantly changed, including the tenor of her voice on cross-examination vs on direct examination,"" he said.

Cunningham also condemned Dr. Cazan-London for her answer to a question about pregnancy that is a product of rape.

""Notable to the court was the inability for Dr. Kazan London to acknowledge, from the court's perspective, the impact of rape and subsequent pregnancy and a victim testifying that all births - even if the result of rape - are simply 'part of womanhood,'"" he said, declaring her testimony carried no weight.

David Kallman, an attorney representing two Republican county prosecutors, said he will appeal the decision.

“The judge ignored all of the clear legal errors and problems in this case, it appears to me, simply because the issue is abortion,” Kallman told the Associated Press after the hearing.

Democratic state leaders celebrated his decision.

“I am grateful for this ruling that will protect women and ensure nurses and doctors can keep caring for their patients without fear of prosecution. I am particularly grateful to Attorney General Dana Nessel and her team for their work on behalf of the state,"" Whitmer said in a statement.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel also released a statement calling abortion ""critical healthcare.""

""Uncertainty around the law has a chilling effect on the conduct of doctors and therefore limits access to care for Michigan women. Maintaining access to reproductive healthcare is absolutely necessary for the health and well-being of women and it is our duty to ensure that access for the roughly two million women of reproductive age who call Michigan home,"" Nessel said.

She continued, ""Absent this preliminary injunction, physicians face a very real threat of prosecution depending on where they practice. There is no doubt that the statue criminalizing abortion is in direct conflict with the ability of the medical community to provide the standard of care consistent with their education, training, expertise and oath.

Women do not need to be protected from themselves by denying them the ability to make personal medical decisions consistent with their own moral, cultural, religious and ethical beliefs. Restricting access to reproductive healthcare jeopardizes the ability of physicians to deliver appropriate care and it denies women the right to decide the most intimate issues regarding their health, their bodies and their lives.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michelle-obama-slams-trump-defends-blm,2022-08-19
Millennial reality star: World War II history shouldn't be taught to 'young children' so their 'mental health' can be preserved,"A 22-year-old United Kingdom reality TV star said on the popular ""Good Morning Britain"" show that World War II history shouldn't be taught to ""young children"" so as to preserve their ""mental health.""

And Freddie Bentley, a contestant on ""The Circle,"" declared all this in a Friday clash with fellow panelist Sir Michael Wilshaw, who only happens to be the former chief inspector of schools in England.

Image source: ITV/GMB video screenshot

'I don't think it needs to be put ... to young children'



""I don't think it needs to be put ... to young children,"" Bentley said, according to Birmingham Live, adding that it could adversely affect ""their mental health to be told that this certain amount of people died for you.""

He added, ""I remember learning it as a child and thinking, 'My God, it's so intense,'"" the outlet reported.

But Wilshaw retorted: ""Children need to know that it is a dangerous world out there. They need to know that crossing the road is sometimes dangerous.""

Bentley, however, wasn't too convinced, emphasizing that ""mental health [problems are] ... on the rise completely, and I don't think encouraging death or telling people how many people died in a world war is going to help someone in the future.""

""There are so many problems going in the world at the moment, like Brexit, that's not taught in schools and climate change, which is a situation that I feel like we should be aware of,"" the reality show star offered, adding, ""when I left school, I felt like it hit me like a ton of bricks, because I didn't know anything"" about practical living such as ""how to save for a mortgage.""

Bentley added that ""instead of focusing so much on our history and holding onto this past, that we could let it go a little bit — I'm not saying get rid of it totally — but let go of it a little bit and replace it with a subject that is gonna be beneficial to us in the future ... more relevant.""

Wilshaw, however, reminded him that ""50 million people died in the Second World War to fight fascism, to fight tyranny — people who wanted to take away people's right to freedom, to the vote ... that's why people should know about the Second World War, the First World War, the conflicts that have taken place, and the fight for freedom that you and I enjoy.""

Gen. Milley denies undermining Trump's command in calls to China; Biden refuses to fire him,"Gen. Mark Milley, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, denied a report that he undermined former President Donald Trump's command and President Joe Biden threw his support behind the nation's top military leader.

Milley faced calls for his resignation after reporting in a new book claimed that he had called his military counterpart in China to reassure them after the Jan. 6 rioting at the U.S. Capitol, and to say he would warn them if there was a surprise attack.

Milley denied that he had undermined the chain of command in a statement released through a spokesperson.

""The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs regularly communicates with Chiefs of Defense across the world, including with China and Russia. These conversations remain viral to improving mutual understanding of U.S. national security interests, reducing tensions, providing clarity and avoiding unintended consequences or conflict,"" said Colonel Dave Butler.

""His calls with the Chinese and others in October and January were in keeping with these duties and responsibilities conveying reassurance in order to maintain strategic stability. All calls from the Chairman to his counterparts, including those reported, are staffed, coordinated and communicated with the Department of Defense and the interagency,"" he continued.

""General Milley continues to act and advise within his authority in the lawful tradition of civilian control of the military and his oath to the Constitution,"" the statement concluded.

Biden responded to the claims on Wednesday and signaled that he had no intention to fire him.

""I have great confidence in General Milley,"" Biden said to a reporter.

Among those voices calling for Milley's immediate firing were Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who said Biden should act to reestablish the tradition of civilian control over the military.

""These actions by General Milley demonstrate a clear lack of sound judgement, and I urge you to dismiss him immediately,"" wrote Rubio to Biden.

John Bolton, the former national security advisor to Trump, defended Milley in a statement on Wednesday.

""Mark Milley is a staunch supporter of the Constitution and the rule of law. His patriotism is unquestioned,"" said Bolton in part.

""In the days after Donald Trump's November 3, 2020, election defeat, I can only imagine the pressures he and others were under in fulfilling their Constitutional obligations,"" Bolton continued. ""I have no doubt General Milley consulted widely with his colleagues on the National Security Council and others during this period. I would also be very surprised if many of them were not fully aware of General Milley's actions, and that they fully concurred in them.""

Minnesota gov blamed right-wing 'white supremacists' for violence — now the truth comes out,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, pinned responsibility for the violence in Minneapolis on right-wing ""white supremacists"" and drug cartels on Saturday. Walz, along with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter (D), also blamed the violence on out-of-state, professional agitators — not local residents.

New evidence, however, show their claims are not true.

According to KMSP-TV, the ""overwhelming majority"" of those arrested in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area over the last several days were in-state residents.

The overwhelming majority of people arrested in connection with the Minneapolis unrest have Minnesota addresses, a search of the online Hennepin County Jail log shows.



Of the 45 people arrested for rioting, unlawful assembly, stolen property, burglary or robbery on May 29 and May 30 so far, 38 had Minnesota addresses, according to publicly available jail records reviewed by FOX 9.

In fact, KMSP reported that only six of those arrested have out-of-state addresses.

The revelation forced Carter to retract his previous declaration that ""every"" protester that had been arrested in his city were not local residents. The Democratic mayor claimed he was given inaccurate information prior to making remarks at a news conference Saturday.

Meanwhile, a security expert — former British Army counterterrorism officer Adam Leggat, who now works as a security consultant — told USA Today that intelligence reports show the agitators are left-wing anarchists.

From USA Today:

Leggat, the security consultant, said intelligence reports from his colleagues indicate most of the hard-core protesters in Minneapolis are far-left or anarchists, and that far-right groups have not yet made a significant appearance. He said looting is typically done by locals – usually people with no criminal record who just get caught up in the moment.



But direct conflicts with authorities come from a mix of both locals and outside groups who see these conflicts as a core part of their mission. Many of the anarchists, he said, target banks, chain-type businesses and even luxury cars as symbols of corrupt institutions. He said even a peaceful protest can turn violent if outside agitators decide to participate, hijacking the message.

Indeed, Attorney General William Barr said Saturday that the violence is being carried out by ""far-left extremist groups.""

""In many places, it appears the violence is planned, organized, and driven by anarchistic and far-left extremists, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence,"" Barr said.

Barr reiterated those facts in a statement on Sunday, saying that, ""violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.""

President Donald Trump also announced Sunday that Antifa will be designated as a terrorist organization, which may prove difficult because Antifa does not have centralized leadership like terrorist organizations and drug cartels.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/millennial-reality-star-world-war-ii-history-shouldnt-be-taught-to-young-children-so-their-mental-health-can-be-preserved,2020-05-31
10-year-old girl at the center of child sex abuse allegations found in foreign country after being missing since July,"Authorities say that 10-year-old Sophie Long — who has been missing since July — has been found in a foreign country, according to a report from Fox News.

The child's father, Michael Long, is in custody after being accused of kidnapping her earlier this year.

Long does not have custody of the child.

What are the details?

Sophie is set to be returned to her family in the United States after being located and placed in protective custody.

A press release from the Collin County Sheriff's Office read, ""The Collin County Sheriff's Office confirms that Sophie Long has been located in a foreign country and is in protective custody. Arrangements are being made for her safe return to her family in the United States.""

""Michael Long is in custody on a felony warrant for Interference with Child Custody. The United States government is working on the extradition of Long back to Collin County, Texas.""

""Collin County Sheriff Jim Skinner stated, 'Many months of determined work by my deputies, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Marshals paid off this morning,'"" the statement continued. ""'We are so happy that Sophie is safe.'""

The release concluded, ""No additional information regarding this case will be released until Sophie is back on U.S. soil.""

What else?

Sophie's father told the Daily Mail during an August interview that he was willing to go to jail to ""protect"" his daughter.

In July, Long refused to return Sophie to her maternal aunt following a visit, saying that he feared for her safety after the child claimed to have been sexually abused by her mother's fiancee.

""I'd absolutely go to jail to protect Sophie,"" he told the outlet at the time. ""I'd do anything for her. She's a 10-year-old child. She shouldn't be dealing with this stuff. These high-conflict custody cases — this wasn't about getting into a custody case. This was about getting justice for my daughter. ... This is about a little girl who made an outcry and has a diagnosis and has not gotten justice. There's no way I'm going to turn my back on her now.""

The outlet reports, ""In a meeting with DailyMail.com in August, Sophie appeared happy to be with her father as she spoke about her grades at school and her favorite classes.""

Sophie's story in August sparked a #StandWithSophie campaign on social media.

Long has insisted that his ex-wife's fiancé, Jacob Bellington, sexually abused the child, who was later diagnosed with a vaginal infection. Sophie corroborated her father's claims in a private meeting with a nurse, according to the report.

Bellington has denied the allegations and said that Long is simply trying to tear apart the family.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/milley-statement-china-biden-backs,2021-12-15
"Mississippi levels up pro-life case, asks Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade: 'Nothing in constitutional text, structure, history, or tradition supports a right to abortion'","Stepping up their efforts to support a pro-life law passed in the state, lawyers for the state of Mississippi urged the Supreme Court on Thursday to overturn Roe v. Wade, arguing the landmark 1973 ruling has no basis in constitutional law.

""Under the Constitution, may a State prohibit elective abortions before viability? Yes. Why? Because nothing in constitutional text, structure, history, or tradition supports a right to abortion,"" Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch and four of her attorneys wrote in an opening brief.

They also argued that the conclusions reached in Roe and 1992 ruling Casey v. Planned Parenthood are ""egregiously wrong"" and have ""inflicted significant damage"" to the ""principles of democratic self-governance."" Both rulings declared that states cannot place an ""undue burden"" on abortion access before viability, which lawyers argue is unconstitutional.

The arguments came as part of a brief filed in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. The case concerns a 2018 law passed in Mississippi that largely prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The law has been held up in the legal system as lower courts have cited Supreme Court precedent to keep the state from banning abortions before ""fetal viability,"" or the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb, generally believed to be 22 weeks.

The state filed an appeal to the lower court rulings with the Supreme Court last year. And in May, the top court agreed to hear the case, setting up a pivotal showdown over abortion rights — the first since the court was reshaped with a 6-3 conservative majority.

When the state initially filed the appeal, it took a softer stance toward Roe and Casey, arguing it was ""merely ask[ing] the court to reconcile a conflict in its own precedents,"" NBC News reported.

But on Thursday, the state changed its tone, arguing that Roe and Casey are ""at odds with the straightforward, constitutionally grounded answer to the question presented"" and thus needed to be dealt with.

Nancy Northrup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the abortion clinic in the case, reviled the state's brief, calling it ""extreme"" and ""regressive.""

Today's brief reveals the extreme and regressive strategy, not just of this law, but of the avalanche of abortion bans and restrictions that are being passed across the country,"" Northrup said in a statement. ""Their goal is for the Supreme Court to take away our right to control our own bodies and our own futures — not just in Mississippi, but everywhere.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/minnesota-gov-blamed-white-supremacists-for-violence-then-the-truth-came-out,2021-07-23
'Witnessing Whiteness': Missouri college may introduce whites-only racism seminar,"A Missouri university may consider a whites-only seminar to encourage white students to talk about racism and privilege, Campus Reform reported.



What is it about?

The program at Webster University in St. Louis would be based on the book ""Witnessing Whiteness: The Need to Talk About Race and How to Do It.""

A former multicultural studies professor at the school and its chief diversity officer have both been involved in the Witnessing Whiteness program.

""White people would not be as forthcoming if they were in a mixed group,"" Mary Ferguson, who was multicultural studies adjunct professor at Webster from 1997 to 2009, said in a report by Webster University's student newspaper, The Journal. ""They would not do as deep a learning because they would be afraid of being called racist and offending someone.""

Vincent Flewellen, the chief diversity officer at Webster University, previously organized a Witnessing Whiteness program at Washington University where he served as Director of Equity and Inclusion. He told The Journal that if implemented, the program would probably not be held before August.

During an NBC news program in December 2018, Flewellen said he wants white people to stop calling the police on black people ""just because they're gathering in a park."" He also said he hopes white people will be able to ""find their voice and are able to speak to, call out and stand up against racism,"" after they attend the workshop.



Ferguson, who is currently a racial justice director with the YWCA said on the NBC program that there are currently 16 ""Witnessing Whiteness"" groups that meet regularly. About one dozen more could be formed by next year, she said.

What's included?

The Mero St. Louis YWCA's website states that the curriculum for the program includes:

""History and construction of white racial identity.

Community building within white spaces.

White culture and values and how US national culture reflects and largely rests of white culture, practices and values.

Manifestations of white supremacy and privilege.

Cross-racial communication, conflict, and relationship building.

Activation of white solidarity and accountability.""

According to a document on the YWCA website, ""People of color shouldn't always have to be the ones to educate white people about racism and oppression. We are taking responsibility for learning about racism, our own white privilege, and how to challenge it as white people.""

It also states the program provides ""a space for white people to figure out what it means to be an anti-racist white person and challenge racism in all areas of our lives.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/missing-10-year-old-girl-found-in-foreign-country,2019-01-27
"Mob of pro-Palestinian thugs ask LA diners if any of them are 'Jews,' witness says. Then mob beats up two Jewish men.","A pair of Jewish men dining outside a Los Angeles restaurant Tuesday night were allegedly attacked by members of a pro-Palestinian caravan driving through the area, KTLA-TV reported.

What are the details?

The incident took place just before 10 p.m. outside Sushi Fumi on North La Cienega Boulevard in the Beverly Grove neighborhood, the station said — and portions of the attack were captured on cellphone video.

A witness told KTLA she was sitting with a group of friends when the caravan displaying Palestinian flags drove by and began shouting at diners.

Twitter video screenshot via @SussexFriendsofIsrael

In one exchange caught on video, one of the apparent pro-Palestinians yelled at diners, ""Israel kills children and women every day!"" After which one of the diners yelled back, ""F*** you!"" Soon what sounds like breaking glass is heard, and the clip ends.

Content warning: Language:

The witness added to the station that several men from the caravan jumped out of their vehicles and asked male diners if any of them were ""Jews"" — and when two said they were, fighting broke out.



The mob of apparent pro-Palestinians easily outnumbered the diners, and at least two attackers were very large. One of the victims appeared to pick up a metal stand and tried to swing it at the mob, but several attackers converged on him and began punching him.

One of the diners — a photographer who is not Jewish — told KCBS-TV bottles were thrown at him and the group he was meeting with to plan a wedding.

The man said he was physically attacked when he tried to defend the group, the station said, adding that the attackers used anti-Semitic slurs and that he went to a hospital after being pepper sprayed.

KTLA said restaurant staff rushed patrons inside, locked the doors, and called police.



The suspects — who fled south on La Cienega in a vehicle described as possibly a black Jeep — were described as white men wearing all black, KCBS said.

The witness told KTLA the incident lasted about 15 minutes, and no one was taken into custody.

Authorities are investigating whether the incident was a hate crime, KCBS reported.

'Absolutely outrageous'

Video of the incident was sent to L.A. City Councilman Paul Koretz, who is Jewish, KCBS noted.

""It's absolutely outrageous,"" Koretz told the station. ""We're not going to allow this in the city of Los Angeles.""

The councilman came to the scene and said he would push for an investigation of the attack, KCBS reported.

""We're not going to bring the conflict from the Middle East here and allow people to be attacked on our streets because of what they look like and [how] they appear ethnically,"" Koretz noted to the station.

Pro-Palestinian activists have taken to the streets in West Los Angeles amid fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, KCBS said.

Moderator for second presidential debate was an intern for Joe Biden and a staff assistant for Ted Kennedy,"The Commission on Presidential Debates has chosen C-SPAN political editor and host of the network's ""Washington Journal"" call-in program, Steve Scully, to moderate the second presidential debate on Oct. 15 in Miami.

Scully is largely considered an old-school, unbiased journalist and was described as having a ""famously calm demeanor"" in a recent bio by Marie Claire. So one might think his presence at the debate would be a welcome addition after Tuesday night's testy, insult-laden contest.

Yet, as the Daily Wire reported Thursday, there are a some areas of Scully's background that are likely to raise eyebrows in conservative circles. Namely, that Scully worked as an intern for then-Sen. Joe Biden in college and later worked as a staff assistant in late liberal firebrand Sen. Ted Kennedy's communications office.

In a 2011 interview with the Cable Center, Scully explained his career history and how it headed in the political direction after he interned for Biden.



""You know, it was pretty traditional,"" he said. ""I came to school in Washington, D.C., went to American University and had a couple of internships. I worked for Joe Biden, senator from Delaware at the time, as an intern, so I had my first chance to really see politics up close in Washington, D.C.

""I worked for Senator Kennedy,"" he continued. ""I was involved in his ill-fated campaign in 1980, which was interesting; having worked as a high school student in the Carter campaign in 1976, I saw from two different perspectives. I always knew I wanted to come back to Washington.""

Now, being partisan doesn't preclude someone from being fair. But it's worth considering what the Democratic response would be if a former Trump employee were slated to moderate a debate.

Scully was a backup moderator for the 2016 presidential debates, and while his services weren't needed, he told Politico at the time that he was ready if called.

""I have the file with me,"" Scully said ahead of the first debate. ""If they call me at 8:59 p.m., I'm ready to go, and if they do in the next three debates I'm ready to go as well.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/missouri-racism-whites-only-seminar,2020-10-01
Mom of missing 1-year-old jailed for filing false police report amid child’s inexplicable disappearance,"The mother of missing 15-month-old Evelyn Boswell is in jail on a charge of filing a false police report.

The whereabouts of Evelyn, who went missing in December, remain unknown at the time of this writing.

Evelyn's family only filed a missing persons report last week.

What are the details?

Authorities charged 18-year-old Megan Boswell with filing a false police report according to ABC News. She is being held at the Sullivan County Jail on a $25,000 bond.

Megan said that her daughter's grandmother took the child to a campground Mendota, Virginia. Police searched the area, but didn't find the child or her grandmother.

Authorities say that Megan has given conflicting accounts in the investigation as to the disappearance and whereabouts of the child.

Evelyn's grandmother, Angela Boswell, and boyfriend William McCloud were arrested last week in North Carolina on fugitive warrants unrelated to the child's disappearance. Angela was extradited to the Sullivan County Jail on Monday and arraigned Tuesday on a theft charge.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigations reports that both Angela and McCloud are ""believed to have information"" on Evelyn's whereabouts.

The Tennessean previously reported that investigators are attempting to determine why the child's family took so long to report her missing.

Bureau of Investigation spokesperson Leslie Earhart announced on Friday that the child was last seen wearing a pink tracksuit, pink shoes, and a pink bow. The child stands 2 feet tall and weighs 28 pounds. She has blonde hair and blue eyes.

Anyone with information on the child's disappearance or whereabouts should call 911 and report and details about the case to 1-800-TBI-FIND.

"Mondaire Jones, Republicans, emboldened Russia","Progressive Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) said that Russia ""has been emboldened by"" GOP assaults against American democracy. The freshman lawmaker also described President Joe Biden as ""a very strong president.""

""I think the Russian Federation has been emboldened by Republican attacks on our own democracy here domestically,"" Jones told reporter Kevin Frey.



The congressman said that ""despite Donald Trump, when he was president, having a very cozy, encouraging relationship"" as it pertains ""to Vladimir Putin and his antics, we've got a very strong president in Joe Biden today.""



A Washington Post-ABC News poll of adults in the U.S. found that 48% believe that American leadership on the world stage has become weaker during Biden's tenure, while just 23% believe it has grown stronger, and 26% think it has stayed around the same. The poll was carried out Feb. 20 to 24.



The eyes of the world are on Ukraine, where Russia has mounted an invasion against the sovereign nation, wreaking death and destruction as Ukrainians bravely risk their lives to fight back against the Russian onslaught.

The U.S. has condemned Russia and levied sanctions. President Biden has said that U.S. troops will not intervene in Ukraine, though he has declared that America will defend NATO allies.

Rep. Jones is an advocate for adding seats to the U.S. Supreme Court, a move critics commonly describe as court packing.



""The only way to restore integrity to the Supreme Court is to expand it. Congress must do exactly that, before it's too late,"" the congressman said in a statement while applauding President Biden's decision to nominate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to fill the high court vacancy that will be created by Justice Stephen Breyer's upcoming retirement.

Jones said that he is ""clear-eyed about the continuing threat the far-right, 6-3 majority on the Court poses to our democracy and fundamental freedoms.

More than 200 members of Congress urge Supreme Court to rule in favor of Louisiana pro-life law,"More than 200 members of Congress filed a brief in an upcoming Supreme Court abortion case out of Louisiana, arguing in favor of the state pro-life law at the heart of the legal controversy.

The group of 207 lawmakers — 168 House members and 39 senators representing 38 states — said that they ""have a special interest in the correct interpretation, application, and enforcement of health and safety standards for elective abortion enacted by the People of the States they represent"" and that a previous 2016 ruling by the high court on abortion clinic safety standards ""created an overly subjective 'balancing' test, leading to confusion among Congress and state legislatures alike as to which laws might withstand constitutional scrutiny.""

Thursday's brief asks the high court to both uphold the safety restrictions and ""provide clarity regarding the bounds of the Government's ability to safeguard the lives and health of their citizens.""

The lawmakers also take issue with abortion provider June Medical Services' standing to bring the case on behalf of patients in the first place. Citing a ""a long history of health and safety violations,"" the brief argues that ""not only do Louisiana abortion providers lack the kind of 'close' relationship ordinarily required for third party standing, but also that there is an inherent conflict of interest between abortion providers and their patients regarding state health and safety regulations.""

The Supreme Court agreed to take up the case in question, which will be Justice Brett Kavanaugh's first abortion case, back in October and is scheduled to hear oral arguments in March. The case is about a Louisiana statute that requires abortion clinics to have ""active admitting privileges"" at a hospital within 30 miles of where abortions are performed.

While proponents of the law defend it as a means of protecting women's health and safety, opponents just see another effort by pro-lifers to make it hard to get an abortion. The pro-abortion Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the case with the Supreme Court in April, says the law was ""designed to close abortion clinics throughout Louisiana"" and argues that only one would remain if it were to take effect.

In a statement about the brief, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said, ""Innocent life must be protected at every stage, and I urge the Supreme Court to uphold this law which ensures the health and safety regulations meant to protect Louisianans from the very abortionists who don't want high standards.""

""When our Supreme Court justices take up this Louisiana case, they will be deciding whether abortion clinics should be required to maintain the same standards as any other outpatient surgical clinic,"" Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy (R) said Thursday.

""We aren't asking abortion clinics to close down; we're demanding they protect their patients by securing admitting privileges at nearby hospitals,"" Kennedy's statement continues. ""It's a common sense law, and we need to uphold this law which helps protect the lives of women and their unborn children.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mom-of-missing-1-year-old-jailed-for-filing-false-police-report-amid-childs-inexplicable-disappearance,2020-01-02
"More than 450,000 acres of land purchased by a billionaire-funded conservation organization","The American Prairie (AP) is attempting to form the largest nature park in the U.S. by buying up massive amounts of land in Montana. The group states that its mission is to create ""a refuge for people and wildlife preserved forever as part of America's heritage.""



AP has successfully purchased over 450,000 acres since 2004 but aims to acquire 3.2 million for its American Prairie Reserve project. When completed, the park will be roughly the size of Connecticut and 25% larger than Yellowstone.

The Montana acreage primarily consists of land once used for farming and grazing. The region's economy heavily depends on its $4.72 billion agricultural industry, and ranchers are concerned that the group will buy up too much privately-owned land and sabotage production.

During a Fox News Digital interview, AP's vice president and chief external relations officer, Pete Geddes, stated the organization is ""engaged in private philanthropy and voluntary exchange by buying ranches from people who would like to sell that to us.""

With the help of billionaire donors, AP has raised tens of millions of dollars since its inception. Its donors include well-known financiers and retail moguls.

Geddes stated AP selected the area because of its decreasing population, saying that ""perhaps there's greater potential for less conflict over conservation in this part of the world.""

United Property Owners of Montana (UPOM) is made up of local ranchers who are against the plan set in motion by AP. UPOM's policy director, Chuck Denowh, explained that the donors helping purchase the land are concerned only about having a tax-deductible charitable donation and not the consequences on agricultural production.

Denowh expressed concern about where the donations are coming from and that ""for the future of food security of this country, we need to take a close look at that.""

AP originally made headlines over its bison grazing plan in Montana. Recently, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) decided to grant AP its request to have bison roam on 60,000 acres previously reserved for cattle grazing.

UPOM expressed concern that the large bison population could spread disease to ranchers' cattle.

Montana's attorney general, Austin Knudsen, told Fox News Digital that allowing bison on the land would be illegal. ""This is federal land that is specifically – by the Taylor Grazing Act, by federal law – set aside for livestock grazing. Bison are not livestock, even under federal law,"" he stated.

Another group, Montana Stockgrower Association, also spoke out against AP. President Jim Steinbeisser stated, ""Ranchers have worked diligently for over a century caring for the public land livestock graze. Ranchers are held to the highest standards by federal land agencies in the areas of range management, range monitoring, range improvements, and processes within the BLM's grazing regulations, yet when concerns were raised regarding these areas in comments and protests, BLM did not acknowledge these concerns.""

With farmers and ranchers being pushed out of the state, it remains to be seen the impact this could have on America's food supply.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mondaire-jones-republicans-russia,2022-07-29
Officials say Ukrainian Neptune missiles sank Russia's Moskva – largest warship lost in combat since WWII. Russian state TV host warns conflict has 'escalated into World War III.',"Russia suffered a major loss on Thursday after Ukrainian Neptune missiles reportedly destroyed the Moskva warship.

Russia denies the warship was destroyed by a missile

A senior U.S. defense official confirmed on Friday that Russia's Moskva warship was struck by two Ukrainian Neptune missiles in the Black Sea approximately 60 miles off the coast of Odesa. The missile strike allegedly caused a ""significant explosion"" that ultimately sank the large cruiser. The official said there are likely casualties.

The Russian defense ministry claimed an unexplained fire broke out on the ship and an explosion was triggered from ammunition onboard. Russia's defense ministry said ""the vessel is seriously damaged"" and ""the entire crew have been evacuated,"" the BBC reported.

The Kremlin asserted that while the damaged warship was being towed to a port that Moskva ""lost its balance due to damage sustained in the hull."" The Russian defense ministry stated, ""Given the choppy seas, the vessel sank.""

Moskva is believed to be the largest warship to be lost in combat since World War II.

The Moskva is the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet

The Moskva is a 611-foot-long, 12,500-ton missile cruiser with a crew of almost 500. Coincidentally, the Moskva was built in the 1970s at the Mykolayiv Shipyard in Mykolaiv, Ukraine. Originally, the ship was named ""Slava,"" which means ""glory."" The ship was renamed ""Moskva"" after the fall of the Soviet Union. The warship was the third largest vessel in Russia's active fleet.

Popular Mechanics reports, ""The Slava-class cruisers were built to hunt down aircraft carriers in the event of a war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, which was headquartered in the Soviet Union.""

The Slava-class cruiser is equipped with Vulkan anti-ship missiles, 16 long-range cruise missiles, anti-submarine, mine-torpedo weapons, and triple-tiered, 360-degree anti-air defense coverage.



""In addition to medium- and short-range defenses, it could engage six short-range close-in weapon systems (CIWS) as a last resort,"" the BBC reported.

""The CIWS system can fire 5,000 rounds in a minute, essentially creating a wall of flak around the cruiser, its last line of defense,"" naval expert Jonathan Bentham from the International Institute for Strategic Studies told the outlet.

The Moskva – which had undergone two modernizations during its time in service – has been involved in several Russian military campaigns, including being deployed in the Syrian conflict in 2015.

The Moskva was a floating command center that provided long-range and mobile air defense protection for the entire Black Sea Fleet during the invasion of Ukraine.

""The ship’s primary mission was air defense, according to the Pentagon, though the Moskva was also equipped with anti-ship missiles and had the capacity to carry 16 long-range cruise missiles, like those that have battered Ukrainian targets for weeks,"" the New York Post reported.

Losing the Moskva is a 'massive blow' to Russia

Alessio Patalano – professor of war and strategy at King's College in London – told CNN that losing the Moskva would be a ""massive blow"" to Russia.

""Ships operate away from public attention and their activities are rarely the subject of news,"" Patalano said. ""But they are large floating pieces of national territory, and when you lose one, a flagship no less, the political and symbolic message – in addition to the military loss – stands out precisely because of it.""

Retired Adm. James Foggo – who commanded U.S. naval forces in Europe and Africa – told Morning Edition, ""This is a terribly humiliating blow to the Russian navy, and it's rather astonishing that they could allow this to happen to themselves.""

Ukraine uses a new kind of missile to defend its country

Odesa state regional administrator Maxim Marchenko claimed in a post on Telegram that Ukrainian forces had attacked the Moskva with Neptune cruises missiles.

Popular Mechanics details the Neptune missile:



The Neptune missile is a Ukrainian subsonic, low-altitude anti-ship cruise missile. The missiles are based on the Cold War-era SS-N-25 ""Switchblade,"" which was so closely modeled on the American AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile, it was derisively nicknamed “Harpoonski.” After the Cold War, Russia fielded newer versions of the missile as the Kh-35, while Ukraine went on to develop the Neptune , which has a range of 190 miles and packs a 330-pound, high-explosive warhead.

The Guardian reported, ""The whole system comprises a truck-based mobile launcher, four missiles, a reload vehicle, and a command and control vehicle. It is designed to fly close to the surface of the sea to avoid detection.""



The Neptune missile has a range of nearly 200 miles and became operational just last year.

Russian state TV host warns of World War III

Russian state TV host Olga Skabeyeva recently said that Russia is now ""fighting against NATO infrastructure, if not NATO itself,"" according to The Independent.

""Many are saying, 'Could it not be done more quickly?' Everyone wants it to happen more quickly,"" Skabeyeva said on the Rossiya 1 television channel. ""Everyone would like a conclusive victory. Everyone would like all the objectives set to be implemented.""



“Otherwise, on the whole, it's impossible to accept the special operation which we started – Russia’s special operation in Ukraine,"" she continued.

""One can safely call what it has escalated into World War III,"" she said on Russian state-owned TV. ""That's absolutely for sure.""

“Right now, we’re definitely fighting against NATO infrastructure, if not NATO itself. We need to recognize that,"" Skabeyeva added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/more-than-200-lawmakers-urge-supreme-court-to-uphold-louisiana-pro-life-law,2022-04-16
Mostly white college choir singing 'negro spirituals' spurs 'cultural appropriation' charges. But black professor who led performance isn't apologizing.,"A performance of ""negro spirituals"" by a mostly white vocal ensemble at Western Michigan University has elicited angry accusations of ""cultural appropriation"" — but the black guest professor who led last Wednesday's performance isn't apologizing, according to the Western Herald, WMU's student newspaper.

What are the details?

John Wesley Wright — who teaches at Salisbury University in Maryland — led the production of ""Spirituals: From Ship to Shore,"" which included songs black slaves sang in the 18th and 19th centuries, the paper said.

Wright said during the performance that the spirituals ""don't belong to one race"" and had become so entrenched in United States history and culture that they ""had no ethnicity"" and are ""American songs,"" the Herald reported, which cited ""multiple members of the majority white production and audience.""



That set off WMU music student Shaylee Faught, who attended the performance and called Wright's comments ""ignorant,"" the paper said.

In fact, Faught posted video of the performance to Twitter — along with her reaction to it. (Content warning: Language):

A second clip shows Faught frowning as the ensemble sings ""Wade in the Water"":

""So apparently Western Michigan University thinks it's OK for white [people] to sing negro spirituals while the instructor talking 'bout 'these songs don't belong to one race.' They sure as hell DO,"" she wrote.

Faught sent an email to WMU's dean, the dean of fine arts, the board of trustees, the director of the school of music, and the office for diversity and inclusion venting her outrage, WKZO radio reported.

""While I understand the importance of education, I think there is a fine line between appreciation and appropriation, and the concert last night seemed very inappropriate,"" part of her email said, according to the station.

""As a black woman, Negro Spirituals are [a part] of my history and my culture, and it signifies the struggle and hardships my ancestors went through. The way the program last night was portrayed is that it is all fun and games and is merely entertainment,"" she added, WKZO said.

Faught also asked for a public apology from the school of music, said Wright should never come back to WMU, and insisted that students should be consulted the next time a similar show is planned in order to avoid insensitivities, the station said.

The professor responds

Wright told the Herald that he's not apologizing: ""I do not feel the need to have to defend what I'm doing, and I've done this for 30 years and to great response.""

He also questioned Faught's motives and wondered if she had been ""investigated,"" the paper said, adding that a mentor of his questioned her mental health.

Wright came to WMU on residency after Ken Prewitt, a WMU voice professor, invited him last year, the Herald reported. Wright arrived in Kalamazoo on Valentine's Day to prepare the choirs for the Feb. 19 show, the paper added.

Prewitt told the Herald that Wright is ""one of the premiere people for this kind of presentation"" and declined further comment.

More students speak out

According to one of the vocalists, some of the songs performed weren't part of the original program, the paper said.

Kayla Lawson, who is black, told the Herald that Wright added songs like ""Wade in the Water"" and ""Walking Up With My Mind on Freedom"" at the last minute: ""We prepared all the other stuff but [Wright] randomly pulled that out and had us sing it, and we had no idea that was happening. He just told us to start singing to make a point.""

Allison Rousseau also sang in the show and told the paper she had mixed feelings but went ahead with the songs, the paper said: ""Our instructor was African-American, and he said it was okay because the songs aren't just [black] culture.""

But she added to the Herald that ""it was just so conflicting to be a part of that. I'm upset that I didn't say something before because I didn't know how many people felt the same way that I did.""

However, another black student who was part of the show told the paper that Wright was on the mark.

""I don't think that much needs to have been done differently,"" Tre Bryant told the Herald. ""Dr. Wright did his due diligence of educating the audience and performers of what they were doing and what the songs meant.""

Bryant added to the paper that the spirituals have evolved and have become part of the larger language of music, such as in blues, rock, and jazz — but that everyone should know their origins, which is why Wright called the songs ""for everyone.""

""We cannot expect people of other races to truly understand what our people had to go through and the songs they sang just to make it through the day if we are not willing to allow them to learn, and that's what this was meant to be,"" Bryant told the Herald.

But audience member DeUnique Dorris — director of outreach for WMU's Black Student Union — told the paper Wright's comments were ill-conceived given the ethnicity of the singers: ""The teacher wasn't acknowledging the history when he's saying it's for everyone. Yeah, it's for everyone to hear, but it takes away the meaning when it's from a mostly white cast.""

In fact, the BSU demanded an apology and called the performance appalling and ""another example of racial insensitivity allowed on WMU's campus,"" the Herald said.



WMU's Student Association added, ""We stand with Shaylee Faught and the students who experience the insidious nature of cultural appropriation. Their experience is characteristic of a lack of accountability to student concerns. When the director is more concerned with investigating the mental health of a student rather than empathetically responding to concerns of students, it further illustrates that student's voices do not matter. We do not and will not tolerate these inappropriate responses,"" the paper said.

What did the university have to say?

The school called Wright's comments about Faught ""unfortunate,"" the Herald said, and that ""the student's perspective is real and is important, without a doubt.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/more-than-450000-acres-of-land-purchased-by-a-billionaire-funded-conservation-organization,2020-02-26
"Mother and boyfriend abused 8-year-old daughter to death, drove halfway across the country with her corpse in trailer to 'spend more time with her,' police say","Various law enforcement bodies across the country are coordinating with one another after a couple was arrested in South Dakota for allegedly driving around with the corpse of the woman's daughter in tow and never reporting the girl's death to police.

On December 14, police in Mitchell, South Dakota, apprehended Mandie Miller, 33, and her boyfriend, Aleksander Kurmoyarov, 28, after a local medical examiner called police to make a disturbing report. Someone had called the office of the Davison County Coroner claiming to have driven into the area from Airway Heights, Washington, with ""their deceased daughter."" Police then located Mitchell and Kurmoyarov in Mitchell and reportedly discovered the remains of Miller's 8-year-old adopted daughter in a coffin in the back of a ""U-Haul tow-behind trailer."" The couple had been in the state for four days when they were arrested.

When questioned, Miller and Kurmoyarov gave conflicting reports regarding the circumstances of the girl's death, police said. Kurmoyarov allegedly told them that the girl had died ""a little before Halloween 2022,"" while Miller claimed she had died on September 10. Kurmoyarov also allegedly added that the couple had never reported the girl's death to the authorities because they ""wanted to spend more time with her"" and feared that they might ""get in trouble."" The two never sought medical attention for the girl, the Mitchell police report stated.

Mitchell police arrested the couple and charged them each with one count of failure to notify law enforcement of a child's death. Mitchell PD also contacted police in Airway Heights and Spokane, which had issued a no-bond warrant for the couple for homicide by abuse. The couple remain detained in South Dakota on charges from both states. Whether federal authorities have intervened in this case remains unknown.

At this point, it is unclear whether Miller or Kurmoyarov will face extradition to Washington. Failure to report a child's death in South Dakota is a Class 5 felony, which carries a sentence of up to five years and $10,000. Homicide by abuse in Washington is a Class A felony, which carries a maximum sentence of at least 20 years and $50,000.



Police in Washington say they have also coordinated with the Spokane Tribal Police Department, and the couple claimed that their ultimate destination was the Pine Ridge Native American reservation in South Dakota. Whether Miller and/or Kurmoyarov claim membership in a federally recognized indigenous tribe remains unclear. It is also possible that the deceased girl could have had a tribal affiliation.

It is also strange that the couple said they planned to drive to the reservation since the reservation is located in the southwestern corner of South Dakota, while Mitchell is located approximately 270 miles east. In other words, if the couple had intended to drive to the reservation, then they drove four and a half or five hours out of their way. Kurmoyarov also appears to be wearing a wedding ring in the booking photo, but police reports indicate that he and Miller are not married.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/moskva-warship-russia-ukraine-neptune-missle,2022-12-16
'Move! Not telling y'all again': Employee fired after viral video suggests she poured water on homeless person sitting outside convenience store on freezing cold day,"An employee in Baton Rouge is now out of a job and facing a misdemeanor summons after her boss claimed that she was the person who poured water on a homeless person in a social media video that has since gone viral.

The video, taken on December 26, shows a woman believed to be Kasey Young marching out of the Triple S Food Mart where she then worked. In her hand was a bucket full of water. She then walked over to an unnamed homeless woman, who was sitting on a curb in front of the store, and dumped the bucket of water over the woman's head.

""Move! Not telling y'all again,"" the woman believed to be Young can be heard saying. ""Move it! Clean this s*** the f*** up. I'm sick of this s***.""

""Y'all got my whole f****ing floor looking like a ..."" she says as she reenters the store, her voice trailing off.

The voice of an unidentified male, ostensibly the person filming the incident, can likewise be heard, and several homeless people can be seen milling about the parking lot, which is covered with trash. The weather that day was a bitter 26 degrees Fahrenheit.



The victim seen in the video has received ""additional services,"" according to a statement from Baton Rouge Mayor Sharon Weston Broome. The statement did not specify the types of services she received, but they likely included medical treatment and perhaps temporary housing.

A Facebook account named Beautiful young posted the video the day the incident occurred. The hashtag ""dontlisten"" is listed as the message. Conflicting reports have listed Young's age as either 33 or 44. If Beautiful young is, indeed, Kasey Young, her age is likely closer to 33. Young has reportedly been issued a misdemeanor summons for simple battery.

Another store employee has since come to Young's defense, claiming that Young often volunteers with the homeless. She just lost her temper on that particular day, the employee insisted.

However, the owner of the store, Abdullah Muflahi, immediately fired Young, despite the rampant homelessness problem that has plagued the store for some time.

""When I got the news, I didn’t speak to the employee too much,"" Muflahi said. ""All I told her was to leave the property because we do not handle situations like that.""

When given the choice, she should have done ""anything but what she did,"" he added.

This is the second time in recent years Muflahi's store has made national news. In 2016, police shot and killed Alton Sterling in the parking lot of the Triple S Food Mart. Muflahi filmed the fatal shooting and afterwards filed a lawsuit against the City of Baton Rouge, the chief of police, and others, alleging police misconduct. The status of that lawsuit remains unclear.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mostly-white-college-choir-singing-negro-spirituals-spurs-cultural-appropriation-charges-but-black-professor-who-led-performance-isnt-apologizing,2022-12-28
Movies featuring Keanu Reeves were removed from Chinese streaming platforms after the movie star appeared at a charity benefit for Tibet,"One of Hollywood’s most lovable movie stars may now be blacklisted from the world’s largest film market as Chinese streaming platforms remove movies and other video content featuring Keanu Reeves after the actor appeared at a fundraiser hosted by a nonprofit affiliated with the Dalai Lama.

In early March, according to the Los Angeles Times, the “John Wick” and “Matrix” star participated in a benefit concert hosted by the New York-based nonprofit Tibet House. Reeves’s presence and role in the benefit concert appears to have angered Chinese censors as one Chinese streaming platform, Tencent Video, has scrubbed nearly 20 movies featuring Reeves from its catalog.

Tibet House is a nonprofit that — according to its website — was founded “at the request of His Holiness the Dali Lama” and is “dedicated to preserving Tibet’s unique culture at a time when it is confronted with extinction on its own soil.”

The Chinese Communist Party rejects the notion of Tibetan independence and views the Dali Lama — a Nobel Prize laureate — as a dangerous “separatist” as he continues to advocate for the geopolitical independence of Tibet and an end to Chinese rule over the region.

Reeves’s role in the Tibet House fundraiser came to light shortly after his latest film “The Matrix: Resurrections” debuted in Chinese cinemas. Chinese nationalists, however, were enraged by Reeves’s participation in this fundraiser and vowed to boycott the film after taking to government-sanctioned social media sites to lob insults at the actor.

In response to what the Chinese government perceived as Reeves snubbing China, last Monday China’s major streaming companies removed the “vast majority” of his filmography from their catalogs and “wiped search results related to his name in Chinese.”

When users ran searches for “Keanu Reeves,” which in translates to “Jinu Liweisi” on the streaming platform iQiyi, users are told: “Sorry, no results related to ‘Keanu Reeves’ were found. Due to relevant laws, regulations and policies, some results are not shown.”

Beloved movies like “The Matrix” trilogy and “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure” as well as some of Keanu’s romantic movies like “Something’s Gotta Give” and “The Lake House” have been removed from Chinese streaming platforms.

Alex Yu, a researcher at the U.S.-based China Digital Times, said, “It’s a curious case that’s worth following. We tend to think of the censorship machine in China as this really coordinated monster, but the fact that we’re seeing these conflicting signals [between the online and theatrical markets] suggest that some of these measures come from different places.”

He added, “Why all of a sudden did they decide to take this measure at this exact moment?”

Reeves un-personing by Chinese censors adds him to the ever-growing list of celebrities who are unwelcome in China after expressing support for Tibet. This list includes Richard Gere, Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga, and, until recently, Brad Pitt.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mother-and-boyfriend-allegedly-abused-daughter-to-death,2022-03-26
Rachel Maddow slapped with $10 million lawsuit over 'paid Russian propaganda' accusations,"MSNBC and host Rachel Maddow are facing a lawsuit over her comments against a news network she accused of being a ""paid Russian propaganda"" outlet.

Maddow made the claims against OAN, the One America Network, which filed the $10 million lawsuit.

""One America is wholly owned, operated and financed by the Herring family in San Diego. They are as American as apple pie,"" said OAN attorney Skip Miller.

""They are not paid by Russia and have nothing to do with the Russian government,"" he added. ""This is a false and malicious libel, and they're going to answer for it in a court of law.""

The complaint was filed against Maddow, MSNBC and also Comcast Corporation and NBC Universal Media.

They allege that Comcast committed ""anti-competitive censorship"" against the network because their conservative worldview was in conflict with the liberal values of their progressive network, MSNBC.

OAN has garnered attention after President Donald Trump issued several complaints against Fox News that it was biased against him.

""The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down!"" the president tweeted in August.

""We have to start looking for a new News Outlet,"" he added. ""Fox isn't working for us anymore!""

Fox News host Neil Cavuto fired back a scathing response, saying, ""Mr. President, we don't work for you.

""I don't work for you,"" he added. ""My job is to cover you, not fawn over you or rip you, just cover you. Call balls and strikes. Our job is to keep score, not settle scores.""

MSNBC's Katy Tur gets testy over President Trump being 'flanked by stern white military men' while addressing nation about Iran,"MSNBC anchor Katy Tur opened her Wednesday afternoon show with a noticeably testy tone concerning President Donald Trump's White House address to the nation on hostilities between the United States and Iran.

""We are asking once again, 'Where is the evidence?'"" Tur queried in a clipped tone, a reference to Trump's assertion that bloodthirsty Iranian Gen. Qaseem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. military airstrike because he was an imminent threat to the U.S.

'Stern white military men'

Tur then saw fit to call attention to the race and gender and even the apparent mood of the Joint Chiefs of Staff standing behind Trump — and with a still snippier tone, particularly when she described their skin color.

""Flanked by stern white military men, the president addressed the world this morning, following Iran's attack on military bases housing American soldiers last night,"" she said.

Oh, the rudeness of it all

If Tur's previous observations weren't irrelevant enough, she also seemed put off that the president didn't, er, offer his audience a proper greeting: ""He began not by saying, 'Good morning,' but by demanding that Iran must not be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. He once again asserted, without evidence, that Qaseem Soleimani was planning an attack on American lives — an imminent attack.""

NewsBusters noted her continued point-by-point takedown of Trump: ""And he also called on NATO to intervene in the Middle East. He called for the international community to abandon the Iran nuclear deal. He blamed the Obama administration for the recent attacks. But he also appeared to back away from any further military conflict.""

Tur also said, according to the outlet: ""And considering the President walked us right up to the precipice of yet another war in the Middle East, the American people deserve to see that evidence as well, if it exists.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/movies-featuring-keanu-reeves-were-removed-from-chinese-streaming-platforms-after-the-movie-star-appeared-at-a-charity-benefit-for-tibet,2020-01-09
"Mueller report says Trump tried to get special counsel fired, but his own lawyer refused to comply","This story has been updated to include more details from the Mueller report

Special Counsel Robert Mueller said in his report that President Donald Trump once tried to have him fired, but White House Counsel Don McGahn refused to go through with the order.

Here's what we know

According to the report, when Mueller was first appointed in May 2017, Trump told his advisers that it would be ""the end of his presidency"" and tried to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign but later recanted and refused to accept his resignation. Trump also suggested that Mueller had conflicts of interest.

Mueller wrote that exactly a month later, on June 17, 2017, ""the President called McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General [Rod Rosenstein]"" — Sessions was still attorney general but had recused himself from the investigation — ""and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.""

The Saturday Night Massacre happened when former-President Richard Nixon's attorney general and deputy attorney general both resigned rather than comply with an order from the president to fire Watergate investigator Archibald Cox.

The report says that when the media reported that Trump was trying to end the investigation, Trump ""denied that he ever ordered McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated and made repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story""

McGahn left the Trump administration in late 2018.

Mueller said that Trump had also asked Corey Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, to pass on a message to Sessions telling him to limit the investigation. These messages also went undelivered, according to the report: ""Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President's message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.""

The report also details multiple occasions where Trump tried to get Sessions to ""reverse his recusal from the Russia investigation."" Sessions had recused himself from all matters related to the Trump campaign, since he had been a Trump campaign surrogate.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/msnbc-maddow-hit-with-lawsuit,2019-04-18
6-year-old boy found murdered in Georgia more than 20 years ago finally identified,"Last month, law enforcement agencies took a giant step forward in getting justice for a young boy found murdered in Decatur, Georgia 23 years ago. Thanks to the tireless efforts of a female tipster and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, law enforcement has finally been able to establish his identity.

His name was William DaShawn Hamilton, and he was just 6 years old when he died. The exact cause of death has not yet been reported.

A district attorney from Dekalb County, Georgia announced on June 13 that William's remains had been identified and that his mother, Teresa Ann Bailey Black, had been arrested in the case.

According to investigators, Black and William had been living in Charlotte, North Carolina until some time between 1998 and 1999, when Black ventured to Georgia with her son in tow. She eventually returned to North Carolina, but William was not with her. Police say at the time, she gave conflicting explanations for his disappearance, but police didn't believe they had enough evidence to arrest her.

Meanwhile, a woman identified only as ""Ava,"" who claims she knew both Black and used to take care of William back in Charlotte, always felt uneasy about the missing boy, and she conducted her own investigation to find him. She said she searched for him ""every day.""

""Every day, it was, like, my job to find him,"" she said.

Georgia Cold Case Solved After 23 Years www.youtube.com





Ava finally stumbled upon a rendering of a murdered boy in Georgia and called authorities to suggest he might be the boy she once knew, William DaShawn Hamilton.

“This case is a perfect example of why we never give up hope,” said Angeline Hartmann, Director of Communications at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. “For more than two decades, a woman in Charlotte followed her gut feeling that something wasn’t right. She made phone calls, scoured the internet and talked to anybody who would listen. We’re grateful she never stopped until she found that rendering of William online and gave investigators the missing piece to help solve this 23-year-old mystery. A huge thank you to the Dekalb County District Attorney’s Office, the Dekalb County Medical Examiner’s Office and Dekalb County Police for their hard work that brought us here today.”

Investigators used DNA testing to confirm the boy's identity.

Ava described William as an animated, active child who loved to dance and read.

“He liked to crack jokes,” said Ava. “He did like to draw a lot, color, mainly read books. He didn’t want you to read to him . . . he wanted to read to you.”

Teresa Ann Bailey Black, 45, has been charged with two counts of felony murder, two counts of cruelty to children, aggravated assault and concealing the death of another. She was arrested outside her home in Phoenix, Arizona and is awaiting extradition back to Georgia.

Musk says America 'harmed by having' Warren as senator,"Billionaire business magnate Elon Musk has suggested that America has ""been harmed by having"" Elizabeth Warren serve as a U.S. senator.

Musk, the CEO of Tesla, made the comment in response to news that the Democratic lawmaker from Massachusetts sent a letter to Tesla board chair Dr. Robyn Denholm, pressing her about how Musk's acquisition of Twitter and work running the social media platform is impacting the electric car maker.

""Mr. Musk's acquisition of Twitter and his simultaneous management of both Twitter and Tesla raise significant legal questions about conflicts of interest, compliance with labor laws, and misappropriation of corporate resources. As you know, it is the legal obligation of Tesla’s Board to ensure that its CEO is meeting all his legal responsibilities and serving as an effective leader. I am writing you so that I can better understand how you are dealing with these challenging circumstances so that I can evaluate current laws and current law enforcement in this area,"" Warren wrote in the letter.

""The United States has definitely been harmed by having her as a senator lol,"" Musk tweeted in response to a post by Farzad Mesbahi.

Mesbahi had tweeted, ""Elizabeth Warren is the last person I would ever want anywhere close to Tesla"" — he made the comment when retweeting another account which had tweeted, ""Elizabeth Warren has written a letter to Tesla’s board asking whether investors have been harmed by the billionaire tech mogul’s time running the social network, per NYT.""

Musk recently posted a poll asking people whether he should step down from the helm of Twitter — he indicated that he would abide by the outcome of the poll, and ultimately, a majority of the votes (57.5%) supported having Musk relinquish the reins at Twitter, while 42.5% of the votes supported having him remain in charge of the platform.

""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software & servers teams,"" Musk tweeted on Tuesday.

Last year, Musk referred to Warren as ""Senator Karen.""

Mutilated body of Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Danish Siddiqui discovered in Afghanistan after being left behind; Afghan general says Taliban likely culprit,"Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Danish Siddiqui is dead after having inadvertently been left behind in Afghanistan in July during an Afghan military retreat.



Reuters reports that Major-General Haibatullah Alizai and other soldiers say that Siddiqui was likely discovered and ultimately murdered by the Taliban.

Just three days ahead of Siddiqui's violent death, Reuters published an account of the late photographer's experience in Kandahar accompanying Afghan commandos in a rescue mission.

What are the details?

According to reports, Siddiqui, a 38-year-old Reuters photographer, was said to have been killed on July 16 along with two Afghan commandos after the military retreated in a fight to to take Spin Boldak, near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

Alizai, commander of the country's Special Operations Corps, and four other soldiers said that Siddiqui and the two commandos were reportedly mistakenly left behind ""after the soldiers believed the three already retreated.""

At least one mutilated body was reportedly discovered in Taliban custody, and reports soon emerged suggesting that neither Siddiqui nor the two commandos made it out of the town to safety after all.

Images of the late photojournalist's body reportedly began circulating on social media, and was ultimately identified and recovered after Reuters and Forensic Equity recognized the body as belonging to Siddiqui.

Forensic Equity ballistics expert Philip Boyce said that it was ""evident"" that Siddiqui was ""shot multiple further times after he was killed.""

Reuters added that other reports also claimed that Siddiqui's body, in addition to being shot and mutilated, was also run over by a vehicle.

A spokesman for the Taliban denies it had any role in Siddiqui's death.

""We can't say whose bullet hit Danish Siddiqui, and we had no prior information about him being in the area,"" the spokesman said.

Siddiqui leaves behind a wife and two young children.

According to The Hill, Siddiqui told his boss that he felt compelled to cover Afghanistan in the weeks leading up to the country's collapse.

""If we don't go, who will?"" he reportedly told his superiors ahead of departing to cover the terrorist-ravaged country.

Reuters stated that it completed a risk assessment before Siddiqui embedded with the country's Special Forces.

""Don't worry,"" he reportedly told a concerned friend. ""I know when to pull the plug.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/murdered-6-year-old-identified,2021-08-24
"Nancy Pelosi mocks pro-lifers, claims they believe life begins at 'candlelight dinner the night before'","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cruelly mocked Republicans and pro-life Americans on Wednesday for believing that life begins at conception.

Despite being a Catholic, Pelosi claimed at her weekly press conference that pro-life Republicans believe life begins ""at the candlelight dinner the night before.""

The California Democrat was responding to Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham's new bill that would institute a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Republicans have not been outwardly supportive of the bill for several reasons, including the sensitivity of the issue ahead of the midterm elections and because many Republicans truly believe abortion is an issue for states to decide.

Pelosi said the fractured response is evidence of ""conflict"" in the Republican Party.

""I think what you're seeing there is a conflict within the Republican Party. There are those in the party that think life begins at the candlelight dinner the night before,"" she said to laughter.

""And these people are in defiance of that, right?"" Pelosi continued. ""They're in defiance of that, because they're saying whatever they're saying about it. So that's what you're seeing there. But we are united in our support for women's right to choose.""

Pelosi's abortion advocacy reached a fever pitch earlier this year when it became clear the Supreme Court was going to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Just last month, for example, Pelosi declared that restricting abortion access is ""sinful.""

Because she is an ardent abortion advocate, San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore J. Cordileone announced in May that Pelosi can no longer receive Holy Communion in his diocese.

""Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi’s position on abortion has become only more extreme over the years, especially in the last few months,"" Cordileone wrote in a letter.

""After numerous attempts to speak with her to help her understand the grave evil she is perpetrating, the scandal she is causing, and the danger to her own soul she is risking, I have determined that the point has come in which I must make a public declaration that she is not to be admitted to Holy Communion unless and until she publicly repudiate her support for abortion 'rights' and confess and receive absolution for her cooperation in this evil in the sacrament of Penance,"" he explained.

The Catholic Church considers abortion a grave sin.

"Nancy Pelosi led a congressional delegation to meet with Zelenskyy in Ukraine, vows 'to be there for you until the fight is done'","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a congressional delegation to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, this weekend.

This trip makes Pelosi the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Ukraine during the ongoing Russian invasion. NBC News reported that to many, this trip came as a surprise and that it provided further evidence of the West’s growing support for Ukraine’s fight against Russia.

The trip comes as Russian forces continue to refocus their military campaign in the eastern regions of Ukraine and struggle to make any significant territorial gains, while Ukraine’s allies increase their material support of the invaded nation by sending increasing quantities of military supplies.

Despite the influx of material aid, the Ukrainian military is receiving, the Russians are not backing down as it appears that both sides of the conflict are preparing for the conflict to go on for longer.

During a meeting with Ukrainian officials, Pelosi said, “We are visiting you to say thank you for your fight for freedom. Your fight is a fight for everyone, and so our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done.”

Zelenskyy said he was “very grateful for this powerful signal of support.”

The Ukrainian president also said, “This shows that the United States today is a leader in strong support for Ukraine during the war against the aggression of the Russian Federation.”

Pelosi’s delegation consisted entirely of Congressional Democrats. It consisted of Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, Gregory Meeks from New York, and Adam Schiff from California.

The delegation’s trip marks the second major visit made by American officials to Ukraine in the month of April.

Earlier this month U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy to discuss U.S. aid to Ukraine. In their meeting, the diplomats told Zelenskyy that the U.S. was prepared to provide Ukraine with $300 million in military financing and had also approved a $165 million sale of ammunition, that was not made in the U.S., that would be compatible with Ukraine’s Soviet-era weaponry.

The U.S. and many of its European allies pledge to send shipments of defensive munitions to Ukraine to aid the country in warding off future Russian advances into the country.

Much like the surprise visits by the American delegations, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a meeting with Zelenskyy earlier this month where the two men discussed European sanctions on Russia and Great Britain’s commitment to supplying Ukraine with materials needed for defense.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mutilated-body-of-pulitzer-prize-winning-photojournalist-danish-siddiqui-discovered-in-afghanistan-afghan-officer-says-taliban-likely-culprit,2022-05-01
Senior NASA scientist pleads guilty to lying about China ties,"A senior NASA scientist pleaded guilty to lying about his participation in a Chinese program that recruits ""individuals with access to or knowledge of foreign technology or intellectual property.""

Meyya Meyyappan of Pacifica, California, pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements in a New York federal court on Wednesday. Meyyappan, 66, entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan federal court, the U.S. Department of Justice said Wednesday.

Meyyappan has been employed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration since 1996, and has been a ""chief scientist for Exploration Technology at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley"" since 2006, according to Meyyappan's profile on the NASA website. Previously, Meyyappan served as the director of the Center for Nanotechnology at Ames.

""Dr. Meyyappan is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Electrochemical Society (ECS), American Vacuum Society (AVS), Materials Research Society (MRS), Institute of Physics (IOP), American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), American Institute of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), National Academy of Inventors, and the California Council of Science and Technology,"" the space agency said.

In October, Meyyappan was interviewed by the FBI, the NASA Office of Inspector General, and the United States Attorney's Office.

""During that interview, Meyyappan falsely stated, among other things, that he was not a member of the Thousand Talents Program and that he did not hold a professorship at a Chinese university,"" the DOJ press release stated. ""In truth and in fact, Meyyappan was a member of the Thousand Talents Program and held a professorship at a Chinese university, funded by the Chinese government.""

The DOJ stated that Meyyappan ""participated in China's Thousand Talents Program, a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with access to or knowledge of foreign technology or intellectual property, and held professorships at universities in China, South Korea, and Japan, and failed to disclose these associations and positions to NASA and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.""

NASA OIG Special Agent in Charge Mark J. Zielinski stated, ""Certain NASA employees are required to disclose affiliations with foreign entities in order to protect NASA's intellectual property. Failure to do so could allow malicious foreign actors unauthorized access to American taxpayer funded technologies. We thank the FBI and the USAO, SDNY for their assistance throughout this investigation.""

Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said, ""Meyya Meyyappan held a trusted position at NASA, with access to valuable intellectual property. In violation of the terms of his employment and relevant laws and regulations, Meyyappan failed to disclose participation in a Chinese government recruitment program, and subsequently lied about it to NASA investigators, FBI agents, and our Office. Now, having admitted his crime, Meyyappan awaits sentencing.""

Meyyappan is scheduled to be sentenced on June 16, and faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.

In May, the DOJ announced that a former Cleveland Clinic employee had been arrested. Dr. Qing Wang ""lied to receive more than $3.6 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health while also collecting money for the same research from the Chinese government,"" NPR reported.

""It is also alleged that Dr. Wang participated in the Thousand Talents Program, a program established by the Chinese government to recruit individuals with access to or knowledge of foreign technology and intellectual property,"" the DOJ statement said.

In June, a prominent scientist at Harvard University was indicted by the Justice Department for lying to federal authorities about his participation in China's Thousand Talents Program.



Dr. Charles Lieber, the former chair of Harvard University's Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department, lied to the U.S. government about his position as ""Strategic Scientist"" at the Wuhan University of Technology in China, according to prosecutors. He was allegedly paid a salary of up to $50,000 a month to set up the laboratory for the Wuhan University of Technology, plus was allotted additional living expenses of up to $158,000.

Lieber has pleaded not guilty.

In July, the Department of Justice claimed that a NASA researcher and University of Arkansas professor had ties to the Chinese government. Simon Saw-Teong Ang, was indicted by a federal grand jury on 42 counts of wire fraud and two counts of passport fraud.

Court documents show that Ang had conversations with a researcher in China about his involvement in the Thousand Talents Program.

""Not many people here know I am [a Thousand talents program scholar] but if this leaks out, my job here will be in deep troubles,"" Ang reportedly wrote. ""I have to be very careful or else I may be out of my job from this university.""

FBI Director Chris Wray gave a speech at the Hudson Institute in July, where he delivered a warning about the Thousand Talents Program.

""Through its talent recruitment programs, like the so-called Thousand Talents Program, the Chinese government tries to entice scientists to secretly bring our knowledge and innovation back to China — even if that means stealing proprietary information or violating our export controls and conflict-of-interest rules,"" Wray said.

""The greatest long-term threat to our nation's information and intellectual property, and to our economic vitality, is the counterintelligence and economic espionage threat from China,"" Wray said during the speech. ""It's a threat to our economic security — and by extension, to our national security.""



In November 2019, the U.S. Senate released a report titled, ""Threats to the U.S. Research Enterprise: China's Talent Recruitment Plans,"" which outlined dangers presented by Chinese recruitment organizations, including the Thousand Talents Program.

Launched in 2008, the Thousand Talents Plan incentivizes individuals engaged in research and development in the United States to transmit the knowledge and research they gain here to China in exchange for salaries, research funding, lab space, and other incentives. China unfairly uses the American research and expertise it obtains for its own economic and military gain. In recent years, federal agencies have discovered talent recruitment plan members who downloaded sensitive electronic research files before leaving to return to China, submitted false information when applying for grant funds, and willfully failed to disclose receiving money from the Chinese government on U.S. grant applications.



China designed the Thousand Talents Plan to recruit 2,000 high-quality overseas talents, including scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and finance experts. The plan provides salaries, research funding, lab space, and other incentives to lure experts into researching for China. According to one report, by 2017, China dramatically exceeded its recruitment goal, having recruited more than 7,000 ""high-end professionals,"" including several Nobel laureates.

In December, a massive database of nearly 2 million registered Chinese Communist Party members was leaked to the public. The database breach reportedly gave insight into CCP members infiltrating western companies, including businesses in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nancy-pelosi-mocks-pro-life-republicans,2021-01-14
National Archives misses deadline to turn over info about possible 'political bias' in its handling of Biden document scandal,"The National Archives and Records Administration failed to meet the deadline to turn over documents to Congress relevant to an investigation into whether political bias played a role in its soft and quiet approach to President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents.

This failure comes amid concerns that the NARA may be providing deferential treatment to Biden, particularly when compared to how it approached a similar matter involving former President Donald Trump. After all, acting NARA head Debra Steidel Wall was reportedly one of the leading figures who triggered the FBI raid on Trump's residence over allegedly mishandled documents.

What is the background?

Committee Chair Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) wrote to acting Archivist Wall on Jan. 10 concerning ""a political bias"" at the NARA.

""For months, NARA failed to disclose to Committee Republicans or the American public that President Biden—after serving as Vice President—stored highly classified documents in a closet at his personal office. NARA learned about these documents days before the 2022 midterm elections and did not alert the public that President Biden was potentially violating the law,"" wrote Comer.

""Meanwhile, NARA instigated a public and unprecedented FBI raid at Mar-a-Lago—former President Trump’s home—to retrieve presidential records. NARA’s inconsistent treatment of recovering classified records held by former President Trump and President Biden raises questions about political bias at the agency,"" he added.

Comer noted that unlike in the case of Trump, whose residence was raided by armed FBI agents, no search warrant was executed after classified Obama-Biden administration documents were discovered to still be in Biden's possession. Instead, the president's attorneys ""quietly"" handled the situation with the Department of Justice.

Republicans on the committee wrote to NARA in August, stating, ""The seeming weaponization of the federal government against President Biden’s political rivals cannot go unchecked, and if NARA is working to further these efforts, it will be only the latest agency to lose its credibility in the eyes of the American people under the Biden Administration.""

Committee member Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.) echoed these statements in an op-ed this week, writing, ""We can see several systemic failures in oversight that have led to widespread deception,"" including ""the weaponization of a federal agency to hide information from Congress and using the power of the presidency to hide a story until after the midterms.""

The committee requested that, by no later than Jan. 24, NARA turn over all documents and communications:

between NARA and the White House related to classified documents at the Penn Biden Center;

between and among NARA employees related to such classified documents;

between NARA and the DOJ related to the documents; and

between NARA and any outside entity, including Biden's attorneys.

In his Jan. 10 letter, Comer also clarified that the ""Committee on Oversight and Accountability has specific jurisdiction over NARA under House Rule X.""

NARA comes up with nada

Jan. 24 came and went, but NARA did not provide the committee with any of the requested documents.

A committee spokesman told Axios, ""The National Archives has not produced the requested documents to the Committee at this time,"" adding that ""Chairman Comer's request still stands and anticipates moving forward with a transcribed interview with NARA’s general counsel soon.""



Committee Chair Rep. Comer told Newsmax that ""there's a problem with how the National Archives does things.""

Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, told Fox News Digital that the NARA has been ""far less prominent"" during the Biden scandal than during the DOJ's apparent Trump fault-finding mission, underscoring that it ""will need to be more transparent with Congress or risk contempt sanctions.""

Derrick Morgan, once staff secretary to Vice President Dick Cheney, suggested NARA's silence on Biden and aggressiveness towards Trump indicates a ""double standard.""

For its possible double standard, the NARA is now facing double scrutiny from both chambers of Congress.

Ahead of the NARA's failure to meet its deadline, Republican Sens. Ron Johnson (Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (Iowa) penned a letter to head archivist Debra Wall demanding ""full transparency regarding its involvement, knowledge and role with respect to the existence of these classified and unclassified documents.""

The letter cited various instances where the NARA previously declined to provide records that the Biden administration might otherwise want to keep under wraps, including records pertaining to the Biden family's ""financial dealings and potential conflicts of interest"" as well as records ""about then-Vice President Joe Biden's use of non-government email for government business, the transmission of government information to his son, Hunter Biden, and compliance with federal records laws.""

The Republican senators indicated they are conducting an ""objective review of NARA's involvement"" in these matters as well as its ""interactions relating to the discovery of records, including those marked classified"" found in Biden's homes and offices.

'Scientists and journalists failed in their duty': National security experts blast New York Times and mainstream journalists for dismissing COVID-19 lab origins,"A group of national security experts published a letter this week denouncing those in the mainstream media who downplayed, ignored, or outright denied the possibility that the COVID-19 virus originated in a Chinese communist lab in Wuhan.

The letter implicates news outlets like the New York Times and scientific journals such as the Lancet in an apparent campaign to censor or displace dissenting voices around the pandemic's origins.



Not only was journalists' and editors' failure to entertain the possibility that the Wuhan Institute of Virology — controlled by the genocidal Chinese regime and notorious for performing gain-of-function experiments on coronaviruses — a dereliction of duty, it ""served to hamper national and international policy discussions about how to mitigate against future pandemics of any origin — natural, accidental, or deliberate.""

Crystallizing public opinion

Forty-three national security experts, including House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul (R-Texas), former Defense Intelligence Agency acting Director David Shedd, former national security adviser Robert O'Brien, and a host of former State Department and National Security Council officials, signed a Jan. 11 letter addressed to the editors of the Lancet, Nature Medicine, the New York Times, and Time magazine.

""From the beginning of the crisis, when the information environment was undoubtedly contentious, divisive, and confusing, some editors and reporters of news organizations and scientific publications stifled debate on the origins of the virus,"" said the letter.

The national security experts noted, ""Some even leveled accusations of racism against those who sought in good faith to investigate whether the virus may have originated from a lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.""



New York Times global health and infectious diseases reporter Apoorva Mandavilli claimed in May 2021 that the lab-leak theory had ""racist roots"" and was not ""plausible.""

""Someday we will stop talking about the lab leak theory and maybe even admit its racist roots,"" she wrote. ""But alas, that day is not yet here.""

The letter notes that ideologically compromised journalists at the New York Times were not the only ones unwilling or unable to consider the possibility of a lab leak.

""Leading scientific journals censored dissenting voices; many science writers at major news outlets promoted narratives or asserted conclusions unsubstantiated by evidence; reporters failed to make even cursory attempts at surfacing potential conflicts of interest of their sources,"" said the letter.

These censorious and myopic efforts ""served to hamper national and international policy discussions about how to mitigate against future pandemics of any origin — natural, accidental, or deliberate.""

Failing America

The national security experts' letter noted that American security and prosperity depend upon ""rigorous scientific debate, research, and scholarship, as well as an intrepid and independent news media.""

Having failed in these regards, scientists and journalists who prematurely dismissed or stigmatized certain questions also ""failed in their duty.""

The letter's authors noted that the lab-leak theory has nevertheless survived these denunciations and dismissals to become widely recognized as a ""legitimate possible explanation for the emergence of the pandemic.""

The authors cite in their letter the June 9 World Health Organization Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens report and various governmental inquiries as examples of the growing mainstream realization that human meddling or human error may ultimately have been responsible for the deaths over over 15 million human beings worldwide.

Republican members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence concluded in their December interim report that it was ""plausible"" that Chinese military researchers possessed the COVID-19 virus ""as part of bioweapons research"" prior to its release into the world as a consequence of a safety incident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

The report also lent far greater credibility to the lab-leak theory, which some House Republicans indicated many government officials, Big Tech platforms, and media outlets were quick to label a 'conspiracy theory.'""

A Republican Senate report published in October reaffirmed that China's Wuhan Institute of Virology, where coronavirus gain-of-function experiments had been conducted for years, is the likely ""high-risk"" source of the virus.

While the lab-leak theory has aged well, the New York Times' February amplification of a study that did not survive peer review hasn't. The Times platformed the suggestion that the virus originated in the wet market and failed to provide an update when other data showed that claim wanting.

In light of new reports about the plausibility of the lab-leak theory, the Lancet's featured March 7 open letter claiming that all but the natural origins theory constituted ""misinformation"" has also aged poorly.

The authors of the Lancet letter wrote, ""We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.""

The national security experts' Jan. 11 letter calls for those who inadvertently worked to absolve the Chinese communist regime of possible guilt to be held accountable. Additionally it called on major news organizations ""to carry out deeper investigations into the pandemic's origins, particularly by examining all credible origins hypotheses.""

Nation's largest teachers union targets charter schools in 'policy playbook' for Biden-Harris administration,"The largest teachers union in the United States has released a ""policy playbook"" for the next Congress and presidential administration that calls for policies that will reduce school choice and oppose the expansion of charter schools.

The National Education Association in mid-November published a report titled, ""2020 NEA Policy Playbook for Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration,"" calling for former Vice President Joe Biden's presidential administration to pursue a wide-range of progressive policies aimed at consolidating education funding in the public school system.

""With a Biden-Harris administration, we have new opportunities to implement policies at the federal level that will benefit the lives of our students and educators locally,"" the NEA report states. ""New relief funding will help our schools overcome the immense hurdles created by COVID-19. Fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program will get educators the debt relief they were promised and ease the teacher shortage. Racial inequities caused by decades of unjust funding, white supremacy, and anti-immigration policies, will begin to be corrected.""

The report covers ""27 different issue areas for the Biden-Harris Administration and Congress to address."" Scholar Corey A. DeAngelis, the director of School Choice at the Reason Foundation, on Friday called attention to several policies in the report that oppose charter schools and school choice.

""Public education should be our first priority,"" the report states. ""Any program that diverts resources from the traditional public schools that 90 percent of American students attend by definition undermines the promise of public education.""

The NEA ""opposes for-profit management of public schools, which creates a conflict of interest and undermines the transparency required to maintain public accountability regarding school finances.""

They demand the following policies:

Oppose all charter school expansion that undermines traditional public schools.

Bar federal funding to charter schools, charter school authorizers, and charter school management companies not authorized or operated by local school districts.

Require charter schools, charter school authorizers, and charter school management companies to abide by the same laws and regulations applicable to traditional public schools.

The NEA also opposes ""the enactment of any new voucher program, including education savings accounts and tuition tax credit schemes, or the expansion of existing programs.""

""Vouchers divert scarce resources from public schools, while offering no countervailing benefits,"" the report says. ""Private schools can and do discriminate by denying admission on the basis of religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, citizenship status, English language proficiency, and disability. Using federal tax dollars to subsidize such discrimination is unconscionable.""

""These policies all protect the monopoly at the expense of families,"" DeAngelis tweeted.



The NEA also calls for $175 billion in additional federal emergency aid for schools in response to the coronavirus pandemic, passage of the HEROES Act or simular trillion-dollar stimulus legislation by Congress, and a nationwide mask mandate.

Further, the policies requested go well beyond education policy. The NEA declares support for single-payer health care; demands legal status for illegal immigrants; an immediate end to Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids; the reinstatement of an Obama-Biden administration anti-discrimination policy for transgender students; gun control measures including banning high-capacity magazines and outlawing private firearms sales; repealing the 2017 Trump tax cuts; and expanding voting rights for ex-felons and others.

""We need the federal government to return to its role of ensuring equal access to opportunity, protecting the most vulnerable, and investing in the future of society.""

"NATO and China showcase their latest killer drones, turning page on autonomous ground warfare","October was a big month for ground-based killer drones. The Royal Netherlands Army announced on Oct. 14 that it had begun armed robot trials, deploying four armed and unmanned tanks to Lithuania. China similarly showcased defense contractor Kestrel's ""combat dog"" system in an Oct. 3 video demonstrating the unmanned ground vehicle's carriage by aerial drone and ability to run with a light machine gun.

While UGVs are presently an unreliable supplement to flesh-and-blood ground forces, their development and growing capabilities may signal their future adoption as soulless substitutes.

A new breed of dog

A social media account affiliated with Chinese defense contractor Kestrel released a video earlier this month of an unmanned aerial vehicle dropping off a robotic four-legged dog equipped with what WarZone reported was possibly a Chinese QBB-97 light machine gun, capable of firing 650 rounds per minute.

A translation of the post in which the video first appeared on the Chinese micro-blog site Weibo said, ""War dogs descending from the sky ... Red Wing forward heavy-duty drones deliver combat robot dogs, which can be directly inserted ... behind the enemy to launch a surprise attack.""

The post also suggested that the UGV could ""be placed on the rooftops and work with troops on the ground to ambush enemies inside buildings.""

A longer version of the demonstration shows the Chinese UGV climbing stairs and performing simulated ground operations with human companions.

Kestrel Defense Blood-Wing | Military promotional video #3 youtu.be

The same Chinese defense firm also released a video revealing the doglike UGV's ability to carry a loitering munitions launcher.

Unmanned tanks

Armored UGVs are not unprecedented, but have historically been grossly ineffective.

Russia, for instance, deployed its semi-autonomous Uran-9 tanks in Syria in 2016, which proved to be more trouble than they were worth. The technology is, however, improving.

Janes reported that the Royal Netherlands Army became the first Western military to start operational trials with UGVs.

Lt. Col. Sjoerd Mevissen explained that the four Tracked Hybrid Modular Infantry Systems tanks that were deployed with the Netherlands' 13th Light Brigade to Lithuania last month ""have been handed over for experimental use in an operational unit in a military-relevant environment.""

""These are not simply tests on a training ground,"" said Mevissen. ""We are under the direct eyes and ears of the Russians, and as such in a semi-operational environment.

The THeMIS tank's various capabilities are showcased in this video:

General Dynamics announced on Oct. 4 that it would be unveiling the AbramsX, a modified version of the Abrams battle tank. Although it will not be a fully unmanned vehicle, General Dynamics indicated that it will have a ""reduced crew size and AI-enabled lethality, survivability, mobility, manned/unmanned teaming ... and autonomous capabilities.""

Remote-controlled terrors

Killer drones have long been a feature of modern combat. Unmanned aerial vehicles have been on the scene since the 1990s. The Guardian reported that one of their first impactful deployments was in the 1999 Kosovo war, when they were used to identify hidden Serbian positions.

Slate reported that in January 2001, the U.S. armed a Predator drone for the first time, equipping it with a laser-seeker and a Hellfire air-to-ground missile. Several months later, after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, the U.S. recorded its first drone kill when, on Nov. 14, 2001, a Predator-launched Hellfire missile obliterated al Qaeda's Mohammed Atef and six of his terrorist allies.

Drones have been shown to be capable of hitting hard and airborne targets as well.

The first UAV air-to-air kill was recorded in 2017, when a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone shot down another with an infrared guided air-to-air missile, but by then drones were already ubiquitous.

This year, hundreds of lightweight U.S. Switchblades have been deployed in Ukraine, where they have been used to strike small targets.

Janes indicated that by 2030, over 80,000 surveillance drones and nearly 2,000 attack drones will have been purchased. A 2019 estimate indicated that the biggest purchaser of combat drones over the next decade would be the United States, with over 1,000 prospective purchases. China was a distant second, looking to acquire only 68 drones.

With tensions rising between the U.S. and both China and Russia, as well as smaller international conflicts, those estimates may prove conservative.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/national-security-experts-blast-new-york-times-and-mainstream-journalists-for-dismissing-covid-19-lab-origins,2022-10-28
NATO Response Force deployed for first time in response to Russian invasion of Ukraine,"For the first time in the history of the alliance, NATO has activated part of its 40,000-troop strong response force to secure member nations near the borders of the Russian-Ukraine war.

At a press conference announcing the unprecedented deployment of troops, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned Friday that ""the Kremlin's objectives are not limited to Ukraine.""



""We are deploying [the NRF] to ... prevent any miscalculations, any misunderstandings that we are not ready to protect and defend all our allies,"" Stoltenberg said. ""This is something that all allies have agreed to do.""

NATO Response Force troops will deploy ""on land, at sea, and in the air"" in eastern Europe for the purpose of collected defense, Axios reports.

The secretary general explained that while the size of the NRF has tripled since 2014, not all of its forces would be deployed. He also said that NATO countries would be providing Ukraine with arms and air-defense systems at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government.

Stoltenberg told reporters that the eastern flank allies ""are extremely concerned"" with the events unfolding in Ukraine.

""They are close to the fighting in Ukraine, and they also border Russia, and they've seen not only the military buildup and the ongoing war in Ukraine, but also seen the very threatening rhetoric because this goes far beyond Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg said.

""Russia's attack on Ukraine is more than an attack on Ukraine. It's a devastating horrendous attack on innocent people in Ukraine, but it's also an attack on the whole European security order. And that's the reason why we take it so extremely seriously,"" he added.

U.S. President Joe Biden has also deployed troops to eastern Europe to secure NATO countries bordering the conflict. The president has made clear that these troops are being deployed as a defensive measure, and they will not be sent into Ukraine to engage with Russian forces.

NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod Wolters said the activation of response forces was ""historic"" in a statement.



""This is an historic moment and the very first time the Alliance has employed these high readiness forces in a deterrence and defense role. They represent a flexible, combat credible force that can be employed in multiple ways and we are utilizing fully their inherent agility,"" Wolters said. ""These deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect.""

In a statement released Friday morning, Zelenskyy thanked NATO for its support but requested more from the alliance to defend against the Russian invaders.

""We are alone in defending our country. Who is ready to defend us together with us? Honestly, I don't see any,"" Zelensky said. ""Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of joining NATO? Honestly, everyone is afraid.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nations-largest-teachers-union-targets-charter-schools-in-policy-playbook-for-biden-harris-administration,2022-02-25
NBA coach Steve Kerr brings up AR-15s to deflect question about Chinese human rights,"Steve Kerr, head coach of the NBA's Golden State Warriors and an assistant coach for Team USA, brought up AR-15s and mass shootings in response to a question about Chinese human rights Thursday.

NBA players, coaches, and team executives have been bombarded with questions about China and the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong since last week, when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey sparked a conflict between China and the NBA with a tweet supportive of Hong Kong.

A reporter asked Kerr if he had been asked about Chinese human rights abuses during previous trips he has taken to China for basketball reasons.

""No. Nor has our record of human rights abuses come up either,"" Kerr responded. ""People in China didn't ask me about, you know, people owning AR-15s and mowing each other down in a mall. The world is a complex place and there's more gray than black and white.""

Of course, Kerr's reasons for not wanting to discuss human rights abuses in China likely have nothing to do with the fact that mass murders happen in the United States. His reticence to criticize China is, like everyone else in the NBA, tied to how much money the league will lose if the Chinese government severs ties.



In response to Morey's tweet, the Chinese government has already taken some NBA preseason games off state television and shut down some NBA-related media events. The Chinese Basketball League has suspended its relationship with the Houston Rockets.

Human rights abuses aside, the NBA is very much in bed with China financially. USA Today reported that a conservative estimate puts NBA revenue from China at $500 million. NBA China, a business arm of the NBA, is valued at $5 billion, according to the Sports Business Journal.

The league's biggest stars travel to China every year to sell shoes and apparel for companies like Nike and Under Armour, and other league stars have major endorsement deals with Chinese companies. The bottom line is, if the NBA loses China, everyone in the NBA loses money.

The NBA and its stars have no problem speaking up on social justice and human rights in America — which is important, and they should continue to do so. However, watching those same stars squirm and deflect when asked about justice for people resisting communism in China exposes that they're only willing to speak up when the cost isn't too high.

NBA superstar says basketball 'is just not the most important thing to me right now.' So what's taken over as playoffs start? Israel-Gaza fighting.,"NBA superstar Kyrie Irving is getting paid north of $33 million to play for the Brooklyn Nets this season.

And with fellow superstar teammates James Harden and Kevin Durant also making a killing in the hopes of taking the Nets all the way to the NBA championship next month, one might think the Brooklyn brass is assuming Irving has his game in the forefront of his mind.

If only.

What is more important than basketball right now to Irving?

After the Nets' 105-91 win over the Chicago Bulls on Saturday, Irving said basketball wasn't quite hitting his radar at the moment, ESPN reported. Irving scored 22 points in the Nets' win.

""I'm not going to lie to you guys, a lot of stuff is going on in this world, and basketball is just not the most important thing to me right now,"" he told reporters, according to the sports network. ""There's a lot of things going on overseas. All our people are still in bondage across the world, and there's a lot of dehumanization going on.

""So I apologize if I'm not going to be focused on y'all's questions. It's just too much going on in the world for me to just be talking about basketball,"" Irving added. ""I focus on this most of the time, 24/7, but it's just too much going on in this world not to address. It's just sad to see this s**t going on. It's not just in Palestine, not just in Israel. It's all over the world, and I feel it. I'm very compassionate to it — to all races, all cultures, and to see ... a lot of people being discriminated against based on their religion, color of their skin, what they believe in. It's just sad,"" ESPN said.

The sports network said the Nets superstar made ""multiple references to the ongoing violence"" between Israelis and Hamas during his chat with the media.

""I don't care which way you stand on — either side,"" Irving said, according to ESPN. ""If you're a human being, then you support the anti-war effort. There's a lot of people losing their lives — children, a lot of babies, and that's just what I'm focused on. So if you guys want to ask me questions about the game, I really don't care about it except for everyone leaving the game healthy and being able to go home to their families.""

On Sunday, the Nets (48-24) clinched the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference with a 123-109 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, the sports network said.



Here are ESPN's Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman reacting to Irving's comments:

Anything else?



The sports network said Irving was fined earlier this month for violating the NBA's media access rules — and was asked Saturday about maintaining a balance between basketball and social issues important to him.

""It's a job,"" Irving replied, according to ESPN. ""I was raised as a survivor. My family comes from practically the bottom in the South Bronx. They came out of some extreme conditions. I'm the product of a lot of sacrifice. ... It's a unique balance because you're on a platform or industry that — a lot of people that are around it or surviving it don't really get a chance to say what they believe in, or they have to play it safe, or they have to worry about money, or they have to worry about what people are saying. I just think you can't be afraid to say what you believe in. It's not about consuming information or trying to be right or politically correct. It's about doing what God intends us all to do — that's to stand on the good word of treating everyone with respect, compassion and love.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nato-response-force-deployed-for-first-time-in-response-to-russian-invasion-of-ukraine,2021-05-17
NBC News gets torched for giving vague rationale after pulling report with bizarre details on Paul Pelosi attack,"NBC News was criticized heavily after first publishing a report with new information about the attack on Paul Pelosi, then pulling that report, and offering a strange rationale hours later.

The husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was attacked by a man with a hammer, but the strange circumstances around the incident sparked many conspiracy theories and other speculation.

On Friday, NBC News national correspondent Miguel Almaguer went viral with new reporting that said the victim had not told police it was an emergency when they arrived and did not step away from the assailant.

""Sources familiar with what unfolded in the Pelosi residence [are] now revealing when officers responded to the 'high priority call,' they were seemingly unaware they've been called to the home of the speaker of the House,"" Almaguer reported.

""After a 'knock and announce,' the front door was opened by Mr. Pelosi,"" he added. ""The 82-year-old did not immediately declare an emergency or try to leave his home but instead began walking several feet back into the foyer toward the assailant and away from police. It's unclear if the 82-year-old was already injured or what his mental state was, say sources.""

He went on to say that the suspect hit Pelosi with a hammer in full view of the police, who rushed in to tackle him as the victim fell and was found lying in a pool of his own blood.

Very soon after, NBC pulled the report from its social media and its website.

In its place, the editors left a message.

""This piece has been removed from publication because it did not meet NBC News reporting standards,"" it read.

Critics pounced on the story to excoriate NBC News for the bizarre episode.

""Put the conspiracies to bed already - release the 911 and body cam tapes,"" responded Michael Smerconish of Sirius.

""I mean… really?"" replied Megyn Kelly.

""This story is more of a scandal than MSM is letting on… too many inconsistencies and fake news,"" tweeted author Jennifer Theriot.

""This is getting weirder by the day. Conflicting stories left and right. We’ll never know the truth,"" said another critic.

Police arrested the suspect and identified him as 42-year-old David DePape, an illegal alien from Canada. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital after receiving surgery for his fractured skull. The Canadian was charged with elder abuse, attempted homicide, assault with a deadly weapon, and burglary.

Conflict of interest? New report reveals NBC's Chuck Todd was Democrat Amy Klobuchar's landlord,"NBC's Chuck Todd helped moderate Wednesday night's debate despite having once had a financial relationship with one of the Democratic candidates on stage. According to the New York Post's Page Six, Todd was once Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar's landlord in Virginia.

According to the Post's report, Klobuchar and her husband, attorney John Bessler, once rented a three-bedroom home from Todd in Arlington, an affluent city located near Washington, D.C.

A source told the Post that although the couple began renting the house from Todd in 2008, they no longer live at the residence, and it is unclear when they moved out.

'$3,200/month'

A 2008 report by the Star Tribune said that Klobuchar and her husband rented the house for ""$3,200/month, plus utilities."" The Star Tribune noted that, ""Before moving in May to provide more room for 'visiting grandparents,' Klobuchar and her family rented a two-bedroom apartment in northern Virginia for $2,800 a month.""

At a rate of $3,200 per month, it means that, presumably, Klobuchar and Bessler paid Todd up to $38,400 per year.

The article also stated that the couple kept their home in Minnesota, but that she would commute to Washington on weekdays for work. According to online listings of the home, it has 3.5 bathrooms and is approximately 3,000 square feet. It is unclear if Todd still owns the house.

'Not disclosed publicly'

Although D.C. insiders were aware that Klobuchar was Todd's tenant — including while appearing on his various television shows — a source told the Post that their financial relationship had not been publicly disclosed.

IRS revokes North Carolina NAACP tax-exempt status,"The IRS removed the North Carolina NAACP’s tax-exempt status on May 15 after the organization failed to file tax returns for three consecutive years. The IRS also reported that many local NAACP branches across the state had their tax-exempt status revoked for the same reason.



Any organizations that fail to report taxes for three consecutive years are automatically placed on the IRS’s Auto-Revocation List.

The News & Observer broke the story this week, revealing that the North Carolina chapter has faced several conflicts within the last several years, including disciplinary action from the national organization.

A Raleigh tax attorney and former IRS associate chief counsel, Jack Cummings, told the N&O that NC NAACP’s income will be taxed moving forward and that failing to file additional returns could result in fines.

The news outlet reported that experts said the revocation could hinder the NC NAACP’s ability to fundraise.

In 2019, the national organization placed the North Carolina chapter under an “administratorship” because of financial mismanagement allegations. The administratorship removed power from local leaders and handed it over to the national organization.

Former NC NAACP president Rev. Anthony Spearman was accused of failing to provide necessary records and financial documents to his successor. Because of this, the national organization removed Spearman from his position and ordered him to provide the new president with the documents.

Before his death, Spearman wrote to the national organization’s CEO, Derrick Johnson, in December 2020. He accused the national NAACP of unjustifiably removing decision-making power from North Carolina local leaders.

Spearman stated that the administratorship placed doubt in the minds of key financial supporters, causing a dip in donations to the organization.

In a February meeting, Gerald Givens Jr., the NC NAACP’s treasurer, revealed troublesome financial findings to national leaders. The N&O reported that Givens shared a “strictly confidential” presentation that exposed eight years of “very problematic” payment patterns at the NC NAACP.

Givens stated that there was possible evidence of “misappropriation of funds on multiple levels” totaling more than $1 million.

The national organization appointed a new executive director to the North Carolina chapter, Da’Quan Love. In a WRAL interview, Love stated that he had been hired to audit the NC NAACP’s finances.

Love said, “The national NAACP has launched a financial audit, a full financial, multi-year audit of the state conference as well as all the branches in the state of North Carolina to rectify these issues and get to the bottom of these challenges and ensure that this does not happen again and we’re in good financial standing.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nbc-paul-pelosi-story-retraction,2022-09-02
"Nearly 100 members of Congress could have conflict of interest from financial trades, analysis finds","A new analysis by The New York Times has found that at least 97 current members of Congress or their immediate families bought or sold stock, bonds, or other financial assets that “intersected with their congressional work.”

Members of Congress are not banned from investing in any company, including those that could be affected by their roles as lawmakers. Numerous congressmen have come under increased scrutiny in recent years for their financial windfalls. Some members have been proven to be such astute traders that analysts have created severalexchange-traded funds mirroring the personal portfolios of members of Congress.

The New York Times’ analysis reveals numerous trades that demonstrate, at the very least, curious timing.

For example, the wife of Representative Alan Lowenthal (D-Calif.) sold Boeing shares on March 5, 2020 — one day before a committee on which Lowenthal sits released damaging findings on Boeing’s handling of its 737 Max jet, which was involved in two fatal crashes.

The report shows this is an entirely bipartisan issue, identifying 47 Democrats and 49 Republicans. Bob Gibbs (R-Ohio), who serves on the House Oversight Committee, bought shares of the pharmaceutical company AbbVie in 2020 and 2021 — while his committee was investigating AbbVie over drug prices.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has faced numerous allegations regarding the trading activities of her husband, Paul, was not identified as one of the 97 members in The New York Times’ report. Because the Times’ analysis focused on committee membership, Pelosi, who does not sit on legislative committees, was not included as part of the analysis.

Some members of Congress have called for various forms of bans on congressional stock trading.

“The American people don’t want us day trading for profit, and engaging in active trading of the very equities that are connected to the policies that we are deciding on and voting on every day,” said Representative Chip Roy (R-Texas). Roy is co-sponsoring a bill that would “require members to put individual stocks, bonds and many other financial assets in a blind trust,” reports The New York Times. A blind trust is a portfolio in which the owner has no knowledge of the trust’s investments and no right to intervene in the investments.

The Times states that many of the lawmakers told them the trades they reported had been “carried out independently by a spouse or a broker with no input from them.” Two members of Congress said the trades were “accidental.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nbcs-chuck-todd-was-democrat-amy-klobuchars-landlord,2022-09-17
"Neighborhood tells 82-yr-old granny to curb her American flag enthusiasm, but she's refusing","A homeowner's association in Arizona is the news this weekend it couldn't be for less flattering reasons. The HOA told 82-year-old Donna Cordero that she can't keep her new American flag decoration because it doesn't fit the neighborhood's look.

Also she's a grandmother. And a great grandmother. And the widow of a veteran. And then the widow of another veteran. Both her deceased husbands are buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona, where one finds quite a few flags.

So why are they biting off this big fight to chew? Because of the kind of flag Cordero added to her property. USA Today explains.

Cordero lives in a retirement community in Peoria, Arizona, with nearly 4,000 houses in a multitude of colors, all of them brown. And an aversion to red, white and blue — at least, if it's painted on the curb.

The series of events that led to this conflict are outlined in detail by columnist Laurie Roberts here, along with photos. But to summarize: a firefighter on an emergency call to a neighbor asked Cordero why none of the homes had the numbers painted on the curb, and Cordero brought it up with the HOA, which told her that she would basically have to handle it herself because they had no one responsible for such things.

So when a company came through the neighborhood selling that very service, Cordero bought. In addition to numbers, the painters would include an accompanying decorative image, she chose the flag, and now here they are.

... During a routine patrol ""to observe the aesthetic appearance of the properties and to ensure they are maintaining 'the look',"" an HOA inspector noticed Cordero's flag.



In June, Cordero was notified: ""picture on your curb numbers must be removed.""



""I couldn't believe it,"" she told me recently. ""I'm thinking, 'Are you joking?' Of all the things they pay attention to in this community, they're looking at my little flag? It absolutely upset me. My neighbors that I've talked to can't believe it either.""



Representatives of the homeowners association told me it's not about the flag. It's about putting ""decorative artwork"" on the curb which is a distinct no-no. Says so right there in the covenants, conditions and restrictions.

The HOA insists that it's not about the flag per se, explaining that other residents in the neighborhood have traditional, flown flags that are within the HOA's guidelines. They maintained their position against objections, and most of the neighbors complied leaving, as USA Today described it, an ugly blotch of mismatched white paint where a flag used to be.

But Donna Cordero has not complied, and says she doesn't intend to.

""You've got to stand for something or you will fall for nothing and I'm not going to fall for nothing,"" she said. ""This is my property and I just can't believe anybody would find that flag offensive.""

In her column, Laurie Roberts ponders the HOAs motivations, and the implications of their insistence in painting over a small flag on a curb for the sake of appearances. Her conclusions are worth your time to read.

Netanyahu fires back at reporter who claimed journalists were 'lucky' to escape targeted building: 'It wasn't luck',"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired back at journalists who claimed over the weekend they were ""lucky"" to escape a building in Gaza before Israeli Defense Forces destroyed it.

What is the background?

Controversy erupted on Saturday when the IDF struck a high-rise building in Gaza that housed international media, including an Associated Press bureau.

Journalists and First Amendment organizations immediately condemned the act, which Israel said was necessary because Hamas intelligence assets operated from the building. Israel later showed American intelligence officials ""smoking gun"" evidence proving Hamas' presence in the building.

What did Netanyahu say?

Speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Netanyahu rebuked an AP reporter who claimed journalists were ""lucky"" to escape their offices before the building was leveled.

Netanyahu said it wasn't luck. In fact, he explained Israeli officials went to great lengths to warn occupants the airstrike was coming, a fact that was widely reported after the building was targeted.

""The interesting thing is, I would say that, you know, all the journalists, one of the, I think AP journalists said, 'We were lucky to get out' No, you weren't lucky to get out. It wasn't luck. It's because we took special pains to call people in those buildings to make sure that the premises were vacated,"" Netanyahu explained.

""Look, you have your own experiences, I think, in Mosul, in Fallujah, in Afghanistan. I think you can appreciate the efforts we go through in dense urban fighting when terrorists are targeting civilians who are hiding behind civilians, how difficult that is,"" he continued. ""We do our best to avoid civilian casualties. And we did that yesterday with that building as well.""

Netanyahu defends strikes on Gaza, says Israel will do ""whatever it takes to restore order"" youtu.be

Netanyahu also confirmed that intelligence was shown to American officials proving the building was a legitimate military target.



""We share with our American friends all that intelligence, and here's the intelligence we had: it's about Palestinian terrorists, an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organization housed in that building that plots and organizes the terror attacks against Israeli civilians,"" Netanyahu explained.

""So it's a perfectly legitimate target. And I can tell you that we took every precaution to make sure that there were no civilian injuries. In fact, no deaths, no injuries whatsoever,"" he added. ""Well, I can't say injuries, I don't know if somebody received a fragment of a stone. I don't know that. But no people were killed.""

What did the AP say?

AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt claimed his organization was unaware that Hamas operated from the same building as his journalists and demanded that Israel show evidence proving its claims.

""The Israeli government says the building contained Hamas military intelligence assets. We have called on the Israeli government to put forward the evidence,"" Pruitt said in a statement.

""AP's bureau has been in this building for 15 years. We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building,"" he claimed. ""This is something we actively check to the best of our ability. We would never knowingly put our journalists at risk.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nearly-100-members-of-congress-could-have-conflict-of-interest-from-financial-trades-analysis-finds,2021-05-17
Israeli PM Netanyahu pledges to name Golan town after President Trump in a gesture of gratitude,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Tuesday to name a new town in Golan Heights after President Donald Trump in a gesture of gratitude for the United States' recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the region.

The announcement came during Netanyahu's visit, alongside his wife and sons, to the nation's northern region, the Jerusalem Post reported.

""I'm here on the beautiful Golan Heights. All Israelis were deeply moved when President Trump made his historic decision to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights,"" the prime minister said. ""Therefore, after the Passover holiday, I intend to bring to the government a resolution calling for a new community on the Golan Heights named after President Donald J. Trump.""

Last month, Netanyahu traveled to the White House to meet with Trump about the decree to recognize Golan as Israeli territory.

Trump broke from other world powers when he signed the presidential proclamation on March 25.

Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the Six-Day War in June 1967. The brief but bloody conflict is also known as the June War or Third Arab-Israeli War. Israel annexed the area in 1981.



Last week, Jason Greenblatt, the top White House Middle East peace negotiator, introduced an updated international map of Golan on Twitter.



What else?



In December 2017, Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, along with plans to move the embassy to Jerusalem.

Israeli Transportation Minister Israel Katz announced that same month that it would one day name a train station near the Western Wall after Trump.

Netflix announces Colin Kaepernick series based on his life and path to becoming an activist,"Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick's life will be the subject of an upcoming Netflix series created by the same team that produced a recent Emmy-nominated series on the Central Park Five, CNN reported.

The series, ""Colin in Black & White,"" will be led by Ava DuVernay and executive produced by Michael Starrbury and Kaepernick and will ""focus on Kaepernick's formative high school years, lending meaningful insight into the acts and experiences that led him to become the activist he is today,"" according to Netflix.

The project will be a scripted series focusing on Kaepernick's upbringing as a black person adopted and raised by white parents and how that background shaped his path to becoming an NFL star and eventually a full-time social justice activist.

""Too often we see race and black stories portrayed through a White lens,"" Kaepernick said in a statement. ""We seek to give new perspective to the differing realities that black people face. We explore the racial conflicts I faced as an adopted black man in a White community, during my high school years. It's an honor to bring these stories to life in collaboration with Ava for the world to see.""

DuVernay has been supportive of Kaepernick's controversial national anthem kneeling protest, which some blame for his departure from the league. DuVernay participated in a boycott of the Super Bowl and accused the NFL of racist treatment of Kaepernick.



Despite continued rhetoric from NFL executives and coaches about the potential for Kaepernick to resume his football career, it appears increasingly unlikely that the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback will return to professional football. Kaepernick derailed a tryout set up by the league last year, and no team has expressed interest in signing him.

His off-field pursuits have been profitable, however. In addition to the upcoming Netflix series, Kaepernick has a lucrative Nike endorsement and a seven-figure deal for an upcoming memoir.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/netanyahu-fires-back-at-reporter-who-claimed-journalists-were-lucky-to-escape-targeted-building-it-wasnt-luck,2020-06-30
Netflix pulls comedy show in Saudi Arabia at request of Islamic country's government,"Netflix pulled an episode of comedy show ""Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj"" in Saudi Arabia after the Islamic nation's government requested the action, CNBC reported.

The episode in question, ""Saudi Arabia,"" targets Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman over the recent killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as Minhaj noted that ""now would be a good time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia,"" CNBC added.

The Saudi Communications and Information Technology Commission made a ""legal request"" to Netflix to pull the episode for allegedly violating anti-cybercrime law, the network said.

""We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request — and to comply with local law,"" a Netflix spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the move was consistent with how other U.S.-based companies operate.

The episode can still be viewed in Saudi Arabia on YouTube, the network added.

Saudi Arabia's IT regulator was not immediately available for comment, CNBC reported.

What's the backlash?



The episode's removal in Saudi Arabia drew backlash on social media and cries of censorship, the network said.

""Netflix's claim to support artistic freedom means nothing if it bows to demands of government officials who believe in no freedom for their citizens — not artistic, not political, not comedic,"" Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa Division, tweeted.

Karen Attiah — Khashoggi's editor at the Washington Post, CNBC said — called it ""quite outrageous"" that Netflix pulled the episode, saying Minhaj ""has been a strong, honest and (funny) voice challenging Saudi Arabia + Mohammed bin Salman in the wake of #khashoggi's murder.""

Minhaj was not immediately available for comment on his episode's removal, CNBC said, but he appears to be an equal opportunity offender.



He hosted the 2017 White House Correspondents' Association dinner, which Trump declined to attend, and not surprisingly targeted the president and Fox News. But Minhaj also fired off some lines about CNN, saying ""all you guys do is stoke up conflict"" and that ""CNN Tonight"" should be retitled ""Wait a Second. Now Hold On! Stop Yelling at Each Other! With Don Lemon.""

What's the background?

Khashoggi was murdered in October inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, but the Saudi government refused to take responsibility. President Donald Trump said in November that the U.S. will stand behind Saudi Arabia despite the controversy, but the U.S. Senate last month voted to condemn the Saudis for Khashoggi's killing and to withdraw American support from the Saudi-backed war in Yemen.



Reporters Without Borders, which backs freedom of the press, ranks Saudi Arabia 169th out of 180 countries in its 2018 world press freedom index. The U.S. is ranked 45th; North Korea is dead last.

Of Saudi Arabia, the index says its ""level of self-censorship is extremely high and the Internet is the only space where freely-reported information and views may be able to circulate, albeit at great risk to the citizen-journalists who post online. Like professional journalists, they are watched closely and critical comments are liable to lead to arrest and trial under the country's terrorism or cyber-crime laws.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/netanyahu-name-golan-town-after-trump,2019-01-02
New report by Durham 'definitively shows' Hillary Clinton funded the Russia collusion hoax,"Editor's note: The original version of this article erroneously stated that the Durham filing indicated that the Clinton campaign paid Sussman to ""infiltrate"" White House servers. Although the filing does accuse Sussman of lying to the FBI and attempting to fabricate a connection between the Trump campaign and the Russian government at the behest of lawyers intimately connected to the Clinton campaign, it does not state that the White House servers were ever infiltrated. We regret the error.



Durham’s filing focuses on potential conflicts of interest related to the representation of Michael Sussman, a former lawyer for the Clinton campaign. Sussman has been charged with making a false statement to a federal agent. He has pleaded not guilty.

The indictment against Sussman alleges that he told then-FBI General Counsel James Baker, less than two months before the 2016 presidential election, that he was not working “for any client” when he requested a meeting in which he provided the FBI with “purported data and ‘white papers’ that allegedly demonstrated a covert communications channel” between the Trump Organization and the Kremlin connected Alfa Bank.

In a section of Durham’s filing titled “Factual background,” it is revealed that Sussman “had assembled and conveyed the allegations to the FBI on behalf of at least two specific clients, including a technology executive (Tech Executive 1) at a U.S.-based internet company (Internet Company 1) and the Clinton campaign.”

Durham’s filing says Sussman’s “billing records reflect” that he “repeatedly billed the Clinton campaign for his work on the Russian Bank-1 allegations.”

Sussman and Tech Executive 1 had met and communicated with a law partner who served as General Counsel on the Clinton campaign. Fox News reports that this lawyer is Marc Elias.

Per Durham, in 2016, Tech Executive 1 worked with Sussman, an American investigative law firm, several cyber researchers and employees at multiple internet companies to “assemble the purported data and white papers.”

The filing states, “In connection with these efforts, Tech Executive-1 exploited his access to non-public and/or proprietary Internet data.

“Tech Executive-1 tasked these researchers to mine Internet data to establish ‘an inference’ and ‘narrative’ tying then-candidate Trump to Russia,” Durham states, “In doing so, Tech Executive-1 indicated that he was seeking to please certain ‘VIPs,’ referring to individuals at Law Firm-1 and the Clinton Campaign.”

Fox News reports that at Sussman’s trial, Durham will establish that among the ill begotten data foraged by Tech Executive-1 and his associates is the domain name systems (DNS) internet traffic pertaining to “(i) a particular healthcare provider, (ii) Trump Tower, (iii) Donald Trump’s Central Park West apartment building, and (iv) the Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOP).”

New report shows how the incestuous ties between CNN and the Cuomos were worse than you thought,"An explosive new report in Rolling Stone details how former CNN chief Jeff Zucker pulled strings at the network to reward his friends and boost ratings by manipulating the news.

Rolling Stone's Tatiana Siegel spoke to more than 36 sources and obtained text messages exchanged between Zucker, his subordinate and romantic partner Allison Gollust, and disgraced ex-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo that show how Cuomo leveraged his relationship with his former staffer, Gollust, for positive coverage at CNN, while Zucker was more than happy to go along with it to make ""great TV.""



The report shows how CNN executives grossly violated journalistic ethics, including an example of how Gollust, who ran the network's marketing and communications departments, literally cheered for Cuomo after she secured TV appearances for him to attack former President Donald Trump's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Siegel recounts how on March 28, 2020, Trump spoke to reporters about the possibility of imposing a short-term ""quarantine"" in New York, New Jersey, and some parts of Connecticut to slow the spread of the coronavirus. ""This would be an enforceable quarantine. You know, I’d rather not do it, but we may need it,” Trump said at the time, giving reporters an update after he discussed the measures with Cuomo, who was still the governor at this point.

Later that day, Cuomo was asked about the president's comments during his daily press briefing, and he dismissed what Trump said. “From a medical point of view, I don’t know what you’d be accomplishing,” he told reporters.

But Rolling Stone reveals that after this press conference, Cuomo texted Gollust, his former communications director who was now an executive vice-president at CNN, writing, ""Ask Jeff to call me plz,"" apparently referring to CNN President Jeff Zucker.

While Zucker's representatives told Rolling Stone there's ""no record"" of a conversation between him and the governor that day, Gollust secured a TV hit for Cuomo on CNN that night, discussing Trump's quarantine proposal.

Cuomo told CNN's audience that a quarantine would cause ""chaos and mayhem"" in the tri-state area, predicting that it would ""paralyze the economy.""

Though the governor would later become infamous for imposing some of the strictest COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions in the country, in March 2020 on CNN he argued that Trump's quarantine ""would shock the economic markets in a way we’ve never seen before.”

After the segment, Rolling Stone reports Gollust texted Cuomo: ""Well done ... Cuomo-W. Trump-L.""

In another example of how Gollust acted to benefit Cuomo, Rolling Stone reports that she invited the governor to come on CNN's ""New Day"" to ""squash"" a rumor that Trump was preparing to shut down New York City because of the pandemic. In a text message, she reportedly told Cuomo, ""I’m pretty sure I stopped being your publicist 8 years ago, but apparently I still am."" In another exchange, Cuomo reportedly asked Gollust to critique his performance at a press conference.

A spokeswoman for Gollust called these exchanges, ""innocuous, mundane conversations that are being spun into a nefarious tale."" But the spokeswoman admitted that Gollust once asked Gov. Cuomo to help her friend push through the city bureacracy to open a birthing center in Manhattan. And she also confirmed that another time Gollust asked Cuomo for a favor involving Billy Joel, who'd once hosted a Cuomo campaign fundraiser. Gollust had reportedly texted Cuomo, “I never ask you for favors, but ...,” to which Cuomo replied, “Yes, u do ask me for favors, and that’s okay. It’s mutual.”

All of this and more happened under Zucker's watch and reportedly with his approval. Rolling Stone details how Zucker enjoyed a close relationship with both Gov. Cuomo and his younger brother Chris Cuomo, a personal friend whom Zucker hired as a CNN anchor starting at $6 million salary. (Both Cuomos have lost their previous jobs amid sexual harassment scandals, though each has denied the respective allegations against them.) Zucker violated CNN's conflict-of-interest protocols to have Chris interview his brother, the governor, all in the pursuit of higher ratings because Andrew Cuomo's star was rising as a possible Democratic challenger to President Donald Trump, Rolling Stone's sources say.

On top of that, Zucker was in a decades-long sexual relationship with Gollust at the same time he was advancing her career at CNN. And Gollust in turn was working to promote Cuomo at the network, sending his preferred topics to CNN producers, just like for the March 2020 interview, according to Rolling Stone.

Rolling Stone suggests the text messages obtained by Rolling Stone are likely to be among the 100,000 texts and email exchanges reviewed by CNN's internal probe into Chris Cuomo's ethics violations. The investigation was completed on Feb. 13. WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar said in a statement the probe was ""comprehensive and definitive,"" and said it had ""found violations of Company policies, including CNN’s News Standards and Practices, by Jeff Zucker, Allison Gollust, and Chris Cuomo.”

Zucker left CNN on Feb. 2, 2022, citing his inappropriate affair with Gollust but making no mention of the numerous allegations of serial ethics violations that are now coming to light. Gollust was ousted from CNN on Feb. 15, after the internal probe turned up evidence of her unethical behavior.

"New section of the DOJ will focus on stripping citizenship from 'terrorists, war criminals, sex offenders, and other fraudsters' who got it illegally","The Trump administration announced this week the creation of a new section within the Department of Justice that will focus on investigating and stripping away the citizenship of foreign-born individuals who obtained it illegally, such as war criminals and terrorists.

A Wednesday DOJ news release explained that the section will be called the ""Denaturalization Section"" and will exist inside the department's Office of Immigration Litigation. The release said that the move ""underscores the Department's commitment to bring justice to terrorists, war criminals, sex offenders, and other fraudsters who illegally obtained naturalization.""

During the naturalization process, prospective citizens fill out a form that asks a series of questions, including whether the applicant has ever been a part of a terrorist group or totalitarian group or has ever been involved in the commission of serious crimes such as genocide, torture, religious persecution, or working at a labor camp. The form also asks the applicant if he or she has ever been involved with ""forcing, or trying to force, someone to have any kind of sexual contact or relations.""



Under federal law, naturalized citizens can have their status revoked if federal prosecutors are able to prove that it was ""illegally procured"" or ""procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation."" Such cases have no statute of limitations, the department also pointed out.

""When a terrorist or sex offender becomes a U.S. citizen under false pretenses, it is an affront to our system — and it is especially offensive to those who fall victim to these criminals,"" Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt said about the new office. ""The Denaturalization Section will further the Department's efforts to pursue those who unlawfully obtained citizenship status and ensure that they are held accountable for their fraudulent conduct.""



The release also gave examples of successful denaturalization cases, such as one involving an individual who had been convicted of terrorism in Egypt, another involving an individual convicted of executing unarmed civilians and prisoners of war ""during the Balkans conflict,"" and another case dealing with ""an individual who sexually abused a minor victim for multiple years.""

The department also said that while it's been successful in litigating denaturalization cases in the past, the creation of the new stand-alone section was prompted by a ""growing number of referrals anticipated from law enforcement agencies.""

This isn't the first action the administration has taken to combat citizenship fraud. In June 2018, then-Citizenship and Immigration Services Director L. Francis Cissna told the Associated Press that his agency would bring in a team of lawyers and enforcement officers who would be tasked with rooting out immigrants who had been naturalized under false pretenses and refer the cases to the DOJ.

""We finally have a process in place to get to the bottom of all these bad cases and start denaturalizing people who should not have been naturalized in the first place,"" Cissna told the outlet at the time.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-report-by-durham-definitively-shows-hillary-clinton-funded-the-russia-collusion-hoax,2020-02-26
New WHO report reverses prior findings on COVID-19 lab-leak theory,"Preliminary findings from the World Health Organization's second investigative team examining the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic leave open the possibility that the virus was leaked from a lab and say further investigation is needed.

In its first report, the WHO's Scientific advisory group for the origins of novel pathogens said that ""further investigations"" are necessary to determine whether the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. This group is the second investigative group put together by the U.N. health agency after the first advisory group was hampered by interference from the Chinese government and accusations that the investigation had been politicized.

The scientists and public health advisors who participated on the investigative team said that studies on humans, animals, and the environment in china are still needed to ""follow up on several gaps in our knowledge.""

""For example, the source of SARS-CoV-2 and its introduction into the market is unclear and it is yet to be determined where the initial spill over event(s) occurred,"" the report's executive summary states. ""There is a need to examine environmental samples collected from specific stalls and drains at the market in January 2020 that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in areas known to have sold live animals.""

Other studies to identify potential animal sources of the virus, human studies to determine how the virus initially spread, and further examinations of the unresolved questions about the role the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan and other Chinese laboratories played are also needed, the report said.

The investigators said no new evidence has emerged in support of the lab-leak theory but that they remain willing to examine scientific evidence in support of any COVID-19 origins hypothesis as it becomes available.



""The SAGO notes that there has not been any new data made available to evaluate the laboratory as a pathway of SARS-CoV-2 into the human population and recommends further investigations into this and all other possible pathways,"" the report notes. ""The SAGO will remain open to any and all scientific evidence that becomes available in the future to allow for comprehensive testing of all reasonable hypotheses.""



The advisory group emphasized that the investigators' work is ""ongoing and not yet complete,"" and that these findings should be viewed as ""work in progress.""

The WHO's recognition that the lab-leak theory remains a viable hypothesis for the origins of COVID-19 stands in stark contrast to the organization's 2021 investigative report, which asserted it was ""extremely unlikely"" that the SARS-CoV-2 virus escaped from a lab. That report was widely criticized by virologists and public health experts for relying on the word of Chinese authorities, who had obfuscated and lied to the international community throughout the pandemic.

There were also conflict of interest questions surrounding a prominent member of the investigative team, EcoHealth Alliance president Peter Daszak. EcoHealth Alliance had sub-awarded grants from the U.S. government for bat coronavirus research to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the years leading up to the pandemic. Daszak was part of an influential group of scientists, including National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, who had attacked the lab-leak hypothesis as a conspiracy theory without conclusive scientific evidence.

Harsh criticism of the first investigative team's efforts led WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to announce a new team of investigators last October.

After the report was released, China attacked the lab-leak theory, calling it a politically-motivated lie, according to the Associated Press.

“The lab leak theory is totally a lie concocted by anti-China forces for political purposes, which has nothing to do with science,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Friday. “We always supported and participated in science-based global virus tracing, but we firmly opposed any forms of political manipulation.""

He repeated China's calls for an investigation into ""highly suspicious laboratories such as Fort Detrick and the University of North Carolina,"" where Chinese officials claim the U.S. was developing viral bio-weapons.

The unsupported claims are part of China's efforts to take accusations directed towards the Wuhan lab and throw them back at the U.S. without engaging in a serious effort to determine the origins of COVID-19.

To date, no scientific evidence has emerged to conclusively rule out either the natural origins or lab-leak origins theory, though most scientists still believe more evidence points towards the virus transmitting to humans from an animal host. Investigations into the pandemic's origins remain obstructed by China's unwillingness to be transparent.

NYC principal Amanda Bueno urged staff to support Palestinian liberation,"A New York City middle school principal is under fire for telling teachers and administrators to ""take action"" against Israel and make a ""public commitment to Palestinian liberation."" Principal Amanda Bueno emailed staffers at MS 136 in Brooklyn a list of actions they should take to support Palestine in the most recent Israel-Gaza conflict.

The email in question, which is titled ""Day of Action in Solidarity with The Palestinian Uprising & General Strike,"" urged teachers to demand sanctions on Israel from U.S. government officials.

""Yesterday was the Day of Action in Solidarity with the Palestinian Uprising & General Strike. If you have been watching the news in absolute horror, you are not alone,"" Bueno began the email, which was published by the New York Post.

""You can take action today by protesting, attending a vigil, making a public commitment to Palestinian Liberation, signing a petition, or calling your government officials to place sanctions on Israel,"" Bueno wrote on Wednesday morning.

""The time is now to take a stand for those impacted by state-sanctioned violence and crimes against the humanity of the most vulnerable in our world,"" the email read. ""We need not prove their humanity and right to exist for us to spread awareness about these issues. Empathy is the bare minimum.""

The email included a list of links and resources to enable teachers to take action against Israel and support Palestinians.

""Here are some notes and resources from the Institute for Anti-Racist Education,"" the principal wrote.

She included a link to the ""Teach Palestine"" website and an article titled ""'American Taxpayer Money Is Being Used To Commit Human Rights Violations' In Israel, Says Rep. Rashida Tlaib.""

An MS 136 teacher, who is Jewish, told the New York Post, ""I opened the email and I was in shock. I felt very targeted and very attacked by her words.""



""These resources she provided, it's propaganda,"" the teacher added. ""There was nothing in the email about Hamas rockets targeting innocent Israeli civilians.""

Lawyer Inna Vernikov sent a letter to the New York Department of Education calling for Bueno to be punished.

""New York law forbids requesting or encouraging any public servant, city employee, or subordinate public servant/employee to engage in political activities,"" Vernikov wrote.

StopAntisemitism.org, a non-profit foundation that ""works to hold antisemites accountable,"" stated, ""NY law forbids encouraging any public servant or city employee from engaging in politics. This didn't stop Brooklyn Middle School 136 Principal Amanda Bueno from sending out a school wide email titled 'Day of Action in Solidarity with The Palestinian Uprising & General Strike.'""

New York City Schools Chancellor Meisha Porter said Bueno made ""a clear exercise of poor judgment.""

""The MS 136 principal must apologize for her email,"" Porter tweeted. ""This was a clear exercise of poor judgment & we will take appropriate follow-up action. We must teach complex current events without bringing our political activities or beliefs into the classroom.""

Nathaniel Steyer, a spokesman for the Department of Education, said, ""The matter is being addressed internally and was referred to [the special commissioner of investigation] for further investigation.""

Cuomo investigation expanded to include top adviser who may have linked vaccines to political support for Cuomo,"New York investigators have reportedly expanded their investigation into Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to include whether a top COVID-19 adviser tied vaccine access to political support for the scandal-embattled governor.

New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) opened an investigation into Cuomo earlier this year after numerous women came forward with sexual harassment allegations. The scandal boiled over just Cuomo was taking heat from federal officials over his COVID-related nursing home scandal. The U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York is handing the nursing home investigation.

Cuomo is also being investigated over allegations ""misused state resources to write and promote his pandemic book"" about the pandemic, NBC News reported.

What are the details?

According to the Wall Street Journal, investigators have questioned at least three Democratic county executives ""who said they were surprised to receive calls from Larry Schwartz,"" Cuomo's COVID vaccine czar who abruptly resigned from his position as a ""volunteer adviser"" last month.

More from Wall Street Journal:

Mr. Schwartz contacted more than a half-dozen executives in early March, executives said, as Mr. Cuomo faced mounting calls for his resignation from members of his own political party and was personally contacting state lawmakers to shore up support.



The executives said that at the time of Mr. Schwartz's calls they were typically speaking with him about the allocation of vaccine supplies, not politics. Mr. Schwartz has said he didn't link vaccine distribution to political considerations. On Friday, he referred questions to his lawyer, Guy Petrillo, who declined to comment.

At least one of the county executives filed a complaint with the state's attorney general's office after fielding a call from Schwartz, the Journal reported.

""Right at the time that every county was working, and desperately needed more vaccines, to receive a call from the person who was responsible for allocating those doses gauging political loyalty to the governor was an obvious conflict, and at best ethically gray,"" one county executive told the Journal.

Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz (D), meanwhile, told the Journal he did not feel Schwartz tried to pressure him into supporting Cuomo.

Why did Schwartz step down?

According to the New York Post, Schwartz stepped down after the New York State Legislature repealed a controversial rule that allowed some individuals to serve as volunteer officials during the pandemic.

The rule change, according to the New York Times, meant Schwartz would have been ""treated as a public officer following the legislative changes, which would have required him to file financial disclosure forms and be subject to a two-year lobbying ban after his service to the state.""

Numerous staffers have resigned from Cuomo's office in recent months as investigators continue their investigations into Cuomo. ""Those include aides Max Orenstein, Laura Edidin, Christopher O'Brien, Caitlin Girouard, Eric Hammond, Will Burns, Kumiki Gibson and Gareth Rhodes. Most recently, Cuomo spokesman Jack Sterne left in mid-April, a year into serving in the communications department,"" the Post reported.

New York Times drops repeat contributor who called for the genocide of Jews,"In response to pressure by media watchdog Honest Reporting, the New York Times ended its relationship with repeat contributor Fady Hanona on August 12. This comes after revelations that the Gaza Strip-based freelance producer and fixer had not only advanced anti-Semitic tropes and rhetoric, but called for violence in a number of instances.

Hanona contributed to the paper's reporting on the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians right up until his August dismissal.

Honest Reporting, which is run by former chief political correspondent at the Jerusalem Post Gil Hoffman, recently drew attention both to Hanona's contributions to the New York Times, the BBC, the Guardian, and VICE News and to some of the political views he has expressed online.

Akiva Van Koningsveld documented a number of cases in which the New York Times' former freelancer advocated violence against Israelis and supported those who have committed grievous crimes. In one instance, Hanona threatened to murder Ghassan Alian, who had been commander of the Israeli Defense Forces' Golani Brigade.



StopAntisemitism.org, alerted to Hanona's history of hateful rhetoric online by Honest Reporting, highlighted another one of the comments he made on his now-deleted social media, here suggesting that he wouldn't be upset with killing Jews.

On August 10, 2014, Hanona quoted Adolf Hitler, writing: ""As Hitler said, give me a Palestinian soldier and a German weapon and I will make Europe crawl on its knees, Israel will submit."" Eight days later, Hanona reportedly urged the Palestinian guerillas to reject a truce and to ""continue hitting Tel Aviv and return to clash from point zero.""



Koningsveld emphasized that Hanona is ""entitled to his personal views, however ignorant and distasteful they may be."" Honest Reporting's interest in the matter is that Hanona has and continues to act as a fixer for foreign media organizations and personnel.

The Times of Israel noted that fixers, such as Hanona, help foreign journalists and news organizations coordinate logistics and provide translation.

According to Koningsveld, a politically motivated personality like Hanona ""can be selective with the information [he feeds] the journalist or, at worst, mistranslate the words of interview subjects."" The media watchdog is concerned, ultimately, that someone who has involved himself in the causes he helps others report on will result in ""skewed news coverage about the Arab-Israeli conflict.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-city-principal-palestinian-liberation,2022-08-16
NY Times taken to woodshed for claiming Iran's nuclear program is 'peaceful': 'Is this an Iranian paper?',"The New York Times was summarily blasted on Saturday after the newspaper presented Iran's nuclear program in a positive light. The Times' posturing came after the assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the Islamic country's top nuclear scientist.

What did the Times say?

The Times claimed that the nuclear ambitions of Iran — a state-sponsor of terrorism, according to the State Department — are for ""peaceful purposes.""

""Iranian officials, who have always maintained that their nuclear ambitions are for peaceful purposes, not weapons, expressed fury and vowed revenge over the assassination, calling it an act of terrorism and warmongering,"" the newspaper tweeted.

What was the response?

In response, the New York Times, the so-called ""paper of record,"" was accused of disseminating ""foreign propaganda garbage.""

""Is this an Iranian paper?"" conservative commentator Lisa Boothe said.

""What was once the self-styled newspaper of record is now just a well-funded left-wing blog, relentlessly hostile to America and Israel, and always ready to propagandize for their enemies,"" Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said.

""NYT, once again, ignores U.S. intelligence agencies' warnings and props up a murderous, gay killing Regime. Their tweet should have a warning label of pushing misinformation, @Twitter,"" Richard Grenell responded.

""The New York Times is pure foreign propaganda garbage,"" Republican operative Arthur Schwartz said.

""Two weeks ago, the IAEA declared Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was over 12 times the legal limit. Also, you don't build nuclear facilities deep under mountains with 90 degree entrances meant to defeat cruise missiles when they're for peaceful purposes,"" GOP operative Alex Plitsas said.

""Wow. The press has truly become an anti- American propaganda tool. Not even worth using for toilet paper,"" another person said.

""Lmao. Much like the peaceful protests, this is just peaceful nuclear bomb research,"" another person mocked.

Anything else?

Notably, two top officials from the Obama administration were angered by Fakhrizadeh sudden death.

Former CIA Director John Brennan called the operation to kill Fakhrizadeh ""criminal"" and ""highly reckless.""

""This was a criminal act & highly reckless. It risks lethal retaliation & a new round of regional conflict. Iranian leaders would be wise to wait for the return of responsible American leadership on the global stage & to resist the urge to respond against perceived culprits,"" he said.

Brennan added, ""I do not know whether a foreign government authorized or carried out the the murder of Fakhrizadeh. Such an act of state-sponsored terrorism would be a flagrant violation of international law & encourage more governments to carry out lethal attacks against foreign officials.""

Meanwhile, Ben Rhodes, a top Obama aide who helped craft the Iran nuclear deal, claimed Fakhrizadeh's death was meant to undermine Joe Biden's administration.

""This is an outrageous action aimed at undermining diplomacy between an incoming US administration and Iran. It's time for this ceaseless escalation to stop,"" Rhodes said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-investigators-expand-cuomo-investigation,2020-11-28
Evolutionary science and genetics breakthroughs show Adam and Eve are not incompatible with evolution: Report,"Christian scientists say that evolutionary science may very well be ""making space"" for Adam and Eve, Fox News' Tyler O'Neil reported on Monday.

What are the details?

O'Neil reported that scientists, pointing to ""genetics breakthroughs,"" insist that Adam and Eve may not necessarily contradict the theory of evolution.

Christians — many of whom have rejected the theory of evolution as it previously indicated that there was no room for God's first people, Adam and Eve — have long argued about what some see as an impasse between faith and science.

S. Joshua Swamidass, associate professor at St. Louis' Washington University School of Medicine, told Fox that the ""societal conflict"" of Christianity versus evolution has been ""deep and stubborn.""

""Now, in a surprise twist, evolutionary science is making space for Adam and Eve,"" Swamidass explained. ""It turns out that the theological questions are about genealogical ancestry, not genetics. In this paradigm shift, we are finding a better way forward, a better story to tell.""

In Swamidass' 2019 book, ""The Genealogical Adam and Eve: The Surprising Science of Universal Ancestry,"" the professor argues that genetics and evolutionary theory can work hand in hand with the existence of Adam and Eve.

""Most readers of Genesis understood Adam and Eve to be (1) ancestors of us all, and (2) miraculously created without parents of their own,"" Swamidass told the outlet. ""In contrast, evolution teaches that (3) we share common ancestors with apes, and (4) we arise from a large population, not a single couple. This conflict of fact only seemed solvable by revising foundational Christian theological beliefs, or by rejecting evolution.""

""But now, clearing up some big scientific understandings, we know that all four of these things can be true at the same time,"" he continued. ""Even if Adam and Eve lived as recently as just 6,000 years ago, they would be the genealogical ancestors of everyone across the globe by AD 1. They could even have been created de novo, from the dust and a rib. Of course, at the same time, we would also descend from people outside the Garden, others whom God created by a providentially governed process of evolution.""

A person inherits 50 percent of DNA from a mother and 50 percent from a father.

""As you go farther back, you have more genealogical ancestors who each contribute less and less to your DNA,"" O'Neil explained. ""While universal genetic ancestors are rare, universal genealogical ancestors are surprisingly common. ... Each individual has four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, and so on, but population size in past generations tends to get smaller, so overlap is inevitable. [Swamidass] argues that by 1 A.D., every person on Earth was descended from Adam and Eve.""

In his GAE model — Genealogical Adam and Eve — Swamidass claimed that biological humans, despite the span of time of between the time at which Adam and Eve existed and modern day, may still share a common ancestor with apes as per the theory of evolution, but that God could have ""created Adam and Eve from the dust and a rib, without parents, and these two became the ancestors of all humans by 1 A.D.""

""Swamidass claims that Genesis appears to require biological humans outside of Adam and Eve's family line because after Cain murders Abel and leaves his parents, he fears that he will be killed, he acquires a wife, and he builds a city,"" O'Neil added.

What else is there to know about this?

Christian philosophy professor Michael Murray, who previously taught at Franklin & Marshall College, recently commented on Swamidass' researches and said that he believes ""we have arrived at the point where we can confidently affirm that the basic evolutionary story is not the threat to Christian orthodoxy that we once feared, and not because we had to compromise on orthodoxy.""



""My view is that recent findings in genetics and paleontology have shown that our best scientific theories and data do not rule out a historical Adam and Eve,"" Murray told Fox in a statement, adding that new developments show that ""for all we know, there might have been a pair that is the ancestor of all extant humans or extant Homo sapiens.""

He added that there previously appeared to be an ""emerging consensus among both secular scientists and scientists of faith that the relevant empirical data was flatly inconsistent with an ancestral pair.""

However, recent developments show that an ""ancestral pair is not flatly ruled out as was previously thought.""

Biology professor Nathan Lents, who teaches at John Jay College, told the outlet that such developments have made Adam and Eve ""more plausible.""

""I would not say that there is any evidence, historical or scientific, in favor of the existence of Adam and Eve, as they are presented in the Bible,"" Lents told Fox. ""However, there have been developments in our understanding of ancestry and genetics that allow for the possibility of universal ancestors of the entire human population in the surprisingly recent past.""

Swamidass told the outlet that ""in making space for Adam and Eve, secular scientists have an opportunity to offer an olive branch to religious communities.""

""I'm encouraged to see that many religious leaders ... have been eager to take the olive branch,"" he wrote. ""For those seeking to advance science in a fractured society, this is very good news indeed.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-times-drops-reporter-who-called-for-jewish-genocide,2022-01-03
Newly revealed HHS records expose Biden administration's extensive campaign to push COVID vaccines,"On Tuesday, Judicial Watch obtained 249 pages of records from the Department of Health and Human Services, detailing a massive and extensive media campaign executed by the Biden administration with the aim of driving up acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, stated, ""These records show a disturbing and massive campaign by the Biden administration to propagandize and politicize the controversial COVID vaccine.""

The Biden administration's campaign involved dispatching government-approved ""messengers"" to press the issue on popular podcasts. Black and Christian broadcasters were asked to run vaccination specials. Major brands and corporations, brought in as partners, were prompted to have their ""talent"" relay approved talking points. Hollywood guilds were brought on board to incorporate ""vaccination messaging"" into their scripts and shows.



Fitton added, ""It seems as if the entire entertainment industry was an agent for the government!""

The COVID-19 Community Corps

After HHS failed to respond to an April 19, 2021, request for records pertaining to the ""COVID-19 Community Corps"" program it ran in league with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit later that year, on August 31.

The documents Judicial Watch subsequently received exposed the tactics employed by the COVID-19 Community Corps.

HHS announced the launch of the CCC on April 1, 2021, characterizing it as a ""nationwide, grassroots network of local voices people know and trust,"" tasked with encouraging Americans to get vaccinated.

The CCC's three stated goals were: to ""Educate Americans on how they can protect themselves and slow the spread of COVID-19""; ""Build trust in the vaccines so more American [sic] are ready to take them""; and ""Increase vaccine uptake by educating Americans about how and where to get vaccinated.""

Manufacturing consent

Extra to deploying Vice President Kamala Harris — who had previously stated she would not take the vaccine — and other government spokesmen to promote the experimental new vaccines on black radio shows, the Biden administration went so far as to help script content for public consumption.

Among its promotion efforts, the CCC sought to:

""Place a trusted messenger on the Joe Rogan Show and Barstool Sports to promote vaccination (work with outside expert to identify who will be most effective)"";

""Request that the TV morning and daytime talk shows feature special vaccination reunion moments with everyday Americans talking about what this means to them (ex: hugging grandma for the first time)"";

""Request that major live TV entertainment shows feature hosts being vaccinated on air (ex: the hosts of The Voice)"";

""Work with Hispanic entertainment outlets to get vaccination storylines into scripted shows and gameshows"";

""Work with NFL, NASCAR, MLB, CMA to request they create content with their talent and release through their broadcast and social channels"";

""Work with the Hollywood guilds to work vaccination messaging into scripted and reality TV shows"";

""Work with all major sports leagues to send vaccination information to ticket holders"";

""Work with Instagram to produce a series about vaccines"";

""Create a TikTok #PassTheMic campaign ... launch with major influencers to begin the series""; and

""Launch Hollywood comedy writers video content.""

Stephen Colbert, host of CBS' ""The Late Show,"" was one of many television personalities who emphatically pushed for COVID-19 vaccination.

Whoopi Goldberg and others on ABC's ""The View"" similarly promoted COVID-19 vaccination, going so far as to threaten those who chose not to give the shot to their children.

Kristina Schake, appointed by Biden to lead the vaccination campaign and now executive vice president of global communications at Disney, suggested in one of her CCC correspondences that ""no pharma companies are involved."" While perhaps not directly involved, in other CCC talking-point documentation, it is explicitly stated that it ""is vital that everyone get their second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines.""

According to the newly revealed documents, the CCC also dispatched select physicians to promote the Biden administration's narrative on news programs, both American and international. For instance, former White House vaccinations coordinator Dr. Bechara Choucair was scheduled to reiterate approved talking points on BBC News and the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, while the leader of the White House's Equity Task Force, Dr. Nunez-Smith, was assigned to state the case on NPR, iHeartRadio Public Affairs Show, and elsewhere.



The campaign accounted for potential resistance from conservatives. To bring them on board, the CCC targeted faith leaders, rural leaders (e.g., the Farm Bureau), Country Music TV, NASCAR, the Bulwark, and Fox News.

Big support from Big Pharma



In addition to the pressure exerted by the Biden administration on media companies and personalities to reiterate the approved vaccine narrative, financial incentives linked to media sponsorships and ad buys by big pharmaceutical companies may also have had a significant impact on message consistency.

The Tampa Bay Times reported that Pfizer, one of the pharmaceutical giants that produced a COVID-19 vaccine, made $81.3 billion in 2021, nearly double its revenue in 2020. Since the onset of the pandemic, Pfizer spent over $25 million for in-house lobbying and in payments to 19 lobbying firms, all seeking to protect its product and promote ""more robust"" U.S. vaccination programs. In 2019, Pfizer was one of the most popular stocks held by members of Congress.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/new-york-times-iran-nuclear-peaceful,2022-10-06
News outlets from CNN to WaPo to Al Jazeera wrongly blamed Israel for death of Palestinian baby,"Islamic Jihad, an Iran-funded terrorist group based in Gaza, has taken responsibility for the death of a baby who was killed in Gaza over the weekend.

The Jerusalem Post reported:

""A leak from the heroes of the [Islamic Jihad's] Sarayat al-Quds (Jerusalem Brigades) on the circumstances of the death of the baby Saba Abu 'Arar indicates that a rocket of the resistance exploded inside the family's home due to a technical failure, and prematurely exploded,"" a news item by Hamas' al-Risala News said.



""There is a claim that the technical failure was caused by low-grade explosives in the rocket,"" it added. ""There is no doubt that the baby's death has nothing to do with the enemy's [Israel's] planes.""

News outlets across the world originally blamed Israel for the baby's death, with some even citing the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry as their source. Here's a sample of the outlets and legacy media journalists that got it wrong.

Newsmax settles lawsuit with Dominion employee and issues retraction over election fraud claims,"Newsmax settled a lawsuit with a Dominion Voting Systems executive over accusations about election fraud and issued an apology and a retraction of those claims on Friday.

The statement on its website said there was no evidence that Dr. Eric Coomer, the director of Product Strategy and Security at Dominion, had changed the election ballots.

Newsmax would like to clarify its coverage of Dr. Coomer and note that while Newsmax initially covered claims by President Trump's lawyers, supporters and others that Dr. Coomer played a role in manipulating Dominion voting machines, Dominion voting software, and the final vote counts in the 2020 presidential election, Newsmax subsequently found no evidence that such allegations were true. Many of the states whose results were contested by the Trump campaign after the November 2020 election have conducted extensive recounts and audits, and each of these states certified the results as legal and final.

The statement went on to clarify that there was no evidence Coomer had met with members of Antifa either. The statement concluded with an apology to Coomer and his family.

On behalf of Newsmax, we would like to apologize for any harm that our reporting of the allegations against Dr. Coomer may have caused to Dr. Coomer and his family.

Coomer has said that he and his family went into hiding after he was falsely accused of rigging the election for then-candidate Joe Biden.

""It's terrifying,"" Coomer told the Associated Press. ""I've worked in international elections in all sorts of post-conflict countries where election violence is real and people are getting killed over it. And I feel that we're on the verge of that.""

Coomer moved to dismiss Newsmax from his lawsuit after the settlement. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.

His lawsuit will continue on against the other defendants, which include attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, Eric Mataxas, One America News Network (OANN), and the Trump campaign.

""With respect to the remaining defendants, Dr. Coomer is seeking damages to his reputation and livelihood and, once certified by the court, punitive damages,"" read a statement from the law firm representing Coomer.

Dominion has its own defamation lawsuit against numerous media figures apart from Coomer's lawsuit and it is ongoing.

"New York launches 'hate and bias' prevention unit, costing taxpayers millions of dollars","New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she is a launching a special unit to prevent ""hate and bias"" as part of what her office is calling an ""early warning detection system"" in communities. This new task force comes in conjunction with over $100 million the state has allocated to hate crime prevention.

Effective immediately, the New York State Division of Human Rights will launch the ""Hate and Bias Prevention Unit,"" which will lead public outreach efforts and responses to communities where they determine hate has occurred.

The Hate and Bias Prevention Unit is tasked with organizing 10 regional councils in New York as community committees of sorts, to tackle any issues that may arise in the area. The councils will provide services such organizing educational programming, conflict-resolution training, and a method for filing complaints. Perhaps most glaringly, the bias unit will develop a ""rapid response team"" to respond to ""hate incidents"" in the community.

""New York State will use every tool at its disposal to eliminate hate and bias from our communities,"" the governor said. ""We will not let the rise in hate incidents that we see happening online, across the country, and across the world take root here at home.""

New York Lieutenant Governor Antonio Delgado also echoed the need to stand up against hate, saying that ""we cannot allow ignorance, fear, and hatred to damage the enormous amount of work we've done to move our state forward,.""

With over $96M dedicated to organizations that are ""at risk of hate crimes and attacks"" and an additional $10M toward ""securing reproductive health centers,"" Gov. Hochul has created a wide-ranging, sweeping network of government initiatives that provide funding for the most pertinent ideological battle grounds that Democrats have.

In November 2022, the governor's office announced $50M of available funding for community-based organizations to ""strengthen safety measures and protect against hate crimes,"" in addition to $361M already made available through state and federal grants. This legislation required mandatory hate crime prevention training for hate crime offenders, along with the development of an anti-hate campaign.

As such, the new hate and bias unit will be tasked with ""promoting acceptance, inclusion, tolerance, and understanding of diversity"" and, through consulting with school districts, community organizations, local governments, and more, will develop educational materials on those subjects.

In total, including state and federal grants, there is now over $500M of funding available to fight ""hate and bias"" in the state of New York, which sees approximately 5,000 complaints of discrimination per year, according to the New York State Division of Human Rights.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/news-outlets-wrongly-blamed-israel-for-death-of-palestinian-baby,2022-12-13
"NFL star curses out team exec, calls him a 'cracker'—but the team is letting him play Monday","Oakland Raiders wide receiver Antonio Brown verbally abused general manager Mike Mayock at a practice Wednesday over fines the team imposed on him, but he will still play in Monday's game with no repercussions, according to ESPN.

Brown, who was traded from the Steelers to the Raiders this offseason, has been in an extended conflict with the NFL and the team over rules that prevented him from wearing his preferred helmet.

The receiver was so upset that he was being forced to wear a different (safer) helmet this season that he threatened to retire rather than wear it. He filed multiple grievances with the league, losing both times.

The team has fined him for missing team activities while considering quitting football over the helmet injustice. That's not to mention time he has missed because he suffered severe frostbite on his feet from entering a cryotherapy chamber without the proper footwear.

Brown responded to a letter detailing those fines by posting it on Instagram with the caption, ""When your own team want to hate but there's no stopping me now devil is a lie. Everyone got to pay this year so we clear.""

Still, in the NFL, talent rules over all else. So, despite all that drama, the team is ready to trot Brown out for week one's Monday night game—even after what happened Wednesday.

ESPN's Josina Anderson reported on the altercation:

On Wednesday, Brown initiated a discussion with Mayock midway through practice, resulting in the confrontation that had sparked the team's impasse with the player, according to a team source.



A Raiders source confirmed Brown was unhappy with the fine levied by the team and, seeing Mayock watching practice, walked over and initiated an exchange with the GM. The Raiders source confirmed information from another league source who said Brown called Mayock a ""cracker"" and unleashed a barrage of ""cuss words"" during the altercation.



The team source said Mayock tried to keep his cool and defuse the situation.



""[Mayock] was like, 'I'm cool, I understand your displeasure,'"" the source said. ""[Mayock] sort of just like ... just walked away because he saw it escalate.""

Brown has since issued an ""emotional"" apology, receiving forgiveness and acceptance from his teammates. And, apparently, the forgiveness of team executives, since Brown was confirmed by head coach Jon Gruden to be playing Monday, despite earlier reports that the team intended to suspend him for his behavior.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/newsmax-settle-retraction-dominion-coomer,2019-09-06
WATCH: Nikki Haley delivers fiery final speech to UN general assembly,"Nikki Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, announced in October that she would retire from her post at the end of 2018.

On Tuesday, she addressed the U.N. general assembly for the final time as the U.S. ambassador, where she admittedly deviated from her standard practice of not directly addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to blast the U.N. for its continual condemnation of Israel while failing to denounce Palestinian terrorist groups.

What did Haley say?

Haley came out of the gate swinging, blasting the U.N. for its ""one-sided"" discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

""The problems of the Middle East are numerous, and yet we spend vastly disproportionate amount of time on just one of them. And the U.N. has shown itself to be hopelessly biased, as we witnessed again just two weeks ago when the general assembly failed to condemn Hamas's terrorist activity against Israel,"" Haley said.

The former South Carolina governor lamented that her attempts to bring additional value to the U.N. general assembly's monthly meeting by discussing other pressing Middle East issues — such as Iran's meddling, Hamas and Hezbollah, the Syrian War, Iraqi and Yemeni refugees, and other humanitarian crises — have been futile because the U.N. has an ""obsession"" with Israel.

Haley went on to explain that peace is necessary for Israel and Palestine. But in the end, it's going to be most beneficial for Palestinians, who are trapped under the thumb of leaders sympathetic to terrorists, who make peace impossible.

""It is time we faced a hard truth: both sides would benefit greatly from a peace agreement, but the Palestinians would benefit more, and the Israelis would risk more,"" Haley explained.

Later, Haley directly addressed diplomats from other Middle East countries, warning them their posture toward Israel and Palestine will contribute monumental differences to whether or not peace is achieved, as well as confronting them for apparent hypocrisy.

She said:

To my Arab friends, I have heard privately from many of you. You've said that you know a solution is urgently needed. But your governments have not been willing to talk to your constituencies about what is realistic or to the Palestinian leadership about the harm they're doing to their very own people. By taking the easy way, you are really saying that the Palestinian people are not a priority for you. Because if they were, you would all be in a room helping bring both sides to the table.

In the end, Haley reiterated America's steadfast support for Israel and the Israeli people — a commitment Haley said will never change.

""Whatever it is that others decide, the world must know that America will remain steadfast in our support of Israel, its people, and its security. That is an unshakable bond between our two peoples,"" she said. ""And it is that bond — more than anything else — that makes peace possible.""

Why is Haley resigning?

After joining the Trump administration in its infancy, Haley informed President Donald Trump earlier this year that she wanted to ""take a break"" at the year's conclusion. Prior to joining the administration, Haley served as governor of South Carolina for six years.

There was never an indication the relationship between Haley and Trump was anything but amicable. Trump, unlike many of his other departed top-level staffers, has only ever showered Haley with praise.

Trump nominated Heather Nauert, who has served as the spokeswoman of the State Department since April 2017, to succeed Haley.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/newyork-hateandbias-unit,2018-12-19
"Ninth Circuit clears way for Trump to deport up to 400,000 immigrants living in the US under Temporary Protected Status for years, even decades","A federal appeals court has effectively greenlit the Trump administration's plan to deport up to 400,000 immigrants next year by ending the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) they have enjoyed for as long as two decades.

What are the details?

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted within its constitutional purview when it terminated the legal protections for immigrants from four countries — El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Sudan — who fled natural disasters or conflict in their home countries, Politico reported.

In the 2-1 decision in Ramos v. Wolf, the panel lifted an injunction on the plan that was put in place in 2018 by a San Francisco judge. A separate injunction filed by a New York judge preventing Haitians under TPS from being deported remains in place.

""The [Department of Homeland Security] Secretary's discretion to make TPS determinations, while not without check, is undoubtedly broad and unique in nature,"" Judge Consuelo Callahan wrote in the majority opinion, joined by Judge Ryan Nelson. ""The decision to designate any foreign country for TPS begins and ends with the Secretary, so long as certain limited statutory criteria are met.""

The court also reportedly rejected the argument that acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf's decision to terminate the protected status was improperly motivated by President Trump's supposed racial biases, which include the president's January 2018 comments regarding ""sh*thole countries.""

""Plaintiffs fail to present even 'serious questions' on the merits of their claim that the Secretaries' TPS terminations were improperly influenced by the President's 'animus against non-white, non-European immigrants,'"" wrote Callahan, a George W. Bush appointee. She added the lawsuit suffered from ""a glaring lack of evidence tying the President's alleged discriminatory intent to the specific TPS terminations.""

What else?

Proponents of immigration reform praised the decision, agreeing with the Trump administration that the crises which initially led to the TPS designations in those four countries have long since passed.

""The Ninth Circuit affirmed two clear aspects of T.P.S.,"" said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, according to the New York Times. ""The first is that the T in T.P.S. stands for temporary and that it is not intended, nor should it be, a backdoor to permanent residency.""

A spokesperson for the DHS told TheBlaze the department is ""very pleased"" with the outcome.

""The circumstances that led to the temporary designation in each of the countries in question — reduced conflict and improved food security in Sudan, better environmental conditions in Nicaragua and El Salvador, and improvements as to Haiti's 2010 earthquake and its aftereffects (which once had qualified as ""extraordinary and temporary conditions"") — fundamentally changed, and DHS withdrew their TPS designations. These changes have been a landmark of DHS during the Trump Administration,"" the spokesperson added.

The Times noted that, despite the ruling, the protections will not be stripped until next year. The Trump administration previously agreed to extend TPS protection until March 2021 for the countries affected and until November 2021 for immigrants from El Salvador.

This means that if Trump were to lose re-election, the program could be extended even longer.

Nonetheless, open-borders proponents lamented the ruling. Tom Jawetz, vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, said, ""it's a really devastating day for hundreds of thousands of people who have lived and worked in the country lawfully for decades.""

The case is all but certain to face additional litigation and could potentially end up before the Supreme Court.

Pelosi pushes bill banning lawmakers from trading stock,"House Democrats introduced the so-called ""Combatting Financial Conflicts of Interest in Government Act"" on Tuesday, which would ban federal personnel from trading stocks. The legislation has been presented as a potential remedy to previously reported conflicts of interests on the Hill and as a means to prevent more abuses from taking place in the future.

The bill

This legislation, if passed, would apply to: members of Congress; each officer or employee of the legislative branch; the president; the vice president; presidential appointees; federal judges; members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve; and the president of the Fed. Additionally, these individuals' spouses and dependent children would be implicated in the ban.



Prohibited from trading and owning securities, commodities, futures, cryptocurrencies, digital assets ""or any comparable economic interest acquired through synthetic means,"" these persons would be required to either divest their holdings or place them into a qualified blind trust.

Those who violate the restrictions will be subject, at the discretion of the supervising ethics office, to a penalty of $1,000.

If, however, that violation continues for more than 30 days after the notice, then for each subsequent 30-day period after the date of notice, the offender will be fined an additional $1,000 plus ""an amount equal to 10 percent of the value of the covered investment that is the subject of the violation.""

The problem

The New York Times published findings earlier this month revealing that at least 97 members of Congress were guilty of such conflicts, whereby they bought or sold stock, bonds, or other financial assets that ""intersected with their congressional work.""

For instance, among California Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna's trades in 897 companies, there were found to have been 149 potential conflicts.

While sitting on the Agriculture Committee, Khanna had reportedly traded in the agricultural company Deere & Co., among several other impacted companies.

While on the Armed Services Committee, his trades included Boeing, General Electric, and Raytheon Technologies.

While sitting on the Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, Khanna traded in Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, and a host of other effected companies.

Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) traded in Intel and Applied Materials when sitting on the Science, Space and Technology Committee.

Rep. Alan Lowenthal (D-Calif.) traded in Vivint Solar, Sempra Energy, Vistra, and other energy companies when sitting on the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources.

While on the Transportation Committee, Lowenthal saw fit to trade in Uber, Boeing, and General Motors.

The proposed remedy

Although Speaker Nancy Pelosi had shot down the initiative last year, she directed Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) to draft the bill in February.

Support for the bill had initially multiplied when it was revealed that Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) dumped stocks after a classified briefing discussing the COVID-19 threat at the outset of the pandemic.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) indicated at the time of Pelosi's February announcement that he would consider supporting the ban.

Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said, ""Year after year, politicians somehow manage to outperform the market, buying and selling millions in stocks of companies they're supposed to be regulating. ... Here's something we can do: ban all members of Congress from trading stocks and force those who do to pay their proceeds back to the American people.""

Hawley insisted, ""It's time to stop turning a blind eye to Washington profiteering.""

Despite indications earlier this year that the bill would be brought forth, there was nevertheless prolonged delay.

Days after the New York Times highlighted that her husband Paul Pelosi had bought and sold between $25 million and $81 million worth of stocks between 2019 and 2021(including some tied to businesses impacted by congressional scrutiny and action), Pelosi was asked why it had taken several months to materialize.

Pelosi indicated there had been a great deal of back-and-forth about its language, but that its latest iteration had come out ""strong.""

The deadline

The House reconvened Wednesday, one of three days of legislative business left before the midterm elections. Lawmakers will bail out of Washington on Friday, not to conduct business again until November.

Therefore, if the bill, introduced at the last moment, is not passed this week, then it will have to wait for months to be considered. In that time, the body of the House may significantly change.

If Pelosi returns in November, it may not be as House speaker. A Republican majority in the House may spare her from having to worry about the passage or application of this bill.

Going out of style

The Hill reported that Pelosi's international travels over the past year have amounted to her ""swan song.""

There have been indications that she seeks to become U.S. ambassador to Italy. The post, which is presently unfilled but for a temp, chargé d’affaires ad interim Shawn Crowley, is regarded by some to be the desired soft landing for the first Italian-American to lead the U.S. House.

An anonymous source recently told Fox Business Network that the job is Pelosi's if she wants it.

Besides the appeal of the embassy in Rome, which boasts a three-story, $1.1 million wine cellar, a private theater, swimming pool, and tennis court, parking Pelosi overseas may prove politically expedient for House Democrats, providing them with a less contentious leadership transition.

As ambassador — which, as a presidential appointment, consequently falls under the proposed ban — Pelosi would still be banned from trading, although it is possible she may no longer want to.



Pelosi was exempt from the New York Times' analysis of conflicts of interests since ""her disclosure filings were not flagged"" as she ""does not sit on any legislative committees."" Nevertheless, while she sat in Congress, her husband Paul had notably good fortune in the market, such that some have thought him the beneficiary of more than just the gift of preternatural prescience.

Recently, Paul Pelosi picked up between $1 million and $5 million in Nvidia shares (~20,000 shares) on June 17. His investment in the computer chip company was shortly followed by congressional moves to pass over $70 billion in corporate subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production, prompting his shares to soar in value.

Paul Pelosi bought nearly $10 million in Microsoft shares through call options on March 19, 2021, days before the company was awarded a contract by the U.S. Army valued at $22 billion. By April, the stock had jumped 12%.

Just prior to Biden signing an executive order to replace the federal automobile fleet with electric vehicles, Paul Pelosi bought $1 million in Tesla stock. The Washington Times reported he had made a 21% on his investment.

Paul Pelosi has also made significant bets on Amazon, Apple, and Google, which are among the tech behemoths Nancy Pelosi is supposed to regulate.

Nancy Pelosi has an estimated net worth of over $100 million. Her annual salary is approximately $200,000.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nikki-haley-delivers-fiery-final-un-speech,2022-09-28
"CDC: Face masks with vents, valves don't prevent spread of coronavirus","The Centers for Disease Control now says that face masks with vents or valves — like the ones medical professionals sometimes wear to protect themselves from COVID-19 — don't prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

What are the details?

In health guidance issued last week, the CDC quietly announced that such masks can, in fact, increase the amount of ""expelled respiratory droplets that can reach others.""

The guidance reads, ""The purpose of masks is to keep respiratory droplets from reaching others to aid with source control. However, masks with one-way valves or vents allow air to be exhaled through a hole in the material, which can result in expelled respiratory droplets that can reach others.""

""This type of mask does not prevent the person wearing the mask from transmitting COVID-19 to others,"" the guidance adds. ""Therefore, the CDC does not recommend using masks for source control if they have an exhalation valve or vent.""

Dr. John Whyte, chief medical officer of WebMD, told Fox News in a recent statement that not all masks are created equal.

""Although there is some feeling that any type of mask is better than none, it's really not that helpful when one isn't wearing a mask correctly or wearing one that is ineffective, and may not even realize it,"" Whyte said. ""These recent guidelines from the CDC are helpful in helping people choose masks.""

He added, ""I know everyone wants comfort when wearing a mask. The key for protection is a good seal — thereby keeping as many infectious particles that we can from affecting other people. Sometimes that seal makes our glasses foggy or causes humidity. The problem with the valves is that although the prevent particles from coming in, they allow particles to come out — defeating the purpose of infection control. Masks with vent decrease the effectiveness of the seal.""

Anything else?

On Wednesday, the the Washington Post reported that several U.S. airlines have outright banned the use of valved masks.

The same day, Alison Taylor — chief customer officer at American Airlines — issued a statement on the move, saying, ""Wearing a face covering is a responsibility we all share. An effective covering, worn properly, is one of the best ways we can control the spread of COVID-19 to protect our team members and customers. Since American began requiring face coverings in early May, the vast majority of customers have welcomed our continuing efforts to strengthen the policy based on the CDC's guidance.""

The airline company says that masks that fit snugly against a wearer's face, which covers their mouth and nose completely, are acceptable — but that vented or valved masks are not permitted.

NPR hit with universal scorn over 'pathetic and insulting' article offering self-care tips for anxiety from war headlines,"An article from National Public Radio was hit with universal scorn because it detailed the self-care people might need in order to deal with the traumatizing headlines from the war in Ukraine.

""Russia’s attack on Ukraine means there’s a stressful news cycle ahead of us. The reality of conflict is always a shock to the system,"" read the tweet from NPR on Friday as Ukrainian citizens were defending their country against an overwhelming Russian invasion.

The article from NPR's ""Life Kit"" offered helpful suggestions about self-care while sitting at home reading about brave Ukrainian patriots dying in the streets to protect their families.

""Maybe this is the time that you finally recreate a family recipe, or maybe you learn how to make a prettier pie, or maybe you just lose yourself to a kitsch reorganization,"" read one of their recommendations.

The article was excoriated universally by those from both sides of the political divide.

""The stupidest thing NPR has ever proposed, and that's saying a lot,"" replied Politico columnist Jack Shafer.

""These people really do not envision their audience as grown adults. And maybe there's a reason for that,"" responded Dan McLaughlin of National Review.

""This sort of discourse drives me absolutely bananas and I think it is a direct result of media being increasingly dominated by people from super-privileged backgrounds,"" opined Jesse Singal in a tweet that garnered over 2,300 likes.

""I'm all for mental health awareness and therapeutic care. This thread provides for neither. It's just a lifestyle guide for narcissists,"" tweeted Daily Beast editor Anthony Fisher.

""Ukrainians: must cope with bombs raining down on them. Americans: must cope with hearing sad news. This is really a silly thing for a news organization to do, IMHO,"" said Yale professor Nicholas Christakis.

""The Ukrainian government is handing out AK-47s and NPR is handing out listicles about holistic ways to alleviate your doomscrolling anxiety,"" mused commentator Noam Blum.

""This is pathetic and insulting. You NEED to be stressed and Distressed by atrocity, calamity and tragedy not breathe deeply and bury yourself in pasta,"" said another critic.

While NPR readers sought for self-care, the Ukrainian president warned on Friday that the fate of his country was to be decided soon as Russian forces appeared ready to pounce on Kyiv, their capital city.

VIDEO: Outraged mother shouts down NY school officials for holding maskless students in the library,"The enraged mother of a student attending a Nassau County, New York, high school shouted down administrators on Tuesday after discovering her daughter had been held in the school library all day because she refused to wear a mask, a trending video on social media showed.

""Nobody locks my kid in a g*****n library!"" the mother shouted in the video, posted on social media by the channel Libs of Tik Tok. ""This is not a detention camp, this is an educational facility!""

The video quickly sparked a firestorm on social media as commenters debated whether it was appropriate for the school to separate and move maskless students into the library.

In a subsequent tweet, Libs of Tik Tok identified the district where the incident allegedly took place as Manhasset Union Free School District. Manhasset is a hamlet on the North Shore of Long Island, about a 20-minute drive from Queens, New York. Soon after the tweet was posted, the district disabled comments and eventually deleted its Twitter account.

As the incident played out, New York state was in the midst of a legal back-and-forth over Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul's mask mandate. On Monday, a Nassau County judge struck down the governor's mask mandate. However, just one day later, another judge granted the state an ""interim stay"" on the matter, keeping in place the mask mandate until the end of the week.

The incident evidently caused enough of a stir to attract law enforcement. A WNBC-TV reporter said that Nassau Police showed up at the school following the students' refusal. The police, however, said students were not forced to remain at school.



TheBlaze was able to reach the district for comment and confirm that district officials had, in fact, moved a handful of students into the library after they refused to wear masks. Though the district maintained that students were only forced to remain in the library if they chose to remain at school.

In a statement, Acting Superintendent of Schools Dr. Gaurav Passi blamed the incident, in part, on the confusion surrounding whether the mask mandate in New York had been struck down or not.

""We share the community’s frustration with the conflicting messages from governing authorities and their legal counsel. It is understandable that there was great confusion today around the mask mandate,"" Passi said, adding that ""the vast majority of students at all three of our schools complied today with the District’s request to wear masks.""

He went on to say that ""less than a dozen students arrived at the Secondary School without masks and were provided with masks by our staff"" but ""a handful of students declined to wear masks and were asked to wait in the library while Building and District administrators considered the matter.""

""We met with the parents who had gathered at the Secondary School to ask for their understanding, patience, and cooperation while the District awaited clarifying guidance from the State,"" Passi continued.

""Given the confusion, we advised students and their parents that we would make the library available today for students who did not want to wear a mask. Several students at their option chose to remain in the library for the day, where they engaged in remote instruction for their classes,"" he added.

Manhasset UFSD was far from the only district in the state to experience confusion over the court orders.

Now worker is charged with murder — but his boss says it was self-defense.","A 61-year-old New York City deli worker was charged with murder after security video showed him allegedly stabbing to death a man who physically attacked him behind the store's counter last week.

But the deli owner says his employee — who was being held Tuesday in Rikers Island on $250,000 bail, the New York Post reported — acted in self-defense.

What are the details?

A woman tried to use a benefits card to buy potato chips for her 10-year-old daughter around 11 p.m. Friday at the Bluemoon Convenient Store in Harlem on Broadway near West 139th Street, the New York Daily News reported.

The transaction was declined, the Daily News said, citing the criminal complaint.

Amid an argument, prosecutors said deli worker Jose Alba reached over the counter, grabbed the girl’s hand, and yanked the chips away, the paper reported.

Alba's boss — deli owner Maad Ahmad — told the Daily News the mom became enraged: “The lady threw everything from the counter and the [benefits card reader] machine, too. She said, ‘I’m going to get my man, and he’s going to get you.’”

The mother then came back inside the deli with Austin Simon, who got behind the store's counter to confront Alba, the paper said.

Security video shows Simon shoving Alba into product shelves, after which Alba — sporting a baseball cap, glasses, and a white mustache and beard — appears to slide down the shelves into a seated position.

The Daily News said Simon actually shoved Alba hard into a chair that hit the merchandise shelves.

“Jose said ... ‘I don’t want any problems,’” deli owner Ahmad recounted to the paper.

Simon then grabs Alba by the neck, pulls him up, and begins to walk him out of the area behind the counter.

With that, Alba grabs a knife that the paper said was stashed behind the counter and starts fighting back.

“He wanted me to come apologize to the girl,” Alba told a New York City police detective, according to the Daily News. “I took the knife we use to open boxes, and I stabbed him.”

Deli owner Ahmad added to the paper that Simon “pushed Jose first. Jose was just defending himself.”

The Daily News said Alba stabbed Simon at least five times in the neck and chest.

The paper — citing the criminal complaint — added that Simon’s girlfriend grabbed a knife from her purse and stabbed Alba in the arm.

Video shows Alba checking out what appears to be stab wound on his bloody left arm.

“Isn’t she being charged, too?” deli owner Ahmad wondered, according to the Daily News, which added that police confirmed only Alba was arrested.

Here's security video of the fight. Content warning: Graphic video.

What happened next?

EMS crews took Simon to Harlem Hospital where he was pronounced dead, WNBC-TV reported. Simon was 35 years old, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.

Alba was arraigned Saturday on a second-degree murder charge, the Daily News said. He also was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, police told WNBC, adding that Alba is due back in court Thursday.

The Daily News said a spokesman for the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg didn't say why Alba wasn't charged with a lesser offense given video showing Simon acting aggressively.

While Alba claimed self-defense, the Daily News — citing a police source familiar with the case — said investigators believe Alba and Simon were equally involved in the conflict.

Lawyers weigh in

Two lawyers told the Daily News the case against Alba is far from a sure thing.

“Did he go overboard? Some people will say no,"" defense lawyer and law professor Hermann Walz told the paper. ""Are 12 people going to say this guy’s a murderer? I don’t think so.”

Criminal attorney Dmitry Shakhnevich added to the Daily News that Alba’s testimony could decide the case: “Will the defendant be able to testify that this person did something, acted in some way ... that necessitated a response with equal force? That will be the question.”

Alba faces 25 years to life if convicted, the paper said, adding that a lawyer with the Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem represented Alba at his arraignment.

Anything else?

A friend described Alba as a father of three sons and a hard worker whose job often forces him into difficult situations, the Daily News said.

“That bodega is open all hours, and a lot of weird people come in,” the friend told the paper. “Jose had to be tough. Let’s be real. That guy came around the counter to do what?”

This story and its headline have been updated to reflect that Simon was 35 years old and Alba is 61 years old.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/npr-selfcare-war-headlines-twitter,2022-07-06
NYC education meeting turns into parody of woke politics as members rip each other about white supremacy,"A New York City Community Education Council video conference devolved into a parody of woke politics recently as virtue-signaling members presiding over some of Manhattan's wealthiest neighborhoods elected to insult and lecture each other on white supremacy for 90 arduous minutes rather than discuss their children's education.

The main feature

The highlight of the already-tense meeting was a shouting match between two members over whether one member — himself a white male — was ""racist"" for daring to hold his friend's black infant nephew on his lap during a previous meeting.

The accused member, Thomas Wrocklage, demanded that his accuser, Robin Broshi, explain how his actions were inappropriate.

Then this happened:

""It hurts people when they see a white man bouncing a brown baby on their lap and they don't know the context,"" Broshi charged. ""That is harmful! That makes people cry. That makes people log out of our meetings.""

Despite the outrageousness of her comments, no other council members chose to interject.

Amazingly, Broshi had already been scolded earlier in the meeting for insulting the wokeness of another member. After facing backlash, she acknowledged, ""I have 40-plus years of white supremacy I need to undo.""

But apparently her own personal white guilt didn't stop her from tearing into Wrocklage.

What's ironic about the June 29 meeting, posted to the council's Manhattan District 2 YouTube channel, is that one of its primary goals was to address the dysfunction and division regularly taking place at the meetings.

It's safe to say that agenda item will need to be revisited.

What else?

Commenting on the entirety of the meeting, the Atlantic's Conor Friedersdorf wrote that ""it's too long and tedious to be a parody but it could hardly be more outlandish if it was.""

He added that nothing discussed in the meeting ""could conceivably help any school or school child"" because nearly the whole 90 minutes was spent ""in an absurd struggle session accusing one another of microaggressions & demanding apologies of one another.""

""Unforgivable amounts of time are spent arguing about whether it was racist for one white guy to briefly hold his friend's baby of color on his lap while on Zoom during the prior meeting,"" Friedersdorf adds in another tweet.

Finally, toward the very end, a few of the more ""conflict-averse"" members chime in with some sanity, pleading for unity so that work can be done on behalf of the children.

But alas, at that point it was too little too late.

"NYC restaurant owners flummoxed by new, inconsistent dining edicts as the government continues to contradict itself","Restaurant owners have borne the brunt of COVID restrictions during the pandemic — and very few cities have seen more severe and inconsistent new regulations than New York City.

Now, more New York City restaurant owners are publicly pointing out the lack of consistency in the dining shutdown policies in a city where — according to the governor's own data — bars and restaurants are responsible for just 1.43% of the virus' spread.

The contradictions these businesses are facing as New York governmental agencies cannot get their orders straight have made life nearly impossible for entrepreneurs seeking just to stay afloat.

What are the restaurants doing?

After getting completely shut down last spring, New York City restaurants began slowly reopening with limited crowds over the summer and early fall. To cope with diminished indoor seating options, eateries created outdoor dining areas, which worked fairly well as long as the weather cooperated.

On Friday, Dec. 11, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) declared that all indoor dining in the city would have to close as the virus was surging again. Shortly after the governor issued his edict, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) threatened that if people didn't get the virus under control, the city could be facing a ""full shutdown.""

And once again, Gotham eateries got creative and made major investments in attempts to expand outdoor dining and offer more takeout and delivery options.

Then on Thursday, the city issued a new ""COVID-19 Dining Update"" for restaurants, the New York Post reported. Included in that update was a ban on restaurant employees eating inside the restaurants they work for during their breaks.

The city also added a new requirement for nighttime takeout — no more in-person orders, even if conducted outdoors. All such orders must now be placed via online or telephone. Also, orders can be picked up inside the eatery only before 10 p.m. — after that it's curbside only.

But the most controversial item on the COVID update was the declaration that patrons at a restaurant's outdoor dining area could not use the establishment's indoor restrooms. What made the new order even more strikingly egregious was the fact that New York was in the middle of serious winter weather with 30-degree temperatures and significant snowfall.

However, the Post reported, after significant pushback, the state reversed its bathroom ban.

The government can't get its edicts straight

The Post's Karol Markowicz has been watching the impact of government edicts on the Big Apple — from businesses to education to families — and her piece Monday revealed some of the conflicting standards city eateries are facing with Cuomo's new COVID orders that target New York City restaurants.

Markowicz interviewed restaurant owners in the Big Apple who are attempting to navigate the new regulations, and she determined that the ""new city diktats are just the latest serving of hell dished out to restaurateurs and their workers by a political class that continues to receive regular paychecks courtesy of taxpayers.""

One owner, Tina Plagos, who owns three establishments, said she hasn't turned a profit in 10 months.

""We haven't had a profit since February and have bought air purifiers, heaters, a ton of extra cleaning supplies, masks, hand sanitizer and have spent thousands to build and rebuild the outdoor seating area,"" she told Markowicz.

But according to Plagos, what is really maddening about the new COVID edicts is that apparently restaurants are dangerous only if they are located within the boundaries of New York City.

""In Long Island, customers can sit and eat at the bar six feet apart, but in New York City, no one is allowed near the bar,"" Plagos said. ""You can't order a drink at the bar, let alone eat at the bar.""

Rafi Hasid, another multi-location restaurant owner, told Markowicz he has spent at least $10,000 per site to keep up with the ongoing and ever-shifting regulations.

But worst of all, the government continues to contradict itself, as agencies give conflicting messages on what is allowed and what is not for outdoor dining.

""In the beginning, they said they're going to allow propane heaters. But then they said you can't have them on the street side or on the outside of the sidewalk,"" Hasid said. ""Then they said you can't keep the propane tanks on your property and must store them at a different location every night. So that was a wasted purchase.""

And heaters weren't the only area he saw major conflicting messages from officials.

""We capsuled the outdoor seating, so every table has its own personal area,"" he said. ""The Health Department said it's good. Then the Fire Department said we need a door, and it should be closed. Then yesterday, we got an e-mail from the city that the door can't be closed, because the space needs to be open on two sides. We keep investing money but what's the criteria to open indoor dining again? We have no idea.""

Restaurant owners continue to cry for help, asking a city and state that apparently won't listen.

""Restaurants are mainly family-owned and made up of mainly minorities,"" Plagos told Markowicz. ""They aren't corporate America. We were living the American dream of working hard and taking care of our families, and now they took that right away from us.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-deli-worker-murder-charge,2020-12-21
"NYC veterans vow to sue city if Memorial Day parade is barred, point out Black Lives Matter protests and cannabis event were permitted: 'Slap in the face'","A veterans' group is threatening to sue New York City if they are not permitted to hold its annual Memorial Day parade. The United Staten Island Veterans' Organization was denied a permit for the parade, and the group is highlighting a double standard. American military service members are barred from marching in a patriotic parade, yet Black Lives Matter protesters were not only allowed, but encouraged, to hold protests throughout the city for the last year.

This year's Memorial Day parade would be the 102nd running of the distinguished procession to celebrate American service members. This year's parade was specifically going to honor Gulf War veterans since it is the conflict's 30th anniversary.

The United Staten Island Veterans' Organization, an association of 16 local veterans' groups that has sponsored the annual event for decades, filed a request for a parade permit with the New York Police Department on Feb. 27, according to Staten Island Live. The vets' group estimated that approximately 1,000 participants would ""march down Forest Avenue from Hart Boulevard to Greenleaf Avenue, a 18-block stretch of the leafy commercial street in West Brighton,"" the New York Post reported. However, the NYPD denied their request to hold the parade.



The Memorial Day parade was denied because of Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's executive order signed last year restricting public events due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The United Staten Island Veterans' Organization points out that Black Lives Matter protests, which have at times escalated into violent riots, have been allowed since May 28, 2020, in reaction to the death of George Floyd.

Last June, thousands gathered in June for a black transgender lives rally in Brooklyn.



De Blasio even participated with a group that did not practice social distancing when they painted ""Black Lives Matter"" on a Manhattan street.

Last July, the far-left de Blasio argued that Black Lives Matter rallies were permitted while other events were not, ""This is a historic moment of change. We have to respect that but also say to people the kinds of gatherings we're used to, the parades, the fairs — we just can't have that while we're focusing on health right now.""

The United Staten Island Veterans' Organization note that the Big Apple hosted the New York City Cannabis Parade on May 1. About 200 weed enthusiasts marched down Broadway with a giant inflatable marijuana joint. The Cannabis Parade organizers received a permit from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and rally spokesman Stu Zakim gloated, ""We had a police escort the whole way, they shut traffic down, all that stuff.""

The marijuana event was not only allowed by New York City, but also had high-ranking government officials in attendance, including Democratic New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and Attorney General Letitia James.





The United Staten Island Veterans' Organization plans to sue the city over the decision to prohibit veterans from participating in the Memorial Day parade.

""Under the equal protection clause, it's unconstitutional for the city to pick and choose between groups like this,"" attorney Brendan Lantry, who is working pro bono for the Staten Island vets, said. ""There's a clear double standard going on here.""

""All we ask for is fairness under the law,"" John Haynes, CEO of the USIVO, said.

""It's a slap in the face,"" Jamie Gonzalez, a Marine infantryman who saw combat during Operation Desert Storm, said. ""For many of us, a parade is a form of closure. We gather together and support each other.""

""I'm incensed,"" Ted Cohen, an 82-year-old retired Air Force reservist, said. ""It's pathetic.""

""We have accommodated hundreds of marches, protests and other gatherings even without permits,"" NYPD Deputy Commissioner John Miller said. ""Any group where the event is planned, the NYPD was made aware and it was conducted peacefully has been accommodated.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-education-meeting-parody-woke-politics,2021-05-09
NYT reporter criticizes colleagues 'traumatized' by Jan. 6 riot in hidden camera sting,"New York Times reporter Matthew Rosenberg called media coverage of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol ""overblown"" and criticized his colleagues' response to the events of that day in a hidden-camera sting video released by Project Veritas.

Rosenberg, a national security correspondent for the Times, has extensively reported on the riot and accused former President Donald Trump and his supporters in conservative media of using ""a furious array of rumor, innuendo, partial facts and outright lies"" to create ""alternative narratives"" making excuses for the violent mob that trespassed at the Capitol Building. But in excerpts from a recorded conversation with one of Project Veritas' ""undercover journalists,"" Rosenberg admitted that the left has spun a narrative too, in the opposite direction.

“It’s not a big deal as they are making it, because they were making too big a deal. They were making this an organized thing that it wasn’t,” Rosenberg said in excerpts of the video published Tuesday.

He also said that the left's overreaction to Jan. 6 gave people on the right an opportunity to downplay what happened.

""The Left's reaction to it in some places was so over the top that it gave the opening the Right needed to start introducing the idea of, 'Whoa, these people are out of control. Like it's not as big a deal as they're making it.' Cause [the Left] were making too big a deal. They were making [Jan. 6] some organized thing that it wasn't. And that gave the opening for the lunatics in the Right to be like, 'Oh, well, nothing happened here. It was just a peaceful bunch of tourists,' you know, and it's like, but nobody wants [to] hear that,"" he said.

He also made comments acknowledging that there were ""a ton of FBI informants amongst the people who attacked the Capitol.""

NYT Reporter: Jan 6 Media ‘Overreaction,’ FBI Involved; Traumatized Colleagues are ""Fu*king Bit*hes"" www.youtube.com

Project Veritas did not disclose when the video was recorded, but founder and CEO James O’Keefe said it was filmed around the same time Rosenberg was working on an article titled, ""The Next Big Lies: Jan 6 was No Big Deal, or A Left-Wing Plot."" The article was one of several features published by the Times in January for the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 riots.

In other clips from the video, Rosenberg harshly criticized some of his colleagues for acting like ""f***ing b****es"" by claiming to have been traumatized by the violence.

""I know I'm supposed to be traumatized, but like, all these colleagues who were in the building, and they're young and are like, 'Oh my God, it was so scary,'"" Rosenberg said. ""I'm like, 'F*** off.'"" He also said that ""[the Times is] not the kind place I can tell somebody to man up, but I kind of want to be like, 'Dude, come on, like, you were not in any danger.'""

Rosenberg was one of several journalists the Times dispatched to cover former President Donald Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" rally. While he never entered the Capitol building, Rosenberg interviewed several protesters that day, including Bigo Barnett, the rioter who broke into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office and stole a letter from her desk.

In public reflections on his experience for another one of the Times features on the anniversary of the riot, he made very different statements, saying he too was ""scared"" by how ""the most ordinary people were often the most violent."" He even compared what he witnessed to overseas conflicts in military hot zones like Iraq and Afghanistan.

""I spent 15 years overseas in some fairly violent places – Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia. At moments, Jan. 6 was intense,"" he said in a Jan. 6, 2022, discussion with his colleagues. ""Not the entire day, and certainly not everyone who was there. But there were folks in the crowd who were ready to fight.""



According to Project Veritas, Rosenberg responded to the video, saying, ""Will I stand by those comments? Absolutely.""



In the video, O'Keefe promised to release additional videos featuring Rosenberg in the future discussing the ""turmoil and inner workings of the New York Times.""

Project Veritas and the New York Times are in the middle of a legal battle over whether the paper can publish certain memos and documents obtained from the nonprofit group. In a Feb. 10 court ruling, a judge said the Times could publish some documents but not other ones. Project Veritas is also suing the Times for defamation. The paper has accused Project Veritas of engaging in ""deceptive practices, including the use of fake identities and hidden cameras to embarrass liberals, the news media, and others.""

NYT forced to retract award-winning podcast about supposed ex-ISIS fighter after most of it is found to be fake,"The New York Times was forced to retract an award-winning podcast about a supposed ex-ISIS fighter on Friday after an internal review determined much of the story was fabricated.

What are the details?

The 2018 podcast series, titled ""Caliphate,"" centered on the tale of a Canadian man of Pakistani origin who referred to himself as Abu Huzayfah and claimed to have been a former member of ISIS who traveled to Syria to join the group before escaping its hold. It was pioneered by renowned journalist Rukmini Callimachi, a correspondent for the paper who is known for reporting from conflict zones in the Middle East.

In the podcast, Huzayfah even recounted in excruciating detail his participation in multiple atrocities on behalf of the terrorist organization; namely, the shooting of one man in the head and the stabbing of another before hanging his corpse on a cross. But, as it turns out, it was all a lie.

The Canadian man, who is actually named Shehroze Chaudhry, was arrested by authorities in September — two years after the podcast was released — for carrying out a terrorist hoax. Canadian police said they came to believe Chaudhry was lying about the whole affair after he gave contradictory reports regarding his activities with the terrorist group to American and Canadian news outlets. The news prompted an internal review into Chaudhry's claims by the New York Times.

In a new editor's note on the podcast page, the Times admits they ""discovered significant falsehoods and other discrepancies"" while reporting on the series but didn't press hard enough to verify the claims and decided to continue on with the project.

During the investigation, the paper ""found a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry and no corroboration that he committed the atrocities he described in the 'Caliphate' podcast,"" the note continued. As such, they concluded that episodes presenting Chaudhry's claims ""did not meet our standards for accuracy.""

What else?

In an interview with NPR about the retraction, New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet explained how the paper's over zealous interest in the story led to the major editorial mishap.

""We fell in love with the fact that we had gotten a member of ISIS who would describe his life in the caliphate and would describe his crimes,"" he said. ""I think we were so in love with it that when we saw evidence that maybe he was a fabulist, when we saw evidence that he was making some of it up, we didn't listen hard enough.""

He added in another interview posted by the Times on Friday that much of the blame for the erroneous reporting falls in the paper's leaders, which includes himself.

""When The New York Times does deep, big, ambitious journalism in any format, we put it to a tremendous amount of scrutiny at the upper levels of the newsroom,"" he said. ""We did not do that in this case, and I think that I or somebody else should have provided that same kind of scrutiny, because it was a big, ambitious piece of journalism. And I did not provide that kind of scrutiny, nor did my top deputies with deep experience in examining investigative reporting.""

Shortly after its release, ""Caliphate"" hit the top spot on Apple's list of most downloaded podcasts and later won an Overseas Press Club prize and a Peabody Award.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-veterans-memorial-day-parade,2020-12-18
Transgender writer for NY Times rips conservatives who don't view 'Rudolph' as 'queerest holiday special ever',"""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" was called out by the Huffington Post last year as ""seriously problematic"" for displays of bullying, racism, and homophobia — not to mention verbal abuse, sexism, bigotry, lack of acceptance, and even exploitation of workers.

But this year the iconic Christmas movie is apparently just fine — at least to Jennifer Finney Boylan, a transgender opinion writer for the New York Times.

Boylan's latest piece, in fact, declares ""Rudolph"" the ""queerest holiday special ever"" and notes that it's ""as LGBTQ friendly to me as any episode of 'Queer Eye' or 'Steven Universe' or 'The L Word.'""

More from Boylan's piece:

There's plenty of queer code in Christmastown. After Rudolph's red nose shines in his father Donner's cave, for instance, causing Donner a curiously profound mortification, the old man comes up with a fake nose for his boy to wear. You know: so as not to offend The Straights. [...]



Prospector Yukon Cornelius's sexuality doesn't enter into the plot, of course. But in a scene that was deleted from the 1964 original, we learn that even though he claimed to be searching for silver or gold, in fact, Yukon C. was looking for a peppermint mine. No further questions, your honor.



And then, there's Hermey the Elf. Beautiful and blond where all the other elves resemble bulbous-nosed Vulcans, all he wants is to be able to be himself (a dentist, in fact), instead of being forced to toil in Santa's soul-crushing toy factory. ""What's eatin' ya, boy?"" his boss asks. ""Oh, nothing,"" Hermey explains, ""I just don't like to make toys.""



His boss roars with disapproval, and the other elves cluck and go tsk-tsk. ""Not happy in my work, I guess,"" he says. Oh, Hermey. Tell me about it.



Sometimes I dream of seeing an elderly, grown-up Hermey making one of those ""It Gets Better"" videos, sending a message back to a younger generation of closeted elves that with luck, things can turn out all right, if only you can gain agency over your own life.

Conservatives apparently have a big problem with all of that

""I'm sure that conservatives who love this old holiday chestnut will be infuriated by this suggestion,"" Boylan writes. ""But if you watch the show without understanding that its central conflict is the way people who are different are constantly shunned and humiliated — well, I don't know what show you're watching.""

Oh, but the writer wasn't through with those who lean right.

""Conservatives seem to miss the point of a lot of things having to do with Christmas, actually,"" Boylan adds. ""Is it really possible that anyone can watch (or read) Charles Dickens's 'A Christmas Carol' without understanding its fundamental critique of capitalism? (Say this in your best Laura Ingraham voice: 'Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?') What do they suppose is meant in Good King Wenceslas' by the line, 'Ye who now shall bless the poor shall yourselves find blessing'?""

How did readers react?

Some readers agreed with Boylan's assessment:

""Thank you for your opinion piece. Our family watched 'Rudolph' last weekend with our transitioning 9-year-old. The subtext you described nearly screamed its existence out to me. The kids looked at me and said, 'Mom, you're crying? It's going to be OK.' Although they may not have gotten it, I sure did.""

""Like Ms. Boylan I wonder, how do conservatives watch 'A Christmas Carol,' 'The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,' or 'A Wonderful Life' and miss the meaning or think it must be about someone else. Do they cheer on the pre-visitation Scrooge and throw their shoes at the TV when he realizes how getting rich hurting others isn't the point of life? Do they embrace the thieving Grinch but dismiss the Grinch with a heart that does more than pump blood? Do they root for George Bailey to fail every year? How they can they celebrate the birth of baby Jesus knowing what he is to become: the greatest force for love, kindness, treating others with compassion and respect, and that wealth and selfishness are not the pathways to God or [heaven]. It is [hard] to imagine any one more liberal than Jesus and what he taught. He was such a threat tot he conservative establishment they had him killed. How do they miss all this and somehow justify their actions as being 'Christian'?""

But others did not see eye-to-eye with the author:

""Leave to a college professor to, incredulously, read politics and sexual identity into this utterly harmless children's Christmas classic. I've read this piece several times over now and am still struggling to understand whether she is serious or satirical. But if serious, she needs to understand that it was, and remains, nothing more than a simple story about being different. Not LGBTQ, not MAGA, just that and nothing more. To read more into than that is ludicrous. It's that simple.""

""As a nerdy, overweight, unathletic straight white kid, Rudolph speaks directly to my experience in trying to fit and avoid being 'other.' Rudolph is popular not because it is for one group, but because it's universal.""

""Being mistreated for being 'other' is a pretty foundational feature of human existence. It's okay to see your own experience reflected in it, but don't appropriate and make it all about you.""

""I long for the days when a cigar was just a cigar.""

NYU prof fired after his students complained they couldn't hack it warns not to 'coddle students for sake of tuition',"New York University students successfully petitioned to have a chemistry professor fired last month because they found his pre-med course too challenging. That professor is now speaking out about students' inability to ""take responsibility for failure"" and the danger of appeasing juvenile demands to be coddled.

Fired for expecting competency

84-year-old Maitland Jones Jr. is a professor of chemistry. Prior to teaching at NYU for fifteen years, he taught at Princeton University from 1964 until 2007, where he worked on over 200 papers, monographs, and books. According to Princeton's Office of the Dean of Faculty, the lab in which he experimented ""was an incubator of scientific and cultural exchange at all levels.""

Jones has a reputation as an academic who ""teaches the very knowledge he creates"" and whose classes, at least at Princeton, received rave reviews. As recently as 2017, he was celebrated as one of the ""Coolest Professors at NYU.""

The New York Times reported that last spring, 82 of his 350 undergraduate students signed a petition against Jones, claiming that his ""high-stakes course"" was too hard, going so far as to personally blame Jones for their poor test scores.



The petition said, ""We urge you to realize that a class with such a high percentage of withdrawals and low grades has failed to make students' learning and wellbeing a priority and reflects poorly on the chemistry department as well as the institution as a whole.""

According to the Guardian, the petition did not explicitly demand for Jones to be fired. Nevertheless, NYU deans terminated Jones' contract in August ahead of the fall semester.

Jones later wrote that the ""deans never revealed the contents of the petition to me so I was unable to refute it in any way. After several months of silence on their part, on Aug. 2 the deans fired me over the objections of the chemistry department. The administration summarily dismissed the grievance I filed.""

Paramjit Arora, a fellow chemist and colleague of Jones', told the New York Times, ""The deans are obviously going for some bottom line, and they want happy students who are saying great things about the university so more people apply and the U.S. News rankings keep going higher.""

Jones stated that while his ""reputation as a chemist and educator has not been seriously damaged,"" barring ""fair-minded support from departmental and university leadership,"" teachers will no longer be able to ""transfer their knowledge and experience to the next generation of students and teachers.""

Appeasing the complainers

The New York Times noted that extra to firing Jones, NYU officials tried to appease his former students, enabling them to withdraw from his class retroactively — in what Mark E. Tuckerman, the chemistry department's chairman referred to as a ""one-time exception"" — while also offering to review their grades.

Marc A. Walters, director of undergraduate studies, wrote to Jones ahead of his termination, indicating that NYU would ""extend a gentle but firm hand to the students and those who pay the tuition bills.""

Jones seized on this remark among others in a recent opinion piece he penned for the Boston Globe.

The veteran academic suggested that such interventions on behalf of students unwilling to confront their test score-illuminated shortcomings have a ""chilling effect ... on teaching overall and especially on untenured professors.""

Jones suggested that untenured faculty won't dare to ""give real grades"" and risk their careers ""at the peril of complaining students and deans who seem willing to turn students into nothing more than tuition-paying clients.""

The problem, in Jones' estimation, is not just the confrontation-adverse administrators who he indicated think of students chiefly as clients. The students complaining have also themselves to blame.

In his op-ed, Jones claimed that, during the pandemic when in-person classes were interrupted, he ""commissioned and paid for a series of 52 videos to substitute for canceled in-person lectures. Students rarely watched them. They performed abysmally on exams that would have seemed too easy only a few years ago.""

Despite failing to prepare and execute, many students who evidenced their need for help didn't seek it, certainly not by attending zoomed office hours.

Zacharia Benslimane, a Ph.D. student at Harvard who previously worked as a teaching assistant in Jones' course, told NYU, ""I have noticed that many of the students who consistently complained about the class did not use the resources we afforded to them.""

The incompetence amongst students was not, however, universal, just as the signers of the petition did not come close to achieving a majority.

Jones reported that while single digit scores became common ""and we even had zeros on exams ... 60 percent of my students still got As and Bs this past semester.""

While underperformers bottomed out, top students were allegedly performing better than ever.

'Tough love'

Concerning the underperformers, Jones wrote, ""Everyone hits limits at some point, and it is a vital life skill to use 'failure' to overcome and improve. Failure should become a class 'teachable moment.'""



The pandemic may have exacerbated the problem of incompetence and the refusal to address it, but, according to Jones, the problem goes back at least a decade.

""About 10 years ago, I noticed that students were increasingly misreading exam questions,"" Jones wrote. ""My careful attention to the wording or problems did not help much. Exam scores began to decline, as did attendance in the traditional large lecture section of the course.""

The solution, argued Jones, isn't appeasement but ""tough love.""

""Deans must learn to not coddle students for the sake of tuition ... They must join the community in times of conflict to generate those teachable moments,"" wrote Jones.

In addition to adults remaining resolute in upholding high standards, Jones emphasized that students ""need to develop the ability to take responsibility for failure. If they continue to deflect blame, they will never grow.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyt-retracts-caliphate-podcast,2022-10-23
"Obama-era standard that held businesses liable for contractors, franchisees, was too broad says federal appeals court","An Obama-era standard that maintained companies are liable for illegal labor practices by their contractors or franchisees was too broad, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. The ruling spelled a victory for business groups that have worked to get the standard overturned.

What was the ruling?

In a 2-1 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stated that a 2015 National Labor Relations Board decision did not properly define the criteria for reclassifying contract or franchise workers as so-called joint employers.

According to Reuters, joint employers must bargain with contract workers' unions and can be ""held liable for violating those workers' rights under federal labor law.""

Business groups have made it a priority to get the 2015 standard overturned, according to the report. That included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's largest business lobby. The organization maintained that the Obama-era standard ""threatened to upend supply chains and the franchise model,"" the report stated.

The current NLRB board has a majority that was appointed by President Donald Trump. In September, the board proposed a rule that would restore an earlier standard for determining when a company is considered a joint employer, the report states. The board expects to adopt a final rule by June.

Under the proposal, companies would be considered joint employers with their contractors or franchisees only if they can directly control issues such as hiring and firing workers and setting wages, according to Reuters.

What is the background?

In 2015, the NLRB maintained that more indirect control over – such as how is performed – was enough to establish joint employment.

The NLRB rejected that standard in a December 2017. But two months later, the decision was nixed because a board member appointed by Trump reportedly had a conflict of interest, the report states.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyt-transgender-writer-rudolph-queerest-holiday-special-ever,2018-12-31
"Ocasio-Cortez implies Pelosi's criticisms are racially motivated, calls it 'outright disrespectful'","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez escalated her public feud with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday, telling The Washington Post she no longer believes Pelosi's criticisms are solely political.

Pelosi has been critical of Ocasio-Cortez, as well as fellow freshman congresswomen Reps. Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) for their use of social media to air out criticisms of other Democrats. Pelosi has also downplayed their level of actual influence in the House.

What did Ocasio-Cortez say about it?

""When these comments first started, I kind of thought that she was keeping the progressive flank at more of an arm's distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""But the persistent singling out...it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful...the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.""

The decision to imply racial animus from Pelosi is a new frontier in a conflict that had previously been about political strategy and methods.

What has Pelosi said about them?

When the four freshmen voted against a Democratic border funding bill last month, Pelosi pointed out that their social media influence did not translate into real influence in terms of congressional support.

""All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,"" Pelosi told The New York Times. ""But they didn't have any following. They're four people and that's how many votes they got.""

Pelosi has also grown tired of so much Democratic dirty laundry being aired out on Twitter.

""You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it,"" Pelosi reportedly told Democrats during a closed-door meeting on Wednesday. ""But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that is just okay.""

According to The Washington Post, Ocasio-Cortez has not spoken one-on-one with Pelosi since February.

""There hasn't really been a relationship, to be frank. It's difficult,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyu-prof-fired-because-his-students-couldnt-hack-it-calls-for-tough-love-and-warns-not-to-coddle-students-for-sake-of-tuition,2019-07-11
Cop reportedly with New Jersey's Office of Public Integrity & Accountability arrested after trying to reenter seashore bar that kicked her out,"A sergeant with New Jersey's Office of Public Integrity & Accountability — which is part of the state Attorney General's Office — was arrested last month after trying to reenter a North Wildwood bar that kicked her out, PhillyVoice reported.

What are the details?

Danielle Oliveira, 32, allegedly tried to sneak back into Kennan's Irish Pub through an exit during a Fall Festival event Sept. 24, the outlet said, adding that bar staff and police warned her to not return. PhillyVoice said it's unclear why Oliveira was kicked out of the pub.



The Office of Public Integrity & Accountability ""is tasked with a dual mission: to investigate violations of public trust and to develop policies that would rebuild faith in both government and our criminal justice system. OPIA includes both criminal prosecutors and trained investigators, who work together to prosecute cases involving public corruption, criminal violations of civil rights laws, and illegal use of force by law enforcement officers.""

NJ.com said Oliveira is a sergeant with the state Attorney General’s Office, Division of Criminal Justice — and that a colleague told police at the scene that she‘s assigned to the officer-involved “shoot team,” which is officially known as the Office of Public Integrity & Accountability. However, the state Attorney General’s Office didn't address Oliveira’s duty status or assignment, NJ.com added.

PhillyVoice said portions of Oliveira's arrest were captured on police bodycam video obtained by Breaking AC, which first reported on the incident.



In the clip, another woman told police that Oliveira left the bar to take a call about a police-involved shooting that might have required her presence had the shooting been fatal. Breaking AC identified the woman as Lt. Cortney Lawrence, a colleague of Oliveira's in the public integrity office, PhillyVoice said.

But the AG's office website shows no record of a police-involved shooting on the night of Oliveira's arrest, PhillyVoice said, adding that there were no news reports of a police-involved shooting in New Jersey on Sept. 24.



After Oliveira was initially escorted from the pub, a patrolling officer reportedly saw bar staff trying to keep her out, PhillyVoice reported, adding that Oliveira allegedly remained near the bar's exit and continued to argue with staff.

""She kept causing a scene,"" one officer says to a colleague during the arrest.

Oliveira soon asked cops to send a female supervisor to the scene — and when one showed up and removed a handbag from Oliveira's shoulder, Oliveira cautioned the supervisor ""that's a f***ing four-grand bag.""

Oliveira told police she's a lieutenant with the New Jersey State Police, PhillyVoice said, adding that she reportedly had been in line for a promotion to lieutenant at the state Attorney General's Office.

The end of the clip shows a handcuffed Oliveira climbing into what's presumably a police vehicle, after which the door slams shut.

According to PhillyVoice, police said Oliveira would need ""someone sober"" to sign her out.

Now what?

NJ.com reported that the state Attorney General’s Office asked a county prosecutor to perform an independent review of Oliveira's arrest.

“In an abundance of caution and to avoid the appearance of a potential conflict, we have asked that the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office conduct an independent review of the incident,"" an office spokesperson told NJ.com.

Oliveira’s lawyer, Timothy R. Smith, told NJ.com his client was falsely arrested, and the local prosecutor should should drop the charge and apologize to his client.

Smith added to NJ.com that the charge police used — defiant trespass — is legally defective, as one cannot attempt a disorderly persons offense, and the video shows it. Police, therefore, falsely arrested Oliveira.

Oliveira has been a state investigator since 2013 and presently earns $101,606 annually, NJ.com said, citing state records.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/obama-era-standard-for-business-liability-for-contractor-labor-practices-was-too-broad-says-federal-appeals-court,2022-10-20
Ohio Republicans follow Florida's lead with bill banning sex education in grades K-3,"Republican lawmakers in Ohio have put forward their own version of Florida's ""Parental Rights in Education"" bill, legislation that prohibits teachers from giving lessons on sexual orientation or gender identity at younger grade levels.

H.B. 616, introduced by Republican state Reps. Jean Schmidt and Mike Loychik, states that no public school community school, or private school that accepts vouchers, shall ""teach, use, or provide any curriculum or instructional materials on sexual orientation or gender identity"" in kindergarten through third grade.

For students in grades four through twelve, discussion of these topics in ""any textbook, instructional material, or academic curriculum"" is restricted to material that is ""age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.""

“The classroom is a place that seeks answers for our children without political activism,” said Schmidt in a statement to the Columbus Dispatch. “Parents deserve and should be provided a say in what is taught to their children in schools.”

Her proposal uses similar language to the Florida bill that Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law last month, but there are important differences in how it is enforced.



While the Florida legislation opens schools up to face lawsuits if a teacher or school official violates the statewide standards and settles those suits in court, the Ohio bill creates an administrative process to resolve disputes over what is taught in the classroom.

The prohibition on sex and gender education in grades K-3 is enforced by permitting an individual to file a complaint against any teacher, school administrator, or school district superintendent who allegedly violates these standards. The accused would be granted a hearing by the state board of education to defend themselves, and then the Ohio superintendent of public instruction, a political appointee, will make an evidence-based decision on whether the accused person(s) violated the law.

An educator or school official found to have violated the proposed law could face suspension and the loss of state funding, depending on the severity of the offense.

H.B. 616 also bans teaching other ""divisive concepts,"" including critical race theory, the 1619 Project, intersectional theory, diversity, equity, and inclusion learning outcomes, and inherited racial guilt.

Democratic opponents of the bill are calling it another ""Don't Say Gay"" bill, repeating false accusations thrown at the Florida law that the Ohio bill is too vague and that it will harm LGBTQ+ students and unfairly penalize teachers.

State Rep. Brigid Kelly, a Cincinnati Democrat, fears that the prohibition on certain ""instructional materials"" will mean ""there can be no books of any kind that deal with any LGBTQ+ issues.""

""We’re not giving people access to the tools, the materials, the lessons they need to prepare children for the diverse world that exists,"" Kelly told the Columbus Dispatch in an interview.

Ohio teachers unions are also opposed to the legislation.

""Fundamentally, these bills are cynical attempts to use race and now sexual orientation and gender identity as wedge issues to cause division and sow conflict and ultimately to score cheap political points,"" said Scott DiMauro, president of the Ohio Education Association. ""Legislators that are promoting these kinds of agendas ought to be ashamed of themselves.""

The bill's supporters maintain that discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity are inappropriate for younger children and that laws are needed to keep such discussions out of the classroom until students are mature enough to have them.

""The real question is why do people want to sexualize kids at this age,"" said Aaron Baer, president of the Center for Christian Virtue. ""Children need time to develop and grow up and parents should be guiding these discussions.""

Oklahoma City teachers who were placed on leave for refusing mask mandate filing lawsuit,"Employees of the Oklahoma City Public Schools who were placed on leave for refusing to follow the district's mask mandate are planning to file a lawsuit.

Professional Oklahoma Educators executive director Ginger Tinney told KOCO-TV that the organization will represent six employees, including some teachers, who were punished over the mandate.

""It is a little awkward and tense, but, you know, obviously, the teachers are very upset. They're on paid administrative leave,"" Tinney said.

""So, you know, this is their whole career they've worked hard for. I mean, it's very serious. We're happy to represent them, and we'll just see what the courts decide,"" she added.

Tinney said the teachers were confused by conflicting orders from different authorities.

""The teachers are in a bad spot. Like, you have a state law that says one thing. You have a school person or school superintendent who disagrees with the law, and they pass their own rules,"" Tinney explained. ""So, a teacher doesn't really know what are my rights, what is the legality here.""

While Oklahoma health officials have called on the state's Republican governor to order mask mandates for children returning to schools, Gov. Kevin Stitt has resisted those calls. Some hospitals have imposed their own mandates on health care workers.

Oklahoma City Public Schools issued its own mask requirement as students began their second week of school.

On Saturday, hundreds of Oklahomans protested at the state Capitol against any vaccine and mask mandates.

Oklahoma is experiencing a resurgence of the coronavirus with a seven-day average of 2,200 new cases after the rate had plummeted to 110 new cases in June. Previously the highest seven-day average of new cases in the state was 3,900 in January.

""I think it's important that teachers know we, Professional Oklahoma Educators, have their backs,"" Tinney said of the teachers. ""If they get in tough situations, they need to know, 'Hey, there is help out there. We are there to help you.'""

"Rep. Ilhan Omar faces an unexpected Republican challenger in Minnesota — she’s a Muslim refugee, too","Controversial Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) will face an unexpected Republican challenger in this November's election — from a Muslim refugee woman like herself.

Dalia al-Aqidi, a journalist and former White House correspondent from Iraq, argues that since taking office in 2019 Omar has done nothing but seek to divide and undermine America, and that despite apparent similarities with Omar, she is nothing like the freshman Minnesota congresswoman.

""On the surface, we look the same. We're both women, refugees, Muslims, but we couldn't be further apart,"" al-Aqidi said in announcing her run for office.



""The difference is that while Dalia has used her life experience to expose oppression and boost the U.S, Omar has done the opposite — stoking fear, inspiring hatred, inciting violence, and embarrassing the U.S.,"" her campaign website states.

""To put it simply, Ilhan Omar needs to be stopped,"" al-Aqidi argues.

But al-Aqidi also views her and Omar's similar backgrounds as a strength of her campaign, telling Fox News that Omar won't be able to use her backstory as an identity politics ploy since the two candidates' backstories are ""basically the same.""

youtu.be

Al-Aqidi has spent most of her professional career working as a political journalist, working for Voice of America as well as spending some time as a White House correspondent for Alhurra, a U.S.-based Arabic channel that airs in the Middle East.

Her career has given her firsthand experience of Middle Eastern conflict, and she says she has come away with more appreciation for America because of it. This stands in contrast to Omar, al-Aqidi told Fox News.

""Every time she opens her mouth she says something either anti-U.S. or anti-Semitic,"" she argued.

""I am loyal to the country that gave me a chance, gave me a brighter future,"" she added. ""[Omar] continually tries to weaken the country and divide us.""

Al-Aqidi joins a large and growing field of candidates for Minnesota's 5th Congressional District seat. Already, businessman Lacy Johnson, special-education professional Danielle Stella, minister Lucia Vogel, activist Alley Waterbury, and former auto sales manager Brent Whaley are running on the Republican side of the ballot.

On the Democratic side, Omar faces primary challenges from community organizer John Mason and attorney Antone Melton-Meaux.

Since her election to Congress in 2018, Omar has come under scrutiny from many on the right side of the aisle over controversial remarks about Israel and seeming support for U.S. adversaries — as well as potential criminalactivity.

On Thursday, TheBlaze reported that at least three federal agencies, including U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, were reviewing evidence and considering criminal cases against Omar.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ohio-republicans-follow-florida-s-lead-with-bill-banning-sex-education-in-k-3,2020-01-17
OnlyFans reverses promised porn ban after social media outrage,"Controversial U.K. subscription service OnlyFans announced Wednesday that it had reneged on plans to ban pornography on its platform just six days after the company first publicized the intended policy change.

The service — which is widely used by sex workers who provide sexually explicit content to subscribers in return for payment — ignited outrage from subscribers and sex workers last week after declaring that porn would no longer be allowed on the platform starting Oct. 1.

But in a tweet Wednesday, OnlyFans thanked its followers for being outspoken and declared that the policy change had been suspended.

""Thank you to everyone for making your voices heard. We have secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change,"" the service said in a tweet.

""OnlyFans stands for inclusion and we will continue to provide a home for all creators,"" the company added.

In announcing the proposed ban last week, OnlyFans indicated its reasoning for the policy change was financial, not ethical. In short, banks were refusing to partner with the service.

""The change in policy, we had no choice — the short answer is banks,"" OnlyFans founder and CEO Tim Stokely told the Financial Times.

According to the Verge, Stokely also indicated that large financial institutions — including the Bank of New York Mellon, Metro Bank, and JPMorgan Chase — had begun flagging and rejecting wire transactions between OnlyFans users and subscribers. Other banking partners and payment partners had also reportedly pressured the service to drop its porn content.

The conflict with banks, however, appears to have been resolved and so the ban on porn has been dropped before it was ever officially introduced.

The initial policy change announcement, though perhaps being better for society as a whole, sparked immediate backlash from many sympathetic toward the sex work industry.

""I can only imagine how many sex workers are feeling blindsided and terrified for their incomes right now. This is a slap in the face to those who made OnlyFans what it is today,"" Huffington Post reporter Jesselyn Cook noted.

Teen Vogue reporter Kim Kelly added: ""OnlyFans would be nothing without the sex workers whose labor built it up into a major platform. Now it's tossing them aside, and removing a vital source of income from a population of workers who are disproportionately marginalized and have no protections under U.S. labor law.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oklahoma-teachers-mask-mandate-lawsuit,2021-08-25
OnlyFans ‘star’ raises eyebrows after saying she has ‘threesomes with God’ and her husband: ‘I'm having the best sex of my life!’,"OnlyFans star Nita Marie — who claims to be a Christian — says that she's ""having the best sex"" of her life due to her ""threesomes with God.""

What are the details?

According to a Tuesday report from the Sun, Marie told the U.K.'s ""This Morning"" that inviting God to be present for her sex life has brought her ""the best orgasms.""

The 45-year-old internet stripper who lives in Colorado told co-hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield that she had been asexual and celibate for seven years before she began ""rediscovering her sexuality,"" which she said brought her closer to God.

She said, ""I didn't have sex for seven years. That was the beginning, when I ended that relationship, of rediscovering my sexuality.""

Marie — who boasts nearly 1 million Instagram followers — was prompted, she claimed, by the Holy Spirit to begin soliciting people with her nude photos.

""Of course, most Christians want to do what's right in God's eyes, so there was a little bit of moral conflict happening,"" she admitted. ""But the answer that continued to come to me was actually two things — the first was that God wanted me to celebrate my body and love my body. ... The other thing that He said was that 'There will be some people who will never know about me,' meaning Him as God, unless I did this.""

Marie said that she ""insists"" that God joins her and her husband in the bedroom on a nightly basis.

""I know this is funny when you say to have a threesome with God, but it's really just inviting God into the bedroom,"" Marie said. ""I invited God to be part of everything, including my sex life. It's just like anything else, you can invite God to be part of anything in your life. ... I'm much more open to my husband when God is there.""

According to the report, she also explained that ""her other half isn't always aware of whether God is there or not.""

She concluded, ""I believe God is passionate — he is a lover.""



Marie previously added that she began taking her clothes off for the internet only with God's blessing and that he encouraged her to begin selling the X-rated photos to ""lonely"" people.

""I do feel like there are a lot of women in the community of adult modeling that have been shunned from church so I want to be a positive person,"" she continued. ""And there's also a lot of men that might subscribe to my page that are lonely and just need someone to talk to.""

What else?

Earlier this year, Marie — who reportedly rakes in approximately $1 million per year with her social media presence — told Jam Press that that God always supported her stripping.

""I asked God if I should continue stripping off and the answer was always yes,"" she insisted and argued that there's ""nothing wrong"" with embracing both sexuality and religion in the same breath.

""I believe that God wants women to look and feel great and to enjoy their sexuality,"" she reasoned. ""By empowering myself to feel sexy in my own skin, I allow others to do the same.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/omar-faces-republican-muslim-refugee,2021-10-12
"Oregon teachers unions insisted teachers get vaccinations before schools reopen, so the governor put them at the front of the line. Now, they're refusing to go back to work.","Teachers in Oregon demanded to be vaccinated before returning to the classroom, so their governor obliged by putting them at the front of the line — even ahead of the state's vulnerable senior population. Now, vaccinated educators, with the backing of their unions, are refusing to go back to work.

And everybody's angry — even the editorial board of state's giant liberal newspaper.

What happened?

Oregon Democratic Gov. Kate Brown took a big risk in January.

Recognizing the importance of schools reopening, she pushed teachers and school staff to the front of her state's COVID-19 vaccination line — even ahead of senior Oregonians — the Willamette Week reported.

The move came because the teachers unions in the Beaver State demanded that teachers and staff be vaccinated before returning to the classroom.

On Jan. 25, teachers and school staff began receiving their shots, while Oregonians ages 80 years and older were forced to wait until Feb. 7, the Willamette Week said.

The move was a ""bold"" one, according to the Oregonian, considering that seniors account for more than 80% of Oregon's COVID-related deaths.

Seniors, naturally, were upset by the decision, but Brown justified the move by focusing on the importance of reopening schools. But, as the the Oregonian noted in an editorial, ""her justification for this extraordinary decision falls apart if schools across the state don't actually reopen — a significant concern as some teachers unions question returning to in-person instruction.""

And Brown has reason to worry: The Oregon Education Association and the Portland Association of Teachers both are backing teachers who don't want to return to the classroom, the Willamette Week reported Wednesday, as parents grow more irate and educators' refusal to do their jobs.

Portland Association of Teachers President Elizabeth Thiel admitted to the Willamette Week that, yes, the union ""did ask for teachers to be vaccinated before a return to in-person learning. Because that makes sense.""

Now, she said, because they did not ask to be put at the front of the line, teachers are in a ""terrible position where we've been given a thing that is so needed in our community, that people are literally dying for not having access to, and then told, because we were given this, we need to go into live instruction, even though there are so many unanswered questions and concerns about whether that is going to cause an increase in community spread.""

She did not elaborate on how being moved to the front of the line somehow negated teachers' insistence that returning to the classroom was contingent upon receiving vaccinations.

Guidance from the Oregonian

The Oregonian had some advice for their readers when it comes to their governor and her gamble on teachers: They should ""expect and demand that she deliver.""

Unfortunately, Brown already appears to be disavowing responsibility for ensuring schools reopen. With educators receiving vaccines now, Oregonians should expect and demand that she deliver. A failure on Brown's part would be an unconscionable betrayal of the hundreds of thousands of seniors who are being forced to wait in service of a greater good.



While we disagree with the decision to postpone vaccines for older Oregonians, whose vulnerability merits prioritization, the die has been cast. We also believe schools can reopen safely even without vaccines, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reaffirmed last week, but recognize the political necessity of vaccinations to get schools open. [...]



But Brown has taken a hands-off approach to the brewing conflicts between school districts and their teachers unions, who are balking at returning to the classroom even with vaccines.

And the paper offered this advice to Gov. Brown:

Brown can start by publicly calling on teachers unions to commit to reopening schools this year, even if that means extending the year into the summer. She can ask teachers who have no intention of returning to the classroom to delay their vaccines and free up doses for those who will. She and the Legislature should also explore what legal tools they have to require vaccinated staff to return to the classroom. And she should remind them of how many essential workers in food processing plants, grocery stores, social service organizations and more have been going to work without the benefit of a vaccine because that's what being an essential worker means.

It's time for Brown, who ""sold out older Oregonians,"" to ""not sell out younger Oregonians,"" the paper said, and instead ""own the responsibility of getting it done.""

'They used our DNA of Jews being persecuted ... as an excuse to make an event': Orthodox Jewish leaders claim White House barred them from hate crime summit,"Some Orthodox Jewish leaders have cried foul after they say they were barred from attending a White House summit about hate crimes against minority groups.

On September 15, the Biden administration hosted a hate crime summit called ""United We Stand."" Though Rev. Al Sharpton originally requested the summit after 10 black people were murdered in a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, back in May, the summit was pitched as a means of publicly condemning hate crimes in all forms, including anti-Semitic attacks.

During his speech at the summit, President Joe Biden condemned the ""anti-Semitic bile"" uttered by white supremacists at the Charlottesville clash in 2017. He also claimed that a ""through-line of hate"" is endemic to American culture and that this hateful American instinct manifests in attacks against ethnic minorities, such as Mexicans and Chinese, and religious minorities, including Catholics, Mormons, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, and Jews.

Despite these professions of support for persecuted Jews, several notable Orthodox Jewish leaders say they weren't welcome at United We Stand. Orthodox Jewish Chamber of Commerce CEO Duvi Honig said that he attempted to contact administration officials three times to secure his place, but that no one ever responded to his requests.

Honig does not believe that the silence he received from the administration was a mere oversight.

""The question is, is [Biden] punishing the Orthodox community for supporting [former President Donald] Trump?"" Honig asked.

""The White House used hate,"" Honig added. ""They used us, our blood — they used our DNA of Jews being persecuted and attacked daily as an excuse to make an event and didn’t include Orthodox Jews, who were the number one [target of] hate and anti-Semitism.""

Honig is not the only Orthodox Jew who was not permitted to attend the event, either. Four Orthodox Jewish journalists from Ami magazine say they were similarly denied entry due to ""spacing constraints."" The White House claims there were only 40 press spots available total and that 50 applicants were vying for the 20 spots not already taken by members of the daily press pool.

Though it is unclear whether the White House actually denied the accusation that it had deliberately barred Orthodox Jews from United We Stand, according to the New York Post, the White House did point out that Orthodox Union leader Nathan Diament and panelist Joseph Borgen both attended the event and that Rabbi Moshe Hauer was invited but could not be there due to a scheduling conflict. Several other Reformed and Conservative Jews attended the event, including Jewish Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt.

However, Honig seems to view these Jewish representatives as the exceptions that prove the rule. ""One person trickled in!"" he said derisively in reference to Diament. He also noted that Reformed Jews are less likely to face persecution since they often do not wear apparel, such as a yarmulke, that would mark them as Jewish.

Still, Jake Turx, one of the four Ami journalists kept from the event, was satisfied with the explanations given by the White House.

""I’m relieved that we were able to reach an understanding,"" Turx said in a statement to the New York Post. ""The Jewish people have enough enemies as is. Thankfully the White House press shop isn’t on that list.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/onlyfans-star-threesomes-with-god,2022-09-22
Outraged university students protest against scholar-in-residence over tweet decrying bisexual Superman,"Outraged students at Christopher Newport University in Virginia protested against the school's scholar-in-residence over a tweet she posted decrying DC Comics for making their Superman character bisexual.

Students said the tweet made them feel unsafe.

""Reading her tweet, we felt uncomfortable and scared in a place we are supposed to call our home,"" said sophomore Abigail Honeycutt to WTKR-TV.

The tweet from author Sophia Nelson questioned the wisdom of marketing bisexual Superman to children.

""I don't get why this is necessary. I don't! What if Christian parents of children reading comic books don't want their kids exposed to bi-sexual characters? This is being pushed on kids,"" read the tweet. ""Then parents have to explain it. Most cannot!""

Nelson later deleted it but not before it stole the safety from the university students.

""I was sad and angry, and I would want the university to public denounce her actions. It's not what we stand for. It's not a community of excellence,"" Honeycutt said.

Christopher Newport University President Paul Trible released a long statement promising to change their policies to appease the students hurt by the tweet.



Christopher Newport intentionally creates and values our community of diversity, equity and inclusion. We have a powerful University statement about that. It is at the heart of who we are. We also value and protect freedom of speech, and have a powerful statement about that as well. Upholding that freedom is most important when it is hard – when ideas conflict and opinions differ fiercely. In this moment it is important that we live into both of these university commitments.

Trible said Nelson would be brought to the campus in order to have an open dialogue about her beliefs with the students she hurt with a tweet.

She will have an opportunity to share who she is, her views and opinions, and her heart. She will talk about why she tweeted what she did. We will listen. And we will share our views, opinions and hearts – the pain, the anger, and the questions. She will listen. She will learn what it means to be a part of this community. Everyone may never agree, but we will support our LGBTQ+ students and colleagues, listen, and talk, and learn how to be different, together.

On Monday, Nelson took to her Twitter to decry the ""cancel culture"" that had targeted her.

""We are cannibalizing one another with #CancelCulture it has to stop or I promise you in a decade or less America will no longer be America,"" tweeted Nelson.

""It's bullying. They are mean, nasty bullies. Vicious with their words, with intimidation and hatred in their hearts. And there is no excuse for ever bullying another human being because they made a mistake, messed up, misspoke, were just caught being simply human,"" she continued.

""There is a wave coming. A movement of sick and tired Americans. Tired of being pushed around and bullied, canceled, targeted, harassed for our faith beliefs, for our values, for our free thought and free speech,"" Nelson added.

Bottom line: There is a wave coming. A movement of sick and tired Americans. Tired of being pushed around and bullied, canceled, targeted, harassed for our faith beliefs, for our values, for our free thought and free speech. Today it's me in the crosshairs. Tomorrow it's you. 8/

Palestinian militants fire rockets at Israel as historic peace agreement is signed at White House,"A rocket attack launched by Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip wounded two people in Israel Tuesday as the Middle East's lone Jewish state signed an agreement to normalize relations with two of its Arab neighbors at the White House. The attack was apparently coordinated to coincide with the signing of the agreement.

According to an Associated Press report, the Israeli military said two rockets were fired from Gaza and one was intercepted by air defenses. Israeli emergency services treated two people for minor injuries from broken glass.

Earlier, Israeli Defense Forces issued an alert for rocket sirens sounding in Ashdod and Ashkelon, cities in the southern region of Israel near the Gaza Strip.

The Palestinians, ruled by the Islamic terrorist group Hamas, are opposed to the Israeli agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize relations without forcing Israel to cede its sovereignty over territory the Palestinians claim as their own. Historically, most Arab nations have sided with the Palestinians in this conflict, but the Trump administration managed to broker agreements that put aside the issue for now. The Palestinians consider this a betrayal.

The agreement signed at the White House, known as the ""Abraham Accords"" to honor the patriarch of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, declares peace and formally normalizes diplomatic relations between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain.

While the text of the agreement has not been made public, Israeli officials reportedly told The Jerusalem Post it will not go into effect until the Israeli cabinet ratifies the agreement and UAE officials reportedly said there will be references to a two-state solution.



President Trump declared the agreement ""the dawn of a new Middle East"" in a speech delivered at the signing ceremony.

""We're here this afternoon to change the course of history. After decades of division and conflict, we mark the dawn of a new Middle East,"" Trump said.

""Thanks to the great courage of the leaders of these three countries, we take a major stride toward a future in which people of all faiths and backgrounds live together in peace and prosperity,"" he said.

The president said the accord ""will serve as the foundation for a comprehensive peace across the entire region.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this moment marked a ""pivot of history"" and a ""new dawn of peace,"" praising President Trump for his work on the agreement.

""To all of Israel's friends in the Middle East, those who are with us today and those who will join us tomorrow, I say, 'As-salamu alaykum.' Peace unto thee. Shalom,"" Netanyahu said.

""The blessings of peace that we make today will be enormous,"" he continued, ""first because this peace will eventually expand to include other Arab states, and ultimately, it can end the Arab-Israel conflict once and for all.""

UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan added more optimistic remarks, saying ""We are witnessing today a new trend that will create a new path for the Middle East.""

But he also spoke to the Palestinian people, noting the Abraham Accords ""will enable us to stand with the Palestinians and enable their hopes of establishing a Palestinian state"" and thanking Netanyahu for ""halting annexation of Palestinian territories.""

Those overtures to the Palestinians may fall on deaf ears. According to the AP, in addition to the rocket attacks Palestinians expressed their outrage in the West Bank and in Gaza by trampling on and setting fires to pictures of Trump, Netanyahu, and the leaders of the UAE and Bahrain.

The peace accords were not well-received in Bahrain either, where the AP reports the Shiite opposition group Al-Wefaq released a statement condemning normalized relations with the ""Zionist entity.""



Nevertheless, President Trump has promoted the deal as the first step in reaching a broad agreement to secure peace in the Middle East. In an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning, Trump said his administration is negotiating with several other Arab states and predicted that Palestine ""will come to the table"" when everyone else is on board.

""They're actually getting to a point where they're going to want to make a deal. They won't say that outwardly. They want to make a deal,"" Trump said. ""Otherwise, they will be left out in the cold.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/orthodox-jewish-leaders-claim-wh-barred-event,2020-09-15
Palestinians attacked the tomb of Joseph in a 'frenzy of destruction',"The tomb where the biblical figure Joseph is said to be buried has been vandalized by Palestinians as violence and chaos continues to escalate in the region.

The site in Nablus was attacked in what Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett described as a “frenzy of destruction.”

The BBC reported that the tomb was vandalized Saturday as Israeli forces raided a town providing cover for a Palestinian terrorist who opened fire on a bar in Tel Aviv Thursday.

The Palestinian attack left three Israelis dead and 11 injured.

Videos posted on social media showed Palestinians vandalizing light fixtures hanging above the tomb and throwing chunks of rubble at the tomb itself.

The Israel Foreign Ministry tweeted, “On Friday, tens of thousands of Muslims prayed in Jerusalem on Ramadan. On Saturday, Palestinian extremists vandalized the holy site of Joseph’s tomb. Israel is committed to peaceful coexistence and to freedom of worship. Extremists must be shunned and condemned.”

The Palestinians reportedly also started fires in rooms adjacent to the tomb.

Brigadier Gen. Ran Kochav, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, said that the perpetrators were detained by Palestinian security forces.

PM Bennett said that the Palestinian rioters had “simply vandalized a holy place for us, the Jews” and vowed to bring them to justice.

The tomb is an important landmark in both Islamic and Jewish cultures. Jews believe it to be the resting place of Joseph, and Muslims view it as either the tomb of Joseph or the resting place of an Islamic cleric named Sheikh Yousef Dawiqat.

The tomb has previously been at the center of Palestinian caused violence in 2000 and 2015.

Nablus is under Palestinian control, so Jewish pilgrims typically can typically visit the tomb only after coordinating with the IDF. Last Monday, two ultra-Orthodox Jewish men — who reportedly had not obtained permission from the IDF — were shot and wounded while trying to visit Joseph’s tomb.

The Jerusalem Post reported that Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said that the scale of the IDF’s involvement in stopping terrorism is “dictated only by the operational need.”

Gantz indicated that the Israeli government is working to distinguish those who support terrorist plots and those who are active in carrying them out from the broader Palestinian population.

“We try to differentiate between the population and the perpetrators of terrorism, and between the different geographical environments,"" Gantz said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/outraged-university-students-protest-against-scholar-in-residence-over-tweet-decrying-bisexual-superman,2022-04-11
Pardoned former SEAL Eddie Gallagher attacks SEALs who testified against him as 'cowards',"Former Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who was pardoned of one war crime conviction and acquitted of more serious charges, posted a video on social media attacking the SEALs who testified against him as ""cowards,"" according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.

Gallagher published the video on Facebook and Instagram, and they appear to be promotional material for an upcoming, unspecified media project.

""For my entire adult life, I've had the honor and privilege of fighting for this country and your freedom,"" Gallagher said in the video. ""Even though I went to trial and exposed all the lies that were said about me by certain cowards in my platoon and found not guilty, there are those to this day who refuse to accept that fact.""

Some SEALs told the Union-Tribune that Gallagher violated norms and endangered SEALs and their families with the video, which identifies active duty SEALs, shows their faces, and even reveals their current assignments.



""Attempting to call attention to (those SEALs') status in the way it's been done does not serve the mission or the interests of the Navy,"" said David Shaw, former petty officer 1st class. ""To attempt to out (their) status raises questions about the decision to do so.""

Gallagher's lawyer said everything in the video had already been made public. The New York Times had previously published clips from deposition interviews during which the SEALs discussed what they believed were war crimes committed by Gallagher in Iraq.

Gallagher was accused of shooting civilians and killing a young ISIS captive by stabbing him in Iraq in 2017. He was acquitted of those charges, but convicted of taking a photo with the ISIS captive's corpse. He was demoted as a result, but had his rank restored by President Donald Trump after the conviction.

Parents accuse NYC Department of Education and Mayor de Blasio of attempting to 'silence' them,"New York City parents of children in public schools are accusing outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio of attempting to silence them.

In an op-ed for the New York Post, Maud Maron and Danyela Souza Egorov say that a proposed regulation would allow the city Department of Education ""to discipline and remove elected parents from Community Education Councils (our school-board equivalent) if they criticize the school district they are meant to hold accountable.""

The rule, Chancellor's Regulation D-210, prohibits discrimination and harassment and says ""conduct that violates this regulation may serve as a basis for discipline, even if it does not rise to the level of a violation of federal, state or local discrimination laws."" It would apply to all elected or appointed members of any of the 32 Community District Education Councils, or four citywide education councils in New York.

Its stated purpose is to ""develop and maintain a positive and supportive environment for elected and appointed parent leaders that is free of discrimination, harassment, bias, racism, and intimidation.""

But the parents write that the ""vague language"" outlining what kind of conduct is prohibited is too broad. They also criticize the rule for establishing an ""equity-compliance officer"" to enforce it.

""This (no doubt expensive) bureaucrat would be charged with deciding who to target for removal for violating the newly expanded 'code of conduct,'"" the parents write.

They charged that other provisions of the proposed rule are attempts by the DOE to ""censor speech it finds inconvenient.""

One section says council members cannot engage in “frequent verbal abuse and unnecessary aggressive speech” with others. The regulation also allows the chancellor to request a CEC member be removed if she believes the member’s conduct is “contrary to the best interest of the New York City school district.” Conduct that happens outside of CEC meetings or public appearances could serve as a basis for a complaint and removal, as long as the conduct “creates or would foreseeably create a risk of disruption within the district or school community.”



Even worse, an Equity Council, a team of DOE-appointed apparatchiks, would be tasked with providing recommendations on the resolutions of complaints — in other words who to remove and silence. The regulation ominously says that “in the event of a disagreement between the Equity Compliance Officer and the Equity Council, the recommendation of the Equity Compliance Officer shall govern.” Using equity language to cover up the undemocratic impulse to unseat critics is a transparent ploy.

The op-ed authors note that this rule is being proposed just after parents voted directly for CEC members, and ""flipped"" some councils by electing representatives who are vocally critical of DOE policies.

""While the DOE pretends this regulation is about protecting students, it includes language that is clearly meant to shield the DOE from any and all criticism from duly elected council members,"" they write.

The New York City Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Panel for Education Policy will vote on Chancellor's Regulation D-210 on Dec. 21.

Across the nation, parents have come into conflict with school boards over issues related to COVID-19 policies, the content of school libraries, accommodations for transgender students, and more. Some of these heated confrontations over the past year generated national media coverage. In response, the National School Board Association wrote to the Biden administration, requesting that federal law enforcement investigate incidents of violence and comparing protesting parents to ""domestic terrorists.""

That letter prompted many state school board associations to withdraw from membership in the NSBA, and the national body eventually issued an apology for the language used in its letter to Biden.

Passenger in rapper's vehicle accused of pointing gun at person amid pro-Trump rally in Beverly Hills — and is arrested on weapon charges,"A passenger in a rapper's vehicle was arrested Saturday on weapon charges after being accused of pointing a gun at a person amid a rally supporting President Donald Trump in Beverly Hills, California.

What are the details?

Beverly Hills police said they received a report just after 5 p.m. of an individual saying someone in a vehicle pointed a gun at him near South Santa Monica Boulevard and North Beverly Drive — and that he took note of the license plate. A vehicle with a matching plate was stopped after driving past the pro-Trump rally, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The vehicle's driver was rapper Offset, the Times said. Offset is the husband of famed singer Cardi B, known far and wide for the sexually charged song ""WAP,"" which glorifies woman as prostitutes.

Offset recorded part of the interaction with police on Instagram Live.

""You just watched somebody beat my car up with a flag!"" Offset tells an officer who repeatedly asks him to shut off the vehicle. But Offset insists on keeping his hands on the steering wheel and threatens to sue cops.

""Y'all know who I am?"" he asks police.

Soon officers unlock the driver-side door and pull Offset out. Here's the clip. (Content warning: Language):

What happened next?

Offset was released after questioning, the Times said. But passenger Marcelo Almanzar, 20, was arrested and charged with carrying a concealed weapon and carrying a loaded firearm in public, police said. Almanzar remained behind bars in lieu of $35,000 bail, the paper said, citing jail records.

There were multiple reports that Offset was arrested, but police denied those accusations.

Almanzar is reportedly a cousin of Cardi B, who also arrived at the scene at one point, the Times said, citing videos posted to social media.

The individual who told police a gun was pointed at him declined to press charges for that, police said.

'Aggressive Trump supporters'

An Offset publicist, Derrian Perry, told the paper in a statement that the rapper was detained ""following an attack by aggressive Trump supporters.""



BET, citing videos posted to Twitter, said just prior to the police stop, Offset and Cardi B. were seen making their way through a crowd where several people were waving Trump flags.

""Offset thanks his fans for their support and wishes everyone peace and safety during these trying times,"" the statement added, according to the Times. ""He encourages everyone to get out and vote because nothing changes if nothing changes.""

The paper also reported that Offset's representatives emphasized he was not the aggressor and that he complied despite having guns drawn on him and receiving conflicting directions from police.

""Offset's current focus is encouraging younger voters to get to the polls in order to keep incidents like this from continuously happening,"" a representative said, according to the Times.

Pastor faces backlash after dressing in drag on HBO show,"Pastor Craig Duke, who faced backlash after dressing in drag on the HBO program ""We're Here,"" has been relieved of his pastoral duties at Newburgh United Methodist Church in Indiana.

Emails from congregants started not long after the program aired Nov. 8, Duke said, according to Religion News Service, which noted that some of the comments that Duke got were positive. But others were not.

""Enough were so negative that — at the 'insistence' of Newburgh’s Staff-Parish Relations Committee, Duke said — he requested a new assignment from Bishop Julius C. Trimble of the Indiana Conference of the United Methodist Church,"" RNS reported.

Duke intended to head a six-week Bible study regarding sexuality at the church, according to the outlet. But Duke said an additional ""negative, bullying, attacking email from a church person"" that came on Nov. 14 ""flipped the tide.""

“It just got to the point where the conflict, the anger grew too much, and so for my mental health, too, I started to back away, and I told my district superintendent that the conflict was so much, it was at such a level from some, that I was unable to be an effective leader,” Duke said.

Mitch Gieselman, the superintendent of the South and Southwest District of the Indiana Conference, discussed the situation in a November note to the congregation.

""Rev. Duke is being relieved from pastoral duties effective December 1, 2021. He will not be available to perform any pastoral functions at NUMC. He and Linda will continue to reside in the parsonage until no later than February 28, 2022, but he will not be at the church in any capacity,"" Gieselman wrote. ""Duke will continue with a significantly reduced salary until no later than February 28.""

Here's more from the letter:

Craig has not “resigned,” nor has he been “fired,” as these are not actions that are consistent with our appointment system. While there is a diversity of opinion regarding the moral implications of Rev. Duke’s actions, he has not been found to have committed any chargeable offense or other violation of the United Methodist Book of Discipline.



In short, Craig has reached a place where he feels unable to continue to serve in parish ministry at present. During his time of being relieved from pastoral duties, he will be engaging in a process of renewal, reflection, and recovery that will be monitored by our conference Director of Leadership Development, Bishop Trimble, and myself. Our desire is to provide an opportunity for Craig to again be able to utilize his numerous gifts as a pastor in a local congregation. He will not, however, be returning to the NUMC pulpit.

A crowdfunding campaign meant to benefit Duke has already raised tens of thousands of dollars.

“The outpouring of support — not just in emails and Facebook and all those experiences, but also financially, which a group started and it’s just really been incredible and unbelievable — may lead us a different direction. We really just don’t know at this point,” Duke said, according to RNS.

Agitated Nancy Pelosi responds angrily to reporters before storming off briefing,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) angrily shut down a media briefing over questions from reporters about what exactly the Democrats were doing about the impeachment process.

The agitated Democratic leader was frustrated that reporters were requesting clarity about the conflicting statements Democrats had made.

""Do you concede now that the impeachment inquiry for Mr. Trump is underway?"" asked a reporter.

""Do I concede now?!"" she said angrily, mocking the reporter by repeating the phrase he used.

""Have you not paid attention to what we've been talking about? For months we've been saying that we're doing three things,"" she explained.

""We're investigating, we're legislating, as six committees have been doing for months, six committees have been working for months, and third, we are litigating, we are taking the work of the committees into the courts,"" she answered.

""How should the American people understand the work of this committee, when members are speaking very differently about it,"" the reporter pressed.

""You're the only ones who are sowing this!"" she exclaimed.

""That isn't true, ma'am!"" he replied.

In another series of questions, she grew angry when she was asked to ""set the record straight"" on ""mixed messages"" from various Democrats on impeachment.

""I have said what I'm going to say on the subject, that's it!"" she angrily answered.



""We are legislating, we are focusing on the work that we're here to do for the American people,"" she said.

Another reporter asked if she was ""uncomfortable"" with the term ""impeachment inquiry.""

Pelosi looked around in an exasperated fashion, as if angered that reporters kept asking about the same topic.

""We are on our path. Where it takes us, is where, we will follow the facts, that's what it is,"" she said after a few seconds.

""Why don't we spend some time going over to see [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and asking him why he doesn't want to save lives?"" she demanded.

""Why he will let every day go by where at least a hundred people, a large number of them children and teenagers die from gun violence?"" she asked rhetorically.

""Why is that you're hung up over a word over here when lives are at stake over there?"" she concluded before storming off.

Pelosi has been attempting to keep her caucus from running headlong into an impeachment inquiry, but many on the progressive wing of the party have clamored for more action ahead of the election.

Pelosi's archbishop: Prominent pro-abortion Catholics should be denied Communion​,"Although he declined to mention any specific public figure by name, San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone delivered a scathing rebuke to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), President Joe Biden, and other prominent pro-choice Catholics in a recent missive about the evils of abortion.

What are the details?

In the pastoral letter issued Saturday and titled, ""Before I Formed You in the Womb I Knew You,"" Cordileone took prominent Catholics who support abortion to task for their promotion of an act that the church holds to be a grave sin.

""Prominent figures in society help to shape the mores of that society, and in our culture their advocacy of abortion definitely leads others to do evil,"" Cordileone wrote. ""This must be stated with clarity: anyone who actively works to promote abortion shares some of the guilt for the abortions performed because of their actions.""

Pelosi, a high-profile Catholic who represents San Francisco residents in the U.S. House, has long-supported abortion in spite of the fact that it runs afoul of her church's teaching. After all, it is undoubtedly a winning issue for her politically in liberal San Francisco, and just as well, she has never faced religious discipline for it.

But Cordileone wants that to change. In his letter, the conservative archbishop argued that it is the responsibility of church leadership to ""correct Catholics who erroneously, and sometimes stubbornly, promote abortion."" In this case by denying them Communion, the church's holiest sacrament.

""Because we are dealing with public figures and public examples of cooperation in moral evil, this correction can also take the public form of exclusion from the reception of Holy Communion,"" the archbishop said.

""When other avenues are exhausted, the only recourse a pastor has left is the public medicine of temporary exclusion from the Lord's Table. This is a bitter medicine, but the gravity of the evil of abortion can sometimes warrant it,"" he added.

What else?



Cordileone's letter is the latest entry in an evolving debate the Catholic Church is having around how to handle Catholic politicians who adopt stances contrary to the teachings of the church, the Washington Post reported.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops are set to gather in June to vote on whether or not to draft a document on the Communion issue, though there have been numerous conflicting reports coming from within the organization about what exactly the document will look like.

Pressure is surely mounting as any forthcoming decision about Communion is bound to have far-reaching consequences. In fact, it could reach as far as the White House. President Biden, who regularly attends Catholic Mass, is also a vocal proponent of abortion access.

Anything else?

For Cordileone, however, the issue is rather simple.

""Abortion is the axe laid to the roots of the tree of human rights: when our culture encourages the violation of life at its youngest and most vulnerable condition, other ethical norms cannot stand for long,"" he wrote in the introduction to his letter.

""Our responsibility to the rest of the Catholic community is to assure them that the Church of Jesus Christ does take most seriously her mission to care for 'the least of these,'"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pastor-faces-backlash-after-dressing-in-drag-on-hbo-show,2021-05-03
Pelosi may delay Senate impeachment trial until McConnell agrees to 'fair' rules,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday that she may not send the articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial until at least January as the two parties attempt to negotiate an agreeable set of rules, according to Politico.

Even though the House of Representatives voted to adopt two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump (abuse of power and obstruction of Congress), the process doesn't actually transition to the Senate until the House names its impeachment managers — the people who will present the case in the trial.

Pelosi indicated that those managers will not likely be named this year, setting up a delay of at least two weeks or longer before the Senate takes over.

""We cannot name managers until we see what the process is on the Senate side, and we hope that will be soon,"" Pelosi said. ""So far we haven't seen anything that looks fair to us, so hopefully it will be fair.""

Democrats have pointed to comments from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) saying he would be coordinating with the White House on how to run the trial as a sign that the case will not get a full and fair hearing in the upper chamber.

Part of the conflict between Democrats and Republicans centers on whether Democrats will be able to call new witnesses. Democrats would want current and former Trump officials such as chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton to testify.

McConnell said he was not worried about a potential delay in the House transmitting articles of impeachment to the Senate, saying ""I'm in no hurry."" Notes from a Thursday morning speech indicate McConnell will speculate that Democrats might be scared to send their ""shoddy work product"" to the Senate.

The White House spun the delay as an attempt by Democrats to prevent President Trump from receiving his day in court.

""House Democrats have run a fatally flawed process with fake facts, and now they want to deny the president his day in court with another procedural maneuver that proves anew they have no case,"" said Eric Ueland, a White House congressional liaison.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-angrily-shuts-down-briefing,2019-12-19
Pelosi accused AG Barr of committing a crime — but she won't like CNN's fact-check on that claim,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) hit U.S. Attorney General William Barr with a serious accusation, but even CNN couldn't find much substance in her claim.

""The attorney general of the United States of America was not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States,"" Pelosi said. ""That's a crime.""

Pelosi was referring to statements Barr made while testifying to Congress about a letter he received from special counsel Robert Mueller about his report on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

She claims that he made false statements while testifying, but the CNN fact-check found that she would have a tough time getting a court to charge him with the crime of perjury.



Here are the two statements allegedly in conflict

On April 9, Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.) asked Barr if reports were true that members of Mueller's team were ""frustrated"" about his summary about the report, specifically, ""that it does not adequately or accurately, necessarily, portray the report's findings.

""Do you know what they're referencing with that?,"" he asked Barr.

Barr responded, ""No, I don't. I think, I suspect, that they probably wanted more put out.""

It was later revealed that Mueller himself had sent a letter expressing his concerns to Barr about his summary.

When Barr was asked why he had testified that he didn't know about the frustrations of Mueller's team after receiving a letter directly, from Mueller, Barr answered in what CNN calls ""less than fully forthcoming.""

He responded that he did not ""know what members (Crist was) talking about and I certainly am not aware of any challenge to the accuracy of the findings.""

CNN's fact-checker notes that the standard for perjury is very high, and the two statements from Barr, while not completely in agreement, do not rise to the level of an ""actionable lie.""

""Is that perjury? Or just fine-tuned spin, by a trained lawyer?"" asked CNN's John King.

Here's the report from CNN on Pelosi's claims:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-archbishop-abortion-denied-communion,2019-05-03
"Pentagon changes postwar policy to allow nuclear strikes against non-nuclear threats, breaking Biden pledge","The Pentagon revealed in its new ""National Defense Strategy"" that it will dispense with President Joe Biden's pledge only to use nuclear warheads to deter or respond to a nuclear attack. Instead, the U.S. will now deploy nuclear weapons to ""deter not only nuclear attack, but also a narrow range of other high consequence, strategic-level attacks.""

Biden's nuclear pivot

The Pentagon report suggested that its updated policy pertaining to targeting non-nuclear threats with nuclear weapons was the result of a ""thorough review of a broad range of options for nuclear declaratory policy – including both No First Use and Sole Purpose policies.""

The department concluded that ""those approaches would result in an unacceptable level of risk in light of the range of non-nuclear capabilities being developed and fielded by competitors that could inflict strategic-level damage to the United States and its allies and partners.""

This change represents a significant about-face for Biden, who campaigned in 2020 on the Democratic Party's platform, which rejected ""a return to an old era of grave nuclear dangers""; called for a reduction of American nuclear stockpiles; and insisted that the ""sole purpose of our nuclear arsenals should be to deter — and, if necessary retaliate against — a nuclear attack.""

The Democrat platform to which Biden subscribed also criticized former President Donald Trump for seeking to build new nuclear weapons, calling the initiative ""unnecessary, wasteful, and indefensible.""

The Biden administration has recently determined that nuclear upgrades are not so unnecessary after all.

Politico reported this week that the U.S. has ""accelerated the fielding of a more accurate version of its mainstay nuclear bomb"" to European NATO bases. The B61-12 air-dropped gravity bomb will be delivered in December rather than next spring, given the urgency created by nuclear tensions with Russia.

An increasingly bipolar world

The Pentagon noted that ""by the 2030s the United States will, for the first time in its history, face two major nuclear powers as strategic competitors and potential adversaries"": Russia and communist China.

China is reckoned to be the far greater threat, as it is “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order, and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.""

Russia was recognized in the report as an ""acute threat,"" presenting ""serious, continuing risks in key areas"" and presenting ""nuclear threats to the homeland and U.S. Allies and partners.""

While Russia poses a threat to America and its allies, it also bolsters a greater threat.

""Although diverging interests and historical mistrust may limit the depth of their political and military cooperation,"" the Pentagon indicated that communist China and Russia continue to develop and strengthen their alliance. This alliance ""could seek to create dilemmas globally for the Joint Force in the event of U.S. engagement in a crisis or a conflict with the other.""

China, deemed America's most ""consequential strategic competitor,"" may only have an estimated 350 nuclear warheads (Russia has roughly 5,977 and the U.S. has 5,428), but it intends to have 1,000 by decade's end. Furthermore, it is taking ""increasingly coercive actions to reshape the Indo Pacific region and the international system to fit its authoritarian preferences.""

The report suggested that the world ""expects nuclear powers to act responsibly,"" but that the U.S. ""has made little progress"" with China despite consistent efforts.

Chinese dictator Xi Jinping recently intimated that conflict between China and the U.S. was on the horizon, stating, """"Be mindful of dangers in the midst of peace. ... Get the house in good repair before rain comes, and prepare to undergo the major tests of high winds and waves, and even perilous, stormy seas.""

Nuclear deterrence

The Pentagon report indicated that for the U.S. to ""maintain credible and effective deterrence of both large-scale and limited nuclear attacks from a range of adversaries,"" it would have to do what Trump demanded in 2018: ""Modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else.""

Extra to modernizing ""nuclear forces, nuclear command, control, and communications, and the nuclear weapon production enterprise,"" the strategy report said the Pentagon will also ""bolster regional nuclear deterrence"" by working closely with American allies.

The authors of the report concluded, ""For the foreseeable future, nuclear weapons will continue to provide unique deterrence effects that no other element of U.S. military power can replace.""

Bloomberg reported that Mackenzie Eaglen, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was ""struck"" by how emerging geopolitical threats have prompted both the Trump and Biden administrations as well as members of both parties to adopt a similar approach to defense.

Eaglen said, ""They're willing to postpone their visionary policies in light of the harsh reality on nukes from China and Russia.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-may-delay-senate-impeachment-trial-until-mcconnell-agrees-to-fair-rules,2022-10-28
Pentagon: Reluctant Russian troops are punching holes in their vehicle gas tanks to get out of fighting,"Hampered by logistics problems, including lack of fuel and food, some Russian troops in Ukraine are reportedly surrendering en masse and even sabotaging their own vehicles to get out of the conflict, a U.S. defense official said Tuesday.

In some cases, entire Russian units have laid down their arms and surrendered without a fight after encountering stiff resistance from Ukrainian troops, a senior Pentagon official said, according to the New York Times. The official indicated that a significant number of Russian troops are young recruits who have been poorly trained and were not prepared for the full-scale invasion ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin last week. There are even reports that some Russian soldiers have deliberately punched holes in their vehicles' gas tanks, in what the U.S. official characterized as an attempt to avoid combat.

The Times reported that the Pentagon declined to say how military intelligence gathered this information, but it is presumed that statements from captured Russian soldiers or intercepted Russian communications played a role. There is no indication of how widespread these surrenders are.

But reluctant combatants may be one reason why Russia's advance into Ukraine has stalled, U.S. officials said.

Other reasons have to do with the reported shortages of fuel and food and with logistics problems that have prevented a nearly 40-mile long convoy of Russian tanks and armored vehicles from arriving at the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Pentagon officials said. Additionally, Ukraine's military is still organized and defending the country, and Ukrainian civilians have been armed and have joined the fight, engaging the Russians and attacking supply chains that are crucial to the war effort.

The U.S. officials indicated that Russian commanders leading the convoy may also be ""regrouping and rethinking"" their strategy, with a renewed push to put Kyiv under siege and capture the capital to come in the next several days.

“They have a lot of power available to them,” the Pentagon official said, noting that 80% of the more than 150,000 troops Russia had amassed along Ukraine's border over many months are now participating in the invasion.

Though Russia has vastly superior manpower and firepower, U.S. officials have been surprised by the apparent ""risk-averse behavior"" of Russia's forces, the Pentagon official said. The official noted, for example, that when the Russians launched an invasion from the Sea of Azov to capture the port city of Mariupol, they landed troops 40 miles from the city. The distance allowed the Russians more time to prepare their attack, but in turn gave the city time to mount a defense.

The Pentagon official also observed that Russia's reputably strong air force has yet to gain air superiority over Ukraine, as Ukrainian fighter jets, Stinger anti aircraft missiles, and other anti-air weapons are harassing the Russian warplanes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-says-barr-lied,2022-03-01
Pete Buttigieg in favor of renaming things named after Thomas Jefferson,"Democrat and 2020 hopeful 'Mayor' Pete Buttigieg spoke with Hugh Hewitt on Friday, and said that renaming something named after Thomas Jefferson is the ""right thing to do.""

In Buttigieg's home state of Indiana, the traditional, annual Democrat fundraiser had the name changed from Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner (so named for the party's founders) to the Hoosier Hospitality Dinner, for the sake of ""inclusiveness."" Changing the name is also under consideration in other states.

Hewitt asked Buttigieg about that directly. ""A very blunt question, because you talk about going to every Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Indiana when you were running statewide,"" he said. ""Should Jefferson-Jackson dinners be renamed everywhere because both were holders of slaves?""

Buttigieg began by talking about Andrew Jackson. Jackson and his supporters formed the Democratic Party as it still exists today.

""Yeah, we're doing that in Indiana. I think it's the right thing to do,"" said Mayor Pete. ""You know, over time, you develop and evolve on the things you choose to honor. And I think we know enough, especially Jackson, you know, you just look at what basically amounts to genocide that happened here.""

He moved on to Jefferson, Founding Father, memorialized in Washington, D.C. and primary author of the Declaration of Independence.



""Jefferson's more problematic. You know, there's a lot to, of course, admire in his thinking and his philosophy. Then again, as you plunge into his writings, especially the Notes on the State of Virginia, you know that he knew that slavery was wrong,"" he continued.

""Yes,"" said Hewitt. A rather short exchange on an extremely complex topic, particularly referencing Notes, one of Jefferson's most important writings, in a rather passing fashion. Although, such is the nature of a podcast and time constraints.

""Yet, he did it,"" Buttigieg continued, referring to Jefferson having owned many hundreds of slaves despite writing against slavery. ""Now we're all morally conflicted human beings. And it's not like we're blotting him out of the history books, or deleting him from being the Founding Fathers. But you know, naming something after somebody confers a certain amount of honor.""



""And at a time, I mean, the real reason I think there's a lot of pressure on this is the relationship between the past and the present, that we're finding in a million different ways that racism isn't some curiosity out of the past that we're embarrassed about but moved on from. It's alive, it's well, it's hurting people,"" he said. ""And it's one of the main reasons to be in politics today is to try to change or reverse the harms that went along with that. Then, we'd better look for ways to live out and honor that principle, even in a symbolic thing.""

Buttigieg's comment that ""it's not like we're blotting him out of the history books, or deleting him from being the Founding Fathers"" is the one that ought to provoke the most commentary, and it touches on the issues that some on the right have been discussing for a while now in cases such as the removal of Civil War statues and memorials and other instances of honoring people from the past. Although the debate over such issues is usually flatly declarative and lacking nuance or subtle differentiation, it nevertheless requires those things and will remain unresolved until we have them.

But regrardless of necessity, what likely will garner more attention, aside from the simple fact of his stating his support, is that he related the moral necessity of the action to the particular current political climate. ""At a time"" he began to say, before revising and saying that there is a lot of pressure now because of how bad things are. It was sort of high-minded way of saying that the Trump era is a parallel racism to slavery, and that he and other Democrats are running for office to ""try to change or reverse"" it.

So, in the end, just another campaign sound bite designed for his audience. It's what he does.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pentagon-changes-post-war-policy-to-allow-nuclear-strikes-against-non-nuclear-threats-breaking-biden-pledge,2019-05-18
"Pete Buttigieg, who supports abortion, opposes death penalty because it kills 'defenseless' people","Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg told The Hill this week that he opposes the death penalty in all scenarios—but his reason for that stance clashes with his defense of abortion.

Buttigieg is so set in his opposition to the death penalty, he said he would even oppose the execution of someone like accused 9/11 attack mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

""There are people who deserve to die,"" Buttigieg said. ""I just don't know anybody who deserves to kill them.""

Buttigieg also said the ""moral consequence of killing somebody who is defenseless for any reason goes against certainly what I've been taught about the way we're supposed to treat human life.""

The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has made his Christian faith a foundation of his campaign, using it both as a justification for some of his views, and also as a platform on which to criticize other (conservative) Christians like Vice President Mike Pence for theirs.

Abortion is one issue about which he has criticized conservative Christians. Buttigieg believes Republicans are wrong to use Christian values as a reason to oppose abortion.

""Right now, they hold everybody in line with this one piece of doctrine about abortion, which is obviously a tough issue for a lot of people to think through morally,"" Buttigieg told The Breakfast Club during a September interview. ""Then again, there's a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath, and so even that is something that we can interpret differently.""

Yet, there is an obvious contradiction in Buttigieg's views on life. How can he believe the execution of a mass murderer is the immoral killing of a defenseless human, while supporting the mass killing of unborn babies as a fundamental right for all women?

Additionally, Buttigieg's wider view that there are no people who deserve to kill even those people who deserve to be killed comes with some larger potential implications for how he might view military conflict if he was to become commander-in-chief. As a Navy veteran, Buttigieg spent some time in Afghanistan, although he did not engage in direct combat.

"Peter Boghossian resigns from Portland State University, says students 'are not being taught to think'","After more than a decade teaching at Portland State University, Peter Boghossian has resigned and publicly shared his resignation letter which heavily criticizes the institution.

Boghossian, who noted that he is resigning as assistant professor of philosophy, said that students at the school are not getting ""taught to think"" and that faculty and administrators are pushing intolerance of divergent viewpoints.

Here's an excerpt from his letter:

I never once believed — nor do I now — that the purpose of instruction was to lead my students to a particular conclusion. Rather, I sought to create the conditions for rigorous thought; to help them gain the tools to hunt and furrow for their own conclusions. This is why I became a teacher and why I love teaching.



But brick by brick, the university has made this kind of intellectual exploration impossible. It has transformed a bastion of free inquiry into a Social Justice factory whose only inputs were race, gender, and victimhood and whose only outputs were grievance and division.



Students at Portland State are not being taught to think. Rather, they are being trained to mimic the moral certainty of ideologues. Faculty and administrators have abdicated the university's truth-seeking mission and instead drive intolerance of divergent beliefs and opinions. This has created a culture of offense where students are now afraid to speak openly and honestly.

Boghossian wrote that ""it became increasingly clear to me that the incidents of illiberalism I had witnessed over the years were not just isolated events, but part of an institution-wide problem."" He said that, ""The more I spoke out about these issues, the more retaliation I faced.""



He explained that he feels morally bound to relinquish his position in order live by his principles.



""While I am grateful for the opportunity to have taught at Portland State for over a decade, it has become clear to me that this institution is no place for people who intend to think freely and explore ideas,"" he noted. ""This is not the outcome I wanted. But I feel morally obligated to make this choice. For ten years, I have taught my students the importance of living by your principles. One of mine is to defend our system of liberal education from those who seek to destroy it. Who would I be if I didn't?""

The institution said in a statement that it did not have a comment about the man's statement of resignation.

""Portland State has always been and will continue to be a welcoming home for free speech and academic freedom,"" the university's statement declared, according to Fox News. ""We believe that those practices are not in conflict with our core institutional values of student success; racial justice and equity; and proactive engagement with our community. As with all personnel matters, we have no comment on Dr. Boghossian's statement of resignation.""

Boghossian noted on Twitter that while he does not view himself as a conservative, he has been inundated with invitations to do interviews with conservative media, but he has not received any requests from liberal media.

""I've been deluged with requests to appear on conversative media regarding my resignation from PSU,"" Boghossian tweeted. ""And yet, I don't consider myself a conservative. I've received zero requests for interviews with liberal media. I'd enjoy having a conversation with you @maddow @npr @msnbc,"" he wrote.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pete-buttigieg-gets-behind-renaming-things-named-after-thomas-jefferson,2021-09-08
Pfizer executive admits COVID-19 vaccine was never tested to prevent transmission: 'This is scandalous',"In a shocking admission, a Pfizer executive on Monday stated that the company did not know if the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine it developed with BioNTech would prevent viral transmission before bringing it to market last year.

Janine Small, the president of international development markets for Pfizer, testified before the European Parliament's COVID-19 committee Monday on behalf of Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla, who was summoned by the committee but pulled out of his appointment.

During questions, Dutch Member of Parliament Rob Roos, a conservative and opponent of Europe's COVID-19 passports, asked Small whether Pfizer could provide lawmakers with evidence it believed the vaccine would prevent coronavirus transmission before bringing it to market.

""Was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?"" Roos asked. ""If not, please say it clearly. If yes, are you willing to share the data with this committee?”

In response, Small said Pfizer did not know that the vaccine would prevent transmission before bringing it to market.



“Regarding the question around, did we know about stopping immunization before it entered the market? No,"" she admitted.

""These, um, you know, we had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market. And from that point of view, we had to do everything at risk,” Small said.



Following guidance from public health authorities, many governments in Europe and around the world implemented policies requiring people to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination in order to fully participate in public life. These ""COVID passports"" were issued on the premise that the vaccinated were protected from illness so that they could socialize with other people without risk of spreading the disease.

Roos, who along with a handful of other members of European Parliament objected to vaccination requirements, said in a video Tuesday that the justification for COVID passports ""was always a lie.""

""If you don't get vaccinated, you're anti-social! This is what the Dutch prime minister and health minister told us. You don't get vaccinated just for yourself, but also for others — you do it for all of society. That's what they said,"" Roos recounted. ""Today, this turns out to be complete nonsense.""

Roos said Small's admission that the vaccine was not tested to prevent transmission ""removes the entire legal basis for the COVID passport. The COVID passport that led to massive institutional discrimination as people lost access to essential parts of society.""

""I find this to be shocking, even criminal,"" Roos added.

The mRNA vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech was granted emergency use authorization in the United States on Dec. 11, 2020, and later granted Food and Drug Administration approval on August 23, 2021. The vaccine is marketed as Comirnaty and is used for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 12 years of age and older, though it is authorized for emergency use in children as young as five.

In granting an emergency use authorization to Pfizer in late 2020, the FDA wrote that there was no evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person.



Public health officials, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, maintain that COVID-19 vaccination significantly lowers the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death for those infected with COVID-19.

""Like all vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing infection. Some people who are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations will get COVID-19 breakthrough infection,"" the CDC says. ""However, staying up to date with your COVID-19 vaccinations means that you are less likely to have a breakthrough infection and, if you do get sick, you are less likely to get severely ill or die.""

Prior to the vaccine's approval, Pfizer claimed that studies showed its vaccine was as much as 91.3% effective against COVID-19 and 100% effective in preventing infections in at least one study.

Roos said that the Pfizer executive's admission that the vaccine was never tested for preventing transmission was ""scandalous.""

""Millions of people worldwide felt forced to get vaccinated because of the myth that 'you do it for others.' Now this turned out to be a cheap lie. This should be exposed.""



Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment.

Over time, the vaccine has proved to have waning efficacy against mutating strains (Delta, Omicron, etc.) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Health officials have advocated for people to receive COVID-19 booster shots as breakthrough infections have become more common.

Still, officials have claimed, contrary to the evidence that COVID-19 vaccination will prevent infection. President Joe Biden in July 2021 stated, ""You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations."" About a year later, he tested positive for the virus despite being fully vaccinated and up to date with booster shots.

Outgoing White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's go-to health spokesman during the pandemic, has also given conflicting statements on the vaccine's effectiveness. In May 2021, Fauci told CBS News that vaccinated people were a ""dead end"" for the virus, saying the likelihood a vaccinated person could transmit COVID was ""very, very low.""

""When you get vaccinated, you not only protect your own health and that of the family, but also you contribute to the community health by preventing the spread of the virus throughout the community,” Fauci said.

However, in August 2021, during the Delta wave, Fauci told Katie Couric that vaccinated people could still transmit the virus. ""They’re either without symptoms or only mildly symptomatic,” he said. “So it’s less that it’s going to make the vaccinated person sick. It’s more that it’s going to allow the vaccinated person to transmit it to someone else who might get sick, like a vulnerable person in the family, an elderly individual, a child who’s unvaccinated.”

The point wasn't to prevent transmission, but rather reduce the severity of illness, Fauci explained at the time. ""The vaccine is doing exactly what we wanted it to do,” he said. “It’s preventing people from getting seriously ill — that’s the reason why you get vaccinated.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pete-buttigieg-who-supports-abortion-opposes-death-penalty-because-it-kills-defenseless-people,2022-10-11
Phil Robertson announces that he has a long-lost daughter,"This is a story of redemption, reconciliation, and love. This is how the power of faith helped unite a father and daughter who had previously never seen each other in their entire lives.

Following a DNA test and much genealogy research, a 45-year-old woman came to the conclusion that her birth father is Phil Robertson. The woman didn't want to find her father for financial gain, but rather to finally answer burning questions she had her entire life. ""I knew growing up that I was different,"" the woman said on the ""Unashamed with Phil Robertson"" podcast.

Two or three years ago, her oldest son was gifted a DNA test. Once he received the results, his family noticed that the DNA test didn't match up with the heritage that they were told over the years. Then Phyllis did her own DNA test, and after a little digging, she narrowed down who her father could be – to Phil Robertson.

Phyllis, who has done mission work around the world, wanted to let her father know that he has a daughter, but didn't want to disrupt his life or bring conflict to his marriage with his wife, Miss Kay Robertson. She decided to deliver a letter to Phil, and he could decide if he wanted to pursue a relationship with her.

She visited the Louisiana church where Phil is an elder. But the meeting almost never happened; Phyllis had second thoughts about finding her father. ""At one point I cried; I was like, 'I don't know if I can do this,'"" she said.

Phyllis, with her husband encouraging her, mustered up her courage and ventured into the church. That's where she saw her father for the very first time in her life. Phil just happened to be preaching that day.

She didn't confront Phil at the church. Instead, she sought out his son, Jase Robertson. Phyllis didn't reveal her identity; she thanked Jase for the church service and gave him a letter to give to his father.



Although Jase said he would give the letter to his father, that didn't exactly happen. Weeks later, Al Robertson saw a letter for Phil and mentioned it to Jase, and he remembered he received a letter much like it.

The letter from Phyllis let Phil know that she believed that he was her father after the results of a DNA test. Jase pointed out that the Robertson family receive letters about long-lost relatives regularly, but they usually end with someone requesting a $10,000 check from the reality TV stars.

However, this letter was different, seemingly special and genuine to the Robertson brothers. ""We both concluded, this isn't one of these frivolous things, it looks like it may have some merit,"" Jase determined. ""She's a Christian, and she's not looking for anything.""

""We had to pursue it,"" Al added.

Phyllis is 45 years old, and her birth occurred at the end of Phil's phase of boorish behavior. ""You were born, and he [Phil] was born again in the same year,"" Jase noted of his father's religious rebirth.

Phil's entire lifestyle changed once he found Jesus. He was no longer a womanizing, hard-partying, drug-abusing man after he devoted his life to Christ.

Phil does not hide the fact that he lived a sinful life many decades ago before he discovered his faith. In his book ""The Theft of America's Soul,"" Robertson wrote:

""For the next several years, I spiraled down into my own desires, into booze and pills and easy women. The hippie movement was on and, though I was no hippie, I enjoyed the fruits of their sexual revolution, all the while leaving Miss Kay at home to tend to the children by herself. By the time Miss Kay left me, I'm sorry to say I was a regular whoremonger. And without Miss Kay to stand in the way of my sexual appetites, I did what I wanted, with whom I wanted, and I did it all in the name of freedom.""

Phil is not proud of his former rock-and-roll lifestyle, but he has grown as a person since his partying days.

""I learned a lesson way back when I was getting on my feet, individuals who have, in fact, repented don't mind talking about their past sins,"" Phil said during the newest episode of ""Unashamed."" ""But a lot of people who have not repented, they keep them tight, they won't be honest with others or themselves. The repentant, they don't mind talking about their past lives because they know it's been taken care of by the blood of Jesus.""

Phil's nephew, Zach Dasher, spoke with Phyllis over the phone to see if there was validity to her claim. After speaking to her, Zach told Jase, ""She's not after anything"" and that her intentions were pure.



Jase came to the same conclusion after talking to Phyllis and said, ""There is no ulterior motive.""

""There's a 45-year-old woman out there who doesn't know who her dad is, and she's looking; even if it's not dad [Phil], she needs to know,"" Al said.

Jase understood that this was a ""life-changing situation"" and that the only way to know the truth would be through a DNA test. Phil agreed to do the DNA test, and the families waited days for the answer that could change the lives of many.

""We're all praying about it. It was weird because when you're praying about something like this, it's a truth that's already there. She was either dad's daughter and our sister or she wasn't,"" Al said on the ""Unashamed with Phil Robertson"" podcast. ""You could only pray for the truth. Just praying for the truth to be revealed.""

The DNA test results came back as a 99.99% match. When Phil learned that the DNA test was a match, he reacted by saying, ""Bring her on down.""

Phil quoted Romans 8:28 when he found out he has a daughter: ""And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.""

""God is a God that restores broken people. I was a broken mess, a slave to my desire,"" Phil told TheBlaze. ""God redeemed me 45 years ago, but He didn't stop there. 45 years later, God is continuing to restore me. He has brought me to my long-lost daughter, and I love her.""

On the next episode of the ""Unashamed with Phil Robertson"" podcast, Phyllis makes her debut to explain what made her seek out her biological father and what she plans to do next now that she knows the truth. Plus, the Robertson boys talk about how it feels to have a sister, and Miss Kay reveals that she knew that someone from Phil's turbulent past would find him.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/peter-boghossian-resigns-from-portland-state-university-says-students-are-not-being-taught-to-think,2020-05-28
Philadelphia investigating event with Muslim kids saying in Arabic 'we will chop off their heads' — a phrase directed at Jews,"The Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations said it's investigating an event at the Muslim American Society's Philadelphia chapter last month with Muslim children seen on video speaking in Arabic about beheadings and the liberation of Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, The Associated Press reported.

A video uploaded to the chapter's Facebook page shows children moving to a revolutionary anthem often used by Islamist groups, the AP said, and two girls reading from a prepared text. One says, ""We will chop off their heads, and we will liberate the sorrowful and exalted Al-Aqsa Mosque,"" the outlet reported.

Among other phrases the children reportedly said: ""We will defend the land of divine guidance with our bodies, and we will sacrifice our souls without hesitation,"" and ""we will lead the army of Allah fulfilling His promise, and we will subject them to eternal torture.""

More from the AP:

The contested site, revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The compound is the third holiest site in Islam and the holiest site for Jews. It has been a flashpoint of violence in the past.



The Muslim American Society took the video down — calling the video ""disturbing"" and condemning the words used in it — and said a school that rented space in the building was responsible for the program. It said the person in charge of the event had been dismissed.



The society also called the school, which it did not name, a ""separate entity."" But old Facebook posts that have since been taken down show that a school called MAS Leaders Academy operates at the Muslim American Society's Philadelphia location. Muslim American Society officials did not return phone calls and email messages seeking comment Monday on the relationship between the Philadelphia chapter and the school.

What did the Anti-Defamation League have to say?

The Philadelphia chapter of the Anti-Defamation League called the video ""extremely disturbing,"" adding that ""children should not be indoctrinated to hate. These young people should never have been asked to make speeches and dance and lip-sync to songs that glorify violence against Jews and the state of Israel. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is deeply complex and painful on all sides, and the only chance for a peaceful future is to teach our children to pursue peace.""

What else did the Muslim American Society say?

""Unfortunately, the video from the school was uploaded to the chapter's Facebook page without verifying the content of the video for appropriateness and making sure it conforms to our hate-free policy and values,"" according to a weekend statement from the society's national headquarters, the outlet said. ""The chapter will take further steps in assuring strict adherence to publishing and posting policies.""

The Muslim American Society shares space with the Al-Hidaya mosque, which serves many Palestinian immigrants, Jacob Bender, executive director of the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told the AP.

Bender — who is Jewish — added to the outlet that the mosque has asked the CAIR chapter to hold a ""workshop on diversity and religious tolerance"" to help ""members of the immigrant Muslim community have a better understanding of Jewish sensitivities and anti-Semitism, so that events like this don't repeat themselves.""

Bender also told the AP that the April 17 incident ""was not an example of radicalization"" but rather ""a stupid decision by an untrained pedagogue and volunteer teacher.""

What did Philadelphia's mayor have to say?



""The city of Philadelphia condemns bigotry in all its forms,"" Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement Monday, the outlet added. ""Philadelphia is the City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection. For this moniker to ring true, all our brothers and sisters — regardless of their background — must feel safe and welcome. We are committed to working together with partners representing all our communities to make this happen.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pfizer-executive-admits-covid-19-vaccine-was-never-tested-to-prevent-transmission-this-is-scandalous,2019-05-07
Piers Morgan calls to end ‘trans sport insanity’ before it ends up killing women,"British commentator and former CNN host Piers Morgan castigated the idea of biological males competing in women's sports as transgender women after a special forces combat veteran demolished a biologically female MMA fighter during a Friday match.

What are the details?

In a blistering op-ed published in the Daily Mail, Morgan pointed to Friday's fight in which transgender fighter Alana McLaughlin, 38, used a ""powerful chokehold"" on a fellow MMA fighter who happened to be a biological female.

McLaughlin, a special forces combat veteran, defeated 32-year-old Celine Provost after placing her in a match-winning chokehold on Friday. The Friday match was McLaughlin's debut as a MMA fighter. McLaughlin easily ended the fight just three minutes and 32 seconds into the second round.

""It made me sick to watch a once-male special forces combat veteran beat up a woman on TV,"" he wrote. ""It's time to stop this trans sport insanity before women start being killed.""

McLaughlin, who took up MMA training earlier in 2021, fought against Provost, who has competed in the extreme sport for at least a decade, but as Morgan pointed out, Provost simply ""couldn't compete with the overwhelming physical strength of her opponent.""

Instead, Provost was barely able to leave a mark on McLaughlin, who was once a muscle-bound special forces operative.

""At this point let me be clear: McLaughlin was a war hero, rising through Army ranks to become a special forces medical sergeant who went to serve in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of an elite, 12-man team,"" Morgan wrote. ""There, she helped save many lives as she treated IED casualties in a highly dangerous combat zone. I have huge respect for her military service, during which she was awarded eight distinguished service medals.""

A conflicted history

McLaughlin, who grew up in South Carolina, has said that her mother — who had a strongly religious background — disowned McLaughlin once she heard that her son would soon be her daughter.

She told the Guardian in a Wednesday interview that a neighbor's son raped her when she was just 5 years old after having been subjected to what she referred to as ""masculine time"" with the neighbor's sons.

In the years following the incident, McLaughlin's family reportedly sent her to various conversion therapies to change her outlook on sexuality and gender. It didn't take, McLaughlin said, and she ended up begging her parents for gender reassignment surgery from a young age.

Before shipping out to Afghanistan, McLaughlin told her mother during a particularly heated phone call, ""Maybe I should just go get myself killed at war.""

McLaughlin's mother reportedly snapped, ""Maybe you should.""

Elsewhere in the interview, McLaughlin said, ""My whole life I was a runt. I was undersized, I was bullied, I was raped, I was beaten, like I did not have an easy time. The story of my life has been trying to physically resist people that were larger and stronger and more skilled than me.""

'Sickening to watch'

Morgan continued, ""Regardless of her military record or personal struggles growing up, none of this justifies what happened on Friday night. I found the bout sickening to watch.""

""It was obvious very quickly that McLaughlin was too strong, and equally obvious that this strength came from the 33 years she spent as a biological man,"" Morgan continued. ""As I've said before, the restrictive hormone treatment that sports authorities make transgender women do before they can compete in women's sport does not reduce muscle density or power.""

Calling the disparity ""potentially deadly,"" Morgan added that such practices would end up killing women one day.

Morgan, who added that he's always supported trans rights to fairness and equality, said that while transgender men and women deserve fair treatment across the board, allowing mixed biological sexes to compete against one another in contact sports such as MMA will only lead to danger for biological women.

""If you're in any doubt about how unfair this all is, let me take you through a brief history of what's happened when male athletes have transitioned to be women and then competed against women born with female bodies,"" he wrote. ""In 2017, American sprinter CeCe Telfer was ranked 390th among male NCAA Division II athletes in 400m hurdles. In 2018, Telfer transitioned, and in 2019, Telfer was national NCAA Division II women's 400m champion.""

He also pointed to New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard, who qualified for women's tournaments and in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, Hannah Mouncey, an Australian handball player who dominated on the country's women's team after scoring zero goals in 22 appearances for the men's team, and more as examples of unfairness in competition.

""We've already seen the same unfairness manifest itself with the first transgender MMA fighter, Fallon Fox, who served in the US Navy then transitioned, became an MMA fighter, and won all but one fights,"" Morgan noted. ""In one of them, she fractured a woman's skull. I fear worse is to come.""

""[McLaughlin is] a girl born with the massive physical advantage of a male body,"" Morgan concluded. ""Yet now she's deliberately participating in a grotesquely unbalanced physical environment for other women. It's unfair, unequal, and in the case of combat sport, incredibly dangerous. But the real crime going on here is against women's sport.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/phil-robertson-daughter-unashamed-podcast,2021-09-13
Left-wing Pittsburgh mayor big fan of BLM protesters — but not when they bring the noise to his home,"Pittsburgh Democratic Mayor Bill Peduto has said he supports Black Lives Matter and defends protests in the city's streets to ""demand much-needed reforms to policing,"" KDKA-TV reported.

But apparently not when such protests end up at his front door.

What are the details?

The station said a massive protest took place in front of Peduto's residence Tuesday night and lasted all night. There was a siren going off, KDKA said, and protesters banged drums, blew horns, and used megaphones to express their desire for the mayor's resignation after the Saturday arrest of 25-year-old Matthew Cartier, who was taken away in an unmarked van by plainclothes officers.

Indeed, a number of protesters spent the night, the station said, adding that there were mattresses along the sidewalk.



Jesse Seager — co-owner of Point Brugge Cafe, located just steps from the action — told KDKA that at one point around 300 people were on the street.

""There definitely are neighbors that are scared,"" Seager noted to the station. ""I talked to multiple neighbors that left for the evening that have kids, that have elderly people in the house.""

The mayor wasn't home at the time of the protest either, KDKA said.

Finally a line of officers stood near Peduto's home around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday and declared the gathering an ""unlawful assembly"" — and that protesters could be arrested if they didn't leave, the station said. Only about a dozen protesters were there at that point, KDKA added, and they all left about 30 minutes later.

It was the second time in just days protesters were seen in front of Peduto's home, the station said, adding that many of them believe he doesn't support their movement.

Image source: KDKA-TV video screenshot

What did the mayor have to say?



Peduto later released a statement about the protests, KDKA said:

I have long defended First Amendment rights to peaceably protest. I strongly believe that Black Lives Matter, that we are in a historic fight for civil rights in this country, and that it is right for people to take to the streets to demand much-needed reforms to policing in our cities.



What I cannot defend is any neighborhood in our city — and their residents and families — being disturbed through the night and morning, and a peaceful protest devolving into unacceptable conduct in which residents are being harassed and threatened. This crosses a line that cannot be allowed to continue, causing those committing crimes against residents to face possible legal consequences for their actions. Using protests to create conflict and division, as some are doing, only impacts the ability of others to exercise their constitutional rights safely.



I am working to make Pittsburgh a better city for all, and I have condemned and halted the arrest methods Pittsburgh Police used last weekend. I understand that people are feeling fear, pain and anger in our communities, and that some want to take their frustrations out on me. I fully accept that, but I will not accept unjustified actions that threaten neighbors in any part of the city.

Indeed, the leftist mayors of Seattle and Olympia, Washington, didn't like it when Black Lives Matter protesters recently descended upon their homes, either.

Police not happy with Peduto, either

Fraternal Order of Police President Robert Swartzwelder told the station he's predicting massive police retirements in October when 268 officers become eligible, citing criticism from Peduto and District Attorney Stephen Zappala over how police have handled protests.

""They're pinching the police in the middle, and they're putting them in a precarious position where police officers feel that no matter what they do, they're going to be criticized by the two highest-level politicians ..."" Swartzwelder told KDKA, adding that such a scenario ""is going to change public opinion and force negative ramifications on the police officers, and some police officers are going to say, 'OK, you don't want us? We'll go and do something else.'""

The station said police have allowed demonstrators access to city streets without permits, but added that even the American Civil Liberties Union said officers are within their rights to make arrests if protesters create disturbances or block vital streets and intersections and refuse to disperse.

""People need to — especially in this time — have an outlet to be able to exercise their right to express their displeasure with what's going on in government,"" Vic Waczak of the ACLU told KDKA. ""But at the same time, I think everybody need to recognize that those rights are not unlimited.""

Back for more

As it happens, protesters returned to Peduto's home Wednesday night — and this time the mayor talked to them, WTAE-TV reported.

One video showed him speaking, but what he was saying couldn't be heard over protesters chanting, ""Hey hey, ho ho, Mayor Peduto has got to go!""

More from the station:



Public safety officials said the exchange between Peduto and protesters ended in an impasse on Wednesday evening. Peduto went back inside his house after the conversation.



The group of protesters remained outside of his house chanting in the street after the conversation before they returned to Mellon Park.

"Poland, NATO: Missile 'very likely' fired into Poland by Ukrainian forces in 'tragic incident'","American and European officials now believe the explosion that killed two people in Poland near the country's border with Ukraine was ""very likely"" caused by Ukrainian air defenses. Polish President Andrzej Duda stated that ""there is no evidence that it was launched by the Russian side.""

What are the details?

Amid a brutal Russian missile barrage targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure on Tuesday, an explosion rocked the Polish village of Przewodów, just five miles away from the Ukrainian border. Two farm workers were killed.

Ukrainian officials accused Moscow of a ""major escalation.""

While Polish combat planes were scrambled, Warsaw summoned Russia's ambassador.

A Russian attack on Poland would have been sufficient to trigger articles 4 and 5 of the NATO charter, potentially putting the U.S. into direct conflict with the nuclear power.

Duda, President Joe Biden, and the leaders of other allied countries held an emergency meeting on Tuesday to collectively determine their next steps. In the talks, Biden condemned the ""scores and scores of missile attacks in western Ukraine.""

Hours later, the Polish president indicated on Twitter that the explosion was instead an “unfortunate accident” caused by a ""S-300 rocket made in the Soviet Union, an old rocket and there is no evidence that it was launched by the Russian side.""

Barron's reported that the Russian defense ministry corroborated the Polish president's statement, stating, ""Photographs of the wreckage ... were unequivocally identified by Russian military experts as fragments of a guided anti-aircraft missile of a Ukrainian S-300 air defence system.""

""It is highly probable that it was fired by Ukrainian anti-aircraft defense,"" added Duda.



Duda noted that ""there are many indications that it was an air defense missile, which unfortunately fell on Polish territory.""



Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba dismissed the claim that the explosion was caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile, calling it a Russian ""conspiracy theory.""

According to Kiev, Russia launched over 90 missiles into Ukraine on Tuesday, 77 of which the Ukrainian military allegedly shot down.

The Guardian reported that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg similarly suggested that, on the basis of preliminary analysis, it appears that ""the incident was likely caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile fired to defend Ukrainian territory against Russian cruise missile attacks.""

""We have no indication that this was the result of a deliberate attack,"" said Stoltenberg, ""and no indication that Russia is preparing offensive military actions against NATO.""

While it may have been a Ukrainian missile, Stoltenberg stressed that the ""tragic incident"" is ""not Ukraine’s fault. Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine.""



This sentiment was also expressed by Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski, who indicated that ""we are dealing with a consequence of Russia's actions.""

In concurrence with Duda and Stoltenberg, Biden suggested Wednesday morning that it is ""unlikely in the lines of the trajectory that [the missile] was fired from Russia, but we’ll see.”

'Be calm'

In the immediate aftermath of the explosion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a forceful statement, saying, ""Russian missiles hit Poland, the territory of our friendly country. People died.""

Zelenskyy, keen on NATO's formal induction into the war, said, ""The longer Russia feels impunity, the more threats there will be to anyone within reach of Russian missiles. To fire missiles at NATO territory! This is a Russian missile attack on collective security! This is a very significant escalation. We must act!""

The Russians also jumped to conclusions.

The Washington Post reported that the Russian defense ministry intimated that the explosion was a false flag attack, calling it ""a deliberate provocation in order to escalate the situation.""

Polish President Andrzej Duda did not, however, jump to conclusions. He indicated that an investigation was under way and advised people to ""be calm.""

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki suggested that it may not be necessary to invoke NATO's Article 4.

Poland will not take or pay for any more COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer,"Poland has informed the European Commission and the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer that it will no longer accept nor pay for any more COVID-19 vaccines for now, Poland's health minister said Tuesday.

The decision to stop taking vaccine doses will set up a legal battle under a supply contract the European Union has negotiated with vaccine manufacturers.

Poland and other EU member nations have been paying for and receiving vaccine doses under agreements between the European Union and vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer and Moderna. Pfizer is the chief supplier for Poland, Reuters reported.

Currently, the country has 25 million COVID-19 vaccines in storage and another 67 million to 70 million doses on order, according to the private news channel TVN24. But compared to other European nations, Poland has reported a below-average vaccine uptake. Just 59% of the country's 38 million people have been fully vaccinated, and only 31% have received a booster shot, below the EU average of 72.5% and nearly 53%, respectively.



As such, Poland's health minister said the country has a surplus of vaccine doses and does not intend to pay for any more.

""We asked both the European Commission and the main vaccine producing companies ... to spread these deliveries over 10 years and — most importantly — to pay when we receive vaccines,"" health minister Adam Niedzielski reportedly told TVN24 in an interview.

""Unfortunately, here we faced complete inflexibility on the part of the producers,” he said. “There was no way that we could seriously change the terms of this contract, and this contract was signed in a crisis situation.""

Niedzielski explained that Poland has triggered a clause in its legal agreement with the European Commission and Pfizer to stop taking additional vaccine doses.



""At the end of last week, we used the force majeure clause and informed both the European Commission and the main vaccine producer that we are refusing to take these vaccines at the moment and we are also refusing to pay,"" he said.



""Indeed, the consequence of this will be a legal conflict, which is already taking place,"" he added.



According to the health minister, Poland cannot directly terminate the contract with Pfizer because the agreement is between Pfizer and the European Commission.

Pfizer's contract to supply vaccine doses to Poland alone is worth more than 6 billion zlotys ($1.4 billion), with more than 2 billion zlotys spent on vaccines for 2022.

In a comment to Reuters, Pfizer said its contract to supply vaccines to EU member states is with the European Commission.

""Our discussions with Governments and the details of vaccine deliveries are confidential,"" Pfizer said.

European Commission health spokesman Stefan de Keersmaecker said Tuesday that member states were bound by contractual obligations to continue purchasing vaccines, but that the commission understands Poland's ""difficult position.""

""We continue to facilitate discussion between the Polish government and the company in order to find a pragmatic solution to this specific situation the country is confronted with,"" he said.

Niedzielski said that Poland and 10 other EU countries have petitioned the EU to loosen regulations on COVID-19 vaccine contracts to allow for flexibility to spend money on health care for refugees from the war between Russia and Ukraine.

""We, in particular, and I am talking about Poland here, currently have financial pressures related to the influx of refugees, so we also feel that, on the EU scale, we have a certain right to expect special instruments that will give us ... greater flexibility in the contracts,"" Niedzielski said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pittsburgh-mayor-peduto-blm-protest,2022-04-19
"San Francisco police raid home of journalist — with sledgehammer, guns, and FBI in tow — for not revealing his source","San Francisco police raided the home of freelance journalist Bryan Carmody on Friday morning, two weeks after he refused to betray the source of a leaked report exposing salacious details regarding the recent death of the city's longtime public defender.

Officers arrived with a sledgehammer and other equipment to break through the reporter's front gate, before he allowed them inside where they kept him handcuffed for several hours, searched his home and office with guns drawn, had him questioned by the FBI, and confiscated several items — including a copy of the report in question.

What's the background?

The San Francisco Police Department has been under pressure to find out who among them leaked the true cause of the February death of Public Defender Jeff Adachi, who, according to the San Francisco Examiner, ""dedicated his career to uncovering police misconduct.""

The Examiner said Adachi's friends and supporters believe the leak was ""political retribution.""

According to the Los Angeles Times, ""initial reports said the 59-year-old public defender had been traveling when he suddenly had a heart attack."" But soon, conflicting details began to leach out, and Carmody got his hands on the incident report.

The report revealed that on the night of Adachi's death, police responded to a 911 call from a woman — who was not Adachi's wife — saying the public defender was unresponsive. Officers arrived at an apartment where the two had reportedly planned to spend the weekend, and police photos showed ""empty bottles of alcohol, cannabis gummies, and two syringes that may have been left by paramedics,"" KGC-TV reported.

The medical examiner found cocaine and alcohol in Adachi's system, and concluded the stimulants caused ""cardiac stress"" on ""his already compromised heart,"" ultimately resulting in his death, KNTV-TV reported.

Adachi's widow made a public statement condemning the leaking of the police report, saying, ""It was despicable what the police did to myself and my daughter. ... We had no privacy. It was an ongoing investigation and I don't believe that they should have released it.""

The Public Defender's Investigative Unit also slammed the police for the leak, hinting at the possibility of it being a retaliatory act and blaming the media for exposing the details.

""The report was released prematurely at best, and far more concerning was sold to the media,"" spokesman Hadi Razzaq said at a public hearing in April. ""And something the public should be aware of is that the police report was in the hands of media within hours of Mr. Adachi's death in a situation where the police themselves viewed the location as a possible crime scene and ongoing investigation.

""The fact that this happened involving the elected public defender who had a history of battling the police, exposing misconduct, is all the more troubling,"" he added.

What did the reporter say?



Razzaq revealed that a freelance reporter allegedly sold the information to media outlets. Within days, police questioned Carmody about where he received the leaked report, but he refused to reveal his source. Two weeks later, officers showed up with a warrant to find the report, which was described as ""stolen or embezzled"" property.

While Carmody sat handcuffed, police called in and obtained a second warrant. Ultimately, Carmody told NBC News, ""They took every electronic device that I own — every computer, every hard drive, every digital photograph that I have taken in the last 25 years.""

They also took the leaked report, which they found in Carmody's safe. But the reporter said he doesn't believe they'll be able to find the source from the document.

Carmody told NBC he's always had a good working relationship with the SFPD, but now he just wants his equipment back.

""At this point, they've shut down my business completely,"" he said. ""I don't have the gear I need to do my job.""

The SFPD defended the raid, calling it ""one step in the process of investigating a potential case of obstruction of justice along with the illegal distribution of a confidential police report.""

What else?

Meanwhile, the local chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists is asking why the department ignored California's shield laws, which protect reporters from being forced to reveal their sources. The organization said the raid ""shows an alarming disregard for the right to gather and report on information.""

Carmody's lawyer, Thomas Burke, slammed the SFPD for its invasion of his client's work as a professional journalist, telling The Times, ""It's designed to intimidate. It's essentially the confiscation of a newsroom.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poland-nato-missile-very-likely-fired-into-poland-by-ukrainian-forces-in-tragic-incident,2019-05-13
Police shoot and kill critically endangered tiger to free Florida man who stuck his arm in cage,"Florida police say they were forced to shoot and kill a critically endangered tiger at the Naples Zoo after it bit and seriously injured a man who had entered a restricted area and reached into the animal's enclosure.

According to the Collier County Sheriff's Office, the injured man was a member of a third-party cleaning service contracted by the zoo. After the zoo had closed for the day on Wednesday, he entered an unauthorized area near a tiger that was inside its enclosure, police said.

Investigators say the man was either petting or feeding the animal, ""both of which are unauthorized and dangerous activities,"" when he was attacked.

""Initial reports indicate that the tiger grabbed the man’s arm and pulled it into the enclosure after the the man traversed an initial fence barrier and put his arm through the fencing of the tiger enclosure,"" the sheriff's office said in a Facebook post.

Police were called to the zoo at 6:26 p.m. The first deputy to arrive on the scene kicked the tiger enclosure in an unsuccessful attempt to get the animal to release the man's arm from its mouth. When that didn't work, the deputy was ""forced to shoot"" the tiger, police said.

The zoo later confirmed that the 8-year-old tiger, named Eko, was killed.



The man, who is in his 20s, was seriously injured and was taken to a local hospital by Collier County emergency medical services, the sheriff's office said. Police added that the cleaning company the man worked for was responsible for cleaning restrooms and the gift shop, not animal enclosures, and that he should not have been anywhere near an animal enclosure.

Eko the Malayan tiger was acquired by the zoo in 2019 and relocated from the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle in 2020, according to a press release from Naples Zoo.

Malayan tigers are a critically endangered species, with fewer than 200 mature animals living in the wild, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. They are native to Malaysia and endangered because of habitat loss, poaching, depletion of their prey, and conflict with human beings, the zoo said.



News of the tiger's death sparked anger on social media.



""So the man enters a restricted area, sticks his hand in to feed the tiger. And they kill this endangered animal??"" Peter Daou, a Democratic political strategist, wrote on Twitter.



""Why was the tiger shot?!!!!"" Norberto Barba, a producer and director for ""Law and Order: SVU,"" demanded.

""If we're going to keep animals in zoos, the animals' lives should be prioritized over people who do stupid s**t like stick their arm into a tiger enclosure,"" Ari Cohn, the Free Speech Counsel for TechFreedom, said.

""Should have just done a battlefield amputation to free the guy. Lesson learned,"" he said.

""Critically endangered Malayan tiger shot after being provoked by certifiably moronic dumb-ass,"" another user commented.

Politico's founding editor calls for rewriting of Constitution to prevent 2024 Trump win,"Democrats' 2024 presidential prospects have been characterized as being ""increasingly bleak."" Among the many problems now facing the nation, the White House must contend with responsibility over a looming recession, an unprecedented border crisis, and a devastating opioid epidemic.

With the majority of the country disapproving of President Joe Biden's performance, 67% of voters sure the nation is headed in the wrong direction, and indications that former President Donald Trump may not only be able to win the GOP nomination but potentially the forthcoming presidential election as well, some liberals are contemplating extreme means to keep him off the ballot.

Politico editor versus the U.S. Constitution

John F. Harris, founding editor of the news site Politico, recently suggested in an op-ed that the same system that enabled Trump to get elected in 2016 and to four years later receive 7 million more votes than any sitting president in history must be changed.

Harris wrote that, on the one hand, Trump is ""an enemy of the Constitution."" Yet Harris also admitted that ""from a progressive perspective many of the most offensive features of his tenure were not in defiance of the Constitution.""

Despite presenting the former president as a ""constitutional menace,"" it is the Constitution and its ""problematic provisions"" that Harris intimated are the more menacing.



Harris called deference to the Constitution ""the indispensable foundation of American democracy,"" though suggested reverence would be going too far, particularly if it precludes Americans from drastically altering those foundations.

Harris argued ""a new constitutional consensus"" is needed in order to prevent Americans from voting for this candidate to whom he is personally opposed and to make progress ""on issues ranging from climate change to ensuring that technology giants act in the public interest.""

This consensus cannot be brought about just by stacking the Supreme Court with ""sympathetic justices,"" but by addressing ""more fundamental challenges embedded in the document itself — in particular the outsized power it gives to states, at a time when the most urgent problems and most credible remedies are national in character.""

The system as is will not provide the results so-called progressives desire, so a ""constitutional renovation"" is needed.

Extra to minimizing states rights, Harris observed an opportunity and need to ""clean up the infuriatingly murky language of the Second Amendment,"" to alter or abolish the Electoral College, and to impose ""term limits for the Court.""

The obstacles to the realization of the left's agenda are the result of, according to Harris, ""what progressives reasonably perceive as the infirmities of the Constitution.""

Harris likened the current moment to the latter part of the 19th century, drawing a parallel between former President Abraham Lincoln's abolishment of slavery in the Confederate states with progressives' potential elimination of America's ""outdated"" and ""intolerable"" Republican checks and balances.

He threatened that a refusal to transmogrify the Constitution to sate progressives' political ambitions might result in conflict — in civil war.



Harris ultimately claimed that improvisation (i.e., to the Constitution) would be one way to avoid kinetic civil strife. By abolishing the Electoral College and potentially securing the 2024 Democratic candidate a victory by way of the popular vote, war can be averted.

Sparing the demos a choice

Harris is not alone in looking for ways to bypass the electorate to ensure Trump is not elected in 2024.

Former Clinton campaign manager Dick Morris recently suggested that ""Democrats have given up opposing Trump politically ... They know he's going to run again, and they know that Republicans are probably going to win because the economy is in such terrible shape.""

Morris told NewsMax that one strategy they have adopted is to ""litigate him to death, persecution by prosecution.""

The August raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence and the corresponding classified documents investigation, E. Jean Carroll's defamation lawsuit, and New York Attorney General Letitia James' fraud lawsuit are three prongs of a broader litigious endeavor to take Trump down.

Earlier this summer, it was suggested in The Hill that testimonies given before the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, protests, could be used to justify the invocation of section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Accordingly, Trump would be formally accused of participation in an insurrection against the U.S. and disqualified from being president.

Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.), who sits on the committee, suggested earlier this year that the 14th Amendment might serve as ""a blockade for [Trump] ever being able to run for office again.""

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), the former DNC chair who publicly questioned the legitimacy of the 2016 presidential election, indicated she would ""continue to explore all legal paths to ensure that the people who tried to subvert our democracy are not in charge of it.""

If the 14th Amendment and the lawsuits aren't enough to keep the former president off the ballot, then Liz Cheney, who lost in a landslide to the Trump-backed Harriet Hageman, threatened to go so far as to deprive the Republican Party of her membership.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-raid-home-of-journalist-for-not-revealing-his-source,2022-09-29
PolitiFact rates Fox host's claim about Russian oil as 'mostly false' even while admitting she was spot-on,"Fact-checking website PolitiFact recently engaged in some head-scratching analysis in an attempt to discredit a claim made by Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo — but ended up doing the exact opposite.

What are the details?

At issue were remarks made by Bartiromo during an appearance on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" on Feb. 22. While speaking with her fellow Fox host, Bartiromoargued that U.S. dependency on Russian oil was growing at exactly the wrong time: during unprovoked Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

At that time, the U.S. and other Western allies had, in Bartiromo's opinion, only tepidly responded to Russia's troop-building near the Ukrainian border, by refusing to curtail their imports of Russian energy resources.

As an example, Bartiromo said this: ""The United States is also reliant on Russian oil — we have doubled our imports from Russia in the last year. So, [there's] no question why President Biden is begging OPEC and others to pump more oil.""

Two days later, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sparking a military conflict the likes of which mainland Europe hasn't experienced since World War II.

As of Wednesday morning, the Biden administration continued in its refusal to cut off U.S. imports of Russian oil, thereby enriching Moscow — despite harsh criticism from key members in Congress.

What did PolitiFact say?

In a Monday column, PolitiFact parachuted in to assess Bartiromo's claim that the U.S. doubled oil imports from Russia as ""mostly false.""

The fact-checker suggested that when crude oil imports and refined products imports such as gasoline and kerosene are combined, it shows the year-over-year increase to be 28%, not 50%.

But that's not how oil imports are typically categorized. Normally, oil imports and energy imports — which include refined products — are categorized separately. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, which PolitiFact cites multiple times, shows as much by breaking down crude oil imports in a separate chart.

A spokesperson for Bartiromo evidently explained this to PolitiFact, resulting in the fact-checker admitting, ""The U.S. more than doubled its crude oil imports from Russia, to about 208,000 barrels a day in the first 11 months of 2021, from 76,000 barrels a day in 2020.""

Amazingly, that wasn't enough for the fact-checker to change its assessment, even while it openly admitted that Bartiromo's specific claim was accurate.

""But Bartiromo’s broader point was about the extent of U.S. reliance on Russian oil, which remains fairly modest,"" the article went on to say. ""Russia accounted for only about 3% of overall U.S. crude oil imports in 2021 — a 2 percentage point increase from 2020.""



It seems, to cover its tracks, the fact-checker switched gears to argue that Bartiromo's apparent broader point was overstated since Russian imports only make up a relatively small portion of U.S. oil imports as a whole.

But that wasn't the specific claim that PolitiFact was examining, and so its assessment should be changed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-shoot-and-kill-critically-endangered-tiger-to-free-florida-man-who-stuck-his-arm-in-cage,2022-03-02
Poll: Nearly three quarters of Americans agree Putin's invasion of Ukraine was unjustified,"If there is one issue that the vast majority of Americans can agree on, it's opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Nearly three quarters of Americans said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine was unjustified, and 76% of those surveyed gave an unfavorable opinion of the warmonger-in-chief, according to a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll.

This survey of 1.523 U.S. adults was conducted online between Feb. 24 and 27 and shows a large swing in public opinion against Russia and in favor of Ukraine.

Three weeks ago, before the invasion began, 49% of Americans said the U.S. should remain neutral while 46% said America should side with Ukraine in a potential conflict with Russia, Yahoo News reports. Now, after millions of Ukrainians have been displaced by the conflict and pictures and videos from the war have circulated on social media, U.S. adults are more than twice as likely to advocate for siding with Ukraine (57%) than remaining neutral (25%).

Strong majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and self-identified independents say that the invasion of Ukraine was unjustified. Overall, 74% of U.S. adults said Putin's decision to send troops to Ukraine was not justified, 20% were not sure, and 6% said the invasion was justified. Nearly half of survey respondents (47%) agree that it is in America's best interests to stop Russia and help Ukraine. Just 26% overall said ""the conflict is none of America's business,"" though more Republicans (30%) and independents (33%) said so than Democrats (17%).

Americans also appear to be in broad agreement with how the U.S. should respond to the war, with 56% of survey respondents saying they favor the sanctions imposed on Russia by President Joe Biden. Even 53% of Republicans said they favor Biden's sanctions, which cut off Russia's government from accessing Western banks and financial markets. And most Americans are opposed to military intervention, with 56% agreeing with Biden's vow ""not to send troops to Ukraine""; only 15% disagree.

However, a plurality of those polled, 39%, said Biden was ""not tough enough"" on Russia, while 28% said Biden's response has been ""about right."" Just 4% said Biden has been ""too tough."" Only a third of Americans approve of how Biden has handled ""the situation with Russia and Ukraine."" Almost half of those polled (48%) said they disapprove, while 17% are unsure.

Slightly more respondents (40%) said that former President Donald Trump would have handled the situation in Ukraine better than Biden (38%).

Most Americans (62%) would like to see the U.S. take further action against Russia, either through ""more economic sanctions"" (33%), ""military force"" (3%), or both (26%).

The American public is paying attention to the war in Ukraine, with more than two-thirds (70%) saying they're following news updates about Ukraine at least ""somewhat closely."" The Russian-Ukraine war is now tied with inflation for what Americans think should be Biden's top priority as president. The president's response to war in Europe will be one of the defining moments of his legacy.

Poll shows strong support for voter ID and easier early voting,"A strong majority of Americans continues to support voter ID requirements even as Democrats and mainstream media reports attack Republican-led efforts to strengthen voter ID laws as ""voter suppression,"" according to a new poll.

On Monday, Monmouth University published the results of a survey that shows an overwhelming 80% of Americans support requiring voters to show a photo I.D. in order to vote.

The poll also found that most Americans support easier access to early voting. Americans are divided on expanding vote-by-mail, though a majority would support establishing federal guidelines for both mail-in voting and voting early.

From Monmouth:

A large majority (71%) of the public feels in-person early voting should generally be made easier. Just 16% say it should be made harder. Opinion is more divided on voting by mail – 50% say this should be made easier and 39% say it should be made harder. At the same time, fully 4 in 5 Americans (80%) support requiring voters to show photo identification in order to cast a ballot. Just 18% oppose this.



Easing in-person early voting access and requiring photo IDs both have bipartisan majority support. Approval of making early voting easier stands at 89% among Democrats, 68% among independents, and 56% among Republicans. Support for requiring a photo ID to vote stands at 62% among Democrats, 87% among independents, and 91% among Republicans. Only Democrats back making voting by mail easier to do, with 84% supporting this idea compared to just 40% of independents and 26% of Republicans.



More than 2 in 3 Americans (69%) support establishing national guidelines to allow vote-by-mail and in-person early voting in federal elections in every state. Just 25% oppose this idea. Support for establishing national voting guidelines on these issues comes from 92% of Democrats, 63% of independents, and 51% of Republicans.

""The poll contains some seemingly conflicting information on voter access. The bottom line seems to be that most Democrats and Republicans want to take the potential for election results to be questioned off the table. The problem, though, is they aren't likely to agree on how to get there,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

In recent months after the 2020 presidential election, which was unsuccessfully contested by former President Donald Trump, several Republican-controlled legislatures in various states have attempted to pass controversial laws they say would strengthen election security. Georgia, Florida, and Texas have each adopted high profile election reforms that critics say are partisan efforts intended to restrict the ability of non-white voters from accessing the ballot. Some Democrats and media pundits have gone so far as accusing Republicans in these states of implementing ""Jim Crow 2.0.""

Republicans counter that the unprecedented volume of mail-in ballots requested last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic had created a possibility for voter fraud and say new laws are necessary to protect the integrity of U.S. elections at a time when many Americans believe fraud was conducted.

Despite harsh media criticism, several of the measures implemented into law by Republican states are actually popular. The maligned Georgia law, for example, expanded early voting in the state and created a requirement for mail-in ballots to be accompanied with a form of photo I.D.

The controversy over election integrity has been inflamed by Trump's repeated claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent and that President Joe Biden's victory in several states was illegitimate. The Monmouth poll found that nearly one-third of survey respondents believe that Biden won due to voter fraud, while a majority of 61% of Americans think the election was fair and square.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone June 9-14, with 810 adults in the United States. The question results have a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/politifact-bartiromo-mostly-false-on-russian-oil,2021-06-21
Polls show Joe Biden's approval plummeting after disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal,"The American public is souring on President Joe Biden after witnessing the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal that his administration facilitated.

What are the details?

According to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, Biden's job performance has plummeted as Americans have witnessed his administration's Afghanistan blunder.

On Friday, the poll found that 53% of Americans approved of Biden's job performance. By Monday, that figure had fallen to 46%.

Unfortunately for Biden, the Reuters/Ipsos survey is not the only poll showing lopsided approval ratings. Rasmussen Reports surveys show similar figures — a majority of Americans disapprove of Biden's job performance, especially after the fall of Kabul — while polling averages from RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight show a majority of Americans disapprove of Biden's job performance.

What about the Afghan withdrawal?

It's not just Biden. Americans, overall, are souring on withdrawing from Afghanistan.

In fact, a Morning Consult/Politico poll, conducted Aug. 13-16, showed that American support for the withdrawal plummeted 20 points in four months' time. In April, the poll found that 69% of registered voters supported the withdrawal. The most recent survey, however, showed that just 49% of registered voters continue to support the withdrawal after witnessing the Taliban's swift victory.

Support for the withdrawal dropped even further when respondents were confronted with the terrorism implications of America's botched Afghan withdrawal.

From Politico:

When asked whether the U.S. should still withdraw its military presence if this would create an opportunity for terrorist groups like al Qaeda to establish operations in Afghanistan, voters were less supportive. Just 35 percent of participants said the American military should withdraw in this case, with 48 percent saying it should not. This highlights the fear of terrorism coming from the country, as U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan began following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.



Of the voters surveyed, 38 percent said the U.S. should still withdraw if the Taliban regains control of most of Afghanistan. Forty-five percent of voters said the U.S. should probably or definitely not withdraw, a larger share than those who generally opposed the decision to withdraw.

Support for Biden's withdrawal is likely to drop even further.

Americans are being confronted with the Biden administration's potential abandonment of tens of thousands of Afghans — along with their families — who risked their lives to help America conduct its military mission in the country.

Seeing desperate Afghans cling to planes, some even falling to their tragic deaths, will drive support for the withdrawal, and Biden, further down.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-nearly-three-quarters-of-americans-agree-putin-s-invasion-of-ukraine-was-unjustified,2021-08-18
US Secretary of State Pompeo threatens military action in Venezuela 'if that's what's required',"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that U.S. military action in Venezuela was ""possible"" if the U.S. government determined that it was ""required.""

What's happening in Venezuela?

Venezuela has been suffering from a cycle of increasing poverty exacerbated by the socialist policies of the country's dictator, Nicolás Maduro. Although Maduro was legally elected in 2013 to replace his mentor, Hugo Chavez, his 2018 election was denounced by both Venezuelan opposition leaders and the international community as being a sham.

After the election, the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido, declared himself to be the rightful interim president, according to the rules laid out in the Venezuelan constitution. The U.S. government has expressed support for Guaido.

On Tuesday, Guaido called for Venezuelan citizens and the military to rise up and overthrow Maduro. Maduro's forces began fighting back against pro-Guaido supporters.

What did Pompeo say?

So far, the United States has avoided getting directly involved, but Pompeo indicated that this could change if the U.S. determined it was necessary.

On Wednesday morning, Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo asked Pompeo if the U.S. might at any point decide that military action was necessary.

""The president has been crystal clear, and incredibly consistent,"" Pompeo responded. ""Military action is possible. If that's what's required, that's what the United States will do. We're trying to do everything we can to avoid violence.""

He also said the U.S. prefers ""a peaceful transition of government there, where Maduro leaves and a new election is held"" but added that the president was prepared to authorize military intervention ""if that's what's required.""

Pompeo also told Fox News on Tuesday that Maduro had been trying to flee Venezuela rather than risk facing opposition forces.

""He had an airplane on the tarmac, he was ready to leave this morning as we understand it and the Russians indicated he should stay,"" Pompeo said, adding that Maduro had been ""headed for Havana.""

Russia and Cuba have been among Maduro's few allies through the recent events. The U.S. has been urging Russia not to get involved in the Venezuelan conflict, following a longstanding U.S. policy of trying to prevent European influence in Latin America dating back to the President James Monroe, and the Monroe Doctrine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-shows-strong-support-for-voter-id-and-easier-early-voting,2019-05-01
President Biden says the Pope told him to keep taking communion and called him a 'good Catholic',"President Joe Biden said that Pope Francis told him he was a ""good Catholic"" and said he could continue to take communion despite the objections of many U.S. bishops.

Biden made the claim after a private meeting with the pontiff at the Vatican on Friday.

""We just talked about the fact he was happy that I was a good Catholic and I should keep receiving Communion,"" Biden said about the meeting.

He added that the subject of abortion did not come up during their meeting.

A statement from the White House indicated that Biden thanked the Pope for advocating for an ""equitable global economic recovery"" and for fighting global warming.

""Biden thanked His Holiness for his advocacy for the world's poor and those suffering from hunger, conflict, and persecution,"" the statement added.

The Vatican did not confirm Biden's claim in their official statement about their meeting.

Biden's claim will likely disappoint and anger many conservative Catholics in the U.S. who have called for communion to be refused to politicians who support abortion, which is contrary to Catholic church teaching.

The issue is going to be taken up by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops following upon a vote during their June plenary meeting to address it generally. After Biden met with the Pope, they released a statement saying that they would not single out any specific politician if they vote to make a statement about the issue.

The Pope had previously responded to the controversy by calling on the bishops to avoid politicizing the church's highest sacrament, which would turn it into a ""source of discord rather than unity within the episcopate and the larger church in the United States.""

"Pope Francis: For Lent, please stop insulting people on social media","Pope Francis added a new suggestion to the list of things Catholics should consider abstaining from during the 40-day season of Lent: online trolling.

The pope said during Ash Wednesday remarks that in addition to giving up junk food or other vices during the lead-up to Easter, Christians should also abstain from social media conflict, according to Reuters:

Lent, he said in partially improvised remarks, ""is a time to give up useless words, gossip, rumours, tittle-tattle and speak to God on a first name basis,"" he said.



""We live in an atmosphere polluted by too much verbal violence, too many offensive and harmful words, which are amplified by the internet,"" he said. ""Today, people insult each other as if they were saying 'Good Day.'""

Not only should people stop attacking one another online during Lent, the pope said, but they should consider unplugging from technology in general in order to get closer to God. From the Verge:

""We live in an environment polluted by too much verbal violence, by many offensive and harmful words, which the internet amplifies,"" said Pope Francis. ""We are inundated with empty words, with advertisements, with subtle messages. We have become used to hearing everything about everyone and we risk slipping into a worldliness that atrophies our hearts.""



""Hearing everything about everyone"" is a remarkably good description of how the current internet can feel — though the Pope's prescription, granted, is more specific than most digital detox programs. ""Lent is the right time to make room for the Word of God. It is the time to turn off the television and open the Bible. It is the time to disconnect from your cell phone and connect to the Gospel,"" he said.

Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, a 40-day period of fasting, reflection, and good deeds leading to the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Easter. Many Christians wear ashes on their forehead for the day, a symbol of man's mortality and repentance.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pompeo-threatens-military-action-in-venezuela,2020-02-26
Mayor Wheeler and Biden blame Trump for Portland shooting,"Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) blamed President Donald Trump for violence that led up to Saturday's fatal shooting of a seemingly conservative-leaning man in the city that Wheeler governs.

""Do you seriously wonder, Mr. President, why this is the first time in decades that America has seen this level of violence? It's you who have created the hate and the division,"" Wheeler said on Sunday during a press conference regarding the deadly Portland shooting.

""Yesterday's events began with hundreds of cars filled with supporters of the president rallying in Clackamas County and then driving through downtown Portland,"" Wheeler said. ""They were supported and energized by the president himself.""

""President Trump, for four years, we've had to live with you and your racist attacks on black people, we learned early about your sexist attitudes towards women,"" Wheeler said of the president. ""We've had to endure clips of you mocking a disabled man. We've had to listen to your anti-democratic attacks on journalists. We've read your tweets slamming private citizens to the point of receiving death threats. And we've listened to your attacks on immigrants.""

""We've listened to you label Mexicans — rapists,"" Wheeler continued. ""We've heard you say that John McCain wasn't a hero because he was a prisoner of war. And now you're attacking Democratic mayors and the very institutions of democracy that have served this nation well since its founding.""

""Do you seriously wonder, Mr. President, why this is the first time in decades that America has seen this level of violence? It's you who have created the hate and the division,"" the Portland mayor stated.

""President Trump, you bring no peace. You bring no respect to our democracy,"" he added. ""You, Mr. President, need to do your job as the leader of this nation. I, Mr. President, will do my job as the mayor of this city. We will both be held accountable as we should. I'm calling out every other elected official in Oregon to join me. Not only in defeating racism but helping me to stop the violence as we are and will continue to be held accountable by all of our residents.""

Trump retaliated to Wheeler's accusation in a series of tweets, including calling him a ""weak and pathetic mayor.""



""Ted Wheeler, the wacky Radical Left Do Nothing Democrat Mayor of Portland, who has watched great death and destruction of his City during his tenure, thinks this lawless situation should go on forever. Wrong! Portland will never recover with a fool for a Mayor,"" Trump wrote.

""He tried mixing with the Agitators and Anarchists and they mocked him,"" the president continued. ""He would like to blame me and the Federal Government for going in, but he hasn't seen anything yet We have only been there with a small group to defend our U.S. Courthouse, because he couldn't do it.""

""The people of Portland, like all other cities & parts of our great Country, want Law & Order,"" Trump stressed.

Trump then called out Joe Biden, ""The Radical Left Democrat Mayors, like the dummy running Portland, or the guy right now in his basement unwilling to lead or even speak out against crime, will never be able to do it!""



Biden joined Wheeler in saying that Trump was to blame for the violence in Democratic-controlled cities across the nation.

""The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable,"" Biden said on Sunday. ""Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable. I condemn this violence unequivocally. I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same.""

""We must not become a country at war with ourselves. A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you,"" the Democratic presidential nominee said. ""A country that vows vengeance toward one another. But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are.""



""What does President Trump think will happen when he continues to insist on fanning the flames of hate and division in our society and using the politics of fear to whip up his supporters? He is recklessly encouraging violence,"" Biden stated.



""He may believe tweeting about law and order makes him strong - but his failure to call on his supporters to stop seeking conflict shows just how weak he is,"" Biden added. ""He may think that war in our streets is good for his reelection chances, but that is not presidential leadership - or even basic human compassion.""

""Donald Trump has been president for almost four years,"" the former vice president said. ""The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper. And all of us are less safe because Donald Trump can't do the job of the American president.""

Portland has experienced 93-straight days of protests, many of which have escalated into riots. Black Lives Matter protesters chained themselves inside the lobby of Wheeler's condo on Friday.



Earlier this month, Wheeler warned rioters in Portland that they are helping Trump get reelected. ""You are creating the B-roll film that will be used in ads nationally to help Donald Trump during this campaign,"" Wheeler said.

Trump has offered to send in federal officers to quell the riots in Portland numerous times, and as recently as two days before the fatal shooting.

On Friday, Wheeler rebuffed the president's offer by writing a letter. ""Yet again, you said you offered to aid Portland by sending in federal law enforcement to our city,"" Wheeler wrote. ""On behalf of the City of Portland: No thanks."" Adding, ""Stay away please.""

Despite not having federal agents in Portland, the Department of Justice announced last week that 74 people are facing federal charges for crimes committed during violent riots in Oregon's largest city.

Also on Sunday, Trump tweeted out condolences to the man who was shot dead in Portland. The victim is identified as Jay Bishop.

Bishop was a member of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer, and was wearing a hat dedicated to the right-wing group when he was killed. Joey Gibson, founder of the Patriot Prayer, said, ""We love Jay and he had such a huge heart. God bless him and the life he lived.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pope-biden-communion-good-catholic,2020-08-30
VIDEO: Portland rioters topple Lincoln and Roosevelt statues in 'day of rage' against Columbus Day,"Rioters in Portland, Oregon, toppled statues of former Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln Sunday night, declaring a ""day of rage"" in anticipation of Columbus Day.

According to the Associated Press, the rioters assembled for ""Indigenous Peoples Day of Rage,"" referring to ""Indigenous Peoples Day,"" an alternative holiday to Columbus Day favored by progressive activists who accuse famous Italian explorer Christopher Columbus of committing acts of genocide against Native Americans.

The AP noted that President Roosevelt ""expressed hostility towards Native Americans, once saying: 'I don't go so far as to think that the only good Indians are dead Indians, but I believe nine out of every 10 are.'""

OregonLive reported that nearly 200 people made up the crowd marching through downtown Portland, most dressing in head-to-toe black and some wielding melee weapons. The organizers of the event prohibited video livestreaming and photographs of their criminal activity and harassed individuals who attempted to film. One apartment resident reportedly had lasers shined at his eyes and liquid thrown in his face for attempting to take video of the riot from his terrace.



The rioters defaced the statues with paint and used chains and a blowtorch to topple the monuments. The words ""Dakota 38"" were spray-painted on the base of Lincoln's statue, a reference to the 38 Dakota tribesmen whose hangings Lincoln approved after a violent conflict with white settlers in Minnesota.

At 9 p.m. they were successful in tearing down Roosevelt's statue, called ""Theodore Roosevelt, Rough Rider."" Several minutes later they pulled down Lincoln's statue.

After pulling down the statues, they moved on to commit more acts of vandalism, smashing the windows at the Oregon Historical Society and then doing the same at the Portland State University campus police office.



Journalist Andy Ngô covered the protests and shared video taken at the event Sunday night.

According to OregonLive, the police declared the demonstrations a riot and ordered the rioters to disperse but did not directly intervene until nearly an hour after the first statue was torn down. Police said anyone involved in ""criminal behavior, including vandalism,"" would be arrested.

The crowds did not disperse until police cruisers flooded the area and officers in tactical gear began making arrests.



President Donald Trump on Monday called for law enforcement to act and ""focus their energy on ANTIFA.""



In June, rioters in Portland toppled a nearly 100-year-old statue of George Washington, painting the words ""BLM"" and ""genocidal colonist"" on the statue.

Samantha Power says 'catastrophic' food shortages are an opportunity to implement left-wing policies,"A Biden administration member said that ""catastrophic"" food and fertilizer shortages caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine are a great opportunity to implement left-wing policies.

Samantha Power, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, made the comments during an interview with ""This Week"" on Sunday.

""We're seeing global food shortages all around the world,"" said anchor George Stephanopoulos, ""as the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, what more can be done to address those shortages?""

""Thank you for posing that question, it is just another catastrophic effect of Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, I mean as if the harms in Ukraine weren't enough, you have countries like in subsaharan Africa and the Middle East who get maybe eighty, ninety percent of their wheat or their grain, overall, from Russia and Ukraine, and you see massive spikes in food prices,"" said Power.

""Food prices, right now George, globally are up 34% from where they were a year ago, aided substantially, again, by this invasion,"" she added.



Power said they were working to increase food production from farmers, but also wanted to use the opportunity to make farmers choose green energy alternatives to fertilizer.

""Fertilizer shortages are real now because Russia is a big exporter of fertilizer. And even though fertilizer is not sanctioned, less fertilizer is coming out of Russia. As a result, we're working with countries to think about natural solutions like manure and compost. And this may hasten transitions that would have been in the interest of farmers to make eventually anyway,"" Power continued.



""So never let a crisis go to waste,"" she concluded.

She went on to defend the Biden administration against criticism that its policies led to high food prices.

The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is in its tenth week, with some estimates claiming civilian casualties as high as 2,685, and the U.S. State Dept. estimating that more than 10,000 Russian soldiers have perished in the brutal war.

Liberal Dems have egg on face over letter urging Biden to negotiate with Putin — then they take coward's way out,"The Congressional Progressive Caucus is blaming a staffer for releasing a controversial letter urging President Joe Biden to negotiate with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

What did the letter say?

The letter, signed by 30 liberal Democrats and sent by caucus chairwoman Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), urged Biden to make ""vigorous diplomatic efforts"" to end the Ukraine war.

The Democrats urged Biden to ""engage in direct talks with Russia, explore prospects for a new European security arrangement acceptable to all parties that will allow for a sovereign and independent Ukraine, and, in coordination with our Ukrainian partners, seek a rapid end to the conflict and reiterate this goal as America’s chief priority.""

The letter was sharply criticized by Ukrainian politicians and even some of its signatories, who claimed they endorsed it months ago but no longer support its message.

""Timing in diplomacy is everything,"" Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) said, for example. ""I signed this letter on June 30, but a lot has changed since then. I wouldn't sign it today.""

But what is the caucus saying now?

On Tuesday, Jayapal withdrew the letter, noting its release committed the biggest transgression possible in Washington, D.C. — the appearance that they agree with Republicans, who want to stop sending billions of taxpayer dollars to Ukraine.

""The Congressional Progressive Caucus hereby withdraws its recent letter to the White House regarding Ukraine,"" Jayapal said.

Even worse, Jayapal blamed a staffer for releasing the letter without authorization.

""The letter was drafted several months ago, but unfortunately was released by staff without vetting,"" she claimed. ""As Chair of the Caucus, I accept responsibility for this.

""Every war ends with diplomacy, and this one will too after Ukrainian victory,"" she went on to write. ""The letter sent yesterday, although restating that basic principle, has been conflated with GOP opposition to support for the Ukrainians’ just defense of their national sovereignty. As such, it is a distraction at this time and we withdraw the letter.""

Anything else?

Jayapal's excuse — that a staffer released the letter without approval — was summarily condemned.

Pregnant woman's baby dies when she gets shot — and she's charged with manslaughter while the shooter goes free,"An Alabama woman was charged with manslaughter after her unborn baby died when she was shot during a confrontation with another woman, according to AL.com.

Marshae Jones was charged with manslaughter and taken into custody Wednesday for the December 2018 incident. The woman who shot her, Ebony Jemison, was initially charged with manslaughter but the charge was dismissed when a grand jury failed to indict.

Jones, who was five months pregnant at the time was charged because authorities say she initiated and pressed the fight with Jemison at a Pleasant Grove Dollar General, and that Jemison was acting in self defense.

""The investigation showed that the only true victim in this was the unborn baby,"" Pleasant Grove Lt. Danny Reid said according to AL.com. ""It was the mother of the child who initiated and continued the fight which resulted in the death of her own unborn baby.

""Let's not lose sight that the unborn baby is the victim here,"" Reid also said. ""She had no choice in being brought unnecessarily into a fight where she was relying on her mother for protection.""

Police said the conflict that led to the shooting was about the unborn baby's father.

Jones is being held in Jefferson County Jail where she is being held on $50,000 bond.

""When a 5-month pregnant woman initiates a fight and attacks another person, I believe some responsibility lies with her as to any injury to her unborn child,"" Reid said. ""That child is dependent on its mother to try to keep it from harm, and she shouldn't seek out unnecessary physical altercations.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/power-food-shortage-green-policies,2019-06-27
Pres. Trump met with Pelosi and Schumer on infrastructure—and it actually went well. Here's what they agreed on.,"President Donald Trump met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday to discuss infrastructure plans, and the two sides came to an agreement on the amount, according to The Hill.

The three leaders agreed to pursue a deal on a $2 trillion infrastructure bill, setting a foundation on which to build future negotiations and surprising some observers who expected another contentious meeting with the trio.

Schumer said Pres. Trump was more agreeable than he has been in past meetings, and that he didn't bring up the issue of Democratic investigations as an obstacle to negotiations like he has in the past.

""That was different than some of the other meetings that we've had,"" Schumer told reporters afterward. ""This was a very, very good start. … We hope it will go to a constructive conclusion.

""In previous meetings, the president has said 'if these investigations continue, I can't work with you.' He didn't bring it up,"" Schumer said. ""The two are not mutually exclusive and we were glad he didn't make it that way.""

Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney had expressed doubt that the president would overlook the Democrats' aggressive investigations in to his administration and campaign.

""It's not reasonable to expect the president to work with you on Monday on a big infrastructure bill and have you punching him in the face on Tuesday on 15 investigations,"" Mulvaney said during a Tuesday speech in California.

There is a good chance of conflict still to come on infrastructure however. Agreeing on how much to spend is one thing; agreeing on how to pay for it is another entirely.

A point of contention will be a desire from some Democrats to raise taxes and roll back Pres. Trump's 2017 tax cuts in order to fund the infrastructure bill.

""The common denominator, no matter what the subject the Democrats bring up, is a tax increase,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters before the meeting.

Biden says battling inflation is his chief economic priority,"As Americans continue to get soaked by soaring inflation, President Joe Biden continues to describe inflation as his number one economic priority.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released new consumer price index data on Friday which shows that inflation continues to fly high.

""The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.0 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.3 percent in April,"" according to the BLS. ""Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.6 percent before seasonal adjustment.""

""The all items index increased 8.6 percent for the 12 months ending May, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981,"" the report said.

Americans have been facing skyrocketing gas prices — as of Friday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of regular gas has reached $4.986.

During a speech at the Port of Los Angeles on Friday, Biden reiterated that combatting inflation is his ""top economic priority.""

The White House has been pointing toward Russia's invasion of Ukraine as one of the main culprit's behind high inflation, and during his speech on Friday, Biden continued that practice by making a comment about Russian President Vladimir ""Putin's tax on both food and gas.""

President Biden Delivers Remarks at the Port of Los Angeles youtu.be

Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, and the U.S. has banned the importation of Russian oil and other products.

""I call on Congress to pass a bill to cut shipping costs this month, and get it to my desk, so we can lower the price of goods,"" Biden said in a statement about the consumer price index on Friday. ""And, I call on Congress to pass legislation to cut costs for families like energy bills and prescription drugs. The deficit has come down more under my watch as President than at any time in history, but if Congress would pass tax reform to make the wealthiest Americans and big corporations pay their fair share, we could reduce this inflationary pressure even more. These are the most significant things Congress can do to help families now and complement the Federal Reserve’s efforts to bring inflation down.""



Roaring inflation, which has been dramatically eroding the purchasing power of Americans' money, could pose a serious problem for Democrats during the 2022 election cycle.



A Trafalgar Group survey of likely general election voters found that 59.9% thought that the president's ""policies and spending"" are the top causes for increasing inflation in America, compared to 31.6% who viewed the Russian conflict with Ukraine as the chief reason for rising inflation.

President Biden signs executive order calling for declassification review and release of some documents related to Sept. 11 attacks,"President Joe Biden has signed an executive order calling for declassification reviews of documents pertaining to the infamous Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.

""Today, I signed an executive order directing the Department of Justice and other relevant agencies to oversee a declassification review of documents related to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's September 11th investigations,"" the president said in a statement. ""The executive order requires the Attorney General to release the declassified documents publicly over the next six months.""



The president's move comes a little more than a week before the nation will mark the two decade anniversary of the terror attacks that left thousands dead.



On that day 20 years ago hijackers crashed into New York City's Twin Towers, which both eventually collapsed, and into the Pentagon in Washington D.C.

Another plane went down in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. It was around 20 minutes by air from the nation's capital.

""President Biden is asking us to trust that the administration will bring justice to the 9/11 community and we certainly hope this is a genuine step forward,"" Brett Eagleson, whose father was killed in the terror attacks, said in a statement, according to the Guardian. ""We will closely watch this process to ensure the justice department and FBI follow through, act in good faith and help our families uncover the truth in our pursuit of justice against the Saudi government. The first test will be on 9/11, and the world will be watching.""

President Trump nominated for Nobel Peace Prize; person behind nomination slams Obama,"President Donald Trump has officially been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.

Christian Tybring-Gjedde, a member of Norway's Parliament, said Trump is deserving of the esteemed award because of his efforts to broker peaceful relationships between countries, specifically citing the historic peace treaty between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.

What did Tybring-Gjedde say?

In an exclusive interview with Fox News, Tybring-Gjedde said the Nobel Prize Committee should examine Trump's record, for they will find that it is much more impressive than former President Barack Obama's.

Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009.

""For his merit, I think he has done more trying to create peace between nations than most other Peace Prize nominees,"" Tybring-Gjedde said.

""I'm not a big Trump supporter. The committee should look at the facts and judge him on the facts — not on the way he behaves sometimes,"" the Norwegian lawmaker continued. ""The people who have received the Peace Prize in recent years have done much less than Donald Trump. For example, Barack Obama did nothing.""

In his letter to the Nobel Prize Committee, Tybring-Gjedde explained the significance of the Israel-UAE peace deal.

""As it is expected other Middle Eastern countries will follow in the footsteps of the UAE, this agreement could be a game changer that will turn the Middle East into a region of cooperation and prosperity,"" he wrote, adding Trump has played a ""key role in facilitating contact between conflicting parties and … creating new dynamics in other protracted conflicts, such as the Kashmir border dispute between India and Pakistan, and the conflict between North and South Korea, as well as dealing with the nuclear capabilities of North Korea.""

""Indeed, Trump has broken a 39-year-old streak of American Presidents either starting a war or bringing the United States into an international armed conflict. The last president to avoid doing so was Peace Prize laureate Jimmy Carter,"" Tybring-Gjedde went on to write.

Why did Obama win the prize?

According to the Nobel Prize Committee, Obama won the award for ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.""

""Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world's attention and given its people hope for a better future. His diplomacy is founded in the concept that those who are to lead the world must do so on the basis of values and attitudes that are shared by the majority of the world's population,"" the committee said in 2009.

In 2015, the ex-secretary of the Nobel Prize Committee, Geir Lundestad — who chaired the committee in 2009 — revealed he regretted giving Obama the award.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/president-biden-inflation-top-priority,2020-09-09
Prince Harry rips 1st Amendment as 'bonkers' — and more than a few Americans get plenty annoyed: 'Show some utter respect',"Fresh on the heels of boldly commanding top podcaster — and MMA fighter — Joe Rogan to ""just stay out of it"" in regard to Rogan suggesting that young people should not get the COVID-19 vaccine, Prince Harry's outspoken mouth is getting him in trouble again.

What did he say this time?

The Duke of Sussex — who recently left his royal family behind in England for the sunnier environs of southern California, since which he's nabbed a considerable windfall through deals with American companies like Netflix and Spotify, the Daily Mail reported — was conversing on Dax Shepard's podcast Thursday when the subject of paparazzi taking photos of celebrities' children came up.

""I don't want to start, sort of, going down the First Amendment route because that's a huge subject and one in which I don't understand because I've only been here for a short period of time, but you can find a loophole in anything,"" Harry said, adding that ""laws were created to protect people.""

The prince added, ""I believe we live in an age now where you've got certain elements of the media redefining to us what privacy means. There's a massive conflict of interest. And then you've got social media platforms, trying to redefine what free speech means. ... And we're living in this world where we've almost, like, the laws have been completely flipped by the very people that need them flipped so they can make more money, and they can capitalize off our pain, grief, and this sort of general self-destructive mode that is happening in the moment.""

And soon Harry delivered the shot heard 'round the world: ""I've got so much I want to say about the First Amendment. I still don't understand it, but it is bonkers."" (In fairness, Shepard agreed: ""It is bonkers."")

The prince's comments can be heard in context after the 39-minute mark of the podcast.

How did folks react?

To put it mildly, a number of Americans didn't much care for Harry's commentary on the Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees citizens the right to freely express themselves, practice whatever religions they choose — or none at all — and to assemble and petition the government.

To say nothing of the fact that the prince is a guest here, making a load of cash here, and enjoying a lifestyle here protected by U.S. laws — and on top of that admitting that ""I still don't understand"" the First Amendment, yet summoning the arrogance to dismiss it as ""bonkers"" — a number of notable U.S. citizens fired back hard.

""We fought a war in 1776 so we don't have to care what you say or think,"" Meghan McCain of ""The View"" said in reaction to Harry's comments. ""That being said, you have chosen to seek refuge from your homeland here and thrive because all of what our country has to offer and one of the biggest things is the 1st Amendment — show some utter respect.""

Others shared McCain's sentiments:

Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas quipped in rather understated fashion that it's ""nice"" that Harry ""can say that.""

GOP U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, also of the Lone Star State, noted that Harry "" just doubled the size of my Independence Day party.""

Megyn Kelly reminded him that it's ""'b

""Don't let the door knob hit you, Windsor,"" Fox News' host Laura Ingraham tweeted.

Author Nick Adams — who's from Australia and says in his Twitter bio that he's ""American by choice"" — declared that ""Prince Harry should go back to the UK!""

Even fellow Brits got into the act. Former Brexit leader Nigel Farage observed that ""for Prince Harry to condemn the USA's First Amendment shows he has lost the plot. Soon he will not be wanted on either side of the pond.""

Dan Wootton of the UK's GBNews tweeted that ""the First Amendment is one of the biggest reasons why the USA is a bastion of free speech and freedom of expression. The fact Prince Harry doesn't like it because he thinks rich privileged folk deserve more rights than everyone else says a lot!""

Speaking of, Harry and Meghan just added more to their already considerable coffers with a new partnership with Proctor and Gamble, Yahoo Finance reported Sunday.

Anything else?

According to the Daily Mail, Harry also criticized Prince Charles, Prince Philip, and the queen during the podcast and complained he had suffered ""genetic pain,"" which led to royal aides demanding that give up his royal titles.

During the 2020 election cycle, Harry and Meghan issued a video widely interpreted as a campaign ad for then-candidate Joe Biden.

When asked for his reaction to the couple weighing in on the race at the time, then-President Donald Trump said, ""I'm not a fan of hers, and I would say this — and she probably has heard that — but I wish a lot of luck to Harry, 'cause he's gonna need it.""

Harry and Meghan also were famously interviewed by Oprah Winfrey recently, during which they alleged racism within the Royal Family.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/president-biden-signs-executive-order-calling-for-declassification-review-release-of-some-9-11-materials,2021-05-17
The same pro-abortion groups who encouraged everyone to believe Brett Kavanaugh's accusers have no comment about Tara Reade,"You may recall that during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, pro-abortion groups were extremely vocal about believing all women and standing with victims of alleged sexual abuse. They generated graphics, disseminated them on social media, and encouraged their members and donors to call their representatives to express their support for Christine Blasey Ford and even the far less credible accusers like Julie Swetnick.

You may have also noticed that those same groups have been, shall we say, strangely silent about Tara Reade, the former Joe Biden staffer who has accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993.

Perhaps that's because the pro-Democrat media has almost completely ignored the allegations, and groups like Emily's List feel safe ignoring them and refusing comment from right-leaning outlets.

Well, at least one left-leaning outlet, the Daily Beast, felt it was worthwhile to reach out to comment to these groups, and what they found was, well, not very surprising.

After contacting 10 different groups, including Emily's List, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the National Organization for Women, the Daily Beast was not able to get a statement or comment from a single one of these groups.

According to the Daily Beast, some of the organizations simply didn't answer their ""detailed request for comment."" Other organizations ""replied and did not provide a statement,"" indicating that they clearly saw the request for comment and just didn't want to give one.

To its credit, the Daily Beast illustrated the ludicrous lengths some of the groups went to in order to avoid giving comment: ""One prominent women's political group cited a scheduling conflict and asked to be kept 'in mind for other opportunities!' When pressed if the following day would work better, an associate said it would not, citing another scheduling conflict.""

Of course, some users on Twitter were quick to point out that these exact same organizations were decidedly less reticent when Brett Kavanaugh was accused, on substantially flimsier evidence, of misconduct dating back to his high school days.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/president-trump-nobel-peace-prize,2020-04-29
"Pro-Palestinian man yells, 'Stick the Holocaust up your ass!' amid pro-Israel activities in Vienna. The anti-Semitic outburst draws cheers and applause.","In yet another chilling moment of recent broad daylight anti-Semitism, cellphone video caught the moment a pro-Palestinian counter-demonstrator in Vienna, Austria, cupped his hands around his mouth and hollered at pro-Israel activists, ""Stick the Holocaust up your ass!""

More disturbing still was the loud cheering and applause that followed the man's outburst:

What are the details?

A Google translation of a story from the Heute news outlet indicated that opposing factions filled the streets of Vienna all day Saturday, and numerous videos showed a massive police presence.



The outlet said around 5 p.m. a rally ""Against all anti-Semitism"" took place near an opera house, and it quickly attracted a counterprotest ""consisting of Turkish nationalists, young people, and advocates of Palestine.""

Heute said the counterprotest was ""obviously intended to disrupt the pro-Israel demonstration,"" and it also reported the ""grossly anti-Semitic slogan"" recorded in the above video along with the ""raging applause and cheers"" that followed.

A subsequent tweet from Vienna police said they forwarded video to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and that ""presumably this person was stopped a short time later...""

Anything else?

Violent anti-Semitism flared up in several major cities across the globe over the weekend, including beatings in Toronto and chants in London that included, ""F*** the Jews! F*** their daughters! F*** their mothers! Rape their daughters! We have to send a message!""

And while the man's anti-Semitic outburst in Vienna didn't include violence, the huge kudos he received from other counterprotesters seemed equally as chilling due to the lack of pushback and apparent matter-of-fact consensus among the crowd.

According to German news site DW, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called off a Saturday visit to Austria after Israeli flags were raised on government buildings in Vienna.

A spokeswoman for Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said ""we will not remain silent while Hamas fires 2,000 rockets at civilian targets in Israel,"" the news site reported.

DW added that Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said flying the flag over the federal chancellery on Friday was in solidarity with Israel amid clashes with Hamas.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/prince-harry-rips-1st-amendment-as-bonkers-and-more-than-a-few-americans-get-plenty-annoyed-show-some-utter-respect,2021-05-18
Pro-Trump groups plan weekend #StopTheSteal MAGA march in D.C.,"An assortment of pro-Trump groups will rally Saturday in Washington, D.C., to protest perceived election fraud and support President Donald Trump, who has not yet conceded the presidential election to former Vice President Joe Biden.

Various groups, including the Million MAGA March, Women for Trump, and Stop the Steal DC have invited all Trump supporters to participate in an organized protest at noon Saturday at Freedom Plaza, near the White House and along the National Mall, multiple outlets reported.



According to WDVM-TV, counterprotests are planned at Black Lives Matter Plaza. The Metropolitan Police Department released plans for no parking zones in and around the downtown area to accommodate the protests.

""Our Police Chief will have a similar posture this weekend as he did last week, and we will be there to support peaceful exercise of First Amendment demonstrations,"" D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a news conference.

D.C. police reportedly advised those who plan to attend the protests that the capital's notoriously strict gun laws will be enforced.

WTOP national security correspondent J.J. Green reported that while the planned protests are gaining attention and interaction on social media, some followers are skeptical of the wisdom of traveling to Washington.

""There are not a lot of people biting on this; there are a lot of people following them on social media. But there are a lot of people that are doubtful about the wisdom of coming here to do this,"" Green said.

The protests are already being characterized as ""white nationalist"" by mainstream media outlets. Politico reported that ""Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, Infowars fanatics, Groypers, Proud Boys, white nationalists, neo-Nazis and the people who would simply call themselves die-hard MAGA"" plan to attend.

WTOP's report noted that federal, state, and local law enforcement organizations are monitoring the groups planning to attend the protest. Green reported that it is ""not likely"" that a repeat of the 2017 clash between white nationalists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, will happen again.

""In part because authorities here are so well-prepared and have that knowledge under their belt. And … you can't carry guns in D.C. … I'm pretty sure that any organizers are making it very clear to people who come to D.C., 'Do not bring a gun.' Other weapons maybe, but it's not likely that this is going to turn into that,"" Green said.

The Twitter account for Million Mega March posted a public prayer asking God to let the march happen peacefully, ""without conflict from those who wish to agitate and cause violence.""

Prosecutors want 'QAnon Shaman' Jacob Chansley sentenced to more than 4 years in prison,"Federal prosecutors want Arizona resident Jacob Chansley, the ""QAnon Shaman"" who wore horns and paraded shirtless through the halls of the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, to spend more than four years in prison for his role in the riot.

In a 28-page sentencing memo filed Tuesday, prosecutors requested that Chansley be sentenced to 51 months in prison — the longest term allowed by guidelines — plus three years of supervised release and $2,000 in restitution fees, KTAR-FM reported.

The filing referred to Chansley as ""the public face of the Capitol riot,"" and indeed images of his distinctive horns and face paint were ubiquitous in news reports on the events of Jan. 6.

""The defendant was among the first 30 rioters to penetrate the U.S. Capitol building,"" prosecutors said. ""The defendant then stalked the hallowed halls of the building, riling up other members of the mob with his screaming obscenities about our nation's lawmakers, and flouting the 'opportunity' to rid our government of those he has long considered to be traitors.""



The defense filed a 23-page memo asking for a sentence of time served. U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves argued, however, that a longer sentence is needed to serve as a deterrent to other would-be rioters.



""The government submits that such a sentence would be an appropriate one, which would serve to protect the community, punish the defendant for his criminal conduct, and deter others from committing similar offenses,"" the prosecution wrote.



Defense attorney Albert Watkins challenged this argument, writing there is little evidence that harsher prison sentences serve as a general deterrent to crime and that the defendant's prison time spent in solitary confinement because of COVID-19 protocols should be a consideration in favor of leniency.

Watkins also wrote that his client experienced a difficult childhood and has ""mental health vulnerabilities"" that should be considered. He compared Chansley to Forrest Gump, a slow-witted fictional character from the eponymous movie who witnessed and influenced major historical events.

Watkins wrote Chansley's ""gait and apparent Forest Gump-like obliviousness to much of the activity and many of the actions of those surrounding him"" pointed toward his mental health issues.

""He was not an organizer. He was not a planner. He was not violent. He was not destructive. He was not a thief,"" the defense argued.

""Defendant respectfully requests that the Court impose a sentence significantly below the range of sentencing recommended under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, recognizing the harshness of the conditions surrounding time served to date, and impose such sentence as permits Mr. Chansley to proceed hence with his pursuit of his mental and physical health prioritized,"" the defense memo states.

Before the Jan. 6 riot, Chansley attended several Arizona rallies for then-President Donald Trump, as well as protests in Phoenix, dressed in his distinctive costume. He is a longtime promoter of the QAnon conspiracy theory and one of many who questioned the integrity of the 2020 presidential election.

During the riot, he yelled into a bullhorn as police officers came into conflict with the mob, posed for photos in the Capitol building, and called then-Vice President Mike Pence a traitor for refusing to reject the Electoral College results submitted to Congress. He wrote a note to Pence saying, ""It's only a matter of time, justice is coming.""

Chansley was one of more than 650 people who have been charged with federal crimes related to the events of Jan. 6, including more than 100 individuals accused of assaulting police officers.

He pleaded guilty on Sept. 3 to obstructing an official proceeding, a felony charge.

Chansley's sentencing hearing is on Nov. 17.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pro-palestinian-punk-holocaust-vienna,2021-11-10
Left-wing protester — who's a convicted felon — arrested after pointing gun at Louisville motorist,"Sometimes those peaceful, gun-shunning leftists can surprise you.

Seems one of them who took part in a Louisville protest march Friday evening pointed a gun at a motorist — and to top it off, the arrestee is a convicted felon, WDRB-TV reported.

What are the details?

Louisville Metro Police on Saturday released video taken from a police helicopter that was circling over the march, and it shows a woman — identified as Robin Ash — pointing a gun at the driver of a dark gray Ford Taurus, the station said.

Ash is facing charges of wanton endangerment, possession of a handgun by a convicted felon, and criminal mischief, WDRB reported, citing court records.

But others at the scene defended Ash, saying the driver pointed a gun at demonstrators first, the station said.

In the police video, which contains no sound, the car in question is traveling in the opposite direction from the march — and one protester appears to be standing in the left-hand turn lane the car enters.

The car comes to a stop after passing the protester, and that's when the trouble starts.

Several protesters approach the car, including a woman who pulls out a gun and points it at the motorist.

After another protester appears to intervene, the woman who pointed the gun walks away from the scene and seems to place something in her pocket or waistband.

Image source: Facebook video screenshot via Louisville Metro Police Department

Others remained near the car and WDRB said one person appears to kick the vehicle while other protesters try to get the crowd away. The police video shows the car drive a short distance down the street before it comes to a stop, and the station said the driver exits the car as police gather around the vehicle and protesters continue to move forward.

Another video, another story

Sheri Wright took her own video of the march and posted a clip of the incident involving the car on her Facebook page, WDRB said — and at a Sunday news conference at the Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, she said the motorist ""tried to run over protesters.""

Wright's video shows the Ford Taurus drive closely past at least two people marching in the street before coming to a stop, the station said.

More from WDRB:

As Wright approaches the car, video shows the man behind the wheel pulling out a gun and pointing it at the demonstrators near his car. Ash is not seen approaching the car in Wright's video, which is focused on the driver's window.



Wright follows the car as it moves a few feet down the road, and her video shows the man get out of the car and again point a gun at protesters as he inspects a dent in his vehicle. The man then gestures in the direction of police, who are seen moments later moving the crowd away from the vehicle.

Image source: Facebook video screenshot via Sheri Wright

Here's Wright's video. (Content warning: Language):

""What do you do when somebody threatens you with a gun? You know, you run or you defend — fight or flight,"" Wright said, according to the station. ""So I'm not going to knock anyone who felt her life was threatened, because I certainly felt my life was threatened, as did everyone there.""

She added to WDRB that police ""surrounded themselves around this man and his vehicle in a protective fashion.""

""It seems very one-sided as far as where LMPD interjects itself into a conflict,"" Wright also noted to the station. ""From my observation, they want to protect the people who are opposed to the protesters against police brutality. I've seen this over and over and over again.""

What did police have to say?

Sgt. Lamont Washington said in a statement that the motorist wasn't arrested because he was a victim in the incident, WDRB said.

""LMPD released the video to show the whole story,"" Washington added to the station. ""A still photo or single angle often doesn't do that. No charges are expected of the driver whose name will not be released since he was the victim.""

"Protester shot by police, another man set on fire in altercation during ongoing Hong Kong demonstrations","A Hong Kong police officer shot a protester in the street during a demonstration Monday, marking another dangerous episode in the monthslong clashes between pro-democracy demonstrators and authorities in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, according to the Associated Press.

The person who was shot was initially in critical condition, but stabilized after surgery, according to hospital officials.

Hong Kong police shoot protester in the street youtu.be

Another person was set on fire in an altercation, but it is unclear who the involved participants were or how the conflict escalated. According to AP, the victim was arguing with a group of young people when someone poured an unknown liquid on him and struck a lighter. That victim is in critical condition.



What is this all about?

Violent protests have been steadily taking place since June in opposition to a since-dropped measure that would have given Beijing some extradition authority in Hong Kong. Protesters felt Beijing was attempting to infringe on Hong Kong's autonomy.



Although that measure was dropped, protesters still have other demands, including the resignation of Hong Kong CEO Carrie Lam, the release of arrested protesters, a police brutality inquiry, and an expansion of democratic rights.

What does Lam say about all this?

Lam is not backing down and has no intention of resigning.

On Monday, she reaffirmed her determination to end the violence and condemned the actions of protesters.

""I do not want to go into details, but I just want to make it very clear that we will spare no effort in finding ways and means that could end the violence in Hong Kong as soon as possible,"" Lam said. ""If there is still any wishful thinking that, by escalating violence, the Hong Kong SAR government will yield to pressure to satisfy the so-called political demands, I am making this statement clear and loud here: That will not happen. These rioters' actions have far exceeded their demands, and they are enemies of the people.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/prosecutors-want-qanon-shaman-jacob-chansley-sentenced-to-more-than-4-years-in-prison,2019-11-12
Proxy voting ended: McCarthy requires Congress to 'show up to work if they want their vote to count',"House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) announced on Thursday that members of Congress are no longer allowed to cast proxy votes and must instead vote in person.



The practice of voting by proxy was established by former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in May 2020 to allow lawmakers to observe recommended COVID protocol. Pelosi then extended the policy several times.

The policy allowed lawmakers to avoid in-person voting and instead cast their decision by letter, where another member of Congress announced the vote on their behalf.

On Thursday, McCarthy shared on Twitter, ""No more proxy voting. Effective immediately, Members of Congress have to show up to work if they want their vote to count.""

While members from both sides of the aisle have taken advantage of the proxy voting policy, some Republicans have argued that it could lead to lawmakers neglecting their duties.

In 2020, McCarthy filed a lawsuit against former Speaker Pelosi challenging the proxy voting policy, which the Supreme Court ultimately appealed. Despite 160 Republicans signing the lawsuit, by December 2021, 80% of all House members had voted by proxy, according to a Brookings Institute study.

While the policy was initially implemented for health reasons, House members used the ""public health emergency"" policy to attend other events and functions that conflicted with their schedule, Fox News Digital reported.

When voting on the $1.7 trillion omnibus in December, fewer than 50% of lawmakers cast their vote in-person — 134 Democrats and 92 Republicans voted by proxy.

At the time, Representative Chip Roy (R-Texas) stated, ""I would note that this $1.7 trillion legislation is moving off the floor without a physical quorum present.""

""There were 218 votes cast by proxy on the rule and 226 votes cast by proxy on the final passage,"" he added.

In December, McCarthy promised to end the policy once Republicans took control of the House in the new year.

""The Senate has managed to maintain in-person Floor voting for the entirety of the past two years — with a much older population and a 50-50 makeup, no less,"" McCarthy stated. ""From the get-go, we warned that proxy voting would be misused as a means of convenience rather than as a precaution for health — and it has been, by members of both parties.""

Psaki says Biden admin 'welcomes stiff competition' over news that China tested nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki oddly said the Biden administration ""welcomes stiff competition"" when asked Monday about China testing hypersonic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.

What is the background?

The Financial Times reported Saturday that U.S. intelligence officials were completely in the dark on the test, which took place in August.

China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile in August that circled the globe before speeding towards its target, demonstrating an advanced space capability that caught US intelligence by surprise. Five people familiar with the test said the Chinese military launched a rocket that carried a hypersonic glide vehicle which flew through low-orbit space before cruising down towards its target.



The missile missed its target by about two-dozen miles, according to three people briefed on the intelligence. But two said the test showed that China had made astounding progress on hypersonic weapons and was far more advanced than US officials realised.

""We have no idea how they did this,"" one official told Financial Times.

What did Psaki say?



When Psaki was asked about China's hypersonic missiles, she revealed the position of the Biden administration is: ""We welcome stiff competition.""

""We've made clear our concerns about the military capabilities that the PRC continues to pursue,"" Psaki explained. ""And we have been consistent in our approach with China: We welcome stiff competition, but we do not want that competition to veer into conflict.""

""And that is certainly what we convey privately as well,"" she added.

Republican lawmakers were quick to rebuke Psaki's remark.

""You welcome the competition? You don't say that. You tell China, 'Stand down or you will regret this,'"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) reacted on Fox News.

""And did [Biden] say 'Stand down'? No. He says, 'We welcome competition.' No, we do not welcome the Chinese Communist Party with a hypersonic missile that can hit the American homeland and neutralize all of our defenses,"" Graham added. ""I don't welcome that.""

Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas) reacted to Psaki's remarks by saying, ""Let me be clear: testing weapons such as these is a direct threat to us and our allies.""

Anything else?

Psaki's perplexing comment underscores what former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired over the weekend.

Gates explained that former President Donald Trump correctly assessed the threat China poses to America, saying Trump ""basically awakened Americans.""

""I think this is a place where President Trump got it right. He basically awakened Americans — and I would say especially the business community — to a China that the assumptions about which we had gotten wrong,"" Gates admitted.

""The assumption for 40 years was that a richer China would be a freer China — and that's clearly not going to happen,"" Gates explained.

On the other hand, Gates reaffirmed a comment he made about President Joe Biden in 2014 in which he said Biden has been ""wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/protester-shot-by-police-another-man-set-on-fire-in-hong-kong,2021-10-19
Putin doesn't want to host 'premature' diplomatic summit with Biden,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has opted not to have an in-person meeting with President Joe Biden, the New York Post reported.

Russian leadership believes that it is too early for the two countries to hold a summit to discuss the ongoing Ukraine crisis.

Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, said, “It’s premature to talk about any specific plans for organizing any kind of summits.”

He added, “There is an understanding that dialogue should be continued at the level of foreign ministers” and that there are “no concrete plans in place” for the two presidents to attend a summit together.

Peskov said that the two men can continue to discuss diplomacy over the phone or through other means but that an in-person meeting currently isn’t in the cards.

He said, “If necessary, of course, the Russian and American presidents can decide to hold a telephone call or connect via other methods. A meeting is possible if the heads of state consider it appropriate.”

On Sunday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that President Biden had “accepted in principle” a meeting with his Russian counterpart.

She added that “We are always ready for diplomacy. We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war.”

U.S. officials previously suggested that a presidential summit would follow an upcoming meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov.

The idea of a presidential summit has been championed by French officials and cautiously encouraged by the Ukrainian government as a way to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine and avoid armed conflict.

Dmytro Kuleba, a Ukrainian foreign minister, said “We believe every effort aimed at a diplomatic solution is worth trying. We hope that the two presidents will walk out from the room with an agreement about Russia withdrawing its forces from Ukraine.”

On Friday, Biden said he was “convinced” that Russian leadership had decided to invade Ukraine.

Despite the imminent threat their country is facing, Ukrainian leadership hope to avoid armed conflict by bringing Putin to the table.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, said “I don’t know what the Russian Federation wants, so I am proposing a meeting” and “Ukraine will continue to follow only the diplomatic path for the sake of a peaceful settlement.”

On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris attended the Munich Security Conference along with a dozen other leaders from Western nations.

"Putin recognizes independence of Ukrainian rebel regions, moving toward war","Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday announced in a televised address that Russia will recognize the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine — defying Western governments and further escalating a situation that could erupt into war.

""I deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago - to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic,"" Putin said, referring to areas where fighting has broken out between pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian government forces.

Western officials have warned that Russia may use conflict in these regions as a pretext to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The announcement comes after Putin informed Germany and France of his decision, which was received with ""disappointment,"" the Kremlin said Monday according to Reuters. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Putin's decision to recognize the two separatist regions in Ukraine was ""plainly in breach of international law.""

""It is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine,” Johnson added, according to the Guardian.

In a rambling, at times angry speech, Putin lamented the fall of the Soviet Union, twisted history, and essentially denied Ukraine's right to exist as a sovereign state.

""Modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia, more precisely, Bolshevik, communist Russia,"" Putin inaccurately claimed, asserting that the country ""never had a tradition of genuine statehood.""

Putin characterized the current government of Ukraine as a corrupt oligarchy and accused western governments of supporting a violent coup d'état against the old pro-Russian government in 2014. He leveled numerous accusations against the Ukrainian government, claiming there is a ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people taking place in Donetsk and Lugansk and that Ukraine is attempting to develop nuclear weapons that pose a threat to Russian national security. He further claimed that Russia has ancient connections to territory in eastern Ukraine and that the Russian-speaking people there support independence

The Russian president also alleged that attempts by Ukraine to join NATO pose a threat to Russian national security, and that the United States' threat of sanctions in response to an invasion of Ukraine were policies designed to ""limit the development of Russia.""



""Russia has the duty to take all necessary measures to protect our security, which is what we'll do,"" said Putin.

As Putin delivered that ominous message, an estimated 150,000 Russian troops have amassed on three sides of Ukraine's eastern border. President Joe Biden on Friday said he is ""convinced"" that Russia has already decided to invade, including an assault on Ukraine's capital Kyiv.



By recognizing two independent states in eastern Ukraine, Russia has created an excuse to deploy troops there. The separatists do not hold all of the territory they claim. Should they request assistance from the Russian military, Putin will claim an invasion is an intervention to protect independent Russian allies from Ukraine's alleged tyranny. Analysts expect Russia to send ""peacekeeper"" forces into the area, Axios reported.

Though Russia has repeatedly denied having a desire to invade, it has claimed Ukraine is preparing for a major military offensive in the east, which U.S. and Ukrainian officials say is not true. Russia claimed on Monday that it killed five Ukrainian troops crossing the border, which Ukraine denied and which the U.S. said was one of several ""transparent, hackneyed plots to justify an invasion.""

Following Putin's speech, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called on the United Nations security council to ""discuss urgent actions aimed at de-escalation, as well as practical steps to guarantee the security of Ukraine.""

Putin reportedly discloses conditions for ceasefire in call with Turkish president,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly revealed in full the conditions that would need to be met for a ceasefire to be ordered in Ukraine.

The Russian president is said to have disclosed the list of six priorities during a Thursday phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, BBC News reported.

The demands come approximately three weeks after the launch of Putin's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, an unprovoked land invasion that drew swift condemnation and harsh economic retaliation from the entire Western world.

According to BBC News, the demands fall into two categories. The first category, which includes four demands, was reportedly presented as less difficult. Chief among the four is a commitment from Ukraine to remain neutral and not join NATO, something that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has already signaled an openness to.

In addition to a pledge of neutrality, Ukraine would then have to undergo a disarmament process to ensure it isn't a threat to Russia. Of course, any disarmament would leave Ukraine open to future attacks from Russia.

Next, there would have to be protections for the Russian language in Ukraine, and the country would have to undergo what Putin has called ""de-Nazification.""

The demands were passed along to the news agency by Erdogan's leading adviser and spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin.

The second category of demands, according to the BBC, is considered more difficult to satisfy. The outlet said Kalin was less specific on these points but noted they involved the status of Ukrainian territories in the eastern Donbas region.

It is ""assumed"" that Putin will require Ukraine to give up territory in the supposedly Russian-sympathetic region as well as formally recognize that Crimea, an area illegally annexed by Putin in 2014, is part of Russia.

BBC noted that Russia has no legal right to Crimea and even signed an international treaty after the fall of the USSR accepting that Crimea was part of Ukraine.

Putin's alleged demands appeared to fall in line with previous reporting on the matter.

Fox News reported that Putin's list of demands comes as more and more reports continue to surface indicating that morale among Russian forces is waning. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. has indeed observed Russian forces stalling out in their advance but was careful to note that low morale was observed anecdotally and may not be indicative of the whole of the Russian military.

However, there continue to be concerns that Putin's negotiating is nothing more than a head fake to distract Ukraine as Russian forces continue to move on the capital.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/putin-doesn-t-want-to-host-premature-diplomatic-summit-with-biden,2022-03-18
Putin suspended as 'honorary president' of the International Judo Federation,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has been suspended as the honorary president of the International Judo Federation.

On Sunday, the IJF released a statement saying that it was suspending Putin from his position as the “Honorary President and Ambassador of the International Judo Federation,” Reuters reported.

The IJF’s statement said, “In light of the ongoing war conflict in Ukraine, the International Judo Federation announces the suspension of Mr. Vladimir Putin’s status as Honorary President and Ambassador of the International Judo Federation.”

Putin, who is 69 years old, holds a black belt in judo and has even co-authored a book titled “Judo: History, Theory, Practice” and has previously trained alongside the Russian Olympic judo team.

Black belt Putin shows off judo moves with Olympic athletes www.youtube.com

He also holds the rank of grandmaster in taekwondo. He was granted this title in 2013 by the president of the World Taekwondo Federation.



Putin being stripped of this honorary title is just the latest, and the most benign, of the measures taken against him in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On Saturday, leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States released a joint statement that said the Western allies were committed to “ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed form the SWIFT messaging system.”

By removing Russian banks from the SWIFT network, the Western leaders committed to restricting Russia’s ability to manipulate its currency to reduce the immediate fiscal impact of Western sanctions and specifically targeting Russian officials and oligarchs who encouraged military aggression with sanctions.

Restricting Russian access to the SWIFT network will greatly damage the Russian economy and make engaging in international commerce extremely difficult. This move will isolate Russia and stands to prevent it from exporting natural gas and fossil fuels.

The British Petroleum Company plans to divest from state-owned energy firms in Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, despite having done business with them for more than three decades.

BP Chairman Helge Lund said, “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region. BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues. However, this military action represents a fundamental change.”

On Sunday, the leadership of the European Union announced that it would be closing Europe’s airspace to all aircraft of Russian origin.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, “We are shutting down the EU airspace for Russians. We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered, or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off, or overfly the territory of the EU.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/putin-recognizes-independence-of-ukrainian-rebel-regions-moving-toward-war,2022-02-28
"poll, 70, troops should get involved, if Russia invades NATO","A Quinnipiac University poll of adults in the U.S. found that 70% believe U.S. troops should get involved if Russia mounts an invasion against a NATO nation, while 21% do not think U.S. soldiers should get involved if such a scenario unfolds.

The eyes of the world are on Ukraine as the people of that country bravely fight to defend their sovereign nation against a Russian invasion. The survey, which was conducted from Feb. 25 to 27, found that 63% are concerned that Russia might utilize nuclear weapons if NATO attempts to intervene, while 32% are not concerned.

The poll found that 66% believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to invade additional countries, while 20% do not think he intends to invade elsewhere.

President Joe Biden has said that American forces will not get involved in the Russia-Ukraine war, though he also declared that America will defend NATO territory.

Biden, who is underwater in various job approval polls, is slated to deliver a State of the Union address on Tuesday.

The recent Quinnipiac poll found that 52% disapprove of how Biden is handling in his role, while just 37% approve. The poll found that 43% disapprove strongly, 8% somewhat disapprove, 19% somewhat approve, and 19% strongly approve.

According to the poll, 49% of U.S. adults consider Putin to be mentally unstable, while 31% believe the man is stable. A whopping 81% hold an unfavorable view of Putin, while just 4% indicated having a favorable view of the Russian figure.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/putin-reportedly-discloses-conditions-for-ceasefire-in-call-with-turkish-president,2022-02-28
Rand Paul and Dr. Fauci accuse each other of 'lying' in explosive confrontation over NIH funding for Wuhan lab,"Dr. Anthony Fauci and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) each accused the other of ""lying"" in a heated back-and-forth exchange about the National Institute of Health's role in funding the coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.

During a Senate Health Committee hearing on the federal government's COVID-19 response, Paul challenged Fauci over comments he made at a previous Senate hearing denying that the NIH funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab.

""Dr. Fauci, as you are aware it is a crime to lie to Congress,"" Paul began when it was his turn to ask questions. ""On your last trip to our committee on May 11, you stated that the NIH 'has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.' And yet, gain-of-function research was done entirely in the Wuhan Institute by Dr. Shi and was funded by the NIH.""



Paul cited as proof of his claims a 2015 study conducted by Dr. Ralph Baric, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, in collaboration with Dr. Shi Zhengli, the chief coronavirus researcher at the Wuhan lab. He said the study, which the authors acknowledged was funded by NIH, used gain-of-function experiments to make a coronavirus sample taken from bats — an entirely different virus from SARS-Cov-2 — transmissible among humans.

Gain-of-function research involves genetically enhancing viral pathogens in order to predict which may become especially dangerous to the human population. The research is controversial because of the risk that a virus previously only found in animals and subsequently altered to infect humans could be released — accidentally or deliberately — and cause a pandemic.

Between 2014 and 2017, the federal government established a moratorium on funding for gain-of-function research, but the study Baric and Shi co-authored received approval from NIH after review. The funding received by the Wuhan lab to conduct this research was provided by the nonprofit group EcoHealth Alliance, which had received grants from the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), led by none other than Dr. Fauci.

""Viruses that in nature only infect animals were manipulated in the Wuhan lab to gain the function of infecting humans. This research fits the definition of the research that the NIH said was subject to the pause in 2014-2017, a pause in funding on gain-of-function. But the NIH failed to recognize this,"" Paul said.



The NIAID director was previously aware of the study Paul cited. On Feb. 1, 2020, Fauci sent an email with the study attached to NIAID Principal Deputy Director Hugh Auchincloss amid internal discussions at NIH about the possible origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""It is essential that we speak this AM. Keep your cell phone on ... read this paper as well as the e-mail that I will forward to you now. You will have tasks today that must be done,"" Fauci wrote to Auchincloss. The email communications were made public as part of a Freedom of Information Act request from BuzzFeed News.

Paul asked if Fauci would like to retract his comments from the May 11 hearing in light of the fact that it appears Fauci authorized sub-grants that were given to EcoHealth Alliance and then transferred to the Wuhan lab for the research published in the 2015 paper, of which he was aware when he testified to Congress.



""Sen. Paul, I have never lied before the Congress, and I do not retract that statement. This paper, that you're referring to, was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function,"" Fauci replied.



Interrupting, Paul challenged Fauci's definition of gain-of-function research, which made Fauci visibly angry.

""Sen. Paul, you do not know what you are talking about, quite frankly, and I want to say that officially,"" he scolded. ""You do not know what you are talking about.""

Paul interjected again, quoting from a definition of gain-of-function research authored by the NIH and demanding that Fauci explain how the NIH-funded experiments conducted at the Wuhan lab did not meet that definition.

""How can you say that's not gain-of-function?"" he asked.

""It is not,"" Fauci insisted, without elaborating.

""It's a dance and you're dancing around this because you're trying to obscure responsibility for 4 million people dying around the world from a pandemic,"" Paul continued, cutting Fauci off.

Fauci raised his hand in objection to Paul's assertion. ""If the point that you are making is that the grant that was funded as a sub-award from EcoHealth to Wuhan created SARS-CoV-2 — that's where you are getting, let me finish,"" Fauci said as Paul interrupted again.

""We don't know,"" the senator said, acknowledging that the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remain unknown. ""But all the evidence is pointing that it came from the lab and there will be responsibility for those that funded the lab, including yourself,"" Paul told Fauci.

""I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating, senator,"" Fauci snarled in response.

He said it was ""molecularly impossible"" for the viruses examined in the 2015 Wuhan study to be related to SARS-CoV-2 or to have caused the COVID-19 pandemic, appearing to misinterpret Paul's allegations. Paul countered that he wasn't alleging anything of the sort.

""What we're alleging is that gain-of-function research was going on in that lab and NIH funded it. You can't get away from it, it meets your definition, and you are obfuscating the truth,"" Paul charged.

""I am not obfuscating the truth, you're the one,"" replied Fauci. He accused Paul of implying that the NIH grants he authorized were responsible for deaths caused by the pandemic.

""I totally resent that, and if anybody is lying here, senator, it is you,"" Fauci finished.

Scientists are in disagreement over the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many of the world's top scientific experts believe the SARS-CoV-2 virus occurred in nature and evolved to be transmissible among humans, there are others who hypothesize the virus was either obtained and stored in the Wuhan lab or artificially engineered as part of a gain-of-function experiment and subsequently leaked.

The lab-leak hypothesis is growing in mainstream acceptance as scientists have so far failed to find an animal host for SARS-CoV-2, though evidence is far from conclusive for either hypothesis.

Whether the U.S. government funded research at the Wuhan lab that led to the outbreak of the pandemic remains unknown. Fauci's angry denials and his clash with Paul over the technical definition of gain-of-function research did not contribute to answering that question.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/putin-suspended-as-honorary-president-of-the-international-judo-federation,2021-07-20
Rand Paul to Glenn Beck: Media needs to ask tough questions of Dr. Fauci on gain-of-function lies,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) criticized the mainstream media for failing to ask tough questions of Dr. Anthony Fauci days after the two men accused each other of lying during a confrontational exchange at a Senate hearing.

""No one's forced him to explain himself. He hurls ad hominem insults, but he doesn't really explain,"" Paul said of Fauci during an interview Thursday with BlazeTV host Glenn Beck. ""People need to realize that he's not a disinterested party. He has a conflict of interest. His interest is not being associated with gain-of-function any longer, not being associated with Wuhan lab. And most particularly, he doesn't want to attach to himself any responsibility to the pandemic.""

On Tuesday, Paul challenged Fauci, who is the director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, a sub-agency of the National Institute of Health, on whether the NIH funded risky coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The research, known as gain-of-function, involves manipulating viruses to artificially make them more transmissible among humans in an attempt to study how viruses might evolve in nature and predict and prevent future pandemics.

A nonprofit organization called EcoHealth Alliance provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in NIH grants approved by Fauci for the coronavirus research at the Wuhan lab. Paul contended that a 2015 paper published by Dr. Ralph Baric, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, in collaboration with Dr. Shi Zhengli, the chief coronavirus researcher at the Wuhan lab, demonstrates that gain-of-function research was performed at the lab.

But Fauci denied that the research is gain-of-function and claimed experts at NIH reviewed Baric and Shi's work and determined it did not meet the definition of gain-of-function research. When Paul insisted that Fauci's claims didn't make sense, Fauci accused him of not knowing what he was talking about.

Whether gain-of-function research was conducted at the Wuhan lab is relevant to discovering the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are two competing theories on where the COVID-19 pandemic began, the first and more widely accepted one being that the virus came from an animal and naturally evolved to be transmissible among humans.



The second hypothesis, one Fauci and other prominent public health officials have worked to discredit, is that the virus was artificially created through gain-of-function research in the Wuhan lab and somehow leaked.

Paul asserts that if Fauci previously approved NIH funding for such research at the Wuhan lab, he would have a conflict of interest because if it's true the pandemic started there, he and others involved would ultimately be responsible for that dangerous research.

""We're saying one very simple precise thing: That the NIH, with Dr. Fauci's approval, funded the lab in Wuhan, and the lab was doing dangerous gain-of-function research,"" Paul told Beck.

When Paul said as much during Tuesday's Senate hearing, accusing Fauci of previously lying to Congress about funding for gain-of-function research in Wuhan, the NIAID director became incensed and accused the senator of propagating a lie. On Wednesday, during an interview with MSNBC, Fauci further said that Paul had ""made some inflammatory and, I believe, slanderous remarks about lying under oath.""

Many journalists and news reports on the testy back-and-forth appear to be taking Fauci's side over Paul's. Beck pointed out, for example, that CNN's Jake Tapper said, ""I'm not even going to get into the details of what Senator Paul was attacking there"" while discussing ""the constant MAGA media and Republican lawmaker attacks on health experts, especially Dr. Anthony Fauci.""

Paul criticized CNN for neglecting to ask questions he says American taxpayers deserve the answers to.

""Four million people died. CNN has been trying to make money off this pandemic for two years. Yet, they didn't want to go to the heart of the matter. Did it start in a lab? And did it start from gain-of-function research? Is it dangerous research? Should we continue doing this research?"" Paul said, adding that these questions and other concerns about taxpayer funding for dangerous virus research shouldn't be partisan issues.



He observed that Fauci argued in a 2012 paper that the benefits of gain-of-function research were worth the risks of a lab accident that could potentially cause a pandemic.

""These are judgment calls that should preclude him from being in any position of judgment,"" Paul said. ""Gain-of-function research is not worth 4 million lives.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/quinnipiac-poll-us-nato-russia-invade,2021-07-22
"Hedge fund billionaire warns there's a 30% chance US will be engaged in 'war' in the next 5 years due to political, economic 'vulnerability'","Renowned hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio — who famously predicted the 2008 financial crisis — is sharing alarming concerns once again about the state of play in the United States. But this time, he says, America is not only in danger of economic hardship, but war.

What did he say?

""No empire lasts forever,” he told Forbes during a recent interview. “Right now, money and credit and how it’s behaving are affecting the financial markets, it’s affecting inflation.""

The news outlet and the investor were discussing his latest book, ""The Changing World Order: How and Why Nations Succeed and Fail,"" out Nov. 30, when the conversation turned grim. Dalio began warning that the confluence of America's rising debt and income disparity alongside China's meteoric rise on the world state may soon put the U.S. in great peril.

“The last time those three things happened was in the 1930 to 1945 period,” Dalio explained. “When they happen together, it’s a very telling story.”

""Dalio believes there’s a 30% chance that the U.S. will enter into a major 'civil-war-type' conflict within the next five years,"" Forbes reported.

The outlet noted that while other countries are facing similar challenges, America appears ""especially vulnerable.""

“It’s very important that we deal with this now,” Dalio remarked. “We can have a type of civil war or international war based on how we are behaving with each other and our financial conditions.”

What else?

Dalio, the founder of the world's largest hedge fund, reportedly drew the inferences from his newly-developed ""health index,"" which is featured in his new book. The system ""rates around a dozen nations on 18 different factors ranging from debt burdens and economic output to military strength and innovation.""

Though the 18 factors provided a more complete picture, Dalio appears to focus in on the three elements mentioned above when making the dire prediction.

Forbes said Dalio also highlighted the U.S.'s ""increased conflict and polarization due to widening wealth gaps.""



Anything else?

The news comes as the U.S. continues to experience the effects of soaring inflation under the Biden administration. In October, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the year-over-year rise in the consumer price index had reached its highest level in over 30 years.

In the meantime, the country battles a supply chain crisis and labor shortages. The economic downturn is one reason a majority of Americans believe the U.S. is heading in the wrong direction.

Bernie Sanders' campaign is battling its own unionized workers who are demanding the $15 minimum wage he wants to impose on the country,"The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is in a labor fight with its own union workers, who are demanding the $15 minimum hourly wage their boss is fighting to impose on every American employer.

What are the details?

Bernie 2020 made history earlier this year, when it became the first presidential campaign whose workers are represented by a union. According to The Washington Post, the employees did not waste any time in utilizing their collective bargaining rights.

The Post obtained emails and other documents showing the conflict over pay has been going on since May, the same month campaign workers ratified a contract to be represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 400.

In a draft letter set to be sent to campaign manager Faiz Shakir as early as this week, the union argues that field organizers ""cannot be expected to build the largest grassroots organizing program in American history while making poverty wages.

""Given our campaign's commitment to fighting for a living wage of at least $15.00 an hour, we believe it is only fair that the campaign would carry through this commitment to it own field team.""

The letter explains that salaried field workers making salaries of $36,000 annually are working at least 60 hours per week, making their average pay less than $13 an hour. Union representatives go on to say, ""many field staffers are barely managing to survive financially, which is severely impacting our team's productivity and morale. Some field organizers have already left the campaign as a result.""

The union is asking for field organizer salaries be boosted to $46,800, and for 100 percent of health care costs to be provided for all campaign employees making $60,000 per year or less. Workers are also seeking mileage reimbursement for field staff at $0.58 per mile.

It is unclear whether Sen. Sanders is aware of his staff complaints.

The democratic socialist has been a longtime critic of big-money corporations and employers, decrying profit and urging wealth distribution. The Bernie 2020 campaign is reportedly sitting on a war chest of roughly $27.3 million in cash.

Anything else?

Sen. Sanders has been pushing for a $15 federal minimum wage for years, and the House passed its plan on Thursday.

According to a Congressional Budget Office report, the House Democrats' bill ""would boost wages for about 17 million people — but it would also reduce business income, raise consumer prices and reduce the nation's output,"" Fox News reported.

New video shows moment leftist political candidate threatens to blow up school bus — and when cop comes aboard and threatens to blow her away,"Stunning new video the Post Millennial said it exclusively obtained shows the moment when a woman — who's running for office in Washington state — entered a school bus full of kids in January 2010 and threatened to blow it up.

The clip also shows the cop who came to the rescue by boarding the bus, pulling his gun, and threatening to blow away Ubax Gardheere if she persisted.

What are the details?

TheBlaze previously reported that Gardheere — who's director of the Equitable Development Division in Seattle's Office of Planning and Community Development and is running for the King County Council — came about the bus headed to Chinook Middle School and told the driver and the children that she may have a bomb and a gun.

""When students attempted to escape out the back of the bus, [Gardheere] called them cowards and told them they would be responsible if something happened to their classmates,"" deputy prosecutor Gretchen Holmgren later wrote to the King County court.

Gardheere was hit with felony charges of kidnapping but worked out a plea deal with prosecutors to brings things down to the misdemeanor level. Weeks after the incident, Gardheere told the Seattle Weekly she was suffering from postpartum depression after the birth of her son three years earlier.

What does the video show?

Video of the terrifying incident confirms much of what authorities noted. It starts with Gardheere leaning against the bus' dashboard as children board it and telling the driver, ""You can't leave.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @MrAndyNgo

Soon Gardheere is walking down the aisle and yelling at the kids, one of whom apparently questioned if she was truly armed. ""How do you know?"" she yelled. ""I'm Muslim, I'm covered — I might have a bomb.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @MrAndyNgo

She also told the young frightened passengers that she also might have a gun.

Then in another part of the clip, terrified students are seen running out of the bus as Gardheere repeatedly yells, ""Cowards!""

But the one moment of good news is when a heroic cop comes aboard and puts a stop to things.

""I don't care what you want,"" he tells Gardheere. ""I'm gonna tell you right now these are children on the bus, and I'm gonna ask you to get off the bus right now.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @MrAndyNgo

Gardheere appears calm enough in the face of authority — and so the cop turns up the heat: ""I'm gonna ask you once, and then I'm gonna take you off the bus.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @MrAndyNgo

With that, he pulls his gun and points it right at Gardheere.

""If you choose not to get off the bus I'm gonna drop you right here as we stand, do you understand that?"" he tells Gardheere, who proves a quick study and raises her hands skyward.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @MrAndyNgo

With that, he hollers at Gardheere to turn around and back up. After she exclaims that she's ""prepared to die,"" the cop wasn't having any of it.

""I don't care whether you're prepared to die or not,"" he answers. ""I'm about prepared to kill ya, how's that?""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @MrAndyNgo

Here's the clip:

Gardheere had no weapons in her possession at the time of her arrest.

Anything else?

The Post Millennial said it isn't clear if what Gardheere did 11 years ago is known to individuals within the Democratic Party who've backed her candidacy.

State Senator Rebecca Saldana said ""I will follow Ubax anywhere,"" and former Seattle City Council member and radical activist Mike O'Brien called Gardheere ""an amazing leader,"" the outlet said.

More from the Post Millennial:

In a recent interview with the South Seattle Emerald, Gardheere revised her own history and claimed that when she threatened school children with a bomb on a bus she was being criminalized for mental health issues.



""It means being a brand new mother and going through postpartum depression and then actually having a mental breakdown and being criminalized for that, instead of getting the mental health [support] that I needed.""



This conflicts not only with the court documents and police reports of the incident but also with her own statements years earlier to The Seattle Weekly. ""I'm thinking in my head, 'what can I say or do that will get you taken to jail instead of a mental institute?'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ray-dalio-warns-us-war,2021-07-02
Report: Biden State Department refuses to use term 'Abraham Accords' when discussing historic Trump achievement,"The Biden administration is reportedly discouraging State Department employees from using the name ""Abraham Accords"" when discussing the historic peace agreements brokered by former President Donald Trump and signed by Israel and several of its Arab neighbors to normalize relations.

The Washington Free Beacon reported Friday that the State Department has erased the name of the accords from their internal communications as officials are pressured to refer to the peace deals simply as ""normalization agreements.""

The Abraham Accords are a series of agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and several other Muslim nations that were once antagonistic towards the world's lone Jewish state to normalize relations. Speaking last year, President Trump declared the agreements ""the dawn of a new Middle East.""



But according to the Free Beacon's source, the Biden administration is seeking to purge the name ""Abraham Accords"" for some unknown reason.

From the report:

Following inquiries to the State Department about the emails and the source's information, a spokesman told the Free Beacon, ""the Department would refer to the Abraham Accords as such."" The department declined to comment on the emails in question or make clear whether its statement represents another shift in policy. A State Department official, speaking only on background, said, ""This administration is not focused on what these agreements are called but what they mean.""



It is unclear what impact the Biden administration believes the change will have. The State Department declined to explain its position. ""It's a name the Trump administration came up with, a branding they came up with, and they prefer not to use it because it's associated with President Trump. For the U.S. to shy away from that term, it's absurd, petty, and silly."" Team Biden, the source said, further saw the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas terror groups ""as an, 'Ah-ha!' moment to **** on the Abraham Accords.""





Evidence that this policy is in effect surfaced in early April, when Associated Press diplomatic correspondent Matthew Lee repeatedly tried to get State Department spokesman Ned Price to state the ""specific name"" of the agreements. Price bizarrely evaded the question several times before finally calling them the ""Abraham Accords.""

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reacted to the Free Beacon's story on social media, suggesting that the Biden administration's policy was implemented out of spite for Trump or ""they so despise religious freedom that the faith-driven name we gave to these historic deals upends their anti-religious outlook.""

""Maybe both?"" Pompeo mused.

Report: NYT columnist David Brooks promoted a think tank without disclosing that he was being paid by them,"New York Times columnist David Brooks earned a second salary from a think tank he promoted in his columns without disclosing the relationship to readers, according to a report.

According to BuzzFeed News, Brooks was earning a second salary for his work on Weave: The Social Fabric Project, a project of the Aspen Institute that he founded and serves as the executive director for. The Aspen Institute is a prominent think tank in Washington, D.C. Brooks has been a paid contributor to the New York Times since 2003.

In 2018, the Weave project reportedly received funding from Facebook and though Brooks has written about Facebook in several of his columns, he has never disclosed the financial relationship he shares with the social network.

From BuzzFeed News:



In Dec. 2018, Facebook earmarked a $250,000 gift to the Aspen Institute for the project. Three months later, Brooks introduced Times readers to his concept of ""Weavers,"" which he described as people who fight social isolation by ""building community and weaving the social fabric"" across the US.



""We need to create a shared Weaver identity,"" Brooks wrote in the column ""A Nation of Weavers."" To make that happen, Brooks explained, he had started Weave at the Aspen Institute.



Brooks has published multiplecolumns that promote Weave, in addition to writing pieces that mention Facebook, its founder Mark Zuckerberg, and the company's products without disclosing his financial ties to the social networking giant.



The amount and timing of Facebook's funding, which had not been previously reported, combined with Brooks's promotion of Weave in the Times, has raised questions about the columnist's conflicts of interest. Last Friday, BuzzFeed News reported that Brooks wrote a blog post for Facebook's corporate website that was timed with the release of a New York University–led study about Facebook Groups that was funded by the social media giant. Brooks did not tell his editors he was writing for Facebook, according to a Times spokesperson.

Brooks did not respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment.

A spokeswoman for the New York Times said Brooks' work with Weave is under internal review.

""We're in the process of reviewing David's relationship with the Weave Project and the Aspen Institute, and what disclosures, if any, should be added to David's columns going forward,"" said Eileen Murphy, the senior vice president of corporate communications for the Times.

Last week, BuzzFeed News reported that Brooks published a 900-word blog post to Facebook's corporate website to promote a new study of groups that was funded by the company. Brooks also reportedly appeared on a Facebook-produced video panel about the study.

The Times told BuzzFeed News that it was not aware of Brooks' work with Facebook and that he was not compensated for it.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-new-video-shows-moment-leftist-political-candidate-threatens-to-blow-up-school-bus-and-when-cop-comes-aboard-and-threatens-to-blow-her-away,2021-03-04
"Russian 'deep fakes' videos may toss 2020 election into chaos — even destabilize society, officials fear","They're called ""deep fakes"" — and apparently they're pretty scary.

Russian President Vladimir Putin — and perhaps other anti-American entities — will use ""deep fakes"" technology to toss the 2020 presidential election into chaos and even destabilize society, the Washington Times reported, citing U.S. officials at a high-level national security forum.

The tech uses a ""deep-learning algorithm technology"" that ""produces high-quality audio and video of individuals saying things they never said or doing things they never did,"" the Times reported, adding that the resulting media will be ""virtually indistinguishable from real footage, mimicking voices, speaking patterns, facial expressions and surroundings to a frighteningly realistic degree.""

Officials said negative consequences — even to democracy — could be potentially endless, the paper said.

Now what?



Lawmakers said cooperation between the military, the tech community, and Congress is necessary to battle against ""deep fakes"" technology, the Times reported.

""It's going to destroy human lives, it's going to roil financial markets, and it might well spur military conflicts around the world,"" U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska) said during the annual Texas National Security Forum in Austin, the paper noted. ""When deep fakes technology produces audio or video of a global leader saying something or ordering some attack that didn't happen, you're going to have to actually have flesh-and-blood humans who have a little bit of a reservoir of public trust who can step to a camera together and say, 'I know that looked really real on your TV screen. But it wasn't real.'""

More from the paper:

The use of deep fakes — examples of which have been put together by researchers at American universities who say it's vital to understand the technology before it is weaponized against the U.S. — represents an escalation by Russia, officials say.



Moscow's 2016 strategy to influence American elections centered on planting fake news stories and using hosts of bots to bombard Twitter, Facebook and other social media outlets with content. That approach continued this year, contributing to a broader worsening of the relationship between Washington and Moscow.

U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis noted Saturday that Russia did attempt to interfere in the 2018 midterms, but that America won't tolerate its interference. China may be another nation that uses tech to distort the truth, the Times said.



""Our adversaries don't conduct information warfare as much as a war on information, undercutting legitimacy of all comers, including governments,"" Gen. Raymond A. Thomas, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, told the national security conference Friday, the paper added.

The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency — the Pentagon's research arm (DARPA) — spent at least $68 million over the last two years developing ways to detect and fight back against deep fakes, the Times said, citing data obtained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

Where have we seen 'deep fakes'?



""Deep fakes"" have been used to create phony sex videos featuring actress Gal Gadot, among others, the Times reported, adding that Wall Street Journal editors said last month they've started a ""internal deep fakes task force"" to help reporters and editors deep fakes clips.

What else may be coming?



""We can expect to see deep fakes used in other abusive, individually targeted ways, such as undermining a rival's relationship with fake evidence of an affair or an enemy's career with fake evidence of a racist comment,"" University of Texas law professor Robert Chesney and University of Maryland law professor Danielle Citron wrote in a recent post for Lawfareblog.com, the paper said.

They added, according to the Times: ""Blackmailers might use fake videos to extract money or confidential information from individuals who have reason to believe that disproving the videos would be hard. All of this will be awful. But there's more to the problem than these individual harms. Deep fakes also have potential to cause harm on a much broader scale — including harms that will impact national security and the very fabric of our democracy.""

More from the paper:

The possibilities seem endless. Mr. Chesney and Ms. Citron cited some potential uses, including fabricated videos of officials taking bribes, making racist remarks or meeting with criminals; fake footage of soldiers slaughtering civilians in a war zone, thereby undermining public support for the conflict; or phony video of a nuclear strike, biological attack or natural disaster, creating panic among the public.

U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) — vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence — told those at the security forum that he believes Russia will ""marry cyber and disinformation,"" combining more traditional cyberhacking with deep fakes technology to create frighteningly personal attacks, the Times said.

""They will go out and use cybertools to hack into an entity like an Equifax company that has troves of personal information on lots of Americans, contact us with personal information that makes you think, 'Oh, my gosh, I should open this because they know my mom's maiden name or know my Social Security number,'"" Warner told the crowd, according to the paper.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed blasts school board for having a plan to rename schools by April but not a plan to reopen,"The San Francisco school Board on Tuesday followed through with a vote to rename 44 public schools apparently controversial namesakes like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).

As TheBlaze previously reported, in October San Francisco school officials on the School Names Advisory Committee created a list of 44 sites that featured buildings named for historical figures, proposing to change the names of these buildings. The committee was tasked with identifying ""whether the name on a school met the criteria for renaming, which includes anyone or anything associated with slavery, genocide, colonization, exploitation and oppression, among other factors.""

The criteria for a school name to be deemed ""inappropriate"" included: Anyone directly involved in the colonization of people; slave owners or participants in enslavement; perpetrators of genocide or slavery; those who exploit workers/people; those who directly oppressed or abused women, children, queer or transgender people; those connected to any human rights or environmental abuses; those who are known racists and/or white supremacists and/or espoused racist beliefs.

KNTV-TV reported Tuesday that the school board voted to adopt the committee's recommendations and change the names of the 44 public school buildings on the list. The names include Lowell High, Lincoln High, Washington High, Roosevelt Middle, John Muir Elementary and Feinstein Elementary.

Schools named for Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were included because those Founding Fathers were slave owners. Abraham Lincoln High School will be renamed because the nation's 16th president, who issued the Emancipation Proclamation ending slavery in the South, also ordered the executions of 38 Dakota tribe Native Americans involved in a violent conflict with white settlers in Minnesota.

Dianne Feinstein Elementary, a school named for California's sitting senior Democratic senator, made the list because as mayor of San Francisco in 1986, Feinstein reportedly replaced a vandalized Confederate flag at City Hall.



In October, San Francisco Mayor London Breed criticized the school board for moving forward with the plan to rename schools during the pandemic, calling it ""offensive.""

On Wednesday, the mayor issued another statement blasting schools for producing a plan to rename buildings by April but offering no plan to reopen the schools.

""I understand the significance of the name of a school, and a school's name should instill a feeling of pride in every student that walks through its doors, regardless of their race, religion, or sexual orientation,"" Breed said in a statement.

""What I cannot understand is why the School Board is advancing a plan to have all these schools renamed by April, when there isn't a plan to have our kids back in the classroom by then. Our students are suffering, and we should be talking about getting them in classrooms, getting them mental health support, and getting them the resources they need in this challenging time. Our families are frustrated about a lack of a plan, and they are especially frustrated with the fact that the discussion of these plans weren't even on the agenda for last night's School Board meeting.

""I believe our children should be a part of the conversation around the renaming of their schools, and I believe the education and discussions need to happen within our school walls. Let's bring the same urgency and focus on getting our kids back in the classroom, and then we can have that longer conversation about the future of school names.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-report-nyt-columnist-david-brooks-failed-to-disclose-financial-ties-to-think-tank-project-that-paid-him,2021-01-27
"Thousands in Hong Kong take to the streets in 'Thanksgiving' rally praising US, President Trump","Thousands of pro-Democracy demonstrators took part Thursday in a Thanksgiving Day rally in Hong Kong, waving American flags in a show of gratitude toward the U.S. in reaction to a pair of new human rights laws signed by President Donald Trump.

What are the details?

Protests have raged in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong for nearly six months, as citizens push back against Beijing's attempts to impose greater influence over the former British colony. The U.S. Congress took action in support of the protesters this week, passing a bill that ""requires the state department to justify favorable U.S. trading terms that have helped [Hong Kong] become a world financial center,"" The Guardian reported.

The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla), also includes the threat of sanctions against China for human rights violations.

""The rationale for us having this rally is to show our gratitude and thank the U.S. Congress and also President Trump for passing the bill,"" said 23-year-old Sunny Cheung, a member of the student group that pushed for the legislation. ""We are really grateful about that and we really appreciate the effort made by Americans who support Hong Kong, who stand with Hong Kong, who do not choose to side with Beijing.""

Reuters reported that the ""Thanksgiving"" rally took place Thursday night in the heart of Hong Kong. Activists draped themselves in American flags, singing their protest anthem and waving phone ""torches.""



According to the Associated Press, Beijing is ""furious"" over what it views as American meddling in China's ongoing conflict with Hong Kong.

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng reportedly told U.S. Ambassador Terry Brandstad that the new laws passed by the U.S. constituted ""serious interference in China's internal affairs and a serious violation of international law.""

Anything else?

President Trump issued a statement saying, ""I signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China, and the people of Hong Kong. They are being enacted in the hope that Leaders and Representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences leading to long term peace and prosperity for all.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-russian-deep-fakes-videos-may-toss-2020-election-into-chaos-even-destabilize-society-officials-fear,2019-11-29
WHO chief warns worst of COVID-19 pandemic is 'yet to come',"The head of the World Health Organization warned Monday that despite months of governments battling the coronavirus pandemic, ""the worst is yet to come.""

What are the details?

During a virtual news conference, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, ""Six months ago, none of us could have imagined how our world — and our lives — would be thrown into turmoil by this new virus. We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is this is not even close to being over.

""Although many countries have made some progress, globally the pandemic is actually speeding up,"" he continued. ""We're all in this for the long haul.""

Tedros went on to encourage unity as the pandemic continues to drag on, urging, ""We will need even greater stores of resiliency, patience, humility and generosity in the months ahead. We have already lost so much — but we cannot lose hope.""

The WHO chief added, ""The worst is yet to come. I'm sorry to say that.""

CBS News reported that Tedros' remarks come as the WHO marks six months since the organization was made aware of COVID-19, and ""just as the death toll surpassed 500,000 and the number of confirmed infections topped 10 million"" globally. The U.S. has had more than 2,500,000 confirmed cases along with over 126,000 deaths.

Tedros also dismissed claims that the WHO's recommendation for countries to conduct contract tracing is impossible to carry out.

According to the Associated Press, ""in recent months, countries with large outbreaks of COVID-19, including Britain and the U.S., have said there are simply too many contacts to trace for an effective system to be put in place.""

""If any country is saying contact tracing is difficult, it is a lame excuse,"" the WHO chief said.

Global Health Strategies reported that Tedros pointed ""out that many public health professionals have risked their lives to do contact tracing in active conflict zones, including @DrMikeRyan when fighting #Ebola in [the Democratic Republic of the Congo].""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-san-francisco-mayor-london-breed-blasts-school-board-for-plan-to-rename-schools-by-april-but-no-plan-to-open,2020-06-30
"'Religious service,' 'indoor gun range' listed on Virginia health dept. 'online complaint' form","The Virginia Department of Health's website offers an online form to report ""violations"" of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's coronavirus executive orders — and specifically lists ""religious service"" and ""indoor gun range"" in a dropdown menu among six other options for establishments accused of violations.

Image source: Virginia Department of Health website

What are the details?

The form says, ""If you have observed violations of Executive 63 or Executive Order 65 and wish to file a complaint, fill out this report form as completely as possible. Executive Order 63 involves the requirement to wear a face covering while inside buildings. Frequently Asked Questions about Executive Order 63 are available here. Executive Order 65 involves Phase Two easing of certain temporary restrictions due to COVID-19; complaints related only to Executive Order 65 that involve cloth face coverings or capacity requirements may be filed with this form.""

The instructions add that the Virginia Department of Health ""will review your complaint and forward it to your Local Health Department.""

A dropdown menu listing ""type of establishment,"" two of the eight specific options users can choose from are ""religious service"" and ""indoor gun range"" — although it doesn't appear as though completing the ""type of establishment"" option is required.

'Trying to turn us into a society of informers and snitches'

Republican state Sen. Mark Obenshain wondered if Northam is ""trying to turn us into a society of informers and snitches"" and was particularly displeased with the options to specifically call out gun ranges and religious services.

""So let me get this straight,"" he continued. ""Gov. Northam is asking private citizens to tattle on their fellow citizens regarding his mask order and encouraging complaints to be submitted specifically as to churches and gun ranges. And these complaints can be made anonymously. There is nothing to prevent businesses from snitching on competitors, or to prevent the outright fabrication of reports. This is sure to work to the detriment of small businesses who are struggling under the weight of the coronavirus shutdown AND stifling laws Democrats passed that go into effect July 1.""

Obenshain added that ""it appears that the full force and weight of the state government is poised and ready to drop on restaurants, churches, and wineries for perceived violations of the Governor's orders while the Governor equivocates and prevaricates when it comes to its enforcement in connection with protests, demonstrations and riots — as long as participants are his allies.""

While far-left Northam is notoriously anti-gun, on Tuesday he did say he doesn't condone protests when they become violent. Northam also was caught in Virginia Beach in late May without a face mask after having declared he'd issue a rule mandating masks outdoors.

Rep. Justin Amash says he is looking 'closely' at presidential run,"Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), a former Republican known for his knowledge of the Constitution, signaled Monday that he is considering a 2020 bid for the White House.

What are the details?

During a news conference addressing the coronavirus crisis, President Donald Trump claimed the decision to reopen the economy lies with him rather than state governors, saying, ""When somebody's president of the United States, the authority is total, and that's the way it's gotta be."" The president added, ""The governors know that.""

In reaction to the president's comments, Amash — who left the GOP after being the lone House Republican to call for an impeachment inquiry into President Trump — reacted to the comment by tweeting, ""Americans who believe in limited government deserve another option.""

A supporter of Amash's responded, ""Please be you,"" to which the congressman replied, ""Thanks. I'm looking at it closely this week.""

Earlier in the day, President Trump had tweeted, ""For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect.""

The president added, ""It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons. With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue. A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!""

To that, Amash wrote, ""President Trump is flat-out wrong. The president has no authority to 'close down' or 'open up' the states. He's the one creating conflict and confusion. Put down the authoritarianism and read the Constitution.""

Last week, the congressman tweeted that ""Trump versus Biden is not the contest America deserves or the one it needs right now.""

Amash, who believes in ""limited government, economic freedom, and individual liberty,"" left the House Freedom Caucus last year, saying he ""didn't want to be a further distraction for the group.""

Rep. Matt Gaetz files ethics complaint against Adam Schiff,"Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz (R) announced Wednesday that he has filed a formal complaint against fellow congressman and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), accusing his colleague of several instances of ""unprofessional and divisive behavior.""

Schiff has been a longtime critic of President Donald Trump, and has taken the lead in House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into the president.

What are the details?

Gaetz announced on Twitter, ""Today I filed an ethics complaints against @RepAdamSchiff for:

-Distorting @POTUS's call with President Zelensky

-Lying to the public about 'Russian Collusion'

-Blocking Members of Congress from attending impeachment depositions.""

The Republican added, ""Schiff must be held accountable.""



In Gaetz's letter to the Ethics Committee — who have been quite busy the past few weeks — he referred to Schiff's self-described ""parody"" account of a phone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a ""wildly-inaccurate and distorted 'retelling'"" that ""grossly misrepresent[ed] the content of the call to the American people.""

Gaetz also pointed to a March 2017 interview where ""Mr. Schiff claimed to have 'more than circumstantial evidence' of President Trump and his campaign 'colluding' with Russia.""

The Florida congressman continued, ""As the report from Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III has made clear, Mr. Schiff's claim was baseless and untrue; to date, Chairman Schiff has not justified his statement.""



Rep. Gaetz also argued that """"Mr. Schiff's unprofessional and divisive behavior has caused conflict within the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,"" noting that ""every Republican on the committee signed a letter requesting Chairman Schiff's immediate resignation, citing his 'willingness to continue to promote a demonstrably false narrative.'""

A Schiff spokesman reacted to Gaetz's complaint in a statement to Fox News, saying, ""We don't think anyone takes Mr. Gaetz seriously, especially on the subject of ethics.""

Anything else?

The Washington Examiner reported that Gaetz's complaint against Schiff ""could usher an end to a decades-long bipartisan ethics détente,"" explaining that ""House lawmakers have seldom filed ethics complaints, particularly across party lines, after the two sides agreed to end a partisan ethics war that consumed Congress more than two decades ago.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/religious-service-indoor-gun-range-complaint,2019-10-30
Rep. Rashida Tlaib claims 'freedom of speech doesn't exist for Muslim women in Congress',"Far-left Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) declared Thursday to her 1.4 million Twitter followers that ""freedom of speech doesn't exist for Muslim women in Congress,"" after her fellow Muslim female colleague Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) faced backlash from her own party after appearing to equate the U.S. and Israel to terrorist organizations earlier in the week.

What are the details?

Tlaib, who along with Omar is a household name after numerous controversial statements and membership in House Democrats' progressive ""squad,"" tweeted:

""Freedom of speech doesn't exist for Muslim women in Congress. The benefit of the doubt doesn't exist for Muslim women in Congress. House Democratic leadership should be ashamed of its relentless, exclusive tone policing of Congresswomen of color.""

Fox News noted:

Tlaib and Omar were the first Muslim women elected to Congress in 2018 and, along with other members of the progressive Squad, have been more critical of Israel, especially during the recent 11-day conflict with Hamas that left more than 250 dead, the vast majority Palestinians.

On Monday, Omar sparked outrage after telling her own 1.2 million Twitter followers, ""We must have the same level of accountability and justice for all victims of crimes against humanity. We have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban. I asked @SecBlinken where people are supposed to go for justice.""

Omar's remarks drew sharp condemnation from across the political spectrum, including from at least a dozen fellow House Democrats. The Minnesota representative then clarified her comments while slamming her Democratic colleagues for calling her out.

""It's shameful for colleagues who call me when they need my support to now put out a statement asking for 'clarification' and not just call. The islamophobic tropes in this statement are offensive. The constant harassment & silencing from the signers of this letter is unbearable.""

The same day, Democratic leaders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D) issued a joint statement saying ""there is no moral equivalency between the U.S. and Israel and Hamas and the Taliban,"" adding that they ""welcome"" Omar's clarification.

The House's Progressive Caucus issued a statement of their own defending Omar. The message penned by Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) reads:

Rep. Omar is a deeply valued members of the Progressive Caucus. Her voice is critical and necessary, both in the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Democratic Caucus as a whole.



We cannot ignore a right-wing media echo chamber that has deliberately and routinely attacked a Black, Muslim woman in Congress, distorting her views and intentions, and resulting in threats against Rep. Omar and her staff. We urge our colleagues not to abet or amplify such divisive and bad-faith tactics. Members of the Democratic Caucus owe it to each other to pause, reflect, and engage directly with each other when misunderstanding arise, and stand together against cynical attempts to divide our caucus.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib's father said back in 2010 that she lied about her address to get elected in Detroit,"Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib's father accused his daughter back in 2010 of lying about her address so she could get elected in Detroit's 12th District, according to The Daily Wire.

The accusation is found in an article in The Detroit News from March 11, 2010 titled ""Rep. Tlaib's father: She didn't live in city."" In the article, Tlaib's father, Harbi Elabed, told the paper that Tlaib used his address on election forms even though she lived in Dearborn.

""She lied. She lied big-time to get elected. I never teach her that way,"" Elabed told the paper. ""I teachher the right way. It's my house. She didn't live there. She lived in Dearborn in her house with her husband and boy.""

What does Tlaib say about this?

Tlaib has expressed disappointment about her father's accusation.

""People have questioned that a lot,"" Tlaib said at the time, ""but never my father and I'm sad about that. The point is I complied with the law. I moved into the district before I filed. Period.""

Tlaib said she separated from her husband in 2008 as she prepared to run for state representative and moved into her father's house. She served as state representative for the 12th District from 2009 until 2015.

Why did the father bring this up?

This was apparently not the first conflict between Tlaib and Elabed. Elabed told The Detroit News that there was a ""growing litany of transgressions"" related to family issues such as care for his mother and a custody battle involving his nephew.

""My sons told me blood is thicker than water and I should keep my mouth shut, so OK, I did. Then she crossed the line with her father. When she interferes in the father's business, when she shows him no respect,"" Elabed said.

Report: All of the Bobulinski material reviewed by Congress so far has been verified,"The Senate committee tasked with verifying materials submitted to Congress by former Hunter Biden business associate Tony Bobulinski has found all of the material reviewed so far to be legitimate.

Bobulinski submitted materials to the FBI and to Congress last week that he said proved the Biden family — including Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden — leveraged their family name to broker a partnership with CEFC China Energy Co. in 2017. Bobulinski was a member of the business consortium that dealt with the Chinese firm before things went south.

A spokesperson for Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, told the Daily Caller on Wednesday that all of the electronic devices and records of business dealings reviewed to date have been verified. The spokesperson also reportedly said that committee has not come across any ""signs"" or evidence to suggest the content is false.

The news appears to be a stunning rebuke of Democratic lawmakers and former intelligence officials, who have maintained that the Hunter Biden scandal stemming from the New York Post's reporting and Bobulinski's claims is part of a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at swaying the election.

The same laws that prohibit individuals from lying or submitting false information to Congress through verbal or written testimony also apply to the material Bobulinski submitted last week. As such, Johnson also told the Daily Caller that the lengthy review process will prevent the committee from calling Bobulinski to testify ahead of next week's election.

Bobulinski was supposed to appear before the committee last week but that was postponed after the FBI requested an interview with him over his allegations. In a statement, Johnson said he was happy that the FBI was taking the matter seriously.

""I appreciate that the FBI has a job to do, and I am glad they are finally taking an interest in these concerning financial matters that our Committees have been investigating for months,"" Johnson said. ""I expect that Mr. Bobulinski will speak with our committee as soon as possible and fully share his insights into the Biden family's business dealings.""

In September, Johnson and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) published a lengthy conflicts-of interests report about the Biden family which they said ""revealed millions of dollars in questionable financial transactions between Hunter Biden and his associates and foreign individuals.""

Among many findings, the report discovered that ""on Aug. 8, 2017, CEFC Infrastructure Investment wired $5 million to the bank account for Hudson West III,"" most of which would later be rerouted to the Hunter Biden-owned Owasco firm.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rep-rashida-tlaib-claims-freedom-of-speech-doesnt-exist-for-muslim-women-in-congress,2020-10-29
Report: Hunter Biden's new wife is pregnant,"Hunter Biden, 49, is about to become a father for the fifth time, according to an exclusive report from the Daily Mail.

The outlet published photos and a video of Biden's new bride, Melissa Cohen Biden, with a visible baby bump, and reported that a ""source"" close to Mrs. Biden confirmed the couple's news.

What are the details?

Melissa Biden, 33 — who married the son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in May — was spotted in Los Angeles on Thursday and is reportedly well into the second trimester of her pregnancy,

The source who purportedly confirmed that the couple is expecting told The Mail that while Melissa and Hunter are ""thrilled,"" they are also experiencing stress and anxiety with the spotlight Hunter is currently under.

The Mail's report comes less than a month after a DNA test confirmed that Hunter Biden is the father of a 16-month-old child, whose mother is a 28-year-old former Washington, D.C., stripper with whom he had an affair while still allegedly dating his brother's widow. Biden is currently being sued for child support by the toddler's mother, Lunden Roberts.

As part of the lawsuit, Roberts is demanding Biden disclose the income he received from Ukrainian gas firm Burisma. Biden's position on the board of the company has come under intense scrutiny, after it was revealed that he landed the lucrative gig without any apparent qualifications while his father was vice president of the United States and the point-man for Ukraine.

Burisma has been under investigation for corruption for years, raising further questions about the Obama administration's meetings with the company's representatives and whether the conflict of interest with the Bidens played any role.

House Democrats passed articles of impeachment against President Trump claiming the president withheld aide to Ukraine in exchange for further investigation into the Bidens' dealings in the country. President Trump has repeatedly insisted there was no such quid pro quo.

Hunter Biden has three older children with his first wife, Kathleen, to whom he was married for 24 years prior to their divorce in 2017.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rep-rashida-tlaibs-father-said-back-in-2010-that-she-lied-about-her-address-to-get-elected-in-detroit,2019-12-14
"Reporter who broke viral dreadlocks hoax had supported family's hair business, advocated for natural hair law","A viral story about a black sixth-grader in Virginia having her dreadlocks forcibly cut by white classmates turned out to be a hoax — and the reporter who broke the story had some ties to the supposed victim that may have influenced the reporting.

Late last month, Amari Allen accused three white students at Immanuel Christian School in Fairfax, Virginia of pinning her down and cutting her dreadlocks while insulting her. The story gained national media attention, partly due to its characterization as a racist hate crime and partly because it occurred at the school where second lady Karen Pence teaches.

Allen admitted earlier this week that she fabricated the whole story and that she had cut her own hair. Her grandparents apologized to the school and the students.

One of the reporters who broke the story, WUSA-TV's Mikea Turner, has some connections to the story that may have made her more likely to uncritically report the allegation, The Daily Caller reported.

The same day Allen reported the incident to her family, Turner was tweeting in support of a bill that would criminalize discrimination on the basis of hairstyle, known as the ""Crown Act.""

After the story was reported, Turner then used Allen's situation as a way to support the need for hair discrimination laws.

""This why we need the #CrownAct to protect little girls like Amari Allen,"" Turner wrote the next day.

Turner also had some previous connection to a cosmetics business run by Allen's grandparents and aunt called Still Natural. Turner featured the business in a September 2018 news segment, and that pre-existing relationship was not disclosed in the numerous stories Turner did for WUSA about the hoax assault.

WUSA has deleted all articles reporting the made-up attack, and redirected the links to a story about the incident being false. The news organization removed Allen's and her family's names from the story, citing ""the girl's age and the circumstances."" Allen's identity was widely disseminated through her various media appearances.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-bobulinski-materials-verified,2019-10-03
Student confronts reporter who called Hunter Biden laptop scandal 'right-wing media smears.' Her reaction speaks volumes.,"The Washington Post admitted recently the media's reaction to the Hunter Biden laptop story in 2020 ""is an opportunity for a reckoning."" But reporter Anne Applebaum apparently disagrees.

Applebaum, a writer for left-leaning magazine the Atlantic, was confronted with a substantive question about the media's reaction to the story at a ""disinformation"" conference on Wednesday. Instead of engaging in honest self-reflection on behalf of her peers, Applebaum dismissed the story's importance.

What happened?

During a Q&A panel at the University of Chicago event, a student asked Applebaum, citing a Media Research Center poll, whether the mainstream media acted ""inappropriately"" for suppressing and dismissing the Hunter Biden story.

""Do you think the media acted inappropriately when they instantly dismissed Hunter Biden’s laptop as Russian disinformation, and what can be learned from that in ensuring that what we label as disinformation is truly disinformation and not reality?"" the student asked.

""My problem with Hunter Biden’s laptop is, I think, totally irrelevant,"" Applebaum said.

""I mean, it’s not whether it’s disinformation — I mean, I don't think Hunter Biden’s business relationships have anything to do with who should be president of the United States,"" she continued. ""I don’t find it to be interesting, I mean, that would be my problem with that as a major news story.""

When Applebaum concluded, moderator David Axelrod ended the panel.

Applebaum wrote about the Biden-related controversies in the weeks prior to the 2020 presidential election, calling them ""right-wing-media smears""

Meanwhile, despite admitting that she is not interested in the Hunter Biden story, Applebaum repeatedly raisedconcerns of conflict of interestover the proximity of Donald Trump's children to him when he was president (such as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner serving as senior advisers) and the possibility that the Trump family profited from the White House.

Thus, Applebaum's reaction to the question was described as ""arrogant"" because it ""perfectly encapsulates why so many distrust the media.""

Anything else?

The Hunter Biden laptop story is anything but irrelevant.

Despite media outlets and social media companies suppressing the story in October 2020, the New York Times and Washington Post — the nation's biggest newspapers — recently confirmed what was already known: The laptop and emails are real, and they belonged to Hunter Biden.

In a honest editorial published on Sunday, the Post thus admitted the lesson that should be learned from 2020 is that there is ""a danger of suppressing accurate and relevant stories.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-hunter-bidens-new-wife-is-pregnant,2022-04-07
Republicans formally request to subpoena Hunter Biden and the whistleblower,"Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) have submitted a formal request to House Intel Chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) to subpoena Hunter Biden and the whistleblower in the House impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

In the letter request submitted Wednesday, Reps. Nunes and Jordan argue that despite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's commitment that the whistleblower would ""speak directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as required by law,"" their request that the whistleblower testify has been ""repeatedly rejected.""

The letter argues that the whistleblower's testimony is ""necessary for a full and fair understanding of all relevant facts.""

Reps. Nunes and Jordan cite reported revelations of the whistleblower's bias against President Trump, working relationship with former Vice President Joe Biden, and discrepancies between the whistleblower's complaint and closed-door testimony from witnesses as reasons they must testify – and consequently reasons the Democrats' are denying appeals to subpoena them.

To date, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they do not know the identity of the whistleblower – despite publishing his unredacted name in a closed-door testimony transcript – and ironically vow to make sure his, or her, identity is kept secret.

News also broke Wednesday that the alleged whistleblower was friends with a Schiff staffer while both were in the Obama White House.

""You have repeatedly refused to allow Republicans to fully examine the role of Vice President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a corrupt Ukrainian company, during Vice President Biden's term in office,"" the letter continues.



Reps. Nunes and Jordan argue that concerns over Hunter Biden's post at Burisma raised by witness testimony, the Obama administration, and President Trump in his July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, make his testimony directly relevant to the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.

While on the board at Burisma, Hunter Biden was reportedly paid roughly $1 million per year, more than 12 times the comparable pay for board members at similarly-sized companies. He was also paid as a consultant in addition to his paid work as a board member.

In addition to subpoenaing Hunter Biden and the whistleblower for sworn testimony, the letter states that Reps. Nunes and Jordan intend to subpoena Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC, Hunter Biden's company, for records relating to his role at Burisma, and the Democratic National Committee for communications with Ukraine officials and for records relating to Alexandra Chalupa, a DNC contractor allegedly paid to dig up dirt on Trump in 2016 with help from Ukraine officials.

In closing, the letter claims that Schiff and the Democrats' failure to concur with the subpoenas would constitute evidence of ""denial of fundamental fairness and due process.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reporter-dreadlocks-hoax-supported-familys-hair-business,2019-11-20
Republicans want greater oversight for weapon shipments to Ukraine — only 10% of U.S. weapons have been inspected in person,"The U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in first-world weaponry to Ukraine since its invasion by Russia. House Republicans, poised to take control of Congress in January, are now pressuring the Biden administration for greater accountability and transparency about these weapons transfers as well about other aid packages sent to the embattled Slavic nation.

The push for greater oversight comes after it was revealed that there have only been two in-person weapons inspections conducted by U.S. monitors since February.



Some accountability at last

Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told CNN in early November that there ""has to be accountability going forward.""

Underlining his support for Ukraine, McCarthy said, ""You always need, not a blank check, but [to] make sure the resources are going where it is needed. And make sure Congress, and the Senate, have the ability to debate it openly.""

Another GOP lawmaker clarified to CNN, ""McCarthy was not saying, 'We wouldn't spend money.' McCarthy was saying, 'We're gonna be accountable to the taxpayer for every dollar we spend.' ... A 'blank check' means that people get whatever they ask for. What we're saying is there's going to be some thought, there's going to be accountability.""

The New York Post reported that Rep. Michael McCaul (Texas), the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, indicated that Republicans continue to support aid to Ukraine, but on the condition that it's clear where it's going and that there is accountability for how it's utilized.

""We have a voice now, and we're going to do this in an accountable way, with transparency to the American people,"" said McCaul. ""These are American taxpayer dollars doing in.""

Rep. Mike Turner, the ranking Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee, indicated funding will no longer be included in ""Democrat bills,"" whereby assistance for the Slavic nation is contingent upon Democrats getting what they want in the way of domestic funding for their pet projects.

""We don't need to pass $40 billion, large Democrat bills ... to send $8 billion to Ukraine,"" Turner told ABC's ""This Week.""

Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) suggested that oversight has been long been regarded as necessary for weapons shipments to countries far less corrupt than Ukraine. According to Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine ranked 122nd out of 180 countries.

Waltz said, ""With the volumes of goods that we're pushing, it's our responsibility to have third-party oversight. We do it all over the world.""

On Nov. 17, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), and other Republican lawmakers held a press conference to discuss taxpayer funding to aid Ukraine.

Greene, who introduced a privileged resolution to audit the funds allocated to Ukraine by Congress, noted that ""Congress has appropriated $54 billion to aid in the Ukrainian conflict, and then our president, Joe Biden, has requested another $38 billion this week.""



""The American people, the taxpayers of this country, deserve to know where their money is going and how it's being spent,"" said Greene.

In the press conference, Greene said that of the aforementioned $54 billion, $44 billion ""is for aid to Ukraine and other affected countries. But what other countries? And how are they affected? And how did the American people's taxpayer dollars go to those countries? And to who? And to what organization? To their government? And in what way?""



Although Greene's resolution will likely be shot down by Democrats in the House sometime in the next two weeks, the Washington Post indicated that not all Democrats are opposed to clarity on how U.S. tax dollars are being deployed in Ukraine.

""The taxpayers deserve to know that investment is going where it's intended to go,"" said Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.).



Crow reportedly led an initiative in the House Armed Services Committee to include in the defense bill instructions to the Pentagon inspector general to audit, investigate, and review the Pentagon's efforts to support Ukraine.

Although certain that various weapons will be inevitably be ""lost,"" Crow said, ""We're not trying to prevent every single piece from falling into the hands of the Russians, but we want to make sure it's not happening at a large scale.""

Unlike Greene and McCarthy, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) recommended that the House Republican caucus ""focus its oversight on ensuring timely delivery of needed weapons and greater allied assistance to Ukraine.""

By oversight, McConnell doesn't appear to be concerned about accountability but on faster and ""more proactive"" weapons deliveries to Ukraine.

Glaring lack of oversight

The budget for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development in 2021 was over $53 billion. It requested billions more for fiscal year 2022.



The Washington Post reported that despite these billions of dollars, the State Department allegedly cannot afford to have weapons inspectors in Ukraine check every incoming shipment.

As of early November, only two in-person inspections had been conducted by U.S. monitors since the war began. That means only 10% of the 22,000 U.S.-provided weapons requiring enhanced oversight, including Stinger surface-to-air missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles, had been accounted for.

NBC News reported that it was only in October that Brig. Gen. Garrick Harmon, the U.S. defense attaché to Ukraine, had been dispatched to Ukraine to keep track of billions of dollars' worth of first-world weapons. Similar checks were terminated after Russia invaded on Feb. 24.

According to the State Department, included among the largely uninspected weaponry and systems committed to Ukraine are:

Over 1,600 Sting anti-aircraft systems;

Over 8,500 Javelin anti-armor systems;

Over 38,000 other anti-armor systems;

Over 700 Switchblade drones;

142 155mm Howitzers plus 924,000 155mm artillery rounds;

4,000 precision-guided 155 mm artillery rounds;

36 105mm Howitzers plus 180,000 105mm artillery rounds;

1,500 tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided (TOW) missiles;

8 national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (MASAMS) and munitions;

4 Avenger air defense systems;

20 Mi-17 helicopters;

45 T-72B tanks;

200 MII3 armored personnel carriers;

Over 11,000 grenade launchers and small arms;

Over 84 million rounds of small arms ammunition;

58 coastal and riverine patrol boats; and

plenty of other defensive, offensive, protective, and explosive equipment, systems, and military vehicles.

While downplaying the possibility that unaccounted-for weapons might end up on the black market, the State Department conceded both that ensuring American weaponry makes it into the right hands can be ""difficult"" owing to the ""chaotic nature of combat"" and that Russia may be able to capture these weapons to ""develop countermeasures, propaganda, or to conduct false-flag operations.""



According to the Post, the Arms Export Control Act requires the Biden administration to provide ""reasonable assurance"" that the recipients of the billions of dollars' worth of weaponry are using them for their intended purposes.

With weapons going missing and so few incoming U.S. weapons inspected in Ukraine, it is unlikely a reasonable assurance can be given at the present time.

In April, one senior defense official told reporters, ""I couldn't tell you where [helicopters, cannons, and Switchblade drones] are in Ukraine and whether the Ukrainians are using them at this point. ... They're not telling us every round of ammunition they're firing and who and at when.""

National Security Council coordinator John Kirby suggested that weapons provided by the Pentagon were usually picked up by Ukrainian armed forces in Poland and then driven into Ukraine. Afterward, ""it's up to the Ukrainians to determine where they go and how they're allocated inside their country.""

On July 22, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation issued a statement, warning that ""the proliferation of firearms and explosives in Ukraine could lead to an increase in firearms and munitions trafficked into the EU via established smuggling routes or online platforms. This threat might even be higher once the conflict has ended.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reporter-s-reaction-when-confronted-about-hunter-biden-story-by-freshman-student-speaks-volumes,2022-11-28
"'Brave': Researcher with close ties to Wuhan lab thanked Dr. Fauci for dismissing lab leak theory, email shows","A central figure in bat research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who leads a nonprofit with close ties to the bio lab, personally thanked Dr. Anthony Fauci last April after he publicly dismissed the possibility that COVID-19 escaped from the Wuhan lab.

The revelation was revealed in the 3,200 emails obtained by BuzzFeed News as part of a Freedom of Information Act, which sought Fauci's emails.

News that people close to research at the Wuhan lab saw Fauci's dismissal as praiseworthy comes as the Wuhan lab leak theory — once dismissed as a debunked conspiracy theory despite a lack of evidence disproving the possibility — gains significant traction.

What are the details?

The email shows that EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak messaged Fauci on April 18, 2020, to thank him for saying at a presidential press briefing the day prior that evidence showed the pandemic's origins were ""totally consistent"" with a virus jumping from an infected animal to humans.

EcoHealth Alliance is the same nonprofit that was given taxpayer money by the National Institutes of Health to send to the Wuhan lab for the purposes of studying bat coronavirus before the pandemic.

""I just wanted to say a personal thank you on behalf of our staff and collaborators, for publicly standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to-human spillover, not a lab release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" Daszak wrote in the email.



""From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel the myths being spun around the virus' origins,"" he added.

Daszak also barked about Fox News reporters inquiring about the grant and research.

Fauci responded, ""Peter: Many thanks for your kind note. Best regards, Tony.""

A large section of Daszak's email, however, was redacted under a FOIA exception that permits withholding of ""records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that production of such law enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.""

Interestingly, Daszak's group also organized a letter last February, which was signed by more than two dozen prominent public health officials, to ""strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.""



That letter, which was published in The Lancet, generated significant media attention, and ultimately drove institutionalized dismissal of the Wuhan lab leak theory.

Compounding apparent conflicts of interest, Daszak was also a member of the World Health Organization investigative team that entered Wuhan in January to conduct an investigation into the pandemic's origin.



To the shock of no one, that investigation, which was tightly controlled by Beijing, affirmed China's assertion that COVID-19 emerged naturally, not as the result of any work being conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

In fact, Daszak admitted in March the WHO investigative team simply accepted what China told them about COVID-19 and the immediate aftermath of the virus outbreak.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-request-subpoena-biden-whistleblower,2021-06-02
Exclusive: The federal government paid hundreds of media companies to advertise the COVID-19 vaccines while those same outlets provided positive coverage of the vaccines,"In response to a FOIA request filed by TheBlaze, HHS revealed that it purchased advertising from major news networks including ABC, CBS, and NBC, as well as cable TV news stations Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC, legacy media publications including the New York Post, the Los Angeles Times, and the Washington Post, digital media companies like BuzzFeed News and Newsmax, and hundreds of local newspapers and TV stations. These outlets were collectively responsible for publishing countless articles and video segments regarding the vaccine that were nearly uniformly positive about the vaccine in terms of both its efficacy and safety.

Hundreds of news organizations were paid by the federal government to advertise for the vaccines as part of a ""comprehensive media campaign,"" according to documents TheBlaze obtained from the Department of Health and Human Services. The Biden administration purchased ads on TV, radio, in print, and on social media to build vaccine confidence, timing this effort with the increasing availability of the vaccines. The government also relied on earned media featuring ""influencers"" from ""communities hit hard by COVID-19"" and ""experts"" like White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci and other academics to be interviewed and promote vaccination in the news.



Though virtually all of these newsrooms produced stories covering the COVID-19 vaccines, the taxpayer dollars flowing to their companies were not disclosed to audiences in news reports, since common practice dictates that editorial teams operate independently of media advertising departments and news teams felt no need to make the disclosure, as some publications reached for comment explained.



The Biden administration engaged in a massive campaign to educate the public and promote vaccination as the best way to prevent serious illness or death from COVID-19.

Congress appropriated $1 billion in fiscal year 2021 for the secretary of health to spend on activities to ""strengthen vaccine confidence in the United States."" Federal law authorizes HHS to act through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies to award contracts to public and private entities to ""carry out a national, evidence-based campaign to increase awareness and knowledge of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for the prevention and control of diseases, combat misinformation about vaccines, and disseminate scientific and evidence-based vaccine-related information, with the goal of increasing rates of vaccination across all ages ... to reduce and eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases.""



Anyone who has spent time reading the news, watching TV news coverage, or browsing social media in the past year has more than likely been exposed to the government's advertising. HHS ads posted to YouTube have been viewed millions of times and commercials featuring celebrities like singer Sir Elton John and actor Sir Michael Caine have been the subject of news coverage, such as this feature from NBC News:

Elton John, Michael Caine Appear In Comic Covid Vaccine Ad | NBC News NOW youtu.be

""Fear-based vaccine ads"" from HHS featuring ""survivor"" stories from coronavirus patients who were hospitalized in intensive care units were covered by CNN and discussed on ABC's ""The View"" when they were unveiled last October.

Though the federal government was paying each of these companies and others for pro-vaccine advertising while news reports covered the same vaccines, many editorial boards say they have firewall policies that prevent advertisers from influencing news coverage.



""Advertisers pay for space to share their messages, as was the case here, and those ads are clearly labeled as such,"" explained Shani George, vice president of communications for the Washington Post, in a statement. ""The newsroom is completely independent from the advertising department,"" she said.

A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Times gave a similar statement, emphasizing that the ""newsroom operates independently from advertising.""

TheBlaze reached out to several other publications that either declined to comment or did not respond before publication.



The COVID-19 Public Education Campaign by HHS also used earned media outreach — word of mouth marketing — with the goal of having ""trusted messengers and influencers"" speak to news organizations to ""provide factual, timely information and steps people can take to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.""

As a result of that effort, various government officials have frequently been quoted by reporters covering the COVID-19 pandemic, offering factual information on vaccine efficacy and safety. An October article from BuzzFeed News featuring the ""essential facts"" about who is eligible for a COVID-19 booster shot, for example, reported pro-vaccine statements from CDC director Rochelle Walensky, FDA official Peter Marks, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, and University of California, San Francisco epidemiologist George Rutherford.

The article stressed how studies show ""boosters work"" and cited FDA data that suggests getting a booster shot ""can reestablish strong protection against the virus."" BuzzFeed News advised everyone age 65 or older, people with health conditions that put them at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19, those like healthcare workers who are at risk from coming into contact with COVID-19 positive people for work, and anyone in areas with high virus transmission to get vaccine boosters, in accordance with guidance from the CDC.

Other publications, such as the Los Angeles Times, featured advice from experts on how readers could convince vaccine-hesitant people in their lives to change their minds. The Washington Post covered ""the pro-vaccine messages people want to hear."" Newsmax has reported how the vaccines have ""been demonstrated to be safe and effective"" and ""encouraged citizens, especially those at risk, to get immunized.""

HHS did not immediately respond when asked if the agency used taxpayer dollars to pay for people to be interviewed, or for a PR firm to place them in interviews with news outlets.



Since the COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson were given emergency approval for use in the United States last year, more than 215 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. An estimated 94.6 million people have also received at least one booster dose. About 65% of the U.S. population has now been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, including 75% of U.S. adults and 88.8% of seniors.

HHS has not yet revealed how much advertising money was spent on each media platform.

The Rolling Stones haven't played 'problematic' anthem 'Brown Sugar' on current tour: 'They're trying to bury it',"Legendary rock band The Rolling Stones are back on tour, and they're singing and playing in front of fans despite the recent death of founding drummer Charlie Watts, who was 80.

And something else noticeably different on this tour — so far, at least — is the absence of their anthemic song, ""Brown Sugar,"" which the Los Angeles Times referred to as a ""gleefully problematic early-'70s smash that opens on a 'Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields.'""

'They're trying to bury it'

""You picked up on that, huh?"" guitarist Keith Richards replied when the Times asked him why he, Mick Jagger, and the rest of the Stones aren't playing the song. ""I don't know. I'm trying to figure out with the sisters quite where the beef is. Didn't they understand this was a song about the horrors of slavery? But they're trying to bury it. At the moment I don't want to get into conflicts with all of this s**t.""

The paper added that Richards ""laughed in his signature raspy fashion"" and then said he's ""hoping that we'll be able to resurrect the babe in her glory somewhere along the track.""

The publication that bears the band's name — Rolling Stone — reported Tuesday that there's been no sign of ""Brown Sugar"" four shows into the group's 2021 No Filter Tour. The fourth show was Saturday in Nashville; the band's next gig is Thursday in Los Angeles.

For context, the magazine said ""Brown Sugar"" has been a cornerstone of the Rolling Stones' concerts since it was released 50 years ago, and it's the second-most played song in their catalog with 1,136 known performances. (The magazine added that ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" is on top of the list.)

But those lyrics...

Rolling Stone magazine said given the current social climate, it's not difficult to see how playing ""Brown Sugar"" night after night might eventually spell trouble.

After the first line (""Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields""), things get specific and ugly: ""Sold in the market down in New Orleans/Scarred old slaver knows he's doin' alright/Hear him whip the women just around midnight.""

More from the magazine:

This is indeed an historically accurate description of the horrors of the slave trade. And while nobody is seriously suggesting the Stones released a pro-slavery song, it continues on with lines about the unimaginable sexual abuse many slaves faced once they reached southern plantations.



""Drums beating, cold English blood runs hot,"" Jagger sings. ""Lady of the house wonderin' when it's gonna stop/House boy knows that he's doing alright/You shoulda heard 'em just around midnight.""

""We've played 'Brown Sugar' every night since 1970, so sometimes you think, 'We'll take that one out for now and see how it goes,'"" Jagger told the Times. ""We might put it back in.""

The magazine concluded by hypothesizing why Jagger may not be into performing ""Brown Sugar"" at the moment: ""It just doesn't taste so good in 2021.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/researcher-wuhan-lab-thanked-fauci-email,2021-10-13
"DeSantis slams Hamas, terrorist group to blame for Israel conflict","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis weighed in on the current Middle East conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The Republican governor blasted Hamas, placing blame on the group for the recent bloodshed in the tumultuous region, and emphasized that Israelis have the ""right to defend themselves.""

""I also wanted to just make a comment about what's happening in the Middle East,"" DeSantis said during a Wednesday press conference. ""I have friends over there who have been having to hide out in bomb shelters overnight, because of Hamas, which is a terrorist group, raining down rockets on civilians.""

""And make no mistake, Hamas is a terrorist group,"" DeSantis proclaimed. ""They are at fault on this. Israel has every right to defend itself against Hamas. And I think if you look at what's going on here, it really isn't so much about Israel, it's about Hamas trying to stake a claim to be the leader of the entire Palestinian Authority.""

""They kind of have their little place down in Gaza where they foment a lot of terrorism,"" DeSantis explained. ""They've had a lot of problems going on with the Palestinian Authority. I think this is Hamas' attempt to capitalize on that. But our ally Israel has a right to defend themselves and what's going on by Hamas is an absolute disgrace.""

Ron DeSantis' commentary on world conflicts could hint at presidential run



The Florida governor delivered his remarks about the violent situation on the other side of the world as speculation grows that DeSantis could be eyeing up a run for president in 2024. A new poll from the Trafalgar Group found that DeSantis is far and away the most popular Republican presidential candidate if Donald Trump decides not to run in 2024. The nationwide survey, conducted between April 30 and May 6, discovered that DeSantis currently gets almost 35% support from likely GOP voters in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, which is nearly the same amount as the next three potential candidates combined – Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, and Mike Pence.

An Echelon Insights poll from April declared DeSantis to be the early leader with 20% of the vote if Trump doesn't run for president. A Just the News survey from late February stated that DeSantis was the leading Republican 2024 candidate if former President Donald Trump sits out 2024, with 21% of the vote. During the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Republicans overwhelmingly supported DeSantis in the 2024 election, with 43% supporting his presidential run if Trump bows out.

Latest update on the Israel-Gaza conflict

More than 1,500 rockets have been launched from Gaza toward Israel since Monday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. There are a reported 83 deaths in Gaza and seven in Israel, according to the BBC. Four senior Hamas commanders and a dozen more Hamas operatives were killed by Israeli airstrikes, the Guardian reported.

Violence erupted in the streets of Israel late Wednesday as Arab and Jewish mobs attacked each other. Following the night of ""anarchy,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""nothing justifies"" the street violence and vowed to restore order ""with an iron fist if necessary.""

""It doesn't matter to me that your blood is boiling,"" Netanyahu said. ""You can't take the law in your hands.""

Israel has prepared combat troops along the Gaza border and is in ""various stages of preparing ground operations,"" a military spokesman said on Thursday.

""The chief of staff is inspecting those preparations and providing guidance,"" said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, international spokesperson of the IDF.

Hamas armed wing spokesman Abu Ubaida responded to Israel's troop buildup with a threat.

Sen. Marco Rubio calls on Biden to immediately fire Gen. Milley over 'treasonous' report he undermined Trump,"Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called on President Joe Biden to immediately fire Gen. Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, after a report claiming he undermined former President Donald Trump in calls to China.

""I write with grave concern regarding recent reporting that General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, worked to actively undermine the sitting Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forced and contemplated a treasonous leak of classified information to the Chinese Communist Party in advance of a potential armed conflict with the People's Republic of China (PRC),"" wrote Rubio in the letter Tuesday.

Milley is accused of calling his counterpart in the Chinese government to assure them that he would prevent an attack ordered by Trump and that he would let them know beforehand of a surprise attack if it were to be launched.

The report says that Milley's actions stemmed from his fears that the former president had become unstable after the attack on the U.S Capitol by some of his supporters who were angry at the official results of the 2020 presidential election.

Rubio said in the letter that Biden should fire Milley in order to protect the U.S. principle of civilian rule over the military.

""These actions by General Milley demonstrate a clear lack of sound judgement, and I urge you to dismiss him immediately,"" continued Rubio.

""General Milley has attempted to rationalize his reckless behavior by arguing that what he perceived as the military's judgement as more stable than its civilian commander. It is a dangerous precedent that could be asserted at any point in the future by General Milley or others. It threatens to tear apart our nation's longstanding principle of civilian control of the military,"" he added.

""You must immediately dismiss General Milley,"" Rubio concluded. ""America's national security and ability to lead in the world are at stake.""

The claims against Milley are made in a yet to be released book by journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa entitled, ""Peril.""

Jen Griffin of Fox News reported that the Pentagon responded to the claims by saying that Milley did not interfere with the chain of command but that he only made sure that everyone knew what their proper roles were in the event of a nuclear launch order.

They added that Milley had routine calls with China and NATO allies of the U.S. where he reassured them that the government was stable and that they were not plotting a surprise attack.

Trump responded to the report by accusing Milley of being guilty of treason, if the claims were true.

Sen. Rubio: 'Someone broke the law’ by leaking contents of Flynn call,"New acting Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Wednesday that ""someone broke the law"" by leaking the contents of retired Gen. Michael Flynn's December 2016 phone call with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak — and that this fact alone is cause for investigation.

In an appearance on Fox News' ""Fox & Friends,"" the senator explained the importance that information collected by intelligence agencies is not leaked — especially in order to ""further a political narrative"" — before suggesting that ""at the end of the day, elements of a phone call between Mr. Flynn and the ambassador from Russia at the time were leaked to the press.""

""Someone broke the law,"" he stated, adding that this fact ""alone is cause for accountability to find out who did it.""

Rubio then suggested that since the information was owned by the FBI, it seems likely that an FBI official may have been responsible for the leak, adding further suspicion as to whether top officials at the FBI broke the law during the bureau's probe of the Trump campaign.

""That is information that was owned not by the intelligence community,"" he said. ""It was owned by the FBI, they have possession of it, and so I think it's very valid to ask who knew about this information.

""You cannot have a law enforcement agency have people within it break the law,"" Rubio added.

Rubio discussed a wide range of issues during the interview, including the newly declassified email from Susan Rice, former national security adviser for the Obama administration.

The email documents a meeting of Obama officials regarding Flynn on Trump's inauguration day and demonstrates that former FBI Director James Comey was at that time proceeding in an investigation into the incoming national security adviser.

Rubio highlights this fact to again argue that Judiciary Committee hearings into potential wrongdoing by the FBI is justified.

""[The email] actually makes it abundantly clear that this is actually at that point no longer an intelligence community issue, this was an FBI issue, which is why I believe that the hearings in Judiciary is the proper forum to look at how the FBI handled this entire process and figure out if there was any wrongdoing in the way it was approached,"" Rubio said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ron-desantis-hamas-israel-gaza-conflict,2020-05-20
"Video: Russia attacks airports, hospitals, apartment buildings in Ukraine, is reportedly 'making a move on Kyiv' to overthrow government","The Russian military has attacked airports and damaged hospitals and apartment buildings amid its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to videos shared online and reports from multiple outlets on Thursday.

What are the details?

Despite claiming that the Russian military would target only military installations in a so-called ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, it quickly became clear that Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions in the neighboring country matched an all-out war, in which widespread civilian casualties are possible.

Footage obtained by the New York Times appeared to show a mass of airstrikes hitting an airport in Hostomel, just outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Subsequent reporting from CNN indicated that Russian forces had seized control of the facility, though Ukraine's military had apparently launched a counteroffensive.

More video of that attack was also posted online.

A hospital in southeastern Ukraine was also struck by ballistic missile fire Thursday in an apparently targeted attack. Amnesty International reportedly verified the attack and claimed it killed at least two civilians. The group noted that hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law.

Ukraine's health minister, Viktor Lyashko, claimed that more hospitals are now being targeted by Russian forces.

Additionally, Russian rocket fire destroyed an apartment building near Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The New York Times posted footage of firefighters and other first responders putting out flames and clearing debris from what remained of the building.

Video uploaded by the Daily Wire appeared to show a missile striking a building directly adjacent to a home with a woman and her children inside.

BuzzFeed News documented the extent of the devastation by posting a series of pictures online.

What else?



In all, the Russian military claimed Thursday it has overtaken 74 military installations, including 11 airfields. Ukraine has reported that at least 40 soldiers and up to 10 civilians have been killed so far.

A senior U.S. defense official told reporters Thursday that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is focused on three main axes of assault: a south-to-north approach from Crimea to Kherson; a north-central to south approach from Belarus to Kyiv; and a northeast-to-south approach near Kharkiv, where the heaviest fighting is currently happening.

The defense official, offering the information as part of an operational update, said Russia clearly intends is to overtake key population centers and is ""making a move on Kyiv,"" NBC News reported.

Russia has ""every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance,"" the defense official said.

They added that Russia's maneuvering so far is not surprising and ""is very much in line with what was expected."" U.S. intelligence predicted days ago that a full-scale invasion was imminent.

Russia conducts major military exercises near Hawaii — largest since Cold War — ahead of Biden's meeting with Putin,"In an obvious show of force, the Russian military conducted massive naval military exercises just a few hundred miles from Hawaii hours before President Joe Biden was scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The exercises — which Russian officials reportedly touted as the largest since the end of the Cold War — took place about 300 to 500 miles west of Hawaii and included surface ships, anti-submarine aircraft, and long-range bombers, CBS News reported.

News of the ""irregular air patrol"" reportedly sent U.S. defense officials into a frenzy, as they ""scrambled"" F-22s from Hawaii to respond to the Russian bomber flights.

The Russian bombers reportedly were not intercepted as they did not enter the Air Defense Identification Zone, but they came close.

Defense officials noted that a U.S. carrier strike group was also operating about 200 miles east of Hawaii. That exercise was planned beforehand but was moved closer to Hawaii in response to the Russian exercise.

U.S. Indo-Pacific Command spokesman Capt. Mike Kafka said in a statement that the U.S. military is ""monitoring the Russian vessels operating in international waters in the Western Pacific.""

""We operate in accordance with international law of the sea and in the air to ensure that all nations can do the same without fear or contest and in order to secure a free and open Indo-Pacific. As Russia operates within the region, it is expected to do so in accordance with international law,"" he added.

A short video of the exercise produced by Russia's ministry of defense was obtained the New York Post.

The exercises came directly alongside a highly anticipated meeting between Biden and Putin in Geneva, Switzerland, on Wednesday, in which both sides were hoping to ""project strength"" on the world stage, the Wall Street Journal reported.

While Biden may have been hoping to project strength through words, Putin was clearly hoping to project his country's strength through a showcase of military prowess.

""It's about making myself very clear what the conditions are to get a better relationship with Russia,"" Biden told reporters after the G7 summit in Cornwall, England, over the weekend. ""We're not looking for conflict — we are looking to resolve those actions which we think are inconsistent with international norms.""

Biden, despite previously characterizing Putin as ""a killer,"" this week called him ""bright,"" ""tough,"" and a ""worthy adversary.""

When asked about the military exercises following the summit, Putin dismissed U.S. concerns, saying they have ""no basis.""

He claimed that Russia was not attempting ""anything new"" in the Arctic; rather, his country was ""restoring the destroyed infrastructure"" in the region.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rubio-someone-broke-law-flynn-leak,2021-06-16
Russia launched anti-satellite weapon in space according to US,"The U.S. and United Kingdom accused Russia of testing a weapon that could attack satellites in space. The U.S. Space Command said on Thursday that it had evidence that Russia ""conducted a non-destructive test of a space-based anti-satellite weapon"" last week.

The U.S. Space Command alleges that a Russian satellite ""injected a new object into orbit"" on July 15. The Russian satellite named ""Cosmos 2543"" released an unidentified object into orbit near another Russian satellite.

Cosmos 2543 is reportedly an inspector satellite, but the U.S. Space Command said the satellite's activity was ""inconsistent with their stated mission"" as an inspector satellite.

The U.S. State Department questioned the motives of the Cosmos 2543 satellite in 2018 when it exhibited ""characteristics of a space-based weapon."" The Department of State declared the behavior ""hypocritical and concerning.""

""This event highlights Russia's hypocritical advocacy of outer space arms control, with which Moscow aims to restrict the capabilities of the United States while clearly having no intention of halting its own counter space program — both ground-based anti-satellite capabilities and what would appear to be actual in-orbit anti-satellite weaponry,"" said Dr. Christopher Ford, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State.

""We don't have definitive proof, but I think it is,"" Brian Weeden, director of program planning for the Secure World Foundation, told The Verge. ""It stands out as different from all the other rendezvous and proximity operations that have been going on.

""It's mostly satellites coming close to other Russian satellites or other Russian rocket bodies slowly — like a slow approach over several days,"" said Weeden. ""And then they might back away, and then they'll come close again, then they'll hang out nearby. That's the sort of thing we've been watching.""

""On July 15, Cosmos 2543 deployed a smaller object at a relatively high speed (roughly 200 m/s or about 400 mph) that is unusual for the typical satellite deployment,"" Weeden said.

In January, Cosmos 2543 and another Russian ""inspection satellite"" named Cosmos 2542 were spotted seemingly stalking a U.S. reconnaissance satellite operated by the National Reconnaissance Office that is named ""USA 245,"" known to space experts as a ""KH-11.""



""We view this behavior as unusual and disturbing,"" Gen. John ""Jay"" Raymond, Commander of U.S. Space Command and U.S. Space Force Chief of Space Operations, told Time magazine in February. ""It has the potential to create a dangerous situation in space.""

""The United States finds these recent activities to be concerning and do not reflect the behavior of a responsible space-faring nation,"" Raymond said.

""Last November the Russian government launched a satellite that subsequently released a second satellite,"" Gen. Raymond told CNBC in February. ""These satellites have been actively maneuvering near a U.S. government satellite … which the Russian government characterized as 'inspector satellites.'""

Now Raymond is pointing out that Russia's Cosmos 2543 is likely a weapon.

""The Russian satellite system used to conduct this on-orbit weapons test is the same satellite system that we raised concerns about earlier this year, when Russia maneuvered near a U.S. government satellite,"" Raymond said in a statement. ""This is further evidence of Russia's continuing efforts to develop and test space-based systems, and consistent with the Kremlin's published military doctrine to employ weapons that hold U.S. and allied space assets at risk.""

The Space Command claims there was also a Russian anti-satellite test carried out in 2017. Russians launched a satellite and ""a smaller satellite was birthed"" and then ""a projectile was launched"" from the satellite, Stephen L. Kitay, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, told the Pentagon last month.

Kitay said that China and Russia were ""actively developing capabilities to negate U.S. allied and partnered space systems, we are left with no choice but to ensure we are prepared with the necessary means to protect and defend ourselves from attacks to our systems.""

""I wish I could say that space was a sea of tranquility and a sanctuary from attack. But the fact of the matter is, space is contested,"" Kitay added. ""Outer space has emerged as a key arena of potential conflict in an era of great power competition.""

Russian state-owned media lays off most employees and shuts down operations in the US,"The U.S. arm of a Russian state-owned media outlet shut down on Thursday after being expelled from several platforms over the Russian invasion into Ukraine.

CNN first reported that Russia Today was ceasing operations and firing most of its staff in the United States.

The memo obtained by CNN from the general manager of T&R Productions blamed the shutdown on ""unforeseen business interruption events.”

“Unfortunately, we anticipate this layoff will be permanent, meaning that this will result in the permanent separation from employment of most T&R employees at all locations,” wrote Misha Solodovnikov.

The media network had been an outlet for pro-Russian propaganda but was removed from DirecTV this week and then later from Roku streaming services.

On Tuesday, Google said that they had blocked mobile apps connected to Sputnik and RT from their app store and from their search tool. Apple made similar moves on its app store.

RT Deputy Editor-in-Chief Anna Belkina issued a statement angrily decrying the bans.

""This collective ‘establishment’ seems to be terrified of a mere presence of any outside voice for the fear of losing their historically captive audience, if that audience encounters a different perspective,"" she said.

CNN also detailed a personal meeting between Solodovnikov and the hosts, correspondents, and producers of RT American in the Washington, D.C., bureau on Thursday based on a source who attended it.

Solodovnikov told the employees that their jobs were being terminated with two months severance pay.

One RT host spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity about the somber meeting.

“I have never felt more heartbroken as they have nothing to do with this conflict and seriously were just trying to make a decent living to provide for their families,” the host said.

Another source told CNN that people were shocked and many cried after the announcement.

Russian leadership threatens nuclear escalation if the West continues to arm Ukraine,"During a Tuesday interview with state media, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said that if the U.S. and other Western allies of Ukraine continue to provide the country with weapons, the risk of the war escalating into a nuclear conflict “should not be underestimated.”

CBS News reported that Lavrov said that by providing weapons to Ukraine, NATO countries were “pouring oil on the fire” and risking “World War III.”

Lavrov said that by providing weapons to Ukraine, NATO nations were already “in essence engaged in war with Russia.”

The Russian diplomat's warning came as U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with NATO allies in Germany to urge European nations to increase their military aid to Ukraine. Germany’s defense chief announced on Tuesday that Germany would soon start sending self-propelled armored anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine.

According to CBS News, foreign solidarity with Ukraine has “only grown over the course of Putin’s unprovoked two-month assault” that is now placing its focus largely on the eastern regions of Ukraine.

Last night, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said that it had hit roughly 90 more targets that it designated as “military” institutions. These included rail facilities around the northeastern city of Kharkiv that are crucial for getting supplies — including weaponry — into the city.

Austin told Ukraine’s allies in NATO that despite being significantly outgunned, Ukraine could manage to achieve victory if the country was provided with the “right equipment.”

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, dismissed the comments made by Lavrov and suggested that the bellicose rhetoric indicated that Russian leadership already “senses defeat in Ukraine.”

Despite this, the fighting in Ukraine’s eastern regions is far from over. Russian forces are reporting that their latest strikes in Kharkiv have killed 500 Ukrainian troops. CBS News says this claim cannot be verified but does substantiate the fact that front-line fighting in the region has only grown more intense.

Residents in Ukraine’s eastern regions are having their lives overturned as Russian forces continue to shell their hometowns. Many people have fled their family homes and taken shelter in shopping centers, where cafes are being converted into first-aid centers and refugee camps are being set up in parking lots.

Reportedly, Russian forces continue to abuse and claim the lives of civilians as they continue to push forward along their 300-mile-long front line in the east.

Fedor Zubkov, a 36-year-old man living near the eastern town of Zaporizhzhia, said that he was held captive for two days, handcuffed, and had a gun pointed at him by Russian forces.

He said, “I need to see the psychiatrist because, after the imprisonment and the loss of my beloved wife, I am slowly losing my mind. You can't even imagine what it is like to be tortured when 30 fully armored Chechen men stand in front of you, point the gun at you, and threaten to kill you again and again.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-space-force-weapon-satellite,2022-04-26
Russian and Cuban leadership reignite Cold War romance,"Tensions continue to rise across the world as Russian President Vladimir Putin rekindles his country’s relationship with the island nation of Cuba.

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and Putin discussed their countries’ “strategic partnership” and how they might work together to pursue “actions in the international arena.” The two men chatted on the phone as NATO allies continued to worry about a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Stars and Stripes reported.

Earlier this month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, compared the Russian buildup of forces around Ukraine and the subsequent international tension to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, the New York Post said.

Ryabkov continued by explaining that Russia fully intends to annex parts of Ukraine. He said, “We are not bluffing. ... The West’s awareness of this needs to be facilitated, and we are going to make every effort to achieve it.”

In mid-January, the Associated Press reported that Russia grew increasingly frustrated with NATO allies interfering with its plans and that Russia could consider deploying its military to Cuba and Venezuela if tensions with the United States escalated.

Minister Ryabkov said he could “neither confirm nor exclude” the possibility of Russian military involvement in Cuba and Venezuela should the United States continue to increase pressure on Russia.

Ryabkov said that the decision to do so “depends on the action by our U.S. counterparts” in an interview with the Russian television network RTVI. Ryabkov noted that Putin is open to the possibility of using Russia’s military resources should the United States use its military to pressure Russian decision-making about Ukraine.

U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan dismissed this as “bluster in the public commentary,” the Daily Mail reported.

In preparing for a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States ordered family members of American embassy staff in Kyiv to leave the country. This decision frustrated Ukrainian leadership, with some diplomats calling it an “instance of excessive caution.”

On Monday, according to the New York Post, White House press secretary Jen Psaki stated that American citizens currently in Ukraine “should leave now” and that the United States government does not currently have intentions to evacuate them should an armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia occur.

Psaki said, “There is not an intention for there to be a departure or an evacuation. ... So we are conveying to the American citizens they should leave now.”

When asked whether or not Americans would be on their own should armed conflict begin, Psaki said, “There’s commercial airlines, you can depart over land.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russia-today-america-shuts-down,2022-01-25
Russian business tycoon places $1 million bounty on Putin's head as attacks in Ukraine escalate,"A U.S.-based Russian businessman and investor has announced that he's placed a $1 million bounty on Russian President Vladimir Putin's head.

What are the details?

In a Tuesday Facebook post, Alex Konanykhin called on Russian military officers to arrest Putin as a war criminal. Their reward? One million dollars.

In his post, Konanykhin wrote, ""I promise to pay $1,000,000 to the officer(s) who, complying with their constitutional duty, arrest(s) Putin as a war criminal under Russian and international laws.""

""Putin,"" he continued, ""is not the Russian president as he came to power as the result of a special operation of blowing up apartment buildings in Russia, then violated the Constitution by eliminating free elections and murdering his opponents.""

He concluded, ""As an ethnic Russian and a Russia citizen, I see it as my moral duty to facilitate the denazification of Russia. I will continue my assistance to Ukraine in its heroic efforts to withstand the onslaught of Putin's Orda.""

Konanykhin also added that Facebook removed his initial posting about the bounty and said that the original post contained a graphic of a ""dead or alive"" poster.

What else?

Konanykhin — a crypto investor — told Insider on Wednesday that the money will come from his personal funds.

""If enough other people make similar statements, it may increase the chances of Putin getting arrested and brought to justice,"" he told the outlet. ""Putin is known to murder his opponents. He has millions of them now.""

Konanykhin told the outlet that he has not set foot on Russian soil since 1992 and was granted political asylum in the United States in 1999.

A 1996 article from the Washington Post reported that Konanykhin studied at the Moscow Physics and Technical Institute before opening what was described as a student construction cooperative. He eventually opened more businesses and dabbled in banking, real estate, and trading.

By 1992, the Post noted, Konanykhin's companies were worth approximately $300 million.

In 2021, Konanykhin told the Sun that Putin would ""drown [Russia] with blood if need be"" rather than ever give up power.

""Such a regime cannot be removed through elections, he doesn't have any parliamentary opposition, he doesn't have media [against him], and every type of organized opposition is wiped clean,"" he said at the time. ""It would have to be removed by force — and there is no such force, domestically or internationally.""

Konanykhin added that he believes ""only a conflict within the ruling class"" would be able to unseat Putin.

""I would love to be wrong, I really hope in a year I will be able to say 'Jesus, how wrong I was in this interview' — but 29 years ago I saw what has happened now,"" he said. ""I saw no scenario in which the KGB would not regain power and would hold it for the foreseeable future — so at that time I made the decision to leave the country.""

"Top Russian UN diplomat resigns, pens scathing letter against Putin: 'Never have I been so ashamed of my country'","A top Russian diplomat to the United Nations resigned in style on Monday, writing a scathing letter that sharply criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for the war in Ukraine.

What did the letter say?

Boris Bondarev, counselor at the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations, circulated a letter among his colleagues in Geneva explaining why he decided to resign.

In the letter, Bondarev held nothing back.

""For twenty years of my diplomatic career I have seen different turns of our foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my country as on February 24 of this year,"" Bondarev explained in the letter.

""The aggressive war unleashed by Putin against Ukraine, and in fact against the entire Western world, is not only a crime against the Ukrainian people, but also, perhaps, the most serious crime against the people of Russia, with a bold letter Z crossing out all hopes and prospects for a prosperous free society in our country,"" he continued.

Bondarev worked for the Russian Foreign Ministry for 20 years. Over his tenure of service, the professionalism of the Russian Foreign Ministry, he said, has devolved from ""unbiased information, impartial analysis and sober forecasting"" to ""propaganda clichés in the spirit of Soviet newspapers of the 1930s.""



""Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not about diplomacy,"" Bondarev said. ""It is all about warmongering, lies and hatred. It serves interests of few, the very few people thus contributing to further isolation and degradation of my country. Russia no longer has allies, and there is no one to blame but its reckless and ill-conceived policy.""

Speaking directly about Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Bondarev wrote:

Minister Lavrov is a good illustration of the degradation of this system. In 18 years, he went from a professional and educated intellectual, whom many my colleagues held in such high esteem. to a person who constantly broadcasts conflicting statements and threatens the world (that is, Russia too) with nuclear weapons!

Is he defecting?

Bondarev told the Associated Press that he has no plans to leave Geneva. However, when asked whether he would defect, Bondarev told the news outlet that he ""didn’t think so far"" ahead.

Meanwhile, the career diplomat also said he is concerned about Moscow's reaction. He is now the highest-ranking Russian official to publicly criticize the war.

"Report: Russian forces firing rockets at Kharkiv physics institute, which houses a nuclear reactor","Russian invaders have reportedly fired rockets at a Kharkiv, Ukraine, physics institute — a building that is said to house a nuclear reactor and more.



What are the details?

According to a Sunday report from The Independent, Ukraine's national security service has claimed that forces have been firing rockets at the institute, which they say could prompt a ""large-scale ecological disaster.""

The outlet reported that Russian forces are firing missiles from Grad launchers, which reportedly do not have precise targeting.

The facility, which houses a nuclear research division called Neutron Source, and is said to store at least 37 nuclear fuel cells.

It is unknown at the time of this reporting whether the inside of the building — and more particularly, the area in which the reactor and other nuclear materials are stored — sustained any damages from the rockets.

This week, Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs Emine Dzheppar said that the embattled country “continues to collect evidence of [Russian] war crimes for the Hague.”

What else?

The disturbing news comes on the heels of a near-miss at a Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, nuclear power station in which Russian forces stormed the facility and took over at gunpoint.

According to The Independent's report, Malcolm Grimston — honorary senior research fellow at Imperial College London's center for energy policy — said that the level of artillery necessary to destroy a nuclear power station would be immense, and beyond mere bullets and fire, indicating that Russian forces want to overtake the facility, and not trigger a large-scale disaster.



“So it’s much more consistent at least at this stage with them wanting to take a facility that happened to be a nuclear facility in that area, but not to cause a radiological incident,” he reasoned. “These power stations are an enormous asset; Ukraine gets more than half of its electricity from nuclear power. You would expect the Russians to want to maintain that because if they’re going to run it as part of Russia, it will still need energy.”

According to the Evening Standard, Linda Thomas-Greenfield — U.S. ambassador to the United Nations — on Saturday warned that Putin’s forces were closing in on a third plant in the Yuzhnoukrainsk area.

Thomas-Greenfield warned that nuclear power stations ""cannot become part of this conflict.""

“Reliable electricity is vital for the nuclear facility, as are back-up diesel generators and fuel,"" she continued. ""Safe transit corridors must be maintained. Russia must halt any further use of force that might put at further risk all 15 operable reactors across Ukraine — or interfere with Ukraine’s ability to maintain the safety and security of its 37 nuclear facilities and their surrounding populations.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-business-tycoon-places-bounty-on-putins-head,2022-03-06
Russian official apologizes for unjustified invasion of Ukraine at UN climate meeting,"The head of the Russian delegation to a major United Nations climate conference offered an apology for his country's unjustified invasion of Ukraine on Sunday, according to a report.

Russia's Oleg Anisimov told delegates from 195 nations at the closed-door virtual meeting of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that ""those who know what is happening fail to find any justification for the attack,"" according to AFP.

""Let me present an apology on behalf of all Russians not able to prevent this conflict,"" he told the government ministers and scientists participating in the meeting.

Anisimov spoke in Russian after the head of the Ukrainian delegation, Svitlana Krakovska, spoke passionately about Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion.

""We will not surrender in Ukraine, and we hope the world will not surrender in building a climate resilient future,"" she reportedly said in English.

""Human-induced climate change and the war on Ukraine have the same roots — fossil fuels — and our dependence on them,"" she added.

A source who attended the meeting told AFP ""everyone 'in the room' was really moved"" by Krakovska's message.

Delegates were surprised when the Russian Anisimov expressed ""huge admiration"" for the Ukrainian delegation.

""He knows that there is a risk for him, it was a very sincere message,"" said another participant, according to AFP.

Reached for comment, Anisimov told AFP his statements ""expressed my personal opinion and attitude,"" and should not be taken as an ""official statement of the Russian delegation.""

U.N. delegates on the IPCC had gathered to finalize a major assessment of how climate change could impact the world over the next few decades. Anisimov, a scientist and longtime Russian delegate to the IPCC, has previously been the lead author on many IPCC climate reports.

Anisimov's dissenting comments on the unprovoked war come as hundreds of anti-war activists in Russia are protesting against Putin's government, often at risk of arrest. The protests began Thursday, when Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine by land, sea, and air.

Russian police have begun to crack down on the protests in major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to the Associated Press. The Kremlin is issuing propaganda to downplay opposition to the war, but in addition to street protests, tens of thousands of people have endorsed open letters and signed petitions condemning the invasion. Celebrities, athletes, and famous TV personalities have spoken out against the war too.

Russian government officials have attacked opponents of the war. The speaker of Russia's lower house of Parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, said recently that the anti-war position of ""certain cultural figures"" was ""inappropriate"" and ""nothing short of betrayal of your own people.""

It is difficult to ascertain the extent of the anti-war sentiment in Russia because Putin's tyrannical regime has restricted access to social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, police are swiftly ending anti-war demonstrations, and state-run Russian media propagandizes for the government.

Russian prosecutors reportedly threaten to arrest executives and seize the assets of Western companies seeking to leave Russia,"Russian prosecutors are threatening to arrest executives and seize the assets of Western companies in Russia.

Companies with corporate leaders who criticize the Russian government or threaten to withdraw their business from the country in accordance with Western sanctions run the risk of coming into conflict with Russian prosecutors.

American corporations including Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble, IBM, and Yum Brands received stern warnings from prosecutors in Russia. They received phone calls, letters, and physical confrontations where prosecutors threatened to seize company assets, including trademarks, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Russian President Vladimir Putin also expressed support last week for a new law that would nationalize the assets of foreign companies that leave Russia in response to Western sanctions levied upon the country after it invaded Ukraine.

The Russian government’s approach to preventing businesses from leaving has led to some companies limiting communications with their Russian counterparts out of concern that their communications were being monitored.

Other companies have begun working to move their executives out of Russia.

The Russian embassy in Washington, D.C., took to Twitter to refute the claim that its government was either seizing assets or arresting executives.

The embassy said, “The decision whether to continue entrepreneurial activity in our country is entirely up to the Americans. As well as the right to ignore Russophobic hysteria that encourages foreign businesses to suffer huge losses in order to hit Russia.”

The alleged threats to arrest company executives and seize assets reportedly came in response to Western sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. These sanctions have debilitated the Russian economy.

In late February, leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a joint statement calling for the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT telecommunications network.

In doing so, Western leaders committed to “imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions.”

This and the removal of Russian banks from the SWIFT network make it incredibly difficult for Russia to participate in international trade and keep its economy afloat.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent Western sanctions, compelled many international corporations to reconsider their business relationships and practices within Russia.

Financial sector giants Visa and Mastercard severed their ties with the Russian market, subsequently making all Russian-issued Visa and Mastercard bank and credit cards useless; the British Petroleum Company liquidated its holdings in the Russian energy sector and ended its long-standing business relationships; McDonald’s and PepsiCo proceeded to end their operations in Russia; and Disney opted to halt film releases in the country.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-forces-firing-rockets-at-kharkiv-institute-a-dangerous-move-considering-there-s-a-nuclear-reactor-inside-the-building,2022-03-14
Russian troops enter Ukrainian capital; officials tell residents to stay indoors and 'prepare Molotov cocktails' to defend the city,"Russian troops moved into Ukraine's capital city, Kyiv, on Friday as officials urged residents to stay indoors and ""prepare Molotov cocktails"" to defend against the advancing enemy force, the New York Times reported.

What are the details?

Kyiv entered into a defensive phase on the second day of fighting since Russia's unprovoked invasion of its neighboring country. Air raid sirens continued to blare as Russian missiles pounded the city and residents took cover in subway stations and other makeshift shelters, Reuters reported.

Russia claimed to have captured an airport in Hostomel, just northwest of the capital, on Thursday, after fierce fighting. The airport will likely serve as a strategic staging post to launch attacks on the city.

In a tweet, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense indicated that a Russian ground presence had reached Obolon, a northern district of Kyiv. It is the closest the Russian military has been to Ukraine's capital thus far. In an attempt to stymie the advance, the Ukrainian government reportedly destroyed three bridges to the north of the capital.

The Ukrainian government has urged its residents on numerous occasions to stand fast against the encroaching enemy. In a pair of tweets on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared that he would ""give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country,"" adding, ""Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities.""

But at the same time, Ukraine is eager for an end to the bloody conflict, the likes of which Europe hasn't seen since World War II.

As its forces advanced, Russia surprisingly signaled it may be open to talks with the Ukrainian government, though the reported conditions are strict. The Kremlin said it would agree to send a delegation to Minsk for negotiations, but warned that any agreement would be based on ""demilitarization"" and neutral status for Ukraine — both of which have previously been red lines for Zelenskyy.

What else?

Ukraine reported that 137 citizens died and another 316 were wounded during the first day of fighting. Based on earlier reports, at least 40 of those who died were soldiers, while up to 10 were civilians.

Early Friday morning, Zelenskyy appeared to criticize Western nations for their military inaction.

""This morning, we are defending our country alone,"" the leader lamented in recorded remarks. ""Just like yesterday, the most powerful country in the world looked on from a distance. Russia was hit with sanctions yesterday, but these are not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil. Only through solidarity and determination can this be achieved.""

""Who is ready to fight with us?"" he asked. ""Honestly, I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO?""

""Today, I asked the 27 leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer,"" he continued.

President Biden on Thursday joined a host of NATO allies in announcing further sanctions against Russia for its military assault. But it remains unclear when, or even if, the economic penalties will force Russia to back down.

In response to pressing from reporters on the need for more urgent action, Biden insisted that the U.S. wait ""another month or so"" to see if the sanctions are ""working.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-official-apologizes-for-unjustified-invasion-of-ukraine-at-u-n-climate-meeting,2022-02-25
Rutgers U. admin caves to leftist mob just one day after condemning antisemitism: 'We sincerely apologize for the hurt that this message has caused',"Just one day after condemning acts of antisemitism in a lengthy letter to the campus community at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the two administrators who signed the initial letter caved to the leftist mob and actually apologized.

What are the details?

In their initial letter Wednesday, Rutgers-New Brunswick Chancellor Christopher J. Molloy and Provost Francine Conway told the campus community they were ""saddened by and greatly concerned about the sharp rise in hostile sentiments and anti-Semitic violence in the United States. Recent incidents of hate directed toward Jewish members of our community again remind us of what history has to teach us.""

They added that ""this recent resurgence of anti-Semitism demands that we again call out and denounce acts of hate and prejudice against members of the Jewish community and any other targeted and oppressed groups on our campus and in our community.""

Free Palestine protesters dance on Israeli Flag and Burn it in Midtown, Manhattan youtu.be

The letter also said that ""our Student Affairs Office is already working in close partnership with leaders of the Rutgers Jewish community, and meetings have been held with students to assess and respond to their needs. If you are aware of hate incidents on campuses or places that have been made unsafe due to expressed bigotry and other unacceptable and insensitive acts, please report them using the bias reporting system.""

Oops

As you might expect, the administrators' letter didn't sit too well with Palestinian-supporting leftists. In particular, Students for Justice in Palestine were none too pleased, saying the very next day on Instagram that they are ""deeply concerned"" about the statement from Molloy and Conway, which ""conveniently ignores the extent to which Palestinians have been brutalized by Israel's occupation and bombing of Gaza.""

Caving to the woke mob

Well, Molloy and Conway didn't waste much time — and just one day after their joint condemnation of antisemitism, the pair issued another letter to the campus community titled, ""An Apology.""

The pair wrote in the letter that their message sent the previous day ""fell short"" and that ""it is clear to us that the message failed to communicate support for our Palestinian community members. We sincerely apologize for the hurt that this message has caused.""

The rest of the short note reads:

Rutgers University-New Brunswick is a community that is enriched by our vibrant diversity. However, our diversity must be supported by equity, inclusion, antiracism, and the condemnation of all forms of bigotry and hatred, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. As we grow in our personal and institutional understanding, we will take the lesson learned here to heart, and pledge our commitment to doing better. We will work to regain your trust, and make sure that our communications going forward are much more sensitive and balanced.



Our goal of creating a beloved community will not be easy, and while we may make mistakes along the way; we hope we can all learn from them as we continue this vital work together.

Anything else?

The Anti-Defamation League on Thursday noted that it had seen a 75% spike in antisemitic attacks in America in the last two weeks amid fighting between Israel and Hamas:

Rutgers gender and Africana studies professor suggests Ma'Khia Bryant was shot because she was having a 'bad day' and 'not being perfect',"A Rutgers professor appeared on MSNBC's ""ReidOut"" talk show Thursday night, where she came to the overwhelming defense of Ma'Khia Bryant, a 16-year-old who was shot by a police officer as she was lunging with a knife at another girl.

A panel discussion about the Columbus, Ohio, shooting on ""ReidOut"" featured the Rev. Al Sharpton, psychologist Phillip Atiba Goff, and Brittney Cooper, who is a Rutgers University associate professor of gender and Africana studies.

""The argument for our movements has never been that black people have to be perfect in order for them to deserve dignity, for us to have good policing, for us to be viewed with humanity, for cops to take a breath before they literally get out of the car guns blazing,"" Cooper told host Joy Reid.

Cooper claimed that the prosecution of Derek Chauvin had to be ""impeccable"" to get a conviction against the former police officer, who was found guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd.

""And if that is the standard, then no black person is really, truly going to be safe if we cannot be having a bad day, if we cannot defend ourselves when we think we are going to get jumped, if we call the cops and they can't show up and tell who the victim is and who the perpetrators are and they can't use their training to adjudicate regular, old, everyday community conflict,"" Cooper said.



Coincidentally, Cooper lashed out last month at a police spokesperson who relayed a message from the Atlanta spa shooter who said in his own words that he was having a ""bad day."" Cooper attributed the ""bad day"" quote to the police spokesperson, but he was paraphrasing the murderer, as Reason reported.

""'Yesterday was a bad day for him.' There is no end to the capacity of law enforcement to empathize with murderous white terrorists,"" Cooper wrote on Twitter. ""WTF!""

Cooper then argued that girls like Bryant are misunderstood, and she was ""adultified.""



""What are we going to do about the way that we don't understand black girls as girls. Ma'Khia Bryant was a child like Tamir Rice was a child,"" Cooper said. ""And the way that she has been talked about as this, you know, because she was a big girl, right, and so people just see her as the aggressor.

""They don't see her humanity. They have adultified her,"" Cooper claimed. ""We turn black girls into grown women, before they even are able to vote and then, you know, and are unable to see them as children until I have watched folks across the political spectrum really defend this and say – and empathize with the officer, say that he didn't have any other set of choices.



""If you can't figure out how to de-escalate a 16-year-old even with a kitchen knife when you have a gun and you're a grown man, you shouldn't be a cop,"" Cooper ranted on the cable talk show.

Cooper has received notoriety for making controversial, and at times outrageous remarks. Last April, Cooper proclaimed that Trump supporters are to blame for COVID-19 deaths. In 2019, Cooper claimed that former President Donald Trump's policies and racism are responsible for overweight black women. In 2015, Cooper asserted that Jesus Christ was ""potentially queer.""

Ruth Bader Ginsburg blamed for potential overturn of Roe v. Wade: 'Who to blame ... could not be more obvious',"Former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg became the target of sharp criticism on Tuesday after a leaked Supreme Court opinion draft indicated that Roe v. Wade will be overturned.

Chief Justice John Roberts later confirmed that the draft, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, is authentic.

What are the details?

Ginsburg was repeatedly pressured to retire when Barack Obama was president, thereby ensuring a left-leaning justice would replace her. But she refused to cave to political pressures. She passed away in September 2020, which meant then-President Donald Trump named her replacement: Amy Coney Barrett.

Now, critics of the forthcoming Supreme Court decision possibly overturning abortion precedents are blaming Ginsburg for the development.

Paul Quirk, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia, told Newsweek that admirers of Ginsberg may have to reassess their admiration if Roe v. Wade is ultimately overturned.

""Who to blame, from a liberal or pro-choice perspective, could not be more obvious: The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"" Quirk said.

""As an octogenarian cancer survivor during President Obama's second term, she rejected suggestions in 2014 and 2015 that she should retire to allow Obama to appoint her successor,"" he added. ""Obama notably refrained from putting pressure on her to do so. That Ginsburg's failure to retire would lead to the overturning of Roe, among other disasters from her own standpoint, was not entirely foreseeable. It was, however, fairly likely. The overturning of Roe, and more to come from the current Court, may lead liberals to revisit the adulation that was showered upon Ginsburg at the time of her death.""

David Bateman, an associate professor of government at Cornell University, also told Newsweek the possibility of Roe v. Wade being overturned represents ""the failure of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to prepare for the consequences of her mortality.""

Ginsburg, although she supported abortion rights, was a notorious critic of the Roe v. Wade decision itself. She once described the decision as ""heavy-handed judicial intervention [that] was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked, not resolved, conflict.""

What did Ginsburg say about not retiring?

In a 2014 interview, Ginsburg responded to critics who lamented her refusal to step down while a Democrat sat in the White House.

""Anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they're misguided,"" she told Elle Magazine.

Ginsburg reiterated that sentiment one year before she passed.

""When that suggestion is made, I ask the question: Who do you think the president could nominate that could get through the Republican Senate? Who you would prefer on the court than me?"" she said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rutgers-apologizes-for-condemning-antisemitism,2022-05-04
"San Francisco archbishop slams COVID restrictions, says the state 'does not have authority' over the church","Church leaders in California continue to object to coronavirus restrictions that they say are unconstitutional infringements on Americans' right to worship.

Appearing on Fox News Wednesday, San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone accused the state of ""intruding"" its authority into church matters by ordering churches not to hold indoor worship services.

Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a new tiered plan to reintroduce coronavirus lockdowns in different regions of the state based on ICU capacity. Because the remaining ICU capacity in Southern California has fallen below 15%, a region-wide stay-at-home order went into effect Sunday, closing several personal care businesses and restricting public and private gatherings.

""We're still not allowed to have indoor services while indoor retail is allowed to operate,"" Cordileone said on ""America's Newsroom,"" noting that retail stores are permitted to be open at 20% capacity while church worship services are not permitted.

The archbishop argues that if retail and other ""essential services"" can remain open, churches that practice social distancing and proper sanitation should be allowed to hold worship services indoors as well.

""It's possible for people in these large department stores and retail outlets to spend an hour or two, even three hours inside whereas we can keep our religious services to an hour if necessary and make sure that people are safe,"" Cordileone explained.

""I accept the need for the state to give us guidance on safety, but we've shown we can do it, we should be allowed to do it,"" he added.

Conflicts between secular authorities implementing restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19 and religious leaders who feel their liberties are in jeopardy have escalated in recent months as the lockdowns have lasted far longer than the initial ""15 days to slow the spread"" promised last March.

On Tuesday, a church in Northern California was found to be in contempt of court and fined $55,000 for repeatedly defying a court order to stop holding unmasked indoor services. Mike McClure, the pastor of Calvary Chapel Fellowship in San Jose, told reporters, ""I respect the judge, I understand what the laws are, but there's a bigger law.""

Pastor John MacArthur of Grace Community Church in Southern California has been an outspoken advocate against coronavirus restrictions. In October, MacArthur released a video calling on churches nationwide to open in defiance of secular mandates and challenging the media, government, and scientific consensus on the severity of the coronavirus.

The United States Supreme Court has become involved in the dispute. Last Thursday, the high court refused to uphold Newsom's restrictions on worship, remanding the case back to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit with instructions to remand to the Central District of California court in light of the decision in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo. In that 5-4 Supreme Court decision, the Supreme Court ruled that New York could not enforce limits on attendance at churches and synagogues in coronavirus hot spots while permitting ""essential"" businesses to remain open. The court said such restrictions likely discriminate against religion in violation of the First Amendment.

Responding to that ruling on Dec. 3, Archbishop Cordileone issued a statement calling on California to ease restrictions on worship.

""Catholics and other responsible faith communities should not be lumped in with a few irresponsible bad actors. This is not done with anyone else, and it should not be done with people of faith,"" the statement said. ""Worship is not less important than shopping for shoes; it is certainly more important to people's spiritual and psychological health; it is a natural and Constitutional right, and we Catholics have shown for months that we can worship safely — with masks, social distancing, ventilation, and sanitation.""

""Let my people worship,"" Cordileone's statement concluded.

On Fox News, Cordileone expressed frustration with one set of rules for houses of worship and another set of rules for businesses favored by the government.

""It is very frustrating and it's very worrisome because one of the foundational principles of our country is the free exercise and non-establishment clauses of the First Amendment,"" Cordileone said. ""So the state does not have authority to intrude into matters of the church. The state cannot tell the church not to worship.""

""Again, I accept that the state can tell the church what we have to do to keep people safe, but it can't be so severe as to in effect ban public worship,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rutgers-professor-makhia-bryant-bad-day,2020-12-09
"San Francisco may change 'inappropriate' names of schools honoring Washington, Lincoln, and even Sen. Dianne Feinstein","Officials in San Francisco are pushing to rename several public schools in an attempt to purge school buildings of names deemed ""inappropriate"" like Presidents George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.

Even a school building named for Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is on a list of 44 sites that parents and educators have been told must be renamed for having connections to slavery, genocide, or oppression, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Of the 125 schools in the San Francisco district, more than a third have been added to the list for having objectionable names, including Balboa, Lowell and Mission high schools, Roosevelt and Presidio middle schools, and Webster, Sanchez and Jose Ortega elementary schools.

The San Francisco School Names Advisory Committee is requiring each school on the list to brainstorm new names by Dec. 18. The new names will be presented to the school board in late January or early February, at which time the board will vote on any recommended name changes.

The committee was called for in a 2018 resolution requiring a blue ribbon panel to study school names and submit recommendations for changes.

""The panel includes 12 community members appointed by the superintendent and approved by the school board, as well as district staff members and board President Mark Sanchez,"" the Chronicle reported. ""It was formed in January and has since met 10 times, with members doing their own research, looking at newspaper articles, among other resources to identify whether the name on a school met the criteria for renaming, which includes anyone or anything associated with slavery, genocide, colonization, exploitation and oppression, among other factors.""



The committee's specific criteria for a school name to be deemed ""inappropriate"" includes: Anyone directly involved in the colonization of people; slave owners or participants in enslavement; perpetrators of genocide or slavery; those who exploit workers/people; those who directly oppressed or abused women, children, queer or transgender people; those connected to any human rights or environmental abuses; those who are known racists and/or white supremacists and/or espoused racist beliefs.

Schools named for Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson made the list because they were slave owners. Abraham Lincoln High School must be renamed because the nation's 16th president, who issued the Emancipation Proclamation ending slavery in the South, also ordered the executions of 38 Dakota tribe Native Americans involved in a violent conflict with white settlers in Minnesota.



Dianne Feinstein Elementary, a school named for California's sitting senior senator, made the list because as mayor of San Francisco in 1986, Feinstein reportedly replaced a vandalized Confederate flag at City Hall.



According to the Chronicle, many parents and principals are not thrilled that renaming schools is a priority during a pandemic when many children are not even allowed to attend school and are tasked with virtual learning.



""Principals are devoting resources to this,"" parent Jonathan Alloy said. His children attend Commodore Sloat Elementary, a school named for the Navy officer who claimed California for the United States and one of the schools on the list. ""We're being presented with it as a fait accompli.""

The principal of Commodore Sloat told parents Wednesday that the school would need to come up with a new name because the committee said John D. Sloat was a colonizer who ""claimed/stole"" California from Mexico.



""We're not actually helping disadvantaged children by changing the name of the school they can't attend,"" Alloy said, characterizing the timing as absurd.

Last week, five high school alumni associations sent a letter to the school district criticizing the committee for neglecting to consult professional historians or diverse ethnic communities.

""We need an inclusive process that will allow all communities to be heard, use professional historians applying verifiable data, issue a written report why a school name might be changed, so the community can make a considered decision,"" the letter said.

The letter asked the board to ""suspend the current process until everyone can safely return to school sites for the robust and thoughtful conversations you directed in the original board resolution.""

The president of the school board, Mark Sanchez, acknowledged that some will be unhappy with the changes.

""I don't think there is ever going to be a time when people are ready for this,"" he said. ""Predictably people are going to be upset no matter when we do this.""

He added that it was unlikely all 44 schools would have their names changed, but noted that every school on the list ""should be prepared.""

"Sasse rips 'shameful' Biden speech, says bipartisan pleas for 'contingency plan' were ignored","Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) on Monday ripped President Joe Biden's speech to the nation on the situation in Afghanistan as ""shameful"" and a ""campaign speech,"" lambasting the president's administration for failing to come up with a plan to evacuate Afghani allies and American citizens before the Taliban seized control of the country.

Sasse, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN in an interview that Biden failed to explain to the American people what the plan is to evacuate the tens of thousands of Afghani interpreters and other civilians who aided U.S. forces for decades during the conflict with the Taliban.

""The fact that he ran on withdrawal isn't the point. What the American people needed to hear today is that he has a plan for the ongoing national security crisis that's happening at the Kabul airport. It involves Americans, but it also involves a lot of people who fought alongside Americans so that we wouldn't have another 9/11 on our soil,"" Sasse said.

The Taliban stunned Biden administration officials over the weekend by seizing control of Afghanistan's capital city, Kabul, prompting thousands of civilians to rush to the city's international airport in an attempt to flee the country. Chaos erupted at the airport as Afghans crowded the tarmac, some clinging to departing U.S. C-17 cargo jets and then falling to their deaths after the planes took off.



In the latest development at the airport, as many as 600 members of Afghan security forces are helping U.S. troops provide security for evacuation efforts, the Pentagon said Tuesday.

At a news briefing, U.S. Army Major General William Taylor said Tuesday there will be more than 4,000 U.S. troops at the airport by the end of the day and that there have not been any ""hostile interactions"" with the Taliban.

The current plan is to have one flight taking off from the airport every hour.

In his speech, Biden argued that Afghan leaders had proven unwilling or incapable of continuing the fight against the Taliban. The president said that his national security team was ""clear-eyed about the risks"" of withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan and that continued U.S. presence in the country wouldn't have made a difference if Afghans could not fight their own civil war.

""American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves,"" Biden declared.



But just one month ago on July 8, the president assured the American people, ""The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely."" In April, after announcing that U.S. troops would withdraw, Biden said that Afghan security forces would ""continue to fight valiantly ... at great cost.""

Sasse said that Republican and Democratic lawmakers for months had been ""screaming at Biden Administration officials"" for details on the withdrawal plan.

""They have told us that they were sure that everything would be fine through the pause and fighting season over the winter, and if the Taliban ever mounted some significant offensive that moved toward Kabul, it wouldn't happen until next spring. And we repeatedly — again, I mean we, Republicans and Democrats — raised voices at Biden Administration officials, saying, 'Why are you so sure of this, and what is your contingency plan?' And they would sort of murmur and say, 'Well, we don't want to embarrass the President. So, we don't want to go into great detail. But clearly, you're being too pessimistic, but of course we have a contingency plan,'"" Sasse said.

""They didn't have a contingency plan, and the reason so many of the Afghan security forces melted is because the Biden Administration messaged over and over again this nonsense about a negotiation with the Taliban, off in some Belgian restaurant somewhere, and they messaged repeatedly that they were not going to support our allies in the moment of crisis,"" he continued.

Sasse criticized Biden for blaming the previous administration and the Afghan people for handing him this situation.

""There's a lot of blame that this administration puts on the last one because they began negotiating with the Taliban. I get that. But today what the president did is he pivoted and started attacking Afghans, including moms and dads who were at the edge of that airport with their kids. Why are they there? Why did they come to that airport? Because our troops promised them that the U.S. would never just turn tail and cowardly have another Saigon-like event,"" Sasse said.

""This is worse than Saigon. What is happening at the Karzai International Airport today is a more shameful, lower moment in U.S. history than 1975 in Saigon, and Biden comes out of his bunker, he comes back from Camp David trying to do a campaign photo-op speech, and he attacks the Afghan people, who are at the edge of that airport because we promised them security. They fought with us, and we said that they would be secure, and his Administration undermined the confidence of those people fighting, and they didn't believe they were going to have air support, and then we bizarrely in one of the great blunders in military history evacuated Bagram Air Force Base in the night. Why? Why would we have evacuated Bagram Air Force Base?

Saudi Arabia carries out largest mass execution in its history as rights groups issue condemnation,"Saudi Arabia on Saturday carried out the largest mass execution in its history, ending the lives of 81 people in one day for crimes ranging from murder to membership in militant groups, the Associated Press reported.

The massive figure surpassed the previous high of 63 carried out in January 1980 when the kingdom executed militants convicted of seizing the Grand Mosque in Mecca.

It was not immediately clear why the kingdom, which has in recent years has vowed to overhaul its archaic justice system, put the individuals to death in such a fashion.

In a statement published by the official Saudi Press Agency, the Saudi Ministry of Interior said the executed individuals ""were convicted of various crimes including murdering innocent men, women, and children."" It did not say how the individuals were executed.

""Crimes committed by these individuals also include pledging allegiance to foreign terrorist organizations, such as ISIS, Al Qaeda, and the Houthis, targeting residents in the Kingdom and traveling to regional conflict zones to join terrorist organizations,"" the statement continued. ""They also include convictions for targeting government personnel and vital economic sites, the killing of law enforcement officers and maiming their bodies, and planting land mines to target police vehicles. Moreover, the convictions include crimes of kidnapping, torture, rape, smuggling arms and bombs into the Kingdom.""

The ministry said the executed individuals were arrested and tried in courts through trials overseen by judges and were afforded the full rights guaranteed under Saudi law.

But ultimately, the courts found the accused guilty of ""committing multiple heinous crimes that left a large number of civilians and law enforcement officers dead,"" according to the ministry.

The New York Times reported that those put to death were predominantly Saudi but included seven Yemenis and one Syrian.

The paper added that rights groups around the world quickly condemned the executions, arguing they were contrary to progressive claims made in recent years by the kingdom's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

""These executions are the opposite of justice,"" Ali Adubusi, the director of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights, a watchdog group, reportedly said. He added that in many of the cases, the charges involved ""not a drop of blood.""

Adubusi’s rights group went on to tell the Times that many of the charges filed did not merit the death penalty under criteria the Saudi Arabian government has put forward, noting that some were related to participation in human rights demonstrations.

Other rights groups reportedly claimed that the executions included people from Saudi Arabia’s Shiite Muslim minority, a frequent target of the government.

""The world should know by now that when Mohammed bin Salman promises reform, bloodshed is bound to follow,"" said Soraya Bauwens, the deputy director of Reprieve, a London-based advocacy group, the AP noted.

In its statement, the ministry declared, ""The Kingdom will continue to take a strict and unwavering stance against terrorism and extremist ideologies that threaten the stability of the entire world.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/san-francisco-change-school-names,2022-03-14
School district paints over student's Trump-themed parking spot. Judge says that violates free speech.,"Ned Thomas finally got to paint his assigned parking space at Pine Junior-Senior High School in Franklinton, Louisiana, this year — a privilege granted to seniors for a $25 fee, NOLA.com reported.

Thomas' visual theme? A commissioned portrait of President Donald Trump wearing a stars-and-stripes headband and sunglasses.

But while the principal gave the painting his stamp of approval, Washington Parish School System officials deemed the image too political — and promptly blotted it out with gray paint, NOLA said.

However, that isn't the end of the story.

A federal judge on Friday ordered school district Superintendent Frances Varnado and the school board to let the Trump portrait be repainted in the parking space, saying that blotting it out was a violation of Thomas' free-speech rights, the outlet noted.

What are the details?

U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon — an appointee of former President Bill Clinton — ruled the Trump portrait is ""pure political speech"" and cannot be censored by the district, NOLA reported.



""The painting of President Trump cannot reasonably be described as obscene or plainly offensive on its face, nor can it be construed as school-sponsored speech,"" Fallon wrote, according to the outlet.

The judge also ruled that the district — in order to remove the image — would have to demonstrate that the Trump portrait is ""materially disruptive,"" NOLA noted.

But Fallon said Trump's face doesn't qualify.

""This is not a case involving a symbol such as a Confederate flag, which has an established meaning as a 'symbol of racism and intolerance, regardless of whatever other meanings may be associated with it,'"" Fallon said, according to the outlet, adding that ""ultimately, it is clear that school officials in this case acted based upon 'an urgent wish to avoid controversy which might result from the expression.'""

What was the school district's position?

Varnado cited the campaign season's divisive politics as the reason for painting over the Trump portrait, NOLA said, adding that the superintendent was ""concerned that the painting would cause further division and disruption among students — similar to that experienced within the school, parish, community and on social media.""

More from the outlet:

A risk of vandalism, property damage and fights came up. ""Defendants also referenced a number of conflicts on social media over the summer, in which students who were typically friends were fighting against one another about race and politics,"" Fallon wrote. And they cited the murder of ""a Black student perpetrated by a White individual during the previous school year that caused significant controversy in the community.""



Varnado said her decision was meant to avoid controversy, not stir it up. But a barrage of livid e-mails followed, along with a federal lawsuit last month from Thomas's parents seeking an injunction. Their attorney, Yigal Bander of Baton Rouge, asserted the policy-required school approval came in late July, and that the senior paid a friend $200 to lay Trump's face down in paint.



The portrait was ready for public viewing on Aug. 6. Eight days later, the principal told him the School Board had ordered it painted over.

But Fallon ruled that ""the burden on plaintiffs' First Amendment right to free speech and expression outweighs the school's burden of dealing with controversy related to the painting,"" NOLA reported.

Now what?

Thomas told the outlet the college student friend he hired to paint the Trump portrait will be back to repaint it.

It isn't clear from the NOLA report whether the district is paying for the repainting job.

Texas school district survey tells 3rd- to 11th-grade students that 'gender is how a person feels',"One of Texas' largest school districts told third- through 11th-grade students in a recent survey, ""Sex is what a person is born. Gender is how a person feels.""

The statement was part of Austin Independent School District's 2018-2019 Student Climate Survey administered to students this year, the Federalist reported. Following the statement, students were asked to indicate how they felt about their identities.



The answer options included: ""I am a girl/woman,"" ""I am a boy/man,"" and ""I identify in some other way."" Additional space was provided for students to ""describe how they identify,"" but it was optional.

Austin ISD is the fifth largest school district in the state with more than 83,000 children enrolled. The Federalist estimated that 57,000 children took the survey this year, assuming the number of an even division of students across the grade levels.

The district claims that the questionnaire helps it ""examine factors contributing to student success beyond test scores,"" a spokeswoman told the Federalist in an email.

Parents often have no idea what questions are asked on ""school climate surveys"" until after their children take the evaluation. At the beginning of each school year, parents sign multiple forms allowing the district to administer such surveys.

Does this happen in other districts or states?

Surveys such as the one used by AISD are part of the Obama administration's 2015 Every Student Succeeds Act, which updated the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002.

The updated act included allowing states to evaluate children on non-academic behaviors and feelings known as ""socioemotional learning."" The surveys are considered to be part of an accountability tool called the ""fifth indicator"" in the ESSA.

In 2017, non-academic questions were added to the National Assessment of Educational Progress or more commonly known as the Nation's Report Card.

Some special interests groups, including the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning organization, have used the ESSA to push districts into expanding this type of questionnaire. CASEL leads multiple initiatives and produces high-quality resources to advance and implement SEL practices and policies, according to its website.

What do critics say?

Some critics believe the surveys are a way to impose transgender ideology onto students.

""Both the content and process of CASEL are statist in nature ... think of it as Groupthink 10.0: We're the government and we're here to help. The net effect is to build a collective mindset,"" Stella Morabito, a Federalist senior contributor, said last year at a presentation before the Family Research Council, the Christian Post reported.

Morabito worked in intelligence for about 10 years and is an expert in propaganda.

""Power elites have always utilized propaganda through psychological manipulation to coerce the masses to bend to an agenda, and over time false premises, like the notion that 'sex is assigned at birth,' slowly make their way into law, she explained,"" she said.

Self-reported assessments are also highly unreliable, according to experts.

Pediatrician and education researcher Karen Effrem told the Federalist that research suggests that simply asking children about specific behaviors can create problems.

""Whether it's comprehensive sex education or a survey, if you're bringing stuff like that [sexuality] up you are potentially creating upset or conflict or just planting the idea,"" she said.

Woke Scientific American says Jedi in Star Wars problematic,"Scientific American is a science magazine founded in 1845 that has published articles by more than 200 Nobel Prize winners. The magazine has featured brilliant minds such as Hans Bethe, James D. Watson, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Linus Pauling, and Albert Einstein. However, now one of the science magazine's goals is ""advancing social justice,"" which was evident in a recent article attempting to cancel the Jedi in ""Star Wars"" for being ""problematic.""

It took a total of five Scientific American writers to spew out a 2,060-word article titled: ""Why the Term 'JEDI' Is Problematic for Describing Programs That Promote Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion."" The opinion piece oozed out an exhausting laundry list as to why the Jedi are ""inappropriate symbols for justice work."" The wokescold composition explained why Jedis — the mythical knightly order in the fictional movie ""Star Wars"" — should not be compared to the acronym ""JEDI,"" which stands for ""justice, equity, diversity and inclusion.""

The article listed all of the ways that the members of the fabled Jedi order are problematic, including white saviors, toxic masculinity, and even the phallic-shaped lightsabers (which are also used by the enemy Sith).

They are a religious order of intergalactic police-monks, prone to (white) saviorism and toxically masculine approaches to conflict resolution (violent duels with phallic lightsabers, gaslighting by means of ""Jedi mind tricks,"" etc.). The Jedi are also an exclusionary cult, membership to which is partly predicated on the possession of heightened psychic and physical abilities (or ""Force-sensitivity""). Strikingly, Force-wielding talents are narratively explained in Star Wars not merely in spiritual terms but also in ableist and eugenic ones: These supernatural powers are naturalized as biological, hereditary attributes. So it is that Force potential is framed as a dynastic property of noble bloodlines (for example, theSkywalker dynasty), and Force disparities are rendered innate physical properties, measurable via ""midi-chlorian"" counts (not unlike a ""Force genetics"" test) and augmentable via human(oid) engineering. The heroic Jedi are thus emblems for a host of dangerously reactionary values and assumptions. Sending the message that justice work is akin to cosplay is bad enough; dressing up our initiatives in the symbolic garb of the Jedi is worse.

The social justice overreaction over the beloved space opera then attacked the ""Star Wars"" franchise for ""trafficking in injustices such as sexism, racism and ableism.""

""'Star Wars' arguably conflates 'alienness' with 'nonwhiteness,' often seeming to rely on racist stereotypes when depicting nonhuman species,"" the post said.

Even Darth Vader's heavy breathing is allegedly a problem, ""The series regularly defaults onto ableist tropes, memorably in its portrayal of Darth Vader, which links the villain's physical disability with machinic inhumanity and moral deviance, presenting his technology-assisted breathing as a sinister auditory marker of danger and doom.""

""What's more, the bodies and voices centered in Star Wars have, with few exceptions, historically been those of white men,"" the article stated.

But even when the science-fiction franchise became more inclusive, it wasn't enough. ""And while recent films have increased gender and racial diversity, important questions remain regarding how meaningfully such changes represent a departure from the series' problematic past,"" the writers alleged.

""Those unfamiliar or uncomfortable with Star Wars­­—including those hurt by the messages it sends—may feel alienated by the parade of jokes, puns and references surrounding the term JEDI,"" the article said.

Even saying the word ""Jedi"" is apparently an issue because it provides Disney ""with a form of free advertising, commodifying and cheapening our justice work in the process."" The SJW authors then trashed Disney for a ""long and troubling history of circulating racist, sexist, heterosexist and Orientalist narratives and imagery.""

Many people on the internet blasted the article quicker than Han Solo could shoot Greedo with his DL-44 at the Mos Eisley cantina. Numerous Twitter users deemed the article to be more worthless than bantha fodder.

Three scientists ousted from top US cancer research center over concerns they provided confidential information to China,"MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston has ousted three scientists over concerns that the researchers had connections to China's attempts to steal U.S. intellectual property.

The move followed emails from the National Institutes of Health last year that pointed to conflicts of interest or unreported foreign income by five professors, the Houston Chronicle reported. The center was given 30 days to respond to the investigation, which was assisted by the FBI.

""As stewards of taxpayer dollars invested in biomedical research, we have an obligation to follow up,"" Peter Pisters, president of MD Anderson Cancer Center, told the newspaper. ""This is part of a much larger issue the country is facing — trying to balance an open collaborative environment and at the same time protect proprietary information and commercial interests.""

If MD Anderson didn't take action, the NIH could have withheld the center's grant funding. The center received $148 million in NIH grants last year.

MD Anderson is ranked as the No. 1 cancer center in the world.

What's the story?

The center began the termination process for three of the five professors suspected of espionage. Two resigned before the proceedings began, and one has just started the process.

Officials found that firing one of the professors wasn't necessary. A fifth professor remains under investigation.

The terminations come amid the federal government's heightened concern around foreign governments' attempts to capitalize on U.S.-funded research to use students and visiting scholars to steal confidential information from grant applications. The intellectual property is used to operate ""shadow laboratories"" in their home countries.

All five professors were of Asian descent, according to the Houston Chronicle, and at least three are Chinese.

Three of the five were believed to be involved with China's Thousand Talents program, which Pisters described as ""predatory."" The U.S. government, including the NIH, believes the program is the main source for handing over U.S. intellectual property to China.

While MD Anderson policy allows participation in the program, it requires disclosure of all foreign sources of research. None of the researchers had disclosed any involvement.

When did the cancer center first learn of a possible breach?

The FBI first requested the cancer center's assistance in a ""national security investigation"" in November 2015 that it described as ""pursuant to an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation.""

It wasn't until August 2018 that the NIH revealed the name of a specific researcher who had violated several NIH policies, according to the report. Among the NIH violations disclosed was confidentiality of peer review, failure to disclose other research resources, and possibly failing to disclose a financial conflict of interest.

Four more letters were sent to MD Anderson requesting further information about ""serious violations"" by professors. Max Weber, MD Anderson's compliance and ethics officer, responded to the NIH's request. He provided detailed information that showed the accused researchers had corresponded with people in China who held positions at institutions there.

Weber showed examples of the professors sharing confidential grant information with unauthorized third parties, along with undisclosed payments from Chinese institutions and the leadership of a shadow laboratory in China.

According to the report, Weber didn't disclose evidence that MD Anderson proprietary data was transferred to China or other countries.

Will the researchers be charged with a crime?

It's unknown whether the scientists will face federal charges or deportation.

FBI spokeswoman Christina Garza told the newspaper that the agency ""does not confirm or deny the existence of any investigation.""

What else?

In 2017, the FBI reported that theft of intellectual property by China costs the U.S. up to $600 billion each year.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/school-district-tells-kids-gender-is-about-feeling,2019-04-22
Seattle autonomous zone dissolves after several nights of shootings: 'CHOP project is now concluded',"The protest zone in Seattle that has been occupied by anti-police protesters for the past two weeks has mostly dissolved after several nights of shootings and calls from the mayor to end the protest, Fox News reported.

Leaders of the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, formerly known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, urged participants to continue their cause online.

""This morning's census finds fewer than two dozen clustered near the East Precinct,"" a statement from the CHOP Twitter account said. ""Eleven additional people are at the Space Needle. Last night's BLM march had 71 participants, a number we expect to continue to drop. It is time we shift to the next phase of our organizing and move from direct action to virtual activism.""

Image source: Twitter screenshot

The statement called for supporters to vote for Joe Biden for president and to support re-election efforts of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan (D).



The CHOP was established after a week of protests following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. After conflict between protesters and police officers, the Seattle Police Department abandoned its East Precinct and allowed protesters to occupy nine blocks of the city without opposition.

The CHOP was mostly a peaceful demonstration, but in recent nights a string of shootings, including one that killed a black teenager, disrupted the protests and caused some community leaders to pull their support for the protest. Even Durkan, who had publicly supported the protests, called for it to disperse after four shootings in three nights.

""Our community does not support the violence,"" Andre Taylor, an activist who works to reduce police violence, said, according to KOMO-TV. ""'Oh, somebody just got shot but CHOP, CHOP, CHOP? Wait a minute, but you're just going to look over this black man that got killed over here? This young baby; this 19-year-old? No. No. You're going to pause and you're going to think about this black man because that's the reason you did it for.""

"Seattle bankrolls 'Street Czar,' BLM activist at $150k to help city consider 'alternatives to policing'","The city of Seattle has hired a Black Lives Matter activist and convicted ex-pimp to be its ""Street Czar,"" paying him $12,500 a month for a year to come up with ""alternatives to policing.""

What are the details?

Andrè Taylor was once sentenced to more than five years in prison for illegally working as an escort hustler in Las Vegas (he ended up only serving one year) and was featured in the 2000 documentary, ""American Pimp."" He also came to Seattle in 2016 vowing to ""go to war"" after his brother, Che Taylor, was killed by police.

Now Taylor and his organization, Not This Time, have been bankrolled by the city at $150,000 over the next 12 months to provide ""community de-escalation services.""

“When you come at the king, you best not miss!"" youtu.be

The contract, published for the first time this week by news website PubliCola, provides Taylor's organization office space in the city's Municipal Tower and requests Taylor's help ""provid[ing] recommendations to the City on de-escalation, community engagement, and alternatives to policing.""



Under the agreement, which was reportedly Taylor's idea, Not This Time will also work toward the ""urgent de-escalation of conflict and violence between the police and the community assembling in the Capitol Hill neighborhood.""

The Seattle Times noted that the contract came just one year after Not This Time was paid $100,000 by the city to host a speaker series called ""Conversations with the Streets.""

What else?

According to the Seattle Times, Taylor's public presence during protests and riots in Seattle has evolved considerably over the last several months. He reportedly led one of the very first rallies in Seattle in the immediate aftermath of the police-involved death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, and appeared at a news conference beside Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan (D) on the same day.

Later, while publicly disavowing the Capitol Hill Organized Protest, he attempted to broker a deal between CHOP protesters and the mayor, insisting that the protesters demand money in return for leaving the area.

""Don't just leave. Leave with something,"" he told a small group of protesters in a recorded conversation. ""Let me make that happen for you, and then I can bring that back to you. I don't know, we'll ask for $2 million. They might give us $1 million, but let's ask for it.""

The paper reported that the activists eventually rejected his advice, one saying that the money grab felt ""off.""

Taylor then reportedly drew ire from CHOP protesters when he appeared at a news conference with the mayor on June 22 telling them to shut down CHOP — the same day he was offered a six-figure contract by the city.

Anything else?

Kelsey Nyland, a spokesperson for Durkan, said, ""the City sought a contract with Not This Time because of our existing working partnership ... but also because of the organization's lived experience with the criminal legal system, and their history of successful advocacy and activism on issues of policing and dismantling systemic racism.""

Nyland added that the city is spending millions this year on similar contracts with various other groups.

""Not too many people can go talk to gangbangers in their territory, and then go talk to the government in their territory,"" Taylor said of the contract.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scientists-ousted-from-cancer-research-center-over-espionage,2020-09-23
"Seattle City Council ​bans police use of chokeholds, tear gas, and pepper spray","The Seattle City Council voted Monday night to ban the police use of chokeholds, tear gas, and pepper spray as the city deals with continued protests, including a six-block area of the city that has been taken over by protesters demanding the abolition of the city's police department, KING-TV reported.

The legislation bans the crowd control methods as unlawful uses of force that open the city up to legal liability in the event those methods are used.

""It has been historically known through the evidence and other research that the use of CS gas, otherwise known as tear gas, can often be a less lethal way of dispersing a crowd without having to go hands on, without using our riot batons,"" Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said. ""So it has been determined to be less dangerous to do that. That said, it has been very clear to us that people are not wanting us to use the CS.""

Some residents complained during the meeting that tear gas used to disperse protests last week forced them to leave their homes, even though they were not participating in the protests.

Demonstrations sparked by the killing of George Floyd by a former Minneapolis Police Department officer resulted in conflicts between police and protesters. Protesters reportedly threw objects, including ""incendiary devices,"" at officers, and police used tear gas to break up the protests on June 8.

Now, the same neighborhood where tear gas was used has been occupied by protesters who created the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (now referred to as the Capitol Hill Organized Protest). The zone includes six blocks surrounding Seattle police's East Precinct, which the department abandoned. Protesters want the police department abolished and have demanded a series of reforms related to racial equity.

With Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan apparently content to allow the ongoing protest to continue, it's unclear how or when the city will regain control of the area and the police precinct and city property.

""Seattle is fine. Don't be so afraid of democracy,"" Durkan wrote on Twitter in response to criticism from President Donald Trump.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/seattle-autonomous-zone-dissolves-shootings,2020-06-16
"Second worst outbreak of Ebola in history hits the Congo; more than 1,000 infected","The Democratic Republic of the Congo has been hit by the second worst outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in recorded history. More than 1,000 people have been confirmed to have been infected, and hundreds have already died from it.

Here's what we know

Since the start of the outbreak, 610 people have died, according to the World Health Organization — 62 percent of the total number infected. In the past week alone, there were 58 reported cases of the virus.

Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization's assistant director general for emergencies, told The Hill that ""[a] lot of patients are arriving quite sick. Five, six, 10 days after infection. It's also bad for their families, it's also bad for their communities, because they're transmitting the disease before they are isolated.""

The deadlier outbreak occurred in 2014, when 11,000 people in West Africa died from Ebola. At this point, the outbreak seems contained to two northern provinces of the country: Kivu and Ituri.

Even before the outbreak, Kivu was the site of increasing conflict. The situation there is so unstable, according to The Hill, that the State Department has banned U.S. government aid workers from traveling to the area to help treat Ebola patients.

These precautions do not seem to have been without merit. In February, Ebola treatment facilities were attacked by angry mobs. The threat of violence was severe enough that Doctors Without Borders decided to recall its people from the region.

What else?

All of these factors have made it more difficult for the health workers who are still in the area to effectively treat the disease. But, thankfully, they're still trying.

According to the World Health Organization, despite the obstacles, ""over 90% of people eligible for vaccination have accepted to do so, and over 90% of these individuals having participated in follow-up visits. To date, 89,855 people have been vaccinated.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/seattle-bankrolls-ex-pimp-street-czar,2019-03-25
"Sen. Rand Paul calls for ban on Congress obtaining phone records of journalists, members","Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) told reporters Monday he's taking a look at committee rule changes to restrict Congress from obtaining the phone data of lawmakers and members of the press, after House Democrats published call records purportedly linked to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and investigative journalist John Solomon.

What are the details?

Sen. Paul is reacting to the House Intelligence Committee led by Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) publicizing the call and text records of Nunes and Solomon along with the personal phone data from President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, as part of Democrats' impeachment probe against the president.

Schiff has not explained why or how he obtained the records.

""Congress has no rules...it's not illegal for Adam Schiff to do this,"" Paul told reporters, according to Politico. ""It's highly immoral or unfair for him to do it. No one else has ever done it to another member or a journalist. I think we need to change the rules.""

The Kentucky Republican said he's looking at placing restrictions on Congress through the revision of committee rules, adding, ""Nobody should get your phone records. This is a big deal, this is a huge deal.""

Sen. Paul also took issue with the lack of outrage from the press over Solomon's phone records being obtained by Schiff, telling the reporters, ""There hasn't been enough calls from some of you people about protecting your own.""

Solomon's work is repeatedly cited in impeachment probe documentation, and he has faced attacks and been accused of peddling Russian propaganda for his extensive investigative work exposing ""an appearance of a conflict of interest on the part of former Vice President Joe Biden,"" The Epoch Times reported.

Anything else?

According to Nunes, his own call records do not match up with what Schiff's committee published in its report. The California Republican told Fox News he plans to take legal action over the violation of his civil liberties.

""We're definitely taking legal action,"" Nunes said. ""We need to get to court to try to stop that from happening again.""

"Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson blocks new $1,200 stimulus checks, argues for more 'targeted' coronavirus relief","Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) on Friday blocked an effort by Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to pass a new round of $1,200 stimulus checks to Americans, arguing for more ""targeted"" relief to help Americans struggling during the coronavirus pandemic.

Hawley and Sanders had asked for the unanimous consent of the Senate to pass a bill providing another one-time payment of $1,200 to individuals earning less than $75,000, using the CARES Act stimulus bill Congress passed in March as a model for their legislation. Johnson supported that effort in March, but now says Congress cannot ignore the growing national debt and should work harder to ensure stimulus money has its intended effect.

Acknowledging the need for Congress to provide financial support to businesses and families in need ""through no fault of their own,"" Johnson criticized the ""shogun approach"" of the proposed relief package and called for more ""targeted"" relief.

""One of the reasons we are $27.4 trillion in debt is we only speak about need, we only talk in terms of compassion — we all have compassion, we all want to fulfill those needs — we don't talk in numbers very often. We don't analyze the data. We don't take a look at what we did in the past and see, did it work? Or didn't it work?"" Johnson said on the Senate floor.

""We will not have learned the lessons from our very hurried, very rushed, very massive, earlier relief packages. We're just going to do more of the same, another trillion dollars. It takes our debt from $27.4 trillion to $28.4 trillion in a couple months. With doing virtually no revisions, no improvements,"" he warned.

The current stimulus package being considered by the Senate would cost about $900 billion, Axios reported. Johnson raised concerns about how Congress is ""mortgaging our children's future.""

He noted that the last round of ""economic impact payments"" to Americans cost about $275 billion and sent checks to 115 million households at a time when 25 million people were unemployed.

""That was about 4.5 [times] more households than the number of jobs lost,"" Johnson said, going on to explain that the Hawley-Sanders bill would provide payments to a number of households 12.6 times greater than the 9 million Americans currently unemployed.

""I think it's important to ask, well, how was that money spent? Was it really spent on essentials? Was this money really needed? Was there any hope of actually that money being stimulative to our economy?"" Johnson asked.



He cited a study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued on Oct. 13, 2020, that surveyed American households and found that only 18% of the stimulus check funds was spent on essential items, 8% was spent on nonessential items, and 3% was donated for a total of 29%, which the study called the ""marginal propensity to consume.""

Most households, Johnson said, either saved the stimulus money or used it to pay off debt. The survey also asked respondents what they would do with another $1,500 check and only about 24% would spend or donate the money while the remaining 76% would use the funds for savings or debt repayment.

""I don't think you can take a look at these direct payments to individuals as stimulative,"" Johnson argued. ""Obviously, 18%-24% is spent on essential items. We ought to figure out how to provide that money so people can spend it on essentials.""

After Johnson concluded speaking, Hawley rose to respond, saying, ""Nothing could be more targeted, no relief could be more important than relief for working people.""

""What I'm proposing is what every senator has supported already,"" Hawley continued. ""What I'm proposing will give working folks in my state and across the country a shot … at getting back up on their feet.""

This debate over direct stimulus payments is occurring under the backdrop of a potential government shutdown that will happen if Congress does not pass new spending legislation before midnight. Democrats and Republicans are negotiating on a continuing resolution to keep the government open, with the central conflict between the parties being what additional coronavirus relief should look like. One compromise currently under consideration is smaller $600 direct payments, half of what Hawley and Sanders have proposed, in addition to small business funding and an extended $300 federal unemployment benefit.

The Daily Caller reported that after Hawley finished speaking, he walked out of the Senate chamber and told reporters he would not allow a government funding bill to pass until he's assured there are direct payments to Americans included.

""I'm not going to allow a [continuing resolution] to go through until I know what's actually in the package,"" Hawley said. ""It'd better include direct assistance at a substantial level.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/second-worst-outbreak-of-ebola-in-history-hits-the-congo-more-than-1-000-infected,2020-12-18
Senate confirms Trump judge despite Dem concerns about his membership in Catholic org,"In a 51-40 party-line vote Wednesday afternoon, the Senate voted to confirm Brian Buescher as a federal district judge for the district of Nebraska after he faced scrutiny from Judiciary Committee Democrats late last year for his membership in a Catholic fraternal organization.

Buescher found himself at the middle of a national debate about religious intolerance late last year after he was questioned by Democratic Sens. Mazie Hirono (Hawaii) and Kamala Harris (Calif.) about his involvement with the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization dedicated to the principles of charity, unity, fraternity and patriotism.

""The Knights of Columbus has taken a number of extreme positions,"" Hirono said in December noting the group's adherence to Catholic teaching on same-sex marriage. ""If confirmed, do you intend to end your membership with this organization to avoid any appearance of bias?""

Before the vote, Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska took to the Senate floor to defend Buescher and urge colleagues to vote in favor of confirmation.

""Brian's confirmation process has been the occasion for one of the most baffling displays of constitutional confusion and prejudice I've seen in my time here,"" Sasse told the chamber.

""Brian is a Catholic, and he is a member of the Knights of Columbus, the largest Catholic fraternal service organization in the world,"" Sasse pointed out. ""This is not a scandal.

""But according to some of my Senate Judiciary colleagues,"" Sasse continued, ""the Knights of Columbus is an extremist outfit. One of my colleagues suggested that Brian needs to resign his membership in the Knights if he were confirmed to the Federal bench to 'avoid the appearance of conflict and bias.' Really bizarre stuff.""



Sasse also called the questions about Buescher's membership in the organization ""plain, unadulterated anti-Catholic bigotry.""

Buescher is not the only judicial nominee to be questioned about his involvement in the Knights of Columbus. Sasse also came to the defense of then-nominee Peter Phipps after he was asked similar questions during his confirmation last month. Phipps was confirmed by a 56-40 vote earlier this month.

Full video of Sasse's speech is available below:

"Senate report levels serious allegations against Hunter Biden over Burisma 'corruption': Chinese money, payments to women linked to trafficking, millions from wife of ex-Moscow mayor","The Senate Republican majority of the Homeland Security Committee and the Finance Committee released a joint report Wednesday revealing powerful allegations against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden.

The investigation of the younger Biden's actions connected to his time on the board of Burisma in Ukraine, which he joined in May 2014, uncovered damning new details of possible corruption, hindering of U.S. foreign policy, and assisting Moscow's effort to spread disinformation.

The report's ""key findings"" list a number of concerning areas when it comes to Biden and his international work and potential conflicts of interest.

KEY FINDING 1: ""In early 2015 the former Acting Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, George Kent, raised concerns to officials in Vice President Joe Biden's office about the perception of a conflict of interest with respect to Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board. Kent's concerns went unaddressed, and in September 2016, he emphasized in an email to his colleagues, 'Furthermore, the presence of Hunter Biden on the Burisma board was very awkward for all U.S. officials pushing an anticorruption agenda in Ukraine.'""

The report states that Kent raised concerns to Vice President Biden's staff, but that he never heard anything back from Biden's office. Kent also recommended that Hunter Biden step down from his role on the board at Burisma in order ""to avoid the perception of a potential conflict of interest."" However, none of his recommendations were followed.

According to the committees, Hunter Biden's continued presence on the Burisma board the President Barack Obama's State Department repeatedly felt it had to ""manage"" when attempting to implement and execute the White House's Ukraine policy.

More than a year after Kent reported his concerns to the vice president's staff, he wrote to his superiors that Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board was “very awkward"" to those on the front lines pushing anticorruption efforts in Ukraine on a daily basis. Kent testified that he felt the need to “prepar[e] everybody for 'what about-ism,' because we're pushing what's right … and we have to be prepared for people who are critics, are opponents, to say, 'Well, what about? What about Hunter Biden?''"" Indeed, Kent testified further that he “would have advised any American not to get on the board of [Burisma owner Mykola] Zlochevsky's company.""

Kent also raised concerns to State Department higher-ups, making clear that it was ""very awkward"" for Bidens to be on the Burisma board while U.S. officials were trying to implement an anti-corruption agenda for Ukraine.

KEY FINDING 2: ""In October 2015, senior State Department official Amos Hochstein raised concerns with Vice President Biden, as well as with Hunter Biden, that Hunter Biden's position on Burisma's board enabled Russian disinformation efforts and risked undermining U.S. policy in Ukraine.""

The report revealed that more than just Vice President Biden's staff had been informed of the State Department's concerns. The vice president himself had been told.

Then-U.S. Special Envoy and Coordinator for International Energy Affairs Amos Hochstein spoke directly to Vice President Biden about Hunter's ties to Burisma.

Hochstein said he raised the issue with the vice president because he was worried the Russians were using Hunter's Burisma duties to ""sow disinformation,"" the report states.

Hochstein said he also discussed the situation with Hunter Biden himself.

""I shared with [Hunter Biden] that the Russians were using his name in order to sow disinformation — attempt to sow disinformation among Ukrainians,"" Hochstein testified to the committees.

KEY FINDING 3: ""Although Kent believed that Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board was awkward for all U.S. officials pushing an anti-corruption agenda in Ukraine, the Committees are only aware of two individuals — Kent and former U.S. Special Envoy and Coordinator for International Energy Affairs Amos Hochstein — who raised concerns to Vice President Joe Biden (Hochstein) or his staff (Kent).""

Despite the many people purported aware of and concerned about Hunter Biden serving on the Burisma board, Kent and Hochstein were the only people who said anything to Vice President Biden or his staff. And their concerns were apparently ignored

Yet even though Hunter Biden's position on Burisma's board cast a shadow over the work of those advancing anticorruption reforms in Ukraine, the Committees are only aware of two individuals who raised concerns to their superiors. Despite the efforts of these individuals, their concerns appear to have fallen on deaf ears.

KEY FINDING 4: ""The awkwardness for Obama administration officials continued well past his presidency. Former Secretary of State John Kerry had knowledge of Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board, but when asked about it at a town hall event in Nashua, N.H. on Dec. 8, 2019, Kerry falsely said, 'I had no knowledge about any of that. None. No.' Evidence to the contrary is detailed in Section V.""

Former Obama Secretary of State John Kerry told NBC's Amanda Golden on Dec. 8, 2019, that he had had no idea that Hunter Biden had joined the board of Burisma.

Golden asked Kerry, ""[W]hen Hnger Biden joined the board of Burisma, were you aware of, did you know about it at the time and were you comfortable with the arrangement giving [sic] you were secretary of state at the time?""

Kerry answered, ""I had no knowledge about any of that. None. No.""

""Why would I know about any company or any individual. No. The answer is no,"" he added. ""No communication. No nothing. I don't know who they are. I don't know what they were doing to this day, actually.""

However, evidence shows Kerry did know.



In May 2014, Kerry's then-chief of staff, David Wade, briefed Kerry about inquiries about his stepson, Christopher Heinz, Hunter Biden, and Burisma.

Wade testified to the committees that Kerry learned about the Biden-Burisma connection from him.

Also, the report says, Secretary Kerry's adviser, David Thorne, sent press clippings and articles about Biden joining Burisma directly to Kerry.

KEY FINDING 5: ""Former Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland testified that confronting oligarchs would send an anticorruption message in Ukraine. Kent told the Committees that Zlochevsky was an 'odious oligarch.' However, in December 2015, instead of following U.S. objectives of confronting oligarchs, Vice President Biden's staff advised him to avoid commenting on Zlochevsky and recommended he say, 'I'm not going to get into naming names or accusing individuals.'""

According to testimony, State Department officials clearly saw Burisma and its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, as corrupt. But despite Vice President Biden being viewed as ""a leading U.S. figure who pushed for anticorruption measures in Ukraine,"" his staff was encouraging him to not link Zlochevsky to Ukrainian corruption.

The committees allege that it's ""clear that members of Vice President Biden's staff wanted to distance him from an individual whom the State Department clearly believed was corrupt and an individual who employed his son.""

KEY FINDING 6: ""Hunter Biden was serving on Burisma's board (supposedly consulting on corporate governance and transparency) when Zlochevsky allegedly paid a $7 million bribe to officials serving under Ukraine's prosecutor general, Vitaly Yarema, to 'shut the case against Zlochevsky.' Kent testified that this bribe occurred in December 2014 (seven months after Hunter joined Burisma's board), and, after learning about it, he and the Resident Legal Advisor reported this allegation to the FBI.""

Kent testified that Zlochevsky allegedly paid a $7 million bribe to Ukraine's prosecutor general got get him to close the cases against him. That alleged bribe came in December 2014, not May 2014. Which would put the alleged crime as occurring months after Hunter took the job with Burisma.

KEY FINDING 7: ""Hunter Biden was a U.S. Secret Service protectee from Jan. 29, 2009 to July 8, 2014. A day before his last trip as a protectee, Time published an article describing Burisma's ramped up lobbying efforts to U.S. officials and Hunter's involvement in Burisma's board. Before ending his protective detail, Hunter Biden received Secret Service protection on trips to multiple foreign locations, including Moscow, Beijing, Doha, Paris, Seoul, Manila, Tokyo, Mexico City, Milan, Florence, Shanghai, Geneva, London, Dublin, Munich, Berlin, Bogota, Abu Dhabi, Nairobi, Hong Kong, Taipei, Buenos Aires, Copenhagen, Johannesburg, Brussels, Madrid, Mumbai and Lake Como.""

Hunter Biden was afforded Secret Service protection as the son of the vice president. While a protectee, he scheduled at least six trips to China, including a trip to Beijing in May 2014, just before he officially joined the Burisma board.

The report reveals that Biden took at least seven trips under Secret Service protection while a Burisma board member.

KEY FINDING 8: ""Andrii Telizhenko, the Democrats' personification of Russian disinformation, met with Obama administration officials, including Elisabeth Zentos, a member of Obama's National Security Council, at least 10 times. A Democrat lobbying firm, Blue Star Strategies, contracted with Telizhenko from 2016 to 2017 and continued to request his assistance as recent as the summer of 2019. A recent news article detailed other extensive contacts between Telizhenko and Obama administration officials.""

Democrats have repeatedly claimed that Telizhenko is key to a Russian disinformation campaign to attack Hunter and Joe Biden. However, Telizhenko had a history of working with the Obama administration and the Democrat lobbying group Blue Star Strategies, the report states.

KEY FINDING 9: ""In addition to the over $4 million paid by Burisma for Hunter Biden's and [Hunter Biden's business partner Devon] Archer's board memberships, Hunter Biden, his family, and Archer received millions of dollars from foreign nationals with questionable backgrounds.""

Committee investigators found that Hunter Biden and his family and business associates pursued ""financial arrangements"" with other foreign nationals besides Burisma.

The Treasury records acquired by the Chairmen show potential criminal activity relating to transactions among and between Hunter Biden, his family, and his associates with Ukrainian, Russian, Kazakh and Chinese nationals. In particular, these documents show that Hunter Biden received millions of dollars from foreign sources as a result of business relationships that he built during the period when his father was vice president of the United States and after. In addition to providing new and descriptive details about the nature, origin and extent of payments from Burisma Holdings to Hunter Biden, the documents acquired by the Committees also shed light on a much broader array of questionable financial transactions involving Hunter Biden, other members of the Biden family, and their associations with foreign nationals.

KEY FINDING 10: ""[Devon] Archer received $142,300 from Kenges Rakishev of Kazakhstan, purportedly for a car, the same day Vice President Joe Biden appeared with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arsemy Yasenyuk and addressed Ukrainian legislators in Kyiv regarding Russia's actions in Crimea.""

On April 22, 2014, Vice President Joe Biden appeared with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arsemy Yasenyuk and addressed Ukrainian legislators in Kyiv regarding Russia's actions in Crimea. The same day, Novatus Holding PTE. LTD. (Novatus Holding), a private holding company in Singapore, used a Latvian bank to wire $142,300 to Archer's company, Rosemont Seneca Bohai. The currency transaction report states, “For Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC, … For a Car.""

According to the committees, the payment raises ""serious questions"" — especially considering that Archer's Rosemont Seneca Bohai ""does not deal in vehicles.""



KEY FINDING 11: ""Hunter Biden received a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.""

Baturina is a Russian businesswoman and the country's only female billionaire. Her riches came when her husband, the late Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, orchestrated a number of municipal contracts with her company. Luzhkov was fired in 2010 by then-President Medvedev over corruption allegations, the report says.

Baturina wired $3.5 million to Hunter Biden's investment firm for a ""consulting agreement,"" the committee states.

KEY FINDINGS 12 & 13: ""Hunter Biden opened a bank account with Gongwen Dong to fund a $100,000 global spending spree with [Vice President Biden's brother] James Biden and [James Biden's wife] Sara Biden."" ""Hunter Biden had business associations with Ye Jianming, Gongwen Dong, and other Chinese nationals linked to the Communist government and the People's Liberation Army. Those associations resulted in millions of dollars in cash flow.""

According to the committees, Hunter, James, and Sara Biden were authorized users of credit cards connected to an account set up by Hunter and a Chinese national named Gongwen Dong. The cards were used to purchase $101,291 worth of ""extravagant items"" from airline tickets to items from Apple stores, pharmacies, hotels, and restaurants.

The report also reveals:

Hunter Biden and Devon Archer engaged in numerous financial transactions with Chinese nationals who had deep connections to the Communist Chinese government. These Chinese nationals included Ye Jianming, founder of CEFC China Energy Co. Ltd (CEFC) and chairman of the board for its subsidiary, the China Energy Fund Committee (CE Fund). They also included Gongwen Dong, who was Ye Jianming's associate and reportedly executed transactions for his companies. Ye's connections to the Communist government are extensive and ... he has been previous affiliations with the People's Liberation Army. Based on the information received by the Committees, Ye was also financially connected to Vice President Biden's brother, James Biden. Thus, there exists a vast web of corporate connections and financial transactions between and among the Biden family and Chinese nationals.

KEY FINDING 14: ""Hunter Biden paid nonresident women who were nationals of Russia or other Eastern European countries and who appear to be linked to an 'Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.'""

The committee reports contains a very disturbing footnote about Hunter Biden's payments to women connected to prostitution.

Biden is already known to have had issues before with his relationships with women. The committees' investigation uncovered something that is potentially even uglier:

There is extensive public reporting concerning Hunter Biden's alleged involvement with prostitution services. Records on file with the Committees do not directly confirm or refute these individual reports. However, they do confirm that Hunter Biden sent thousands of dollars to individuals who have either: 1) been involved in transactions consistent with possible human trafficking; 2) an association with the adult entertainment industry; or 3) potential association with prostitution. Some recipients of those funds are Ukrainian and Russian citizens. The records note that it is a documented fact that Hunter Biden has sent funds to nonresident alien women in the United States who are citizens of Russia and Ukraine and who have subsequently wired funds they have received from Hunter Biden to individuals located in Russia and Ukraine. The records also note that some of these transactions are linked to what ""appears to be an Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.""

Senate Republicans introduce resolution to condemn anti-Semitism and denounce incendiary language from House Dems,"Republican senators on Tuesday introduced a resolution to condemn the recent rise in hateful violence committed against American Jews and denounce ""poisonous rhetoric"" from progressive lawmakers who have spoken out against Israel amid renewed conflict in the Middle East.

Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and 11 of their GOP colleagues co-sponsored the resolution, which condemns hatred and violence against Jews at home and around the world and denounces recent anti-Israel rhetoric from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Cori Bush (D-Mo.), and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), though those progressive lawmakers are not named.

""In recent weeks, Jewish people in the United States have been threatened and physically assaulted in nearly 200 documented attacks since the start of the most recent conflict between Israel and Palestine,"" the Republicans said in a press statement.

""The horrific spike in anti-Semitic violence and crimes in the United States and around the world serves as reminder that hateful rhetoric and lies can quickly turn into violence,"" Rubio said. ""We must be very clear that this ancient evil has no place in our society and ensure America's Jewish communities are protected.""

Hawley added that ""hateful anti-Israel rhetoric from politicians and the media"" inspires the ""sickening"" violence against Jews.

""We must ensure that Jewish people receive the full protection of law owed to them as citizens of the United States,"" he said.

The text of the resolution cites preliminary findings from the Anti-Defamation League that found at least 193 reports of possible anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. from May 7-14, the first week of renewed violence between Israel and Hamas. It also calls attention to several specific examples of disgusting attacks on Jews by pro-Palestinian activists in recent weeks, including incidents in New York City and Los Angeles.

The resolution also refers to and denounces recent anti-Israel statements from several Democratic members of Congress. It quotes, for example, Ilhan Omar calling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an ''ethno-nationalist"" on the floor of the House of Representatives and a tweet she sent accusing Israel of war crimes.

Other ""poisonous anti-Israel rhetoric"" cited includes Rashida Tlaib's declaration that Palestinian ""babies, children and their parents"" were ""being massacred"" by Israel, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's statement describing Israel as an ""apartheid state,"" and Cori Bush's tweet accusing Israel of ""ethnic cleansing.""

Further, the Republicans want the Senate to reject ""the biased, incomplete, and inaccurate information promulgated by the news media in the United States about Israel and the Government of Israel's efforts to protect its citizens from terrorism.""

The resolution is co-sponsored by GOP Sens. Rick Scott (Fla.), Mike Braun (Ind.), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Ted Cruz (Texas), John Kennedy (La.), Roger Marshall (Kan.), Steve Daines (Mont.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Bill Hagerty (Tenn.), and Bill Cassidy (La.).

Democratic leadership in Congress has condemned the anti-Semitic attacks against Jews, but so far remained silent on the anti-Israel statements made by Democrats in the House. Given the Democrats' apparent hesitance to condemn elected members of their own party, it is unlikely the GOP resolution will find bipartisan support in the Senate.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-confirms-trump-judge-despite-dem-concerns-about-his-religious-org-membership,2021-05-25
Senior Hamas leader calls for 'slaughter' of 'every Jew on the globe',"A top Hamas official went on a tirade Friday, calling for his Palestinian brethren across the world to ""attack every Jew on the globe by way of slaughter and killing.""

What are the details?

During a rally at the Israel-Gaza border, senior Hamas leader Fathi Hammad told followers:

Our patience has run out. We are on the verge of exploding. If this siege is not undone, we will explode in the face of our enemies, with God's permission and glory. The explosion is not only going to be in Gaza, but also in the [West] Bank and abroad, if God wills.



But our brothers are still preparing. They are trying to prepare. They are warming up. A long time has passed with them warming up. All of you 7 million Palestinians abroad, enough of the warming up. You have Jews everywhere and we must attack every Jew on the globe by way of slaughter and killing, if God permits. Enough of the warming up.

Hammad's speech came after the death of a 28-year-old Hamas member, who was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers after reportedly being ""misidentified."" The Jerusalem Post reported that Israel later apologized for the incident.

How did Hamas respond?

The official's remarks evidently went too far even for his own Islamic militant group, which is considered by the U.S. and the European Union to be a terrorist organization.

The group condemned Hammad's comments with an official statement Monday, and another Hamas official called the leader's remarks ""personal statements that do not represent Hamas,"" the Washington Examiner reported.

The Times of Israel reported that Hammad attempted to walk back his comments, issuing his own statement on the group's website clarifying that he supports ""Hamas's consistent, adopted policy of limiting its resistance to the Zionist occupation that usurps Palestine's land and defiles its holy sites.""

He added, ""Our resistance to this usurping entity will continue in all its forms whether that is armed or popular peaceful struggle.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-report-hunter-biden-corruption,2019-07-15
"Seven dead, nearly three dozen shot during Labor Day weekend in Chicago","Seven people were killed over Labor Day weekend, and nearly three dozen in total shot, as Chicago endured yet another deadly weekend, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

The victims include two teenagers (15 and 18 years old) and others killed during drive-by shootings, or altercations at parties, or sudden attacks on street corners.

The weekend's violence began when 42-year-old Willie Coker was hit by shots reportedly from an unknown direction while congregating outside with others at about 12:20 a.m. Saturday. He was pronounced dead at the hospital with multiple gunshot wounds to his chest.

Angel Perez, 18, was shot in the chest at Humboldt Park at around 4:45 a.m. in a drive-by, and pronounced dead at the hospital. Another person who was with him at the time was shot but survived.

Later in the day, two other men, ages 26 and 32, were shot and killed, and three others wounded, when someone opened fire on a group sitting on a porch on the South Side.

Sunday around 4 a.m., a man was killed when one car shot at another as they passed each other. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Another man was killed during a shooting at a house party early Sunday morning.

Fifteen-year-old Dovantae Jackson was shot in the legs and back on the West Side, pronounced dead at the scene — the same block on which he lived.

Jackson's death represents the 338th homicide in Chicago this year. He was going to begin his freshman year of high school at Marshall Metropolitan High School on Tuesday.

""There is no better city in the summer than Chicago,"" Police Supt. Eddie Johnson is quoted as having said in a Sun-Times article published Sept. 1. ""The warmer months can lead to conflicts, but CPD officers continue to work tirelessly to keep all of us safe.""

Several top Bernie Sanders aides bail on campaign over 'creative vision' conflicts,"Three senior staff members on Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign quit Tuesday because they couldn't get on the same page with Sanders on creative issues.

Tad Devine, Mark Longabaugh, and Julian Markey worked as media consultants on Sanders' 2016 campaign, and announced their departure on NBC News. Before leaving, they produced Sanders' 2020 announcement video.

Who are they? Devine was Sanders' chief strategist, Longabaugh worked closely with the Democratic National Committee and led the strategy to secure delegates, and Mulvey helped create the campaign's ads.

The three men's consulting firm, DML, earned $5.3 million from the 2016 campaign, which opened them to criticism by some Sander supporters.

What do they say about it? ""The entire firm has stepped away,"" Longabaugh said on NBC News. ""We just didn't have a meeting of the minds.""

""We are leaving because we believe that Sen. Sanders deserves to have media consultants who share his creative vision for the campaign,"" the three men said in a statement.

What does the Sanders campaign say about it? ""The campaign appreciates all the good work DML has done and wishes them well,"" said Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir.



What else might be going on here? Sanders recently told The Young Turks in an interview (before this staff change) that he wanted to have a more diverse staff this time around.



""We have been criticized, correctly so, for running a campaign that was too white and too male-oriented, and that is going to change,"" Sanders said.

Devine has attracted some negative attention for having worked with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort consulting in Ukraine. Manafort pleaded guilty last year to financial crimes including tax fraud and violations of foreign lobbying laws.

While the cited reason for the change was creative disagreement, a source told CNN that the departure wasn't necessarily unexpected in light of the things Sanders wants to do differently in 2020.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senior-hamas-leader-calls-for-slaughter-of-every-jew-on-the-globe,2019-02-26
"'Sex slave' escapes rapist captor by faking pregnancy, police say","A woman reportedly held for months as a sex slave managed to escape her captor by faking a pregnancy, police say.

Last Tuesday, officers with the Burke County Sheriff’s Office in Georgia arrested Ismael Patricio Aguirre, 22, after a woman claimed that he had ""made her a sex slave."" The woman claimed that between four and six months ago, Aguirre kidnapped her from her home in Charleston, South Carolina, and dragged her to Waynesboro, Georgia, about three hours west of Charleston. Conflicting reports indicate he then held her captive at either the Liberty Inn motel or at an apartment and forced her to eat, drink, have sex, and ""basically be a puppet"" to his demands.

The victim claimed that Aguirre threatened to kill or otherwise harm her children and mother if she did not comply. She also alleged that Aguirre repeatedly beat her physically and even made attempts to strangle her, so she concocted a ploy to make her escape.

On December 12, Aguirre and the alleged victim entered the nearby Burke Health medical facility via EMS, claiming that the woman was pregnant and had recently suffered bouts of unconsciousness. However, the woman then confided to a nurse that she was not actually pregnant, but that she needed help escaping Aguirre, whom she called an ex-boyfriend.

While the nurse and the victim were conversing, Aguirre reportedly became increasingly agitated. Some of the Burke Health staff claimed that Aguirre attempted to prevent the woman from speaking with them privately, so they decided to contact police.

The following day, police arrived at Aguirre's residence and arrested him on multiple charges, including rape, kidnapping, aggravated assault, and false imprisonment. Aguirre has been booked into Burke County Detention Center and held without bond. It is unclear when he is expected to appear in court.

He has also been charged with battery, though jail records indicate that the victim of that alleged crime is a male. There have been no reports that Aguirre became violent with any of the Burke Health staff.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/seven-dead-nearly-three-dozen-shot-during-labor-day-weekend-in-chicago,2022-12-19
Shawnee State University settles with professor who wouldn't use preferred pronouns,"A public university in Ohio will pay $400,000 to a philosophy professor who refused to use a student's preferred pronouns. The settlement arrives four years after the school punished the professor for not using a student's preferred pronouns. The legal team for the professor argued the university violated the professor's First Amendment rights.

During a political philosophy class in January 2018, Shawnee State University professor Nick Meriwether responded to a biological male student's question by saying, ""Yes, sir."" When the class ended, the student confronted Meriwether. The student declared to be transgender, and to be referred to as a woman, with feminine titles and pronouns.

""When Meriwether did not instantly agree, the student became belligerent and promised to get Meriwether fired,"" according to the Alliance Defending Freedom.

The student filed a complaint with the university, which triggered a formal investigation into the incident.

Meriwether said the pronouns would force him to speak and act ""contrary to his own Christian convictions and philosophical beliefs.""

Meriwether reportedly offered to address the student by the individual's first or last name, but the student insisted the professor use the preferred pronouns.

Shawnee State University also rejected Meriwether's compromise, and claimed that ""he effectively created a hostile environment."" The university also slapped the professor with a written warning in his personnel file and threatened ""further corrective actions"" unless he used the student's preferred pronouns.



Meriwether countered with a lawsuit, asserting that the Portsmouth-based school violated his First Amendment rights and his 14th Amendment right to due process.

The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2020, but was revived by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March 2021.

""[Shawnee State University] punished a professor for his speech on a hotly contested issue. And it did so despite the constitutional protections afforded by the First Amendment,"" a three-judge panel wrote in their unanimous opinion. ""The district court dismissed the professor's free-speech and free-exercise claims. We see things differently and reverse.""

On Thursday, the Alliance Defending Freedom announced that Meriwether had won his case against the university. Shawnee State University will pay $400,000 in damages and attorney’s fees to settle the federal lawsuit with Meriwether.

""As part of the settlement, the university has agreed that Meriwether has the right to choose when to use, or avoid using, titles or pronouns when referring to or addressing students,"" the ADF declared. ""Significantly, the university agreed Meriwether will never be mandated to use pronouns, including if a student requests pronouns that conflict with his or her biological sex.""

""This case forced us to defend what used to be a common belief – that nobody should be forced to contradict their core beliefs just to keep their job,"" ADF Senior Counsel Travis Barham said in a statement. ""Dr. Meriwether went out of his way to accommodate his students and treat them all with dignity and respect, yet his university punished him because he wouldn't endorse an ideology that he believes is false.""

""We're pleased to see the university recognize that the First Amendment guarantees Dr. Meriwether – and every other American – the right to speak and act in a manner consistent with one's faith and convictions,"" Barham said.

""Public universities should welcome intellectual and ideological diversity, where all students and professors can engage in meaningful discussions without compromising their core beliefs,"" said ADF Senior Counsel Tyson Langhofer. ""Dr. Meriwether rightly defended his freedom to speak and stay silent, and not conform to the university's demand for uniformity of thought. We commend the university for ultimately agreeing to do the right thing, in keeping with its reason for existence as a marketplace of ideas.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/several-top-bernie-sanders-aides-bail-on-campaign-over-creative-vision-conflicts,2022-04-17
Sheriff charged with plotting murder of deputy who planned to expose his racist comments,"The sheriff of Granville County in North Carolina was charged Monday for plotting the murder of a deputy who allegedly had a recording of the sheriff making ""racially offensive"" comments, according to The Washington Post.

Granville County Sheriff Brindell Wilkins was charged with two felony counts of obstruction of justice for discussing a plan with an unnamed third person about how to kill former deputy Joshua Freeman, who was allegedly planning to go public with the recording of the racist comments.

""The only way you gonna stop him is kill him,"" Wilkins told the man during a 2014 phone call.

Wilkins allegedly discussed specifics of how the unnamed person could go about killing Freeman without being caught by law enforcement, advising him to make sure police don't find the weapon and to not talk about it to anyone.

""You ain't got the weapon, you ain't got nothing to go on,"" Wilkins allegedly told the man during a 2014 phone call. ""...The only way we find out these murder things is people talk. You can't tell nobody nothin', not a thing.""

The man informed Wilkins of the specific time and location of the planned murder, as well as the type of weapon that would be used. Wilkins assured the man that if the murder was carried out, he would not confess to any prior knowledge of the situation.

Despite the charges, Wilkins is still the sheriff, and a prosecutor told the Post that he can technically continue serving in that role until and if he is convicted.

Authorities have been aware of this murder plot since 2014, but a series of delays and conflicts of interest has caused the case to be on hold until now, following a 10-month North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and FBI probe.

According to the indictment, Wilkins ""failed to make reasonable and professional efforts to help prevent harm to victim Joshua Freeman, including failing to immediately warn Joshua Freeman of the credible threat ... or failing to effectuate an arrest of this individual,"" and ""failed to properly execute his duties because of his personal animosity towards Joshua Freeman, who [Wilkins] was told had expressed an intention to publicly disclose to authorities a purported audio recording of the defendant using racially offensive language.""

It is not known what was on the recording Freeman allegedly possessed, or what happened to it.

Wilkins is free on $20,000 bond and is due in court Oct. 9. The county commissioners are holding an emergency meeting Tuesday to address the situation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sex-slave-escapes-rapist-captor-by-faking-pregnancy-police-say,2019-09-17
"Sinema slams Democratic leaders for canceling infrastructure vote, calling it 'inexcusable'","Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) on Saturday unloaded on House Democrats for canceling a vote on the bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure package she negotiated with Republicans, calling it ""inexcusable.""

""Arizonans, and all everyday Americans, expect their lawmakers to consider legislation on the merits — rather than obstruct new jobs and critical infrastructure investments for no substantive reason,"" Sinema said. ""What Americans have seen instead is an ineffective stunt to gain leverage over a separate proposal.""

Sinema is referring to a $3.5 trillion spending bill that would fund key aspects of President Joe Biden's economic and climate agenda, including free community college tuition, universal pre-K and child care, Medicare expansion, and a host of subsidies and regulations designed to reduce the use of fossil fuels in America. Sinema and fellow moderate Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) are opposed to spending $3.5 trillion, citing the cost of these programs and taking issue with the tax increases needed to pay for them.

But Progressive House Democrats have demanded that the Senate agree to the $3.5 trillion bill before they will lend their support to the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, which passed the Senate 69-30 in August with 19 Republicans voting in favor of the bill. The infrastructure vote was supposed to happen Monday, but it got pushed back to Thursday and then again to Friday because of intra-party divisions.

When it became clear that Democrats did not have the votes they needed to pass the bill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) canceled the vote. President Biden has met with Democratic lawmakers several times, urging them to come to an agreement on the reconciliation package and pass both bills, so far without success.



Sinema's opposition to the reconciliation package has outraged progressive activists, who have accused her of being beholden to special interests and big-money donors opposed to the Green New Deal.

""My vote belongs to Arizona, and I do not trade my vote for political favors — I vote based on what is best for my state and the country. I have never, and would never, agree to any bargain that would hold one piece of legislation hostage to another,"" said Sinema on Saturday.

Stating good-faith negotiations ""require trust,"" the Arizona Democrat accused leaders in her party of being dishonest with the American people about the divisions between progressives and moderates on Biden's agenda.

""Over the course of this year, Democratic leaders have made conflicting promises that could not all be kept — and have, at times, pretended that differences of opinion within our party did not exist, even when those disagreements were repeatedly made clear directly and publicly,"" Sinema said.

""Canceling the infrastructure vote further erodes that trust. More importantly, it betrays the trust the American people have placed in their elected leaders and denies our country crucial investments to expand economic opportunities.""

On the other side of the aisle, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), one of the 19 Republicans who supported the infrastructure bill, also slammed House Democrats for delaying the infrastructure vote in a ""purely political decision.""

""It is unacceptable that a major piece of bipartisan legislation, which is vital to our economy and necessary to keep important transportation programs going, is being held hostage by the most extreme House Democrats for a completely unrelated and still unwritten piece of legislation,"" he said in a statement.

Slain University of Idaho students butchered with 'edged weapon': Police,"New details have emerged in the mysterious slaying of four college students in Idaho over the weekend.

Police in Moscow, Idaho, said they received a call just before noon on Sunday about an unconscious person in a King Road residence just south of the campus of the University of Idaho. When police arrived, they found the bodies of four dead students. Those students have now been identified: Madison Mogen, 21, of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho; Kaylee GonCalves, 21, of Rathdrum, Idaho; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20.



There have been conflicting reports about the cities of origin for Kernodle and Chapin. Some outlets have reported that Kernodle was from Avondale, Arizona, while others have reported Post Falls, Idaho. Some have claimed Chapin was from Conway, Washington, others, Mount Vernon, Washington.

Regardless of where the students were from, all of them were brutally attacked with an ""edged weapon such as a knife,"" police said in a press release on Tuesday. Though a murder weapon has not yet been recovered, police said that stab wounds on the victims indicate that such a weapon was used in the attack, which likely occurred early Sunday morning, perhaps around 3 or 4 a.m.

Police have also assured the public that the brutal murders were ""an isolated, targeted attack and there is no imminent threat to the community at large.""

No suspect in the case has yet been publicly identified, and no one has been taken into custody.









Though the university has enhanced campus security, even offering to escort students who feel unsafe to and from class, many students have already left school early for the Thanksgiving holiday. A memorial for the fallen, initially scheduled for Wednesday, has been postponed until after the Thanksgiving break.

Meanwhile, friends and family have taken to social media to express their grief and to caution people against speculation.

GonCalves' older sister, Alivea Stevenson, 26, shared that Kaylee loved her dog and ""the way mimosas looked but not really the taste."" Kaylee, one of five siblings, also ""didn't hold back on love, fights or life.""

""She'd never stop fighting for us and demanding the truth and justice and neither will we,"" her family insisted.

Chapin, a triplet and the lone male victim in the attack, was publicly memorialized by one of his brothers. Hunter Chapin shared a picture with Ethan, calling him ""[m]y brother and my best friend.""

Stacy Chapin, Ethan's mother, took to Facebook to defend her son and the other victims against rumors that have spread in recent days.

""They were stabbed,"" she wrote. ""We got the call. I don’t want people to make assumptions about our kids. It wasn’t drugs and it was definitely not some passion thing between these kids. Someone entered the house.""

Moscow Mayor Art Bettge stated on Monday that the murders had been ""a crime of passion,"" but he has since walked that statement back, claiming now that ""a crime of passion"" is just one of several possibilities.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sheriff-charged-with-plotting-murder-of-deputy-who-planned-to-expose-his-racist-comments,2022-11-15
Small businesses post skyrocketing electricity bills to social media as European energy crisis worsens,"Some small businesses in Europe are posting their skyrocketing electricity bills to social media as the worsening energy crisis threatens to cripple their economies.

""My mum owns a small café in Leicester. Her electricity bill has just jumped from £10k ($12k) a year to £55k ($64k) a year,"" claimed one Twitter user.

""She is working out her options but more than likely she will be forced to close,"" he added.

Energy prices have spiked due to governments trying to shift to green energy sources as well as the lack of energy imports from Russia due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

Another user posted a message from a local restaurant in the U.K. that said they were closing because of electricity costs.

""It has been a very difficult few years with Covid but the last few months with the loss of business due to the cost of living crisis, the huge increase in our costs, and the completely ridiculous energy prices that companies are charging — there is no price cap for businesses!! — have meant it is no longer sustainable for us to continue. We have tried so hard to make it work and we are devastated that it has ended this way and so abruptly,"" the message read.

A user identifying herself as Helen Panton posted a similar story.

""We closed our tearoom/cafe we’ve run for 7 years due to increasing costs in food/ petrol/ utilities back in the spring. We can’t sustain the hikes and thought we would wait until the economy perked up again in the summer but obviously we will never open again,"" she tweeted.

Another business from Ireland showed its electricity bill spiking to nearly €10,000, or about $10,025.

The cost of electricity in Germany and France has soared tenfold over the last year, according to one report.

Tracy Shuchart of Intelligence Quarterly told CNBC that Europe was headed into a recession partly due to the energy crisis.



""Europe is headed into a recession. If you look at power prices across Europe, not just the EU,"" said Shuchart, ""we're not even at winter yet and they're hitting an energy crisis, so they're definitely heading towards a recession.""

Prosecutor Kim Foxx actually 'did not formally recuse herself' in Jussie Smollett case,"The Jussie Smollett plot keeps getting thicker.

Since the stunning announcement Tuesday that prosecutors dropped all 16 charges against the ""Empire"" actor alleging he staged a racist, homophobic attack against himself in late January and filed a false police report in order to further his career, we now turn to the head of the office that brought the charges against Smollett.



Image source: Chicago Police Department

It was widely reported that Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx recused herself from the Smollett case after rumblings that she interfered in the investigation. Foxx, you see, asked Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson to let the FBI investigate Smollett's allegations after the former chief of staff to former first lady Michelle Obama told Foxx that Smollett's family was concerned about the police probe, WMAQ-TV reported. A Smollett relative also exchanged texts with Foxx, the Chicago Tribune reported.

But now it turns out that Foxx never actually recused herself at all — in a ""legal sense"" anyway, according to the paper.

Uh, what?

The paper said that while the term ""recusal"" was used when it was announced Foxx was moving from the Smollett case, a Foxx spokeswoman added that ""it was a colloquial use of the term rather than in its legal sense.""

""The state's attorney did not formally recuse herself or the office based on any actual conflict of interest,"" Tandra Simonton told the Tribune in a statement. ""As a result, she did not have to seek the appointment of a special prosecutor under [state law].""

But the paper added that an internal memo sent Feb. 13 by Foxx's chief ethics officer, April Perry, didn't characterize Foxx's recusal as colloquial; rather that Foxx ""is recused"" from the Smollett probe. The Tribune said there was no explanation tied to the ""is recused"" announcement.

Foxx's explanation

Foxx told the paper she never would've involved herself in the case had she known Smollett would later be the suspect rather than the victim.

""I've never had a victim that turned into a suspect ... In hindsight as we see [how] all of it has played out, you know, is there regret that I engaged with the family member? Absolutely,"" she said.

She added to the Tribune that office employees, including Perry, ""internally"" use the term ""recusal"" to describe when the state's attorney distances herself from a case: ""We also use the phrase 'wall-off' ... build a wall, do not talk to the state's attorney about this case.""

In the end, Foxx told the paper, that was sufficient to meet ethical standards without withdrawing the entire office from the case. Now freed from having to turn things over to a special prosecutor, Foxx handed the case to her first assistant, Joseph Magats, a 29-year veteran of the office, the Tribune said.

Magats — who said it was his decision alone to drop Smollett's charges — told WBBM-TV, ""I do not believe he is innocent.""

He added to the Tribune that prosecutors in the last month agreed verbally with Smollett's defense that they would dismiss the actor's charges in exchange for Smollett performing community service and forfeiting his $10,000 bond. Meanwhile Smollett's attorneys adamantly declared no deal was made, and the actor maintained his innocence.

Foxx insisted to the Tribune that she played no role in the dismissal of Smollett's charges and added that she made the informal recusal a week before Smollett's charges were filed — and that a formal recusal or public announcement about it would have tipped off Smollett that he was being considered a suspect, the Tribune reported.

""Me saying publicly and me moving our office out of it while the investigation was ongoing would signal that [the] investigation had changed outwardly,"" she added to the paper.

What else?

Foxx also told the Tribune her office often handles cases in a similar fashion for defendants with nonviolent backgrounds — but the paper said a number of Chicago attorneys disputed Foxx's claim.

""It's frustrating to me that the reliability of the work of the people of this office has been challenged,"" Foxx told the Tribune. ""What happened with Jussie Smollett and having this type of diversion is something we offer to people who do not have his money or his fame.""

But Charlie de Mar of WBBM-TV noted the following:

Criminal defense attorney Dawn Projansky told the Tribune that ""most people usually have to apologize, pay full restitution, do community service, and then maybe their case is dismissed. Maybe. Or it's reduced to a misdemeanor."" Of the Smollett dismissal, she told the paper that it was ""just too fast and ... it didn't follow the proper procedures of any case.""

ABC News' senior national correspondent Terry Moran issued a ""celebrity justice"" tweet concerning Smollett on Tuesday, saying ""Cook County clerk's office tells ABC they were shocked that no written motions were filed with the court in connection with today's surprising dismissal in the Smollett case. On top of that, the case has been wiped off their database as if it never existed.""

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and police superintendent Johnson blasted the decision to drop Smollett's charges, with Emanuel going so far as to say it was a ""whitewash of justice"" and that ""from top to bottom, this is not on the level ... there needs to be a level of accountability throughout the system, and this sends an unambiguous message that there is no accountability, and that is wrong.""

Magats took issue with Emanuel's ""whitewash of justice"" accusation.

""Not true, it's just not,"" he told WBBM. ""It's not a whitewash, [Smollett] did community service, he has forfeited his bond, it's just not a whitewash.""

A spokesman for the Rainbow PUSH Coalition — founded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson — told WBBM that Smollett performed a total of 16 hours of service over two days.

The kicker

When asked if she believes Smollett is innocent, Foxx replied to WBBM on camera, ""You know, I think that the charges that were filed — and again, I was recused at the time of the charges — were appropriate. I believe that the outcome — him having to forfeit the $10,000, having to do community service based on the allegations, and again, the class-4 felony and no [criminal] background are an outcome that we could expect with this type of case.""

Zuckerberg says private companies shouldn't be 'arbiters of truth' after Trump clashes with Twitter,"President Donald Trump clashed with Twitter over social media bias this week after the platform fact-checked his tweets. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has weighed in on the discussion by saying private companies shouldn't serve as an ""arbiter of truth.""

Zuckerberg questioned the decision by Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey to fact-check the President of the United States.

""We have a different policy I think than Twitter on this,"" Zuckerberg said during an appearance on Fox News' ""The Daily Briefing."" ""I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online. I think in general private companies probably shouldn't be — especially these platform companies — shouldn't be in the position of doing that.""

This echoes a sentiment by Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. ""I don't think we have to be the publisher and we definitely don't want to be the arbiter of the truth,"" Sandberg said in a 2017 CNBC interview. ""We don't think that's appropriate for us. We think everyone needs to do their part. Newsrooms have to do their part, media companies, classrooms and technology companies.""

On Wednesday, Dorsey said that his company fact-checking accounts on their social media platform does not make Twitter an ""arbiter of truth.""

Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me. Please leave our employees out of this. We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make. This does not make us an ""arbiter of truth."" Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions.

On Tuesday, President Trump said that Twitter is ""now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election.""

On Wednesday, President Trump said social media companies need to ""clean up"" their act now.

""Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,"" Trump continued. ""We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that.""

""Twitter has now shown that everything we have been saying about them (and their other compatriots) is correct,"" Trump tweeted. ""Big action to follow!""

""Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election,"" Trump wrote. ""If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost.""

""So ridiculous to see Twitter trying to make the case that Mail-In Ballots are not subject to FRAUD. How stupid, there are examples, & cases, all over the place,"" Trump tweeted on Thursday. ""Our election process will become badly tainted & a laughingstock all over the World. Tell that to your hater @yoyoel.""



President Trump is referencing Yoel Roth in the tweet, who is Twitter's ""head of site integrity."" There have been unearthed tweets from Roth that show he despised Donald Trump as a presidential candidate, and he was heavily in favor of Hillary Clinton.

President Trump is set to sign an executive order aimed at combating any bias from social media companies. Trump hinted that the executive order could arrive on Thursday, after he tweeted, ""This will be a Big Day for Social Media and FAIRNESS!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/small-businesses-post-their-skyrocketing-electricity-bills-to-social-media-as-european-crisis-worsens,2020-05-28
Source: Ukrainian sniper reportedly kills highly decorated Russian general,"A highly decorated Russian general was killed Wednesday, the Daily Mail reported, adding that a military source said a Ukrainian sniper did the job on Major Gen. Andrey Sukhovetsky.

What are the details?

Sukhovetsky was deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army of Russia's Central Military District, the outlet said, adding that Russia's Ministry of Defense had not confirmed his death.

However, Sukhovetsky's colleague Sergey Chipilyov announced his death on social media, and several Russian and Ukrainian news outlets reported the general's demise, the Daily Mail said.

The post from Chipilyov — who's with the Airborne Forces Union of Russian Paratroopers — reads as follows, the outlet said: ""With great pain, we received the tragic news about the death of our friend, Major-General Andrey Aleksandrovich Sukhovetsky, in Ukraine during a special operation. We express our deepest condolences to his family.""

The Daily Mail said it wasn't clear where Sukhovetsky was killed. The military source also told the outlet a funeral will be held Saturday in Russia, the outlet said.

Sukhovetsky would be by far the most senior Russian figure to have have died since the invasion of Ukraine commenced last week, the Daily Mail said.

The 47-year-old was a highly decorated veteran who was appointed deputy army commander of the 41st division in October 2021, the outlet said, adding that he previously commanded the 7th Airborne Assault Division in Novorossiysk for three years, completed several combat deployments in the Chechen war, Abkhazia, and the intervention in Syria, and received special commendation for his participation in Russia's annexation of Crimea.

The Daily Mail said Sukhovetsky's death would be seen in Ukraine as another encouraging sign that the Russia's invasion isn't going well.

What else?

The Kremlin on Wednesday acknowledged that nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and another 1,600 have been injured in Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, the outlet said, adding that the real numbers are ""almost certainly higher.""

Ukraine's armed forces said Thursday that Russia's army had suffered 9,000 casualties, the Daily Mail added, although noting that the military's statement said the actual death toll ""is complicated by the high intensity of hostilities.""

A Ukrainian defense official also announced this week that a kill squad sent to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was ""eliminated"" by the country's armed forces.

What's more, some Russian troops in Ukraine reportedly are surrendering en masse and even sabotaging their own vehicles to get out of the conflict, a U.S. defense official said Tuesday.

Zelenskyy on Thursday lauded the fight his fellow citizens are waging against Russian's military and claimed ""all lines of defense are holding"" in the cities of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Mykolaiv, the Daily Mail reported.

""They wanted to destroy us. They failed. We've been through so much. And if anyone thinks that, having overcome all this, Ukrainians will be frightened, broken, or surrender, they know nothing about Ukraine,"" Zelenskyy said, according to the outlet: ""We will restore every house, every street, every city, and we say to Russia: learn the word 'reparations.' You will reimburse us for everything you did against our state, against every Ukrainian, in full.""

He added, ""We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy. They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment,"" the Daily News reported, and also said Russian soldiers ""are not warriors of a superpower. These are confused children who have been used.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/smollett-prosecutor-never-recused-herself,2022-03-03
South Dakota AG 'shocked' to learn he fatally struck man with his car after reporting he hit a deer,"South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg (R) called to report that he hit a deer with his vehicle Saturday night on his way home from a political event, but authorities say he actually struck and killed a man rather than an animal.

Ravnsborg says he is ""shocked and filled with sorrow"" about the discovery.



What are the details?

The South Dakota Department of Public Safety reported that Ravnsborg, 44, told the Hyde County Sheriff's Office that he hit a deer on U.S. Highway 14 with his Ford Taurus at around 10:30 p.m. Saturday night. The next morning, the body of Joseph Boever, 55, was discovered near the crash site. Boever had been fatally hit by a vehicle.

Boever's cousins told the Rapid City Journal that the man had crashed his own truck earlier on Saturday, and that he must have been returning to the vehicle on foot that night when he was hit.

Tim Bormann, a spokesman for Ravnsborg, said the crash occurred Saturday night while attorney general had been on his way home after attending the Spink County Lincoln Day Dinner, which was held at Rooster's Bar and Grill from 5 to 8:30 p.m. Ravnsborg was not injured in the crash.

Bormann said that Ravnsborg ""drinks lightly,"" but that the attorney general had not been drinking on the evening of the crash.

During a news conference Sunday afternoon, Gov. Kristi Noem (R) revealed that Ravnsborg had been involved in a fatal crash on Highway 14 near the town of Highmore, the Rapid City Journal noted.

What did the AG say?

In a statement released Sunday night, Ravnsborg said:

""I am shocked and filled with sorrow following the events of last night. As Governor Noem stated, I am fully cooperating with the investigation and I fully intend to continue to do so moving forward. At this time I offer my deepest sympathy and condolences to the family.""

According to CBS News, ""Ravnsborg has received six traffic tickets for speeding in South Dakota over the last six years. He also received tickets for a seat belt violation and for driving a vehicle without a proper exhaust and muffler system.""

USA Today reported:

Tony Mangan, spokesperson for the Highway Patrol, said at the direction of the governor, the Highway Patrol is leading the investigation. The attorney general's office said investigators from North Dakota are also in South Dakota and assisting in the crash investigation due to the conflict created by Ravnsborg's role overseeing the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/social-media-bias-facebook-zuckerberg,2020-09-14
"South Korea's new president says he will no longer appease Kim Jong Un, says recent attempts at peace with North Korea were a 'proven failure'","South Korea’s days of appeasing its neighbor to the north are over, as South Korea’s new president, Yoon Suk Yeol, said that any new talks between the two countries must be initiated by Kim Jong Un.

Yoon said, “I think the ball is in Chairman Kim’s court – it is his choice to start a dialogue with us.”

The North Korean government has recently resumed testing missiles, testing more so far in 2022 than in the past two years combined. CNN reported that Kim also recently vowed to “strengthen and develop” his country’s nuclear forces at the “highest possible” speed.

Nevertheless, Yoon said that South Korea and its allies are ready to stand against any acts of North Korean provocation.

Yoon lambasted his predecessor’s conciliatory approach to diplomacy with North Korea.

He said, “Just to escape temporarily North Korean provocation or conflict is not something that we should do. This kind of approach over the past five years has proven to be a failure.”

Yoon is a former prosecutor and a newcomer to politics. He consistently has emphasized the need for taking a stronger stance toward North Korea and expressed an ardent desire to strengthen the South’s military. Both of these approaches mark a significant departure from Yoon’s predecessor, Moon Jae-in, who routinely promoted amicable dialogue with the North and advocated for a peaceful reconciliation between the two Koreas.

Despite what some may interpret as blatant hostility toward North Korea, Yoon said that he didn’t want North Korea to “collapse” but that he also did not think the South’s communist neighbor should be emboldened to continue the development of its nuclear arsenal.

He said, “What I want is shared and common prosperity on the Korean Peninsula. I do not believe that enhancing [North Korea’s] nuclear capability is helpful and conducive to maintaining international peace.”

Throughout his campaign for the South Korean presidency, Yoon emphasized the importance of South Korea’s close security alliance with the U.S.

After Yoon’s recent meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, the two leaders announced in a joint statement that they would begin discussions on restarting and potentially expanding joint military drills. This move is expected to anger North Korean leadership, as Kim Jong Un is expected to perceive the renewed exercises as a direct threat to his nation’s sovereignty

Despite Yoon’s hesitance to engage in dialogue with his North Korean counterparts, Biden insisted that he would meet with Kim if he was “sincere and whether he was serious.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/source-ukrainian-sniper-reportedly-kills-highly-decorated-russian-general,2022-05-23
Special Olympics drops vaccine mandate after Florida threatens $27.5 million fine,"The Special Olympics on Thursday reversed its vaccine requirement for upcoming games in Orlando, Florida, this weekend after receiving pressure from Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration.

ABC News reporter Jay O'Brien revealed Friday that the state of Florida threatened the Special Olympics with a $27.5 million fine because it said the organization's vaccine requirement violated state law.

O'Brien shared a letter the Florida Department of Health sent to the Special Olympics International on June 2 giving notice of the fine. The Special Olympics ""required proof certifying COVID-19 vaccination from 5,500 individuals to gain access to entry upon, and/or services from the 2022 USA Special Olympics Games, in violation of Florida law,"" the letter stated.

DOH said that Florida law ""prohibits a business entity, which includes a charitable organization, from requiring any patron or customer to provide documentation certifying COVID-19 vaccination or post-infection recovery to gain access to, entry upon, or service from the business entity."" The state government imposed a fine of $5,000 against the Special Olympics for each individual or separate violation.

On Thursday, the organization announced it is ""lifting the vaccine requirement for delegation members attending the 2022 Special Olympics USA Games being held in Orlando, Florida, June 5-12, as demanded by the state of Florida officials.""

""We don't want to fight. We want to play,"" the charity said.

In April 2021, DeSantis signed an executive order banning so-called ""vaccine passports"" in the state of Florida. One month later, the state legislature passed a bill that the governor signed into law prohibiting businesses and governments from requiring proof of vaccination and imposing fines for each violation.



At a press conference Friday, DeSantis reiterated his opposition to vaccine mandates or passports and said Florida's rejection of those policies has led to a boom in tourism and economic growth in the state.

""Your rights or your freedoms should not be circumscribed by your decision to take or not to take a COVID vaccine,"" DeSantis said, according to WFTX-TV. ""That was inappropriate. At the end of the day, our view was there has to be choice in this regard.""

He also praised the Special Olympics' decision to comply with Florida law.



""This will be a relief to a lot of the athletes,"" DeSantis said. ""There's a significant number of them who were in limbo up until this week.""

DeSantis has won praise among his supporters and fierce condemnation from his critics for his willingness to use the government's power to go after businesses that challenge his policies.

Earlier this year, the governor supported an effort by the state legislature to strip the Walt Disney World Resort of its special tax status because of Disney's opposition to Florida's Parental Rights in Education law. On Thursday, DeSantis vetoed $35 million in state funding for new baseball practice facility for the Tampa Bay Rays seemingly in response to the MLB organization advocated for gun control on social media.

Special prosecutor in Jussie Smollett case admits donating to campaign of State's Attorney he is now investigating,"The special prosecutor appointed to lead a probe into why charges were dropped against Jussie Smollett has admitted to writing a check to the campaign of State's Attorney Kim Foxx — whose office he is responsible for investigating for any potential wrongdoing.

What are the details?

Dan Webb of the law firm Winston and Strawn LLP was tapped by a judge last month to find out, in Webb's words, ""whether reasonable ground exist to further prosecute Jussie Smollett, and whether any person or office involved in the Smollett Case, including Kim Foxx and members of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, engaged in improper conduct or committed any criminal offenses.""

Foxx has faced heavy scrutiny after her office dropped the charges against Smollett, an African-American actor who was arrested and charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct after allegedly staging what he claimed was a homophobic, racially-charged, politically-charged attack against him in January.

On Monday, Webb wrote an affidavit saying that Foxx's attorney informed him last week that he had, apparently, donated $1,000 to Ms. Foxx's campaign in 2016. In the document obtained by WFLD-TV reporter Rafer Weigel, Webb claims he does not recall making the donation, but said it was common for him to write checks supporting political candidates at the behest of his partners.



The Chicago Tribune reported that ""Webb's filing included a copy of the flyer for the fundraiser on Oct. 13, 2016,"" which shows that Webb was included as a co-host of the event.



Anything else?

Webb went on to declare in his letter that Foxx's attorney ""made it clear that he and Kim Foxx do not consider this political contribution an issue, and stated that Kim Foxx will not claim any conflict of interest, or have any other objection related to this contribution.""

Spirit Airlines gate agent suspended after punching back,"A Spirit Airlines gate agent has been suspended for his involvement in the brawl that took place on August 11 at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport .

In a video captured inside Terminal E of the airport by witness Thomas Shannon, a Spirit employee (who the airline has suggested was contracted through a partner company) and a passenger can be seen embroiled in a verbal conflict that turned kinetic.

There is visual context missing from the video since Shannon had responded with camera in hand only after he heard the initial yelling. The commotion is said to be the result of a dispute at the gate.

The agent reportedly told police that the female passenger exited the jetway and began yelling that there was nowhere for her to sit on the plane. After allegedly telling her to join the line in order to speak to an agent, the agent said the passenger cut in line and became uncooperative, prompting him to take her boarding ticket.

The passenger told the Dallas Morning News that she ""didn't do anything"" and that the agent had torn her boarding pass in half, thereby setting the stage for what came next.

""Don't touch me ever in your life,"" said the agent, identified in a DFW airport police report as Emmanuel Sullivan of Grapevine. ""Don't ever invade my personal space.""

The passenger, who has been reported to be Ayriana Davis of Fort Worth, responded by screaming, ""Get out of my face."" She proceeded to call the employee a ""faggot,"" then followed up the remark with additional profanities, racial slurs, and physical contact.

Sullivan repeatedly told Davis to get out of his personal space, at which point she can be seen in the video giving him a forceful shove.

A male bystander intervened, initially creating some space between the two. However, as the space collapsed and the shouting continued, Davis managed to allegedly smack Sullivan over the bystander's shoulder.

Upon being struck, Sullivan roared: ""Oh wait!""

The bystander tried to block the agent's charge, but Sullivan managed to break through and over to Davis, who had begun to flee. In the video, he tackles her to the ground, and despite another attempt by the bystander to intervene, punches the passenger in the side of the head.

Davis told reporters that after the fracas, she went to hospital with a fractured leg, abrasions, and swelling.

After the incident, Shannon — who caught it all on video — posed the question: ""What happens when the woman strikes first and is throwing abuses and assaults? ... And what happens when the man snaps?""

Spirit Airlines told WFAA on August 12 that the airline ""does not tolerate violence of any kind"" and that the ""vendor at DFW has suspended the agent.""

"Sports fans don't want political discussion on ESPN, network president acknowledges","During the first few years of President Donald Trump's first term, ESPN's sports coverage often included political commentary. Now, ESPN's current president is acknowledging that fans don't want politics with their sports, according to the Los Angeles Times.

ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro admitted during an interview with the LA Times that one of the most significant things he has accomplished since taking over in March of 2018 is getting the divisive politics off the network's shows.

Stephen Battaglio of the LA Times writes:

So far, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger is happy with Pitaro's progress. Appearing at a recent investors conference, Iger credited Pitaro with dialing down the political discourse on ESPN's debate shows and its signature program ""SportsCenter,"" as well as lifting ratings.

And later in the piece:

Pitaro has also satisfied ESPN's more traditional fans by steering commentators away from political discussions on-air and on social media, which heightened during President Trump's criticism of NFL player protests against social injustice during the playing of the national anthem.""



Without question our data tells us our fans do not want us to cover politics,"" Pitaro said. ""My job is to provide clarity. I really believe that some of our talent was confused on what was expected of them. If you fast-forward to today, I don't believe they are confused.""

One of the more high-profile political conflicts ESPN has faced in the Trump era involved former personality Jemele Hill. Hill called Pres. Trump a white supremacist in a tweet, leading the White House to suggest that Hill be terminated for her post. Hill was a host on the 6 p.m. edition of SportsCenter, one of the network's most visible shows, at the time.

Hill has since moved on to The Atlantic where she is a staff writer, and she hosts a podcast titled ""Jemele Hill is Unbothered.""

Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protests also brought the intersection of sports and politics to the networks airwaves, sparking debate that some believe alienated fans and hurt ratings.

"'We did not just lose, we got blown out': Stacey Abrams' campaign owes over $1 million after rejection by voters","Twice-failed Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams recently suggested that she may soon test whether voters have the resolve to reject her a third time. However, in the interim, she will first have to deal with the financial fallout of her latest political blunder.

A new report, confirmed by Abrams' two-time campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, has revealed that Abrams' campaign owes over $1 million to various vendors.

What are the details?

Abrams' political machine has been long mired in scandals concerning its finances.



For instance, Politico revealed in October that the law firm belonging to Abrams' campaign chairman, Allegra Lawrence-Hardy, got paid $10 million in legal fees for services rendered to the Georgia Democrat's nonprofit group, Fair Fight Action.

The legal team was unsuccessful and the group's lawsuit failed in federal court, but that's not what ultimately raised eyebrows. The $10 million payment, flagged as exceptional, raised concerns about a possible conflict of interest.

Abrams' Fair Fight PAC announced earlier that month that it would look into an entirely different but similarly questionable matter: why the inexperienced friends and family of its director were getting enriched while maintaining other full-time jobs.

Now, Abrams' campaign, which raised over $103 million in her latest losing race against Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), is facing scrutiny over its debts and the Democrat's failure to budget responsibly.



According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the Abrams campaign rented a so-called ""hype house"" in an expensive neighborhood intended for TikTok streamers. The house was rarely used.

The campaign also paid for a ""swag truck"" and pop-up shop without a deployment strategy to speak of.

One Democratic official told the Journal-Constitution, ""It's incredibly bad planning, and it shows where their values are at.""

Georgia Democratic operative Chris Huttman told Axios that Abrams ""was running a campaign where there's always been more money in the future that can fix the mistakes of the past.""

Huttman noted that this is a ""well-documented pattern"" for Abrams, given that she also ran out of other people's money during her 2018 primary.

Groh-Wargo told Axios that the campaign, facing a ""cavalcade of negative press and negative polling,"" resorted to working with brokers to sell off its donor lists and voter contact databases to help pay down the debt.

While on the hook to vendors, the campaign cut most of its 180 full-time staffers' paychecks.

""Of course, I would have loved to do a lot of things differently,"" said Groh-Wargo. ""But I had to move as fast as possible. We tried to do the best we could to make sure that help would be there for folks.""

A former staffer told Axios that people linked to the campaign panicked after the pay cut: ""They have no idea how they're going to pay their rent in January. ... It was more than unfortunate. It was messed up.""

The unceremonious cuts made losing by over 297,000 votes even harder for members of Abrams' team to bear.

""We did not just lose, we got blown out,"" said Groh-Wargo. ""It was the most sub-optimal situation to be in. And we will be dealing with that situation for some time.""

Staffers' disdain may be the least of Abrams' concern.

The Washington Free Beacon reported earlier this month that the the Abrams-run New Georgia Project (NGP) has been collecting donations without a license in at least nine states, exposing itself to potential fines and criminal inquiries.

Fines for violating these states' charity laws could range from $25 dollars to $25,000, with penalties possibly applying to each donation received by the group, formerly led by Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).",https://www.theblaze.com/news/spirit-airlines-gate-agent-suspended-after-punching-back,2022-12-20
HS staffer punished for grabbing female student who attacked him. Student was suspected of possessing gun — and one was found in her book bag after dust-up.,"A Georgia high school athletic director was caught on video grabbing a female student who physically attacked him back in August.

Thing is, though, the student was suspected of having brought a gun to Tri-Cities High School that day — and sure enough, a gun was found in the student's book bag after the altercation, WAGA-TV reported.

However, the Fulton County School System didn't like that athletic director Kenneth Miller put his hands on the student, so the district fired Miller and then soon changed course and suspended him, WLTX-TV reported.

But Miller is fighting for his rights — and his supporters are calling him a hero for what he did.

What are the details?

Miller told WAGA that the principal on Aug. 20 called him to her office and told him to investigate reports that some students had guns on campus.

""During that process, we located guns,"" he told the station. ""We saved lives.""

Image source: WAGA-TV video screenshot

That day Miller was seen on video confronting an unidentified female student who was suspected of having brought a gun to school, WAGA said. According to WLTX, Miller said police were with him at the time.

Eyewitnesses reported the student was belligerent and aggressive, WAGA said, citing a personnel investigation report conducted by the district's Internal Affairs Department. WAGA added that police body cam video supported eyewitnesses' statements.

In the video in question — which is from a police body cam, WLTX said — the student smacked Miller's hands, knocking his phone to the floor.

Miller — fearing for his own safety, WAGA reported — grabbed the girl and backed her up to a wall. She soon was pushing Miller backward as well.

Image source: WAGA-TV video screenshot

After the altercation, a loaded gun was found in the girl's book bag, WAGA reported, adding that Miller said he located a second gun on campus that day, but it's unclear if the same girl was in possession of the second gun.

What happened next?

Miller's lawyer told WLTX the student was taken into custody, and Miller initially was fired — until the district eventually modified its decision and suspended him.

The district's internal investigation found Miller's conduct was unprofessional and in violation of both the Fulton County Board of Education Policy and the Georgia Professional Standard Commission's Code of Ethics for Georgia Educators, WAGA reported.

Miller doesn't see it that way.

""I don't feel like I did anything wrong,"" he told WLTX. ""I only adhered to what Fulton County School Board Policy says you're allowed to do.""

Miller's supporters are calling him a hero, WAGA said, and are none too pleased with the district's powers that be.

""I'm OK with him standing up for those children,"" supporter Kavon Smith Arnold told WAGA. ""What I'm not OK with is him being railroaded, because at the end of the day teachers are put in very uncompromising positions to take care of our children.""

Miller's lawyer told WLTX that ""teachers get put in terribly dangerous situations, and they have to be supported by the school systems that employ them. Those teachers are our first line of defense against guns and other types of terrible violence that happens in schools.""

Anything else?

Fulton County Schools offered the following statement to WLTX:

The district administration does not support Mr. Miller’s actions relating to this event and believes his conduct failed to meet the professional expectations it has for employees. Mr. Miller inappropriately intervened in a student matter being handled by school administrators and law enforcement. Mr. Miller acted outside of the scope of his authority and responsibilities. Mr. Miller’s conduct resulted in an escalation of a physical altercation with a student in crisis, which conflicts with district expectations to deescalate in these types of situations. Mr. Miller has not exhausted his due process rights at this time and remains on full, paid administrative leave. The district will not engage Mr. Miller or his attorneys in a public debate on this matter, but instead will allow the facts to drive the outcome of any related decision.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sports-fans-dont-want-political-discussion-on-espn-network-president-acknowledges,2022-03-10
"Stanford university releases list of 'harmful language' it plans to eliminate or replace, including 'American,' 'he,' and 'brave'","Stanford University has identified a list of words and phrases that it will soon be removing from its websites. ""American,"" ""he,"" ""straight,"" and ""gentlemen"" are among the forbidden words listed in the school's index of so-called ""harmful language.""

What are the details?

Stanford claims on its website that ""freedom of speech is core to the mission of academic life of our university.""

Marc Tessier-Lavigne, the university's president, previously alleged that besides threats of harm, disruptive speech, and unlawful harassment, ""we do not otherwise restrict speech in our community, including speech that some may find objectionable.""



It is now apparent that where official communications are concerned at the university, common words and idioms that conflict conceptually with LGBT and identitarian activists' agendas are not to be used freely.

The Wall Street Journal noted that administrators have embraced the recommendations of the so-called ""Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative"" and published a master list of forbidden words.

According to the university, the EHLI ""is one of the actions prioritized in the Statement of Solidarity and Commitment to Action, which was published by the Stanford CIO Council and People of Color in Technology (POC-IT) affinity group in December 2020.""

The terms listed in the censors' index are reportedly ""in alignment"" with those used by similarly censorious peer institutions, including Brandeis University and the National Science Foundation's Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment project.

The forbidden words

Although the university, facing scrutiny, password-protected the EHLI's list and hid it from public view, the Journal obtained a copy.

The forbidden terms on the EHLI list are grouped into the following categories: ""Ableist, Ageism, Culturally Appropriative, Gender-based, Imprecise Language, Institutionalized Racism, Person-First, and Violent.""

Terms deemed unfit for use that do not fall into the above categories are classed under ""Additional Considerations.""

Among the verboten words cited on the ""Ableist"" master list along with the preferred substitutes are:

""addict,"" to be replaced with ""person with a substance use disorder"";

""addicted,"" to be replaced with ""devoted"";

""blind study,"" to be replaced with ""masked study""; and

""walk-in,"" to be replaced with ""open office.""

Among the verboten words cited on the ""Culturally Appropriative"" master list along with the preferred substitutes are:

""Brave,"" not to be replaced but to be dropped from use altogether;

""chief,"" to be replaced with ""the person's name""; and

""tribe,"" to be replaced with ""friends, network, family, support system.""

Among the verboten words cited on the ""Gender-Based"" master list along with the preferred substitutes are:

""'preferred' pronouns,"" to be replaced by pronouns — since ""the word 'preferred' suggests that non-binary gender identity is a choice and a preference"";

""ballsy,"" to be replaced with ""bold"";

""gentlemen,"" to be replaced with ""everyone"";

""he,"" to be replaced with ""person's name of 'they'"";

""seminal,"" to be replaced by ""leading, groundbreaking,"" and

""tranny,"" to be replaced by ""non-gendering conforming folk.""

Among the verboten words cited on the ""Imprecise Language"" master list along with the preferred substitutes are:

""American,"" to be replaced with ""US Citizen"" — since this term insinuates ""that the US is the most important country in the Americas""; and

""straight,"" to be replaced with ""heterosexual.""

Among the verboten words cited on the ""Institutionalized Racism"" master list along with the preferred substitutes are:

""black hat,"" to be replaced with ""unethical hacker"";

""blackballed,"" to be replaced with ""banned, denied"";

""gangbusters,"" to be replaced with ""very successful"";

""master (v),"" to be replaced with ""become adept in"";

""master list,"" to be replaced with ""list of record""; and

""white paper,"" to be replaced with ""position paper.""

In addition to eliminating language that references biological realities and universal concepts that upset activists, Stanford also seeks to swap out idioms it regards as violent, such as ""beating a dead horse"" and ""killing two birds with one stone.""

While the EHLI's stated goal is to eliminate harmful and biased language, there is nevertheless an apparent bias in its suggested replacements.

For instance, the EHLI presumes that the U.S. is not the most important country in the Americas, despite the nation being the most powerful and prosperous as well as serving as a benefactor to most others countries in the Western Hemisphere.

In another instance, by presuming ""tribe"" is culturally appropriative, the EHLI censors abrogate alternative meanings, glossing over both the Latin root ""tribus,"" referencing ""one of the three political/ethnic divisions of the original Roman state,"" as well as its biblical usage.

Without providing a ""trigger warning,"" the Stanford Review ridiculed the EHLI list, making sure to use as many of the proscribed terms on the master list as possible.

The campus paper called on ""all students to be brave and liberally use all words POC-IT considers harmful, so at least their guide will have another use besides a laughing-stock.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stacey-abrams-campaign-owes-over-1-million-after-another-rejection-by-voters,2022-12-20
State Dept. spox says officials are aware of 'congestion' around Kabul airport as desperate Americans try to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan,"State Department spokesman Ned Price said Thursday that officials are aware of ""congestion"" around the Kabul airport as desperate Americans try to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.

What did Price say?

Price said in the clip, ""We significantly expanded how many American citizens, locally employed staff, [Special Immigrant Visa] applicants, and other vulnerable Afghans who are eligible for departure, and we offered them to consider transit to the airport.""

He added, ""We're aware of congestion around the airport. We are working closely with the Department of Defense to facilitate safe and orderly access for consular processing on the airport compound.""

How did folks react to Price calling the chaos 'congestion'?

As you might expect, a number of observers were dumbfounded by Price's characterization of the dangerous situation around the airport as ""congestion"":

""My chest has congestion,"" one commenter wrote. ""The airport has terrorists with weapons that my tax dollar paid for.""

""Really?! 'Congestion'? Even the local helicopter traffic guy would follow that up with a suggestion or two of 'alternate ways around' the 'congestion,'"" another user observed. ""Good Lord — they really should just stop speaking.""

""These people truly have no shame, no courage, and no integrity,"" another commenter said.

""Congestion? This administration is a damn joke,"" another user declared.

""This is not Spirit Airlines you a**hole,"" another commenter said.

""Wow,"" another user exclaimed. ""They need to start resigning so we can get competent people in place to try and minimize the damage at this point.""

""What a tool this guy is,"" another commenter said.

Anything else?

Price also said the State Department was sending consular officers to Kabul and other locations, including Qatar and Kuwait, to help with the evacuation effort from Afghanistan, Reuters reported.

The outlet added that thousands have attempted to get past Taliban roadblocks and U.S. troops to reach the airport — and that the Taliban on Thursday urged Afghans waiting outside the airport to go home.

Price reportedly used the word ""congestion"" a second time, as CNN quoted him saying:

""Our imperative is to relocate as many people as quickly as we can. And we've seen the reports of congestion. My understanding is that things are moving quite efficiently at this hour at the airport, at the airport now, but every report we see of someone unable to reach the airport is of concern,"" he said.

He also noted that ""when it comes to American citizens, we have a relatively large cadre of consular officers on the ground in Kabul right now. They are in regular and constant contact with American citizens. I can tell you that they have received as of a couple hours ago a small handful of reports from American citizens who weren't able to reach the airport for whatever reason,"" CNN said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/staffer-punished-grabbing-female-student-suspected-of-possessing-gun,2021-08-19
More than a dozen states and three cities join lawsuit suing Trump over rule allowing health care providers to opt out of participating in abortions,"A group of 22 states, counties, and cities has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, to try to get rid of a rule that would allow employers, insurers, and health care providers to opt out of procedures, including abortion, that conflicted with their beliefs.

What does the rule say?

Announced on May 2, the 440-page rule from the Department of Health and Human says that people or institutions can't be discriminated against based on personal beliefs that would prevent them from assisting in an abortion, contraception, ""assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing.""

""Together, we are building a culture that cherishes the dignity and worth of human life,"" Trump said when he announced the new rule. He added that this would protect the conscience rights of ""physicians, pharmacists, nurses, teachers, students, and faith-based charities.""

This rule would go into effect on July 22, 60 days after it was published in the federal register. That is, unless it's struck down first.

What about this lawsuit?

The lawsuit was filed by 18 states (Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin), 3 cities (New York City, Chicago, and Washington D.C.), and Cook County Illinois.

The lawsuit is being led by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

""The federal government is giving health care providers free license to openly discriminate and refuse care to patients,"" James said.

The multi-state lawsuit claims that the Trump administration's rule would risk ""undermining longstanding efforts by those institutions to build trust with the patient communities they serve.""

California has filed a similar lawsuit of its own in San Francisco.

In his state's lawsuit, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said that the new rule ""impedes access to basic care"" and ""encourages discrimination against vulnerable patients.""

Roger Severino, the director of the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, has promised to ""defend the rule vigorously,"" saying that it ""gives life and enforcement tools to conscience protection laws that have been on the books for decades.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stanford-university-releases-list-of-harmful-language-it-plans-to-eliminate-or-replace,2019-05-22
"Former NBA player Stephen Jackson backs Rachel Nichols, rips ESPN for giving Maria Taylor 'sympathy job' to 'look good' amid BLM, George Floyd rioting","Former NBA player Stephen Jackson is backing ESPN's Rachel Nichols and blasting the sports network for giving Nichols' black colleague Maria Taylor a ""sympathy job"" to ""make themselves look good"" amid last year's Black Lives Matter and George Floyd rioting.

What's the background?

As TheBlaze's Jason Whitlock pointed out Monday, Taylor took unjustifiable offense after Nichols made the complaint in a private, leaked conversation. Nichols was annoyed that Taylor got the ESPN NBA Countdown hosting job over her and that it was due to diversity pressure.

Whitlock added in his Tuesday follow-up op-ed that he ""can't imagine pretending to be as fragile as Taylor, a 34-year-old former Division I basketball and volleyball player. I can't imagine being so obsessed with the opinions of my white co-workers that their private thoughts could hurt me to the point that I'd expect the company's human resources department to address it.""

And now the hammer has come down harder on Nichols, as CNBC reported Tuesday that ESPN has pulled Nichols from sideline coverage of the NBA Fiinals between the Milwaukee Bucks and Phoenix Suns.

Stephen Jackson steps in

Jackson came to Nichols' defense Monday in an Instagram video and placed the blame squarely on ESPN's shoulders.

""We all ramble. We say things when we're frustrated. And you know, Rachel did deserve that job. It's just plain and simple. I talked to Rachel, and I know a lot of things she was saying out of frustration because ESPN put her in a bad position. And they even put Maria in a position trying to give Maria a sympathy job,"" Jackson said.

He added that ESPN was ""trying to make themselves look good because all the Black Lives Matter ... and George Floyd stuff was going on. So ESPN tried to make themselves look good by taking the job from Rachel that she had already had, that they'd already told her she had, that she deserved, and give it to Maria just to make themselves look good. It wasn't a genuine job they wanted to give Maria. ... ESPN's behind all this ... I can't blame Rachel. I Iove Rachel, and I'm gonna stand behind her, I spoke to her. And I'm gonna stand behind Maria, too. But ESPN, ya'll are some suckers ... y'all did this.""

But that's not all Jackson said.

He posted three other videos relating to the controversy as well as larger issues. In one Jackson said he understands Nichols' dissatisfaction, that she ""never"" showed him signs of being ""racist,"" and that he'd be angry too if he lost out on a job for which he was qualified based on race alone.

'I'm gonna hit y'all with a harsh truth'

In another he told viewers that ""a lot of y'all ... still livin' off your mama, still livin' in your mama house and wondering why you ain't winning or 'I ain't got nothin' going on.' I'm gonna hit y'all with a harsh truth: I am the face for equality, but I also am the face of being black and proud and being strong and goin' to get what's mine. Not askin' no white person or nobody to give me nothin'. I'm gonna take what's mine, like I been doin'.""

Jackson added that some of his viewers also are ""quick to forget"" that when Nichols' show, ""The Jump,"" started, ""Rachel hired all black people. Remember that.""

In his final clip, Jackson blasted those who are ""sittin' around waiting for somebody to hand you something instead of"" doing things for themselves. He also said many of his viewers are ""stuck in this attitude of blaming white people for why you ain't made it ... get up off your ass and put in the work. Ain't nobody holding you back — that's you.""

Here are all of Jackson's clips in one video. Content warning: Profanity, N-word uttered:

Stephen Jackson Defends Rachel Nichols After ESPN Leaked Audio youtu.be

Backlash

According to HotNewHipHop, Jackson got hit with backlash on social media for backing Nichols ""as some felt like he shouldn't be rushing to the defense of a white woman, especially considering the fact that he is an activist."" The outlet added that criticism of Jackson ""ended up snowballing into memes, and for now, Jackson isn't in good standing with the rest of NBA Twitter.""

Comedian Steven Crowder exposes: Tulsi Gabbard's YouTube videos were suppressed on YouTube while she was trending over Hillary Clinton feud,"Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard's YouTube videos were being suppressed in search results in the United States while she was trending, causing her videos and channel to show up below videos about her from other pages when her name is searched, according to comedian Steven Crowder.

Crowder posted tweets showing that on Oct. 18, as Gabbard was trending on Google and social media for her response to allegations by Hillary Clinton that she was a Russian asset, her search results on YouTube in the United States buried Gabbard's own content on the platform.

But, by Oct. 20, when the furor had died down some, her search results were back to normal, giving the appearance that they could have been deliberately suppressed by YouTube during the time when people were most likely to be searching for her name.

Both Crowder and Gabbard have significant histories of conflict with big tech companies.



Most recently, Crowder discovered that YouTube search results for his page and video in the U.S. were being treated unusually by YouTube algorithms, causing direct searches for his most popular videos to yield results that buried his actual page and videos below videos about him from other, less popular pages.

YouTube search results for a popular page typically list the actual page as the top result, followed by a selection of popular videos from that channel. For Crowder, his channel wasn't even the top result.

In other countries (Argentina, for example), Crowder's YouTube search results were showing normally — it was only for those searching in the U.S. that his videos were apparently being suppressed by the algorithm.

After Crowder publicized the problem on his Twitter page, website, and YouTube channel, something changed; his search results began showing up normally.

Gabbard has also had some issues with Google. In June, after the first Democratic presidential primary debate, the Gabbard campaign attempted to buy Google ads to make sure the campaign page was at the top of search results for her name. Gabbard had been the most searched for candidate after the debate.

But, Gabbard's Google advertising account was suspended for six hours, from 9:30 p.m. June 27 until 3:30 a.m. June 28. Google issued a statement claiming the suspension was due to ""verify billing information and policy compliance,"" although a reason for the timing of that verification was never given.

Gabbard sued Google for $50 million in damages, alleging that Google infringed on her freedom of speech and obstructed the campaign's ability to fundraise.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/states-cities-join-lawsuit-suing-trump-over-conscience-rule-for-healthcare-providers,2019-10-22
"'Stormy seas': Chinese dictator calls for military buildup, threatens 'all measures necessary' to take Taiwan","On Sunday, 69-year-old Chinese president Xi Jinping spoke at the opening ceremony of the Chinese communist party's 20th National Congress before a crowd of the nation's elites. Although he did not mention the United States by name, Xi intimated that a conflict was on the horizon, saying, ""Be mindful of dangers in the midst of peace ... Get the house in good repair before rain comes, and prepare to undergo the major tests of high winds and waves, and even perilous, stormy seas.""

Willy Lam, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, told the New York Times that Xi's ""stance this morning showed that U.S.-China confrontation will continue.""



Extra to detailing what he regarded as accomplishments, Xi's speech was primarily concerned with ways to guarantee China's superpower status and its ""rejuvenation.""

Communist aggression

In his speech in the so called Great Hall of the People, Xi — expected to extend his decade-long rule for another five years — mentioned ""national security"" 26 times. He claimed his regime's total crackdown on protesters in Hong Kong was a victory and emphasized that the People's Liberation Army must ""safeguard China's dignity and core interests.""

Taiwan is considered one such core interest, which the CCP claims to belong to China.

""We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification,"" said Xi. He noted that the CCP ""will never promise to renounce the use of force. And we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary"" against ""separatists"" and ""interference by outside forces.""

Xi added that ""the wheels of history are rolling on towards China's reunification and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The complete reunification of our country must be realized and it can without a doubt be realized.""

Yu Jie, senior research fellow on China at Chatham House's Asia-Pacific Program, suggested that Xi's remarks sent a ""further warning to the U.S. and other Western allies which are perceived as interfering in Taiwan affairs.""

The office of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen issued a response to Xi's speech, emphasizing the island nation is a ""sovereign and democratic country.""



Tsai Ing-wen's spokesman, Xavier Chang, said the ""consensus of the Taiwanese public is that territorial sovereignty, independence and democracy cannot be compromised and that military conflict is not an option for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.""

Taiwan's insistence on its sovereignty comes amidst sustained encroachments on the island by the PLA.

Part of Xi's expressed desire to protect China's so called core interests involves accelerated military buildup, which will not just affect Taiwan, but all countries in the region.

Japan, India, and Southeast Asian governments are similarly at odds with China over territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific region.

The U.S., both under former President Donald Trump and under President Joe Biden, made clear its intention to check Chinese aggression, in part through via its Quad alliance with Australia, Japan and India.

While presently in a position to do so, Xi's indication that China ""will work faster to modernize military theory, personnel and weapons"" and ""enhance the military's strategic capabilities,"" along with past moves to do so, have been identified by some as a prompt for America to step up its game.

A 2021 estimate put China's military budget at $252 billion, $526 billion less than America's at the time. The PLA's budget in 2022 was an estimated $229 billion, a 7.1% increase over the previous year — more than Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and India spend combined.

Although the American Military has a bigger budget, the PLA is significantly bigger, with 2 million active personnel as of 2019, including 915,000 active-duty ground troops.



China's navy is also growing in terms of its number of ships and capability. In June, it launched its third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian. These aircraft carriers may soon be able to use hypersonic missiles, comparable to those in the employ of Russia.

In skies, the U.S. still has China significantly outmatched, with 13,000 military aircraft versus its 2,500.

2049

Xi's desire to address the deficit between its military capability and America's — with new ballistic missiles, carriers, and overseas outposts — fits within its broader goal of completing its so called ""hundred-year marathon.""

Liu Mingfu, a retired colonel in the Chinese communist military, wrote a book to which Chinese president Xi Jinping has repeatedly referred, entitled ""The China Dream."" Liu, a proponent for communist Chinese global supremacy, characterized the competition between China and the U.S. as not a ""shooting duel"" or ""boxing match,"" but as a ""track and field"" competition, or a marathon.



Michael Pillsbury, director of the Center on Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, indicated in the book ""The Hundred-Year Marathon"" that the marathon concept is ""more readily referred to in Mandarin as China's 'rejuvenation' within a 'just' world order or, in keeping with the book's title, 'the China Dream.'""

Xi and other elements of the communist Chinese regime have long aspired to ""replace the United States as the economic, military, and political leader of the world,"" in part to ""avenge or 'wipe clean' (xi xue) past foreign humiliations,"" such as the Chinese addiction to opium in the 19th century.



Pillsbury stated that the CCP's aim is ""a world without American global supremacy.""

Not long after Xi first came to power, the Wall Street Journal reported that he had set a date for the fulfillment of his dream of becoming the dominant military power in Asia: ""2049, the 100th anniversary of the Communist takeover of China.""

In his speech on Sunday, Xi alluded to the ""rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"" on numerous occasions, and tied the concept to national security.



Xi noted that the ""next five years will be crucial.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stephen-jackson-rachel-nichols-espn-maria-taylor,2022-10-16
HS student says National Honor Society rejected him over Trump support,"A New Jersey high school student said the National Honor Society rejected him due his public support of President Donald Trump — but the superintendent countered that political affiliation isn't a factor in NHS selection, the Asbury Park Press reported.

Holmdel High School junior Boris Kizenko said in an interview this week with WXKW-FM that the trouble started last year when he created ""Make Holmdel Great Again"" T-shirts — a reference to Trump's 2016 campaign slogan — for his re-election as class president. Boris lost the election.



He added that while he was class president, his class adviser rejected his idea for a paintball fundraiser and then when Boris asked the principal for a second opinion, he was reprimanded.

The Trump quotation that broke the camel's back

Boris told WXKW that also when he was class president, he posted daily inspirational quotations on the class' Instagram page — everything from the words of Marcus Aurelius to the sage advice of Yoda.

But one day he chose a Trump quotation: ""If you're going to be thinking anything, you might as well think big.""

Apparently that was going too far.

Boris said administrators took down the Instagram post and revoked his administrative privileges on all class social media accounts, the Press said. He added to WXKW that the higher-ups said he was ""being a monarch"" and that the Trump quotation ""doesn't represent ideals of the class""

He said he appealed the administration's decision — and a ""conduct report"" was the result, the paper said.

National Honor Society says no way

Boris told WXKW he was rejected by the National Honor Society over the incidents, which the one school official said reflected a ""character issue,"" the Press reported.

More from the paper:

A handful of 11th and 12th graders are inducted into the National Honor Society each year. To be eligible, students must have at least a 3.66 GPA, show leadership skills and several hours of extracurricular activities and community service, according to the school website.



Applicants are also required to show they have a positive character: ""The student should demonstrate an empathetic, compassionate, caring and kind behavior and attitude. The faculty council does recognize that students make mistakes. It is most important that full responsibility for their actions is assumed and a positive life-change is displayed as a result,"" according to the website.

It was noted during the WXKW interview with Boris that he has 200 hours of community service and a grade-point average that's technically higher than 4.0.

When Boris learned he wasn't getting into the NHS, he said he launched an appeal but that the principal wouldn't release the names of those in charge of accepting applicants.

What did the superintendent have to say?

Robert McGarry, superintendent of Holmdel Township Public Schools, told the Press that state and federal laws prohibit him from disclosing students' personal information, including grade-point-average and conflicts with administrators.

But he added to the paper that politics aren't a factor in National Honor Society selection.

""I can confirm that political affiliation is not a consideration for National Honor Society acceptance and that no student would be denied admittance to NHS based on his/her political speech or political party affiliation,"" McGarry told the Press.

What else did Boris say?

The paper said Boris didn't return its requests for comment — but that he did post a message to classmates on Twitter: ""[T]o all my fellow students who have been discriminated against for their politics, you are not alone. Never forget that. It's time to say enough is enough.""

Study finds mask mandates have no substantial effect on slowing COVID-19 spread,"With students finally headed back to school for the fall, debate is raging nationwide over whether K-12 children should be required to wear face masks to reduce the spread of COVID-19. But a peer-reviewed study suggests that mask use and requirements during the pandemic had no substantial impact on reducing the spread of the virus.

Researchers from the University of Louisville examined COVID-19 case growth and mask use in the United States, comparing states with mask mandates to states without, and found that ""mask mandates and use likely did not affect COVID-19 case growth.""

""For our study, we wanted to determine if effects of mask mandates and use were observable in the general population,"" Dr. Damian Guerra, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Louisville, said. ""Essentially, did the theory of mask effectiveness hold up on a population-wide level?""

Guerra observed that given the widespread adoption of mask requirements as a COVID-19 mitigation strategy, there was a need to evaluate the effectiveness of that policy. He told TheBlaze in an email that previous studies on mask-wearing using case studies, mannequin experiments, or theoretical models had produced conflicting results, but his study used states without mask mandates as a control group to better gauge the effectiveness of the policy.

The results contradict the popular belief that mask mandates effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19.

""It appears that mandates and typical mask use among the public have no substantial impact on COVID-19 growth,"" Guerra said. ""Early in the pandemic (Summer 2020), there was an association between lower infection rates and mask mandates and use. However, this association disappeared when transmission levels rose despite increased mask use in the Fall and Winter.

""While growth rates did decline in states after mask mandates became effective, rates declined to a similar degree in states without mandates,"" he added.

Mask-wearing is an issue that has become controversial and politicized, with heated arguments between those who support mandates and those against. According to a recent Axios/Ipsos poll, a majority of 69% of Americans support mask mandates in schools, but opinion is sharply divided by political ideology. Democrats overwhelmingly support requiring masks in schools (92%) while just 44% of Republicans support mask mandates.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone who is not vaccinated against COVID-19 and is older than age 2 should wear a mask in indoor public spaces.

The Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has proved to be more contagious than previous variants, is fueling fears that unmasked students and school faculty, even those who are vaccinated, could spread disease rapidly and endanger children who may be vulnerable to the virus, such as those with pre-existing health conditions or weaker immune systems. In response and in accordance with guidance from the CDC, states like New York have implemented mandatory mask requirements for students, staff, and visitors inside school buildings, with the goal of reducing risk of spreading the virus.



However, some concerned parents have objected to requiring their children to wear masks. In the United States, the average length of the school day is 6.64 hours. These parents are worried that requiring their children to wear face masks for that prolonged period indoors can be unsanitary, have negative effects on mental health and development, and put children at an increased risk of hypercapnia from exhaling and then inhaling CO2. In response to their concerns, Republican governors in eight states have taken steps to prohibit local school districts from implementing mask requirements without giving parents the ability to opt their kids out.

Asked about the risks versus the benefits of mask-wearing, Guerra said his study coheres with earlier randomized control trials that did not find surgical masks to lower probability of COVID-19 infection.

""Simulations with mannequins and theoretical calculations also support this, as virus-containing aerosols efficiently escape from masks that are not fitted respirators. Aerosols would presumably accumulate to a steady state level in congregant settings to enable infection levels like those in non-masked settings,"" he explained.

""However, this process is time dependent, so it is possible that a simple surgical or cloth mask could offer some protection in a passing encounter of short duration. For workplaces or schools, where people congregate for hours at a time, you would expect much less protection.""

Guerra added that some studies have shown N95-type masks are much more effective than surgical or cloth masks at reducing virus spread, ""but only when properly fitted and undamaged."" The CDC currently says Americans should not buy N95 respirators, that they should be reserved for health care workers.

As for the risks, Guerra said there are both known and potential harms in frequent masking.

""Surgical or cloth masks are safe for most people for short periods of time. However, chronic use is associated with enhanced susceptibility to skin barrier breakdown due to pH changes in facial skin. This can promote subsequent infection by bacteria,"" he explained.

""Repeatedly taking off and putting on the same mask, touching a mask with unwashed hands, or wearing a used mask increase the likelihood of upper respiratory tract infections,"" he added, noting that health care workers have reported greater fatigue, headaches, and psychological stress from mask-wearing. The study also notes that masks can ""interfere with social learning in children.""

The best methods for reducing spread of COVID-19 are ""vaccination, improved building ventilation, and freely available N95-type respirators for high-risk individuals.""

""Children younger than 12 are not yet eligible for vaccination, but the risk of serious COVID-19 illness in children is lower than the risk of serious flu illness,"" Guerra said. ""For reference, less than 0.1% of COVID-19 deaths are children. For higher risk adults and children, N95-type respirators could be made freely available and social distancing encouraged. In addition, people should be encouraged to stay home if they have respiratory symptoms and/or a positive SARS-COV-2 PCR test.""

Guerra emphasized that his study is ""not a comprehensive referendum on all masks in all scenarios.""

""Theoretical and mannequin studies suggest that mask efficacy against viral pathogens is influenced by multiple factors, including respiratory fluence rates, viral load and contagiousness, exposure time, and mask type,"" he said, adding that ""N95-type respirators (KN95, R95, P95, etc.) can filter viral aerosols, whereas surgical and cloth masks do not.""

""Surgical and cloth masks may offer marginal protection during short duration encounters with low viral loads by slowing droplet emission, but the probability of infection is already low in these instances. For longer duration encounters and/or congregant settings where aerosols tend to accumulate, surgical and cloth masks are considerably less effective.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stormy-seas-chinese-dictator-calls-for-military-build-up-threatens-all-measures-necessary-to-take-taiwan,2021-08-30
'The View' goes off the rails as co-host Sunny Hostin says a 'black Republican is an oxymoron',"A heated argument erupted on ABC's ""The View"" on Friday after co-host Sunny Hostin argued that black Americans who identified themselves as Republicans simply make no sense.

What are the details?

During a heated panel discussion about recently appointed White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, Hostin made the jump to blasting Republicans, and argued that a ""black Republican is an oxymoron.""

The segment, which initially zeroed in on a potential conflict of interest between incoming Press Secretary Jean-Pierre and her partner, CNN correspondent Suzanne Malveaux, also heard Hostin make a similar remark about Latino Republicans.

Co-hosts Hostin, Ana Navarro, and Sara Haines said that they didn't believe that the relationship between Jean-Pierre and Malveaux created any conflict of interest.

Guest and talk show host Lindsey Granger, however, said that while she understood their stance, she believed it was important to keep an open mind about potentially unethical conversations that may take place ""when you're in bed with somebody.""

Navarro fired back that it was a ""novel idea"" for Granger -- who she suggested was a Trump supporter -- to believe that a government employee and a media staffer could cohabitate without sharing potentially sensitive information.

Granger snapped, ""Did I ever say I was a supporter of Trump? There are many things I don’t stand by that Trump did. Trump has done things that are racist. I'm a black woman first, so always understand that. But I do say that I have many conservative values that I will talk to you about.”

""I feel like it's an oxymoron, a black Republican,"" Hostin spat.

Granger fired back, pointing to Navarro.

""Why? Your friend right here is a Republican,"" she insisted.

Hostin argued, ""I don't understand either of you. I don't understand black Republicans and I don't understand Latino Republicans.""

"New York university reportedly suspends student for saying 'A man is a man, a woman is a woman'","State University of New York Geneseo reportedly suspended one of its students for saying ""a man is a man, a woman is a woman.""

What are the details?

According to a Thursday report from the Daily Wire, the university suspended the education student, Owen Stevens, from required teaching programs after he posted Instagram videos addressing biological sex.

In one video, the Daily Wire reported, Stevens said, ""A man is a man, a woman is a woman. A man is not a woman, and a woman is not a man.""

""The school claims that Stevens' videos 'call into question' his ability to 'maintain a classroom environment protecting the mental and emotional well-being of all of [his] students,'"" the outlet — which obtained a copy of Stevens' suspension record — reported.

Stevens will be required to complete a ""remediation plan"" in order to resume his field experiences and mandatory degree programs.

""The remediation plan,"" according to the outlet, ""includes taking down his Instagram videos, toning down his social media presence, and attending school-sanctioned training.""

In an email, the dean of the School of Education wrote, ""After review of all available materials, I find that, based on your continued public stance and social media presence, you do not consistently demonstrate behaviors required by the Conceptual Framework of the School of Education.""

""You continue to maintain, 'I do not recognize the gender that they claim to be if they are not biologically that gender,'"" the email added. ""This public position is in conflict with the Dignity for All Students Act requiring teachers to maintain a classroom environment protecting the mental and emotional wellbeing of all students.""

What else?



The university also reportedly addressed all students via email and condemned Stevens for the videos.

""Yesterday, I was made aware of a current student's Instagram posts pertaining to transgender people,"" the university president wrote. ""I want to take this opportunity to publicly restate my deep personal commitment to promoting social justice.""

The message also appeared to suggest that the school would not be opposed to taking action against Stevens if permitted.

""There are clear legal limitations to what a public university can do in response to objectionable speech,"" the email continued. ""As a result, there are few tools at our disposal to reduce the pain that such speech may cause.""

What is Stevens saying now?

He told the outlet that he will not take part in any ""reeducation training.""

""I've received threats and horrible incidents of students who all feel like they are making the world a better place by becoming the woke thought police,"" Stevens said. ""Overall, I want justice and the right thing to be done.""

Anything else to know?

A SUNY Geneseo spokesperson told the outlet that the school doesn't believe it is ""infringing on any student's right to free speech.""

“Although we cannot comment on any particular student, SUNY Geneseo respects every student's right to freedom of speech and expression,"" the spokesperson told the outlet. “By choosing to enter into certain professional fields, students agree to abide by the professional standards of their chosen field. At times, these professional standards dictate that students act and behave in certain ways that may differ from their personal predilections.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/study-mask-mandates-no-substantial-effect-covid-spread,2021-02-26
Support for Israel among young US evangelicals craters from 75% to 34% in new survey,"Evangelical Christians in the United States have in the past been staunch supporters of Israel in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a powerful voting bloc in American politics, generally supporting the Republican Party's pro-Israel foreign policy. But a new survey shows support for the world's lone Jewish state cratering among young evangelicals, who report having different views from their elders.

A poll commissioned by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke and administered by the Barna Group shows a sharp drop in support for Israel among evangelical Christians between the ages of 18 and 29, The Times of Israel reported Tuesday. The online poll was conducted between March and April and surveyed over 700 individuals. It had a 3.7 percentage-point margin of error with a 95% level of confidence.

Respondents were asked who they sided with in the ""Israeli-Palestinian dispute."" Only 33.6% of young evangelicals said they sided with Israel, 24.3% said they sided with the Palestinians, and 42.2% didn't take sides.

Support for Israel dropped precipitously from a similar survey of young evangelicals conducted by the same researchers just three years ago. In 2018, 75% of survey respondents said they sided with Israel over the Palestinians, while 22% said they sided with neither faction. A mere 2.8% expressed support for the Palestinians at the time.

On the question of two-state solution, 45% of survey respondents in the 2021 poll said they support the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, while 35.1% said they are neutral.

A plurality of young evangelicals, 41.5%, said Israel treats Palestinians fairly while over 22% said that Israel does not treat Palestinians fairly and 35.7% said they were neutral on the issue.

In a statement to the Times of Israel, UNCP professors Motti Inbari and Kirill Bumin observed that evangelical support for Israel is historically connected to a certain view of End Times theology popular in the U.S., which links the creation of the state of Israel with the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

As such, the researchers asked young evangelicals about the relationship between their religious beliefs and their views of Israel. More than 44% of respondents said their religious beliefs do not impact their view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. More than 38% said they view Israel more favorably because of their theology and another 17.4% said their religious beliefs lead them to be more supportive of the Palestinians.

An overwhelming majority of 71.6% of young evangelicals still believe that the city of Jerusalem should forever remain Israel's capital. Only 28.4% said East Jerusalem should be partitioned off and made the capital of a future Palestinian state.

The survey asked respondents to explain the apparent changing views among the evangelical Christian community: 34% of respondents attributed shifting support for Israel on ""generational difference""; 22.5% said younger evangelicals were less knowledgable about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; and 29.8% said they do not know how to account for the differences.

Nearly half of those polled admitted to having very limited or no knowledge of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The UNCP researchers also asked the survey respondents about their political leanings.

The study found that 46% of respondents reported voting for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election while only 26% voted for Donald Trump. Another 20% said they did not vote at all.

Just under half of respondents, 48.5%, identified as Democrats or said they leaned in favor of the Democratic Party. Another 40% identified as Republicans or Republican-leaning.

A plurality of young evangelicals, 37.5%, said they are centrist or moderate compared to 31% who identified as conservative and 31.5% who identified as liberal.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sunny-hostin-black-republican-view,2021-05-25
"Supreme Court hands Biden a win, clears way for repeal of Trump's 'Remain in Mexico' policy","President Joe Biden won a victory at the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday after the court said he may repeal the Trump administration's ""Remain in Mexico"" immigration policy.

Under former President Donald Trump, the Department of Homeland Security required migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. to wait in Mexico for their immigration hearings. This policy, known as Migrant Protection Protocols, was meant to address the widespread problem of migrants coming to the U.S. and disappearing within the country when they are supposed to show up in court. About 70,000 migrants were made to wait in Mexico under the Trump administration.

Immigration activists opposed the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, accusing it of being inhumane, and Biden sought to repeal it last year as part of his larger effort to reverse his predecessor's immigration policies. But a lower court blocked the administration from doing so.

The question before the Supreme Court was whether repealing the policy would violate federal law that requires migrants to be detained for immigration proceedings and, if that migrant arrives on land from a contiguous territory, gives immigration enforcement the option of removing those migrants.

The relevant statute says that any person applying for admission to the U.S. ""shall be detained for a proceeding"" unless they are ""clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted."" If the migrant came to the U.S. by land from a contiguous territory (Mexico or Canada), then ""the Attorney General may return the alien to that territory"" while they await their proceeding.



In a 5-4 decision, the court held that repealing Trump's Migrant Protection Protocols did not violate the law.

""If Congress had intended section 1225(b)(2)(C) to operate as a mandatory cure of any noncompliance with the Government's detention obligations, it would not have conveyed that intention through an unspoken inference in conflict with the unambiguous, express term 'may.' It would surely instead have coupled that grant of discretion with some indication of its sometimes-mandatory nature — perhaps by providing that the Secretary 'may return' certain aliens to Mexico, 'unless the government fails to comply with its detention obligations, in which case the Secretary must return them,'"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority.

""The statutory grant of discretion here contains no such caveat, and we will not rewrite it to include one,"" Roberts declared.



Roberts was joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, and Sonia Sotomayor.

Justice Samuel Alito dissented and was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. He argued that the government does not have the authority to release migrants into the U.S. if it appears that they are not admissible under the law.

""In fiscal year 2021, the Border Patrol reported more than 1.7 million encounters with aliens along the Mexican border. When it appears that one of these aliens is not admissible, may the Government simply release the alien in this country and hope that the alien will show up for the hearing at which his or her entitlement to remain will be decided?"" Alito wrote.

""Congress has provided a clear answer to that question, and the answer is no,"" he asserted, citing federal law that says an alien ""shall be detained"" for deportation if they have no legal right to enter the U.S.

Pointing out that the DHS ""does not have the capacity to detain all inadmissible aliens encountered at the border,"" Alito said that the Biden administration's decision to release migrants into the U.S. ignores the solution federal law provides of having those migrants remain in Mexico.

""Rather than avail itself of Congress’s clear statutory alternative to return inadmissible aliens to Mexico while they await proceedings in this country, DHS has concluded that it may forgo that option altogether and instead simply release into this country untold numbers of aliens who are very likely to be removed if they show up for their removal hearings,"" Alito wrote.

""This practice violates the clear terms of the law, but the Court looks the other way,"" he said.

Supreme Court rejects hearing challenge to admin’s bump stock ban; Justice Gorsuch explains why,"The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a legal challenge to the Trump administration's regulatory ban on bump stocks, with one of the court's Trump-appointed justices explaining that the issue needs more time to work through in the lower courts.

The case at hand — Guedes v. ATF — turns heavily on a Supreme Court precedent known as ""Chevron deference."" The term was coined after the 1984 Chevron v. NRDC ruling, which provided a framework for when courts should defer to federal agencies' ""reasonable interpretation"" of vague laws passed by instead of imposing their own. Conservatives have long taken issue with the precedent, arguing that it gives too much power to the administrative state.



Guedes, which was brought by a group of individual plaintiffs and gun rights organizations, asks whether Chevron deference apples to the administration's 2018 decision to ban bump stocks by reinterpreting federal statute dealing with machine guns rather than having Congress address the matter by deliberating a new law.



In 2018, the Justice Department announced the new regulation classifying bump stocks as ""machine guns"" under federal law, despite the fact that they do not change the firing action of a semi-automatic firearm.

In their petition for the Supreme Court to take up the case, the plaintiffs argued that lower courts had incorrectly applied Chevron precedent in upholding the bump stock ban, and should have instead applied a different, less deferential standard for evaluating it.

""That holding conflicts with numerous holdings of this Court, mischaracterizes the nature of Chevron deference, distorts the litigation process and the government's prerogative regarding whether and how to exercise any implicitly delegated authority, and undermines fundamental tenets of our constitutional structure,"" the petition said of the lower court ruling.

In an opinion explaining why the Guedes petition was denied, Justice Neil Gorsuch agreed with the idea that the Chevron deference had been incorrectly applied, noting that the administration had even asked the lower court to waive it.

""The executive branch and affected citizens asked the court to do what courts usually do in statutory interpretation disputes: supply its best independent judgment about what the law means,"" the justice wrote. ""But, instead of deciding the case the old-fashioned way, the court placed an uninvited thumb on the scale in favor of the government.

Gorsuch went on to write that deferring to the government's interpretation of the law might not be appropriate for other reasons, too.

""The agency used to tell everyone that bump stocks don't qualify as 'machine guns.' Now it says the opposite,"" the justice wrote.

""The law hasn't changed, only an agency's interpretation of it. And these days it sometimes seems agencies change their statutory interpretations almost as often as elections change administrations,"" he continued. ""Why should courts, charged with the independent and neutral interpretation of the laws Congress has enacted, defer to such bureaucratic pirouetting?""

However, the justice agreed with his colleagues that the court should wait, noting that other courts lower courts are currently dealing with the regulatory ban as well.

""Before deciding whether to weigh in, we would benefit from hearing their considered judgments — provided, of course, that they are not afflicted with the same problems,"" Gorsuch concluded. ""But waiting should not be mistaken for lack of concern.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/support-israel-young-evangelicals-craters,2020-03-02
Supreme Court rejects Democratic Wisconsin governor's attempt at race-based gerrymandering,"The United States Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a Wisconsin legislative redistricting plan put forward by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, dealing a blow to Democratic state governments who have sought to twist federal law in order to create race-based gerrymanders.

In an unsigned opinion, the court's 7-2 majority said that the Wisconsin Supreme Court had ""committed legal error"" in the way it applied the federal Voting Rights Act to Evers' state redistricting plan.

The state court approved Evers' plan after the Democratic governor had vetoed several plans passed by the Republican-controlled legislature. At an impasse, the court ordered the legislature and the governor to propose maps that complied with the state constitution, the federal Constitution, and the Voting Rights Act. It then selected Evers' map, which had created seven majority-black districts, adding one new majority-blacks district.

The governor had argued that the addition of one new majority-minority district was necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act.

GOP lawmakers and the Wisconsin Institute for Liberty challenged Evers' map, arguing that the governor had used racial gerrymandering to create a new likely Democratic district, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with the governor, stating that while ""we cannot say for certain on this record that seven majority-Black assembly districts are required by the VRA,"" there were ""good reasons to believe"" the district was necessary.

Seven U.S. Supreme Court justices disagreed.

""Under the Equal Protection Clause, districting maps that sort voters on the basis of race 'are by their very nature odious,'"" the majority wrote.

""[Evers'] main explanation for drawing the seventh majority-black district was that there is now a sufficiently large and compact population of black residents to fill it ... apparently embracing just the sort of uncritical majority-minority district maximization that we have expressly rejected,"" the court said.

The justices said the Wisconsin Supreme Court had erred by ignoring several factors judges were required to consider when making a judgement on a redistricting map. The state court had instead ""focused exclusively on proportionality"" and failed to consider ""whether a race-neutral alternative that did not add a seventh majority-black district would deny black voters equal political opportunity.""

The Supreme Court remanded the case back to the state supreme court with instructions to reconsider the case.

""On remand, the court is free to take additional evidence if it prefers to reconsider the Governor’s maps rather than choose from among the other submissions. Any new analysis, however, must comply with our equal protection jurisprudence,"" the court said.

Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented, calling the Supreme Court's decision ""unprecedented.""

“In an emergency posture, the Court summarily overturns a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision resolving a conflict over the State’s redistricting, a decision rendered after a 5-month process involving all interested stakeholders. Despite the fact that summary reversals are generally reserved for decisions in violation of settled law, the Court today faults the State Supreme Court for its failure to comply with an obligation that, under existing precedent, is hazy at best,” Sotomayor wrote.



In a separate, unanimous order, the Supreme Court approved congressional maps drawn by Evers, which had been challenged by Republican members of Congress from Wisconsin.

"States can punish Electoral College members who change their votes to disrupt elections, Supreme Court rules","Electoral College members hoping to disrupt the system to influence the election results took a loss Monday, as the Supreme Court ruled that states can punish ""faithless electors"" who vote differently from how they are pledged to vote based on the general election results.

What's this about? There have been conflicting legal decisions regarding whether states can punish Electoral College members who change their vote. In 2016, for example, three electors in Washington state cast their votes for Colin Powell instead of Hillary Clinton.

They hoped to inspire electors in states won by President Donald Trump to change their own votes, preventing Trump from getting a majority of Electoral College votes and pushing the election to the House of Representatives, and were fined $1,000 each for their actions.



What did the Supreme Court say? The Supreme Court ruled in a 7-2 decision that states are justified if they choose to punish these faithless electors.



""The Constitution's text and the nation's history both support allowing a state to enforce an elector's pledge to support his party's nominee—and the state voters' choice—for president,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote.

Kagan wrote that since the state has the power to appoint electors, that also grants the state the power to discipline them for changing their vote.

What does this mean? Despite the ruling, not all states will choose to require electors to vote according to their pledges. Only 32 states and the District of Columbia require electors to vote in line with their pledges, and of those, only 15 states enforce that requirement with termination or fines.



Only seven electors voted against their pledges in 2016. Although it was the most electors in a century to do so, it did not have an impact on the result of the election, in which Donald Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/supreme-court-rejects-hearing-challenge-to-admins-bump-stock-ban-justice-gorsuch-explains-why,2020-07-06
Former Trump administration surgeon general says CDC was 'wrong' for lifting mask mandate: 'Let's fix it',"Former Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who served for the majority of the Trump administration, is worried the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased face mask restrictions too early.

What is the background?

As COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths plummeted this spring, the CDC rescinded face mask and other COVID-related restrictions for fully vaccinated individuals.

The CDC's most recent guidance, in fact, says fully vaccinated individuals should ""resume activities that you did prior to the pandemic.""

What did Adams say?

With COVID-19 cases spiking in some areas — which public health experts attribute to the so-called ""Delta variant"" — Adams expressed dismay over eased COVID restrictions.

""Last year Tony Fauci and I famously, prematurely, & wrongly advised against masks. I felt it was the best call at the time, but now regret it,"" Adams wrote on Twitter. ""I'm worried the CDC also made a similarly premature, misinterpreted, yet still harmful call on masking in the face of [rising] delta variant.""

In fact, Adams called on CDC officials to admit they were ""wrong"" and re-enact face mask requirements to prevent municipalities — like Los Angeles County, which has re-enacted its indoor face mask mandate — from being in direct conflict with CDC guidance.



""The sooner CDC says we were wrong, & hits the reset button, the better,"" Adams said. ""Trust me- I know more than anyone.""

""Instead of vax it OR mask it, the emerging data suggests CDC should be advising to vax it AND mask it in areas with [increasing] cases and positivity- until we see numbers going back down again,"" he added. ""CDC was well intended, but the message was misinterpreted, premature, & wrong. Let's fix it.""

Will the CDC heed Adams' advice?

Surgeon General Vivek Murthy addressed Adams' remarks Sunday and explained the CDC's current guidance was designed to permit flexibility between governments, a suggestion that current guidance may remain in place.

""I think the CDC's guidance around masks was intended, actually, to give flexibility to individuals and to localities, recognizing that in this next phase of the pandemic, as we move into more of a local and regional response based on peoples' vaccination rates in community, that that guidance around what to do with mitigation measures like masks would also be tailored locally,"" Murphy explained on CNN.

CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky has not said whether the CDC will re-enact indoor face mask requirements. She did, however, say recently that face masks, of course, do not protect fully vaccinated Americas because the vaccine is providing them necessary protection from COVID-19 variants.

""If you are vaccinated, you are safe from the variants that are circulating here in the United States,"" Walensky said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/supreme-court-rejects-wisconsin-state-redistricting-map-clarifying-precedent,2021-07-19
Survey: 3 in 5 unvaccinated Americans would get their shots if they were paid a 'big financial incentive',"Nearly three in five unvaccinated Americans said a big financial incentive would persuade them to get a COVID-19 vaccine, according to a new survey.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday about 154 million people in the United States have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, about 58 percent of U.S. adults. That number is shy of the goal of 70 percent that President Joe Biden set for May 4.

To incentivize those who have not yet been vaccinated to get the shot, several states are adopting programs offering some form of award for getting vaccinated. The state of West Virginia is handing out $100 savings bonds to anyone ages 16-35 who gets a vaccine. The governor of Ohio just announced a million-dollar lottery drawing for vaccinated voters in his state. In New Jersey and Connecticut, anyone who gets a vaccine also gets a free beer. And Maryland is offering $100 payments to state employees who get vaccinated.

Though some critics are skeptical that these financial incentives will actually encourage people to get vaccinated, a Morning Consult survey released Thursday found some vaccination incentives could work.

For example, 57 percent of unvaccinated adults said a big cash payment, such as a $1,000 savings bond, would persuade them to get COVID-19 shots. Another 43 percent said they'd probably or definitely get vaccinated for a smaller $50 bond. Adult respondents under age 45 were more likely to say a big financial incentive would incentivize them to get their vaccines.

The number-one reason given by survey respondents for their vaccine hesitancy was concerns over the ""long term effects,"" 44% said. Another 32% indicated they were concerned about the ""short term"" effects of the vaccine.

The second-most cited reason for vaccine hesitancy, given by 39% of respondents, is that there is too much ""conflicting information"" about the vaccines for them to feel comfortable getting shots right now.



While there is no nationwide requirement for adults to be vaccinated, the survey suggests a requirement to be vaccinated might work as well as a financial incentive: 57% of unvaccinated Americans said they'd get a COVID-19 shot if they were required to do so for work or to shop in-person; 48% said they'd get the vaccine if it was required to dine indoors at a restaurant; and 45% said they'd get vaccinated in order to fly domestically.

The survey also suggests steps taken to make getting the vaccine more convenient might also convince more people to take advantage of the opportunity. Nearly half of unvaccinated adults said they would ""probably or definitely get a shot"" if it was provided by their employer at the workplace; if they could get it from their primary care doctor during a checkup; or if they didn't need an appointment for a walk-up vaccination site that opened near their workplace.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/supreme-court-rules-electoral-college-members-cant-change-their-votes-to-disrupt-election-results,2021-05-13
Declassified Susan Rice email conflicts with her statement to Congress from 2018,"A newly declassified email from former Obama official Susan Rice appears to conflict with the statement her lawyer gave to Congress about that email in 2018.

The email was sent by Rice to herself on the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration in order to document her notes about a meeting of Obama officials about incoming national security adviser Mike Flynn.

The newly unredacted portion of the email involves the warning from former FBI Director James Comey that Flynn had an unusual number of interactions with a Russian ambassador.

Director Comey affirmed that he is proceeding ""by the book"" as it relates to law enforcement. From a national security perspective, Comey said he does have some concerns that incoming NSA Flynn is speaking frequently with Russian Ambassador Kislyak. Comey said that could be an issue as it relates to sharing sensitive information.



President Obama asked if Comey was saying that the NSC should not pass sensitive information related to Russia to Flynn. Comey replied, 'potentially.' He added that he has no indication thus far that Flynn has passed classified information to Kislyak, but he noted that the 'level of communication is unusual.'

But in a statement sent in 2018 from her attorney Kathryn Ruemmler to Congress, Rice indicated that she had no knowledge about any investigation by the FBI into Trump officials colluding with Russian officials.

While serving as National Security Advisor, Ambassador Rice was not briefed on the existence of any FBI investigation into allegations of collusion between Mr. Trump's associates and Russia, and she later learned of the fact of this investigation from Director Comey's subsequent public testimony.

The letter goes on to claim that Rice didn't know about any FISA applications made during the investigation into alleged collusion:

Ambassador Rice was not informed of any FISA applications sought by the FBI in its investigation, and she only learned of them from press reports after leaving office.

This appears to conflict with the declassified portion of her self-email that shows Comey discussed the communications that the FBI had obtained between Flynn and the Russian ambassador.

Rice responds

Rice released a statement through her spokesperson Erin Pelton in response to the release of the declassified email.

The statement denies that the meeting had anything to do with an FBI investigation and decries ""dishonest accusations"" making such claims.

Ambassador Rice's email makes clear that no discussion of law enforcement matters or investigations took place, despite dishonest accusations to the contrary. The email clearly states that President Obama stressed that he was ""not asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective.""

The statement goes on to ask that the director of national intelligence release the ""unredacted transcripts of all Kislyak-Flynn calls.""

Anything else?

In the wake of the release of the declassified email, a resurfaced video of Rice's claims was circulated on social media to further corroborate the claim that she had been dishonest about the unmasking of Trump officials. The video comes from an interview on PBS in March 2017.

""During the transition, after President Trump, uh, had been elected, he and the people around him may have been caught up in surveillance of foreign individuals and that their identities may have been disclosed,"" said PBS host Judy Woodruff. ""Do you know anything about this?""

""I know nothing about this,"" claimed Rice.

"Major airline to sever ties with chocolate supplier over the owner's pro-life, Christian views","Swiss Air Lines is said to have nixed its relationship chocolate manufacturer Läderach over its owner's affiliation with pro-life, Christian causes, LifeSiteNews' Martin Bürger reported.

The airline had a business relationship with chocolatier Läderach that spanned over a decade, providing passengers with small boxes of its world-famous chocolates as a way of saying thanks for flying with the airlines.

Now, after months of protests from activists, Swiss Air has decided to sever ties with the chocolate-maker and will stop distributing its truffles and other sweets in the first half of 2020.

Why are they attacking a chocolate-maker?

The owner of Läderach, Jürg Läderach, is also the president of Christianity For Today, an evangelical organization based in Switzerland. The company's CEO, Johannes Läderach, is also on the board of CFT. The organization is a sponsor of various March for Life rallies in the European nation.

On its website, CFT also promotes traditional marriage between a man and a woman, reinforced by a Christian foundation, as the backbone of civilization. The organization also calls for parents to instill Christian values in their children and the protection of human life—from conception in the womb to natural death.

Attacks on stores

In October, far left activists attacked one of the chocolate-manufacturer's boutiques in Basel, Switzerland, with butyric acid, which is said to have a strong odor similar to human vomit. LifeSiteNews noted that after the attack, Läderach had to close its shop in Basel for two days. Additionally, a German newspaper reported acts of vandalism in seven individual stores.

Shortly before Swiss Air Line decided to end its business ties with Läderach, a German LGBT group called for boycotts of the chocolatier. ""One way of protesting would be, for example, if hotels or restaurants decided to eliminate Läderach's products from their range of goods and clearly mark the reason.""



Läderach CEO Johannes Läderach commented on the controversy in an interview: ""The business in Switzerland will still grow in 2019, but we have customers who will no longer buy from us. However, new customers came into the store, who were sorry to see a conflict being played out on the back of the employees.""

Läderach denied that either she or her company have any issues with LGBT communities and emphasized the chocolatier has zero tolerance for discrimination.

""We have homosexuals working for us, too. We don't ask them. I attended a gay network event because I wanted to hear what the LGBTQ movement has against Läderach. There, I explained that I may have a different opinion on same-sex marriage [sic] or on the question of when life begins. But this does not mean that I have anything against homosexuals. Läderach has a zero tolerance for discrimination,"" Läderach said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/survey-3-in-5-unvaccinated-americans-would-get-their-shots-if-they-were-paid-a-big-financial-incentive,2020-02-02
Taco Bell reportedly fires worker over Black Lives Matter face mask because it was against policy,"A former Taco Bell employee says the local restaurant where he worked fired him after he refused to take off his Black Lives Matter face mask during work.

A spokesperson for the company, however, says that Black Lives Matter masks are not against company policy.

What are the details?

The employee, 29-year-old Denzel Skinner, filmed his alleged experience in a video posted to Twitter.

Skinner had reportedly worked at the Youngstown, Ohio, Taco Bell for eight years and was a night shift manager before being terminated.

Skinner's post has gone viral and has sparked protests at the local franchise.

In the one-minute video shared to Twitter, Skinner can be heard having a discussion with an off-screen, unidentified female about the mask.



The female can be heard telling Skinner that he is not permitted to ""bring politics into the building,"" but he disagrees. Skinner responds by telling the woman ""This is what I'm standing for. ... I'm standing up for my people.""

The female tells Skinner that he doesn't ""get it"" and says that she doesn't have a problem with the mask or the movement, but that rather it's a ""company thing.""

Skinner shared a follow-up video on Facebook, where he said he was asked to leave the restaurant and was advised to ""not come back.""

He also told WFMJ-TV that the company mandated mask-wearing on May 4 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He pointed out that the verbiage in the company's new policy did not stipulate what types of masks were permitted.



""It just said we have to wear a mask,"" Skinner recalled.

""If the governor and governments are requiring us to wear masks, we should be able to wear any type of mask that you want,"" he reasoned. ""And not only that, I still want everyone to believe that we still need justice for what is happening in this world and people need to be held accountable for whatever mistakes that they make. Black lives are going to always matter. Not just when some people want it to matter. It will always matter.""

Following outcry about Skinner's alleged firing, at least 30 people convened at the Taco Bell franchise to protest the incident.

Has Taco Bell responded?

A company spokesperson said Taco Bell was ""disappointed to learn about the incident"" and promised that it was working with the franchisee who operates the location ""to understand what happened.""

The company added that it is ""committed to fighting racial injustice and are hosting open forums to give restaurant teams an opportunity to discuss racism in America.""

Taco Bell pointed out that masks are certainly mandatory for restaurant employees, and the employees are asked to supply their own masks for work.

The station also reported on the restaurant's policy:

Masks are required not only by the states but by Taco Bell and KFC. They must be worn properly at all times. We have been receiving multiple guest complaints about employees wearing masks under their chins or not over their nose. Team, I know it's hot and uncomfortable but unfortunately, this is what has to be done. Not wearing your mask correctly is grounds for termination. Businesses are under a microscope right now, and we must follow the rules ... masks/gloves/food safety!!!

On Thursday, Taco Bell announced that it would permit employees to wear Black Lives Matter masks while working.

""We believe Black Lives Matter. We were disappointed to learn about the incident that took place in Youngstown, OH,"" a spokesperson for Taco Bell told USA Today. ""We take this very seriously; we have been working closely with our franchisee that operates this location to address the issue.""

The statement added, ""Our goal is to ensure our policies are inclusive and keep our team members and customers safe. While our policies at restaurants do not prohibit Team Members from wearing Black Lives Matter masks, we are working to clarify our mask policy so this doesn't happen again.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/susan-rice-email-statement-conflict-fisa,2020-06-18
Taliban viciously tortured and massacred ethnic minority men in Afghanistan this summer: Amnesty International report,"The Taliban ""massacred"" and viciously tortured several members of the Hazara ethnic minority in Afghanistan, according to the human rights group Amnesty International.



Amnesty International reported Thursday that nine Hazara men were murdered between July 4-6 in the Malistan district in the eastern Ghazni province.



""Six of the men were shot and three were tortured to death, including one man who was strangled with his own scarf and had his arm muscles sliced off,"" the report said.

The villagers saw that the fighting between Afghan government forces and the Taliban intensified on July 3. They allegedly fled into the mountains, where they have basic shelters.



However, there was not enough food for the 30 families, so five men and four women returned to the village to gather supplies on the morning of July 4. They returned to their homes, which had been looted by the Taliban, and fighters were reportedly ""lying in wait for them.""

""One man, 45-year-old Wahed Qaraman, was taken from his home by Taliban fighters who broke his legs and arms, shot him in the right leg, pulled his hair out, and beat his face with a blunt object,"" the report said.



A 63-year-old man was accused of working for the Afghan government after cash was found in his pocket, then he was severely beaten and ""the muscles of his arms had been carved off.""



Other Hazara men were ""ambushed and executed as they attempted to pass through Mundarakht to reach their homes in the nearby hamlet of Wuli.""

An eyewitness told Amnesty International, ""We asked the Taliban why they did this, and they told us, 'When it is the time of conflict, everyone dies, it doesn't matter if you have guns or not. It is the time of war.'""

Amnesty's Secretary-General Agnès Callamard said, ""The cold-blooded brutality of these killings is a reminder of the Taliban's past record, and a horrifying indicator of what Taliban rule may bring.""

Brian Castner, who is Amnesty International's senior crisis adviser for arms and military operations, said the attack happened in the tiny village of Mundarakht that only has 40 men in total living there, nine of which were brutally murdered by the Taliban. Castner adds that the Taliban cut cellphone service to hamper communication of the atrocity.

Taliban 'tortured and massacred' men from Hazara minority in Afghanistan - BBC News www.youtube.com

As the Taliban were taking over Afghanistan this week, they reportedly pledged to provide a general ""amnesty"" for all in Afghanistan, including those who worked with the previous Afghan government. The Taliban also promised a new era of peace in the country. However, many are skeptical of the radical Islamist group's promises, especially the Hazara community.



A few days after capturing Kabul, the Taliban destroyed a statue of Hazara leader Abdul Ali Mazari, who fought against the Taliban until he was executed by the group in 1995.

The Hazara, who make up 9% of Afghanistan's 38 million population, have been previously persecuted by the Taliban. In August 1998, the Taliban went on an alleged ""killing frenzy"" after conquering the city of Mazar-i Sharif in northwest Afghanistan.



A Human Rights Watch report from 1998 stated, ""Within the first few hours of seizing control of the city, Taliban troops killed scores of civilians in indiscriminate attacks, shooting noncombatants and suspected combatants alike in residential areas, city street sand markets.""

""In the days that followed, Taliban forces carried out a systematic search for male members of the ethnic Hazara, Tajik, and Uzbek communities in the city,"" the report said of the 1998 massacre. ""The Hazaras, a Persian-speaking Shi'a ethnic group, were particularly targeted, in part because of their religious identity. During the house-to-house searches, scores and perhaps hundreds of Hazara men and boys were summarily executed, apparently to ensure that they would be unable to mount any resistance to the Taliban.""

Many Hazaras have adopted liberal values over the past two decades with the Taliban out of power, and now fear the situation could be even worse than before.

""The threat we face now is much more serious than the 1990s,"" a Hazara woman who works in the government told the New York Times. ""I am worried about my life and my family's life.

""Hazara women have a strong presence in the society: They are university students, working outside, and are visible in the streets,"" she added. ""And this is exactly the opposite of what the Taliban want.""

"Taliban leaders reportedly got into major brawl over who did the most to expel US from Afghanistan, who deserves cabinet positions. One prominent leader hasn't been seen since.","Only days after installing a new government in Afghanistan, several top leaders of the Taliban reportedly got into a major dust-up over who did the most to boot U.S. troops from the country and who was most deserving of certain coveted cabinet positions.

Two rival factions of the militant regime brawled at the presidential palace in the capital city of Kabul late last week, BBC News reported.

The skirmish — which started after strong words were exchanged between Taliban deputy prime minister and co-founder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and the regime's new head of security, Khalil ur-Rahman Haqqani — has reportedly resulted in Baradar's disappearance.

Here's more from the BBC:

One Taliban source told BBC Pashto that Mr. Baradar and Khalil ur-Rahman Haqqani — the minister for refugees and a prominent figure within the militant Haqqani network — had exchanged strong words, as their followers brawled with each other nearby.



A senior Taliban member based in Qatar and a person connected to those involved also confirmed that an argument had taken place late last week.



The sources said the argument had broken out because Mr. Baradar, the new deputy prime minister, was unhappy about the structure of their interim government.



The row also reportedly stemmed from divisions over who in the Taliban should take credit for their victory in Afghanistan.

The Taliban has publicly denied that the argument took place and insisted that Baradar is alive and well despite the fact that the deputy prime minister hasn't made a public appearance in days.

A Taliban spokesman, Sulail Shaheen, told Reuters on Tuesday that Baradar has been busy attending meetings in the southern city of Kandahar. The spokesman has shared video footage of the meetings, but the footage has not been independently verified.

""He says it is lies and totally baseless,"" Shaheen added, claiming to pass along a message from Baradar himself.

The BBC noted that the Taliban has issued ""conflicting statements"" in regard to Baradar's whereabouts. Some have maintained he is away on business, while others said the leader was ""tired and wanted some rest.""

Baradar's supposed rival, Khalil ur-Rahman Haqqani, is known for carrying out violent attacks against Western allies in Afghanistan. He is the leader of the Haqqani network, a group designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization.

Haqqani currently has a $5 million bounty on his head for links to al Qaeda operations. His nephew, Sirajuddin Haqqani, has been appointed interior minister in the new Taliban regime in Afghanistan. He is on the FBI's ""Most Wanted"" list and has a $10 million bounty on his head.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taco-bell-fires-worker-face-mask,2021-09-15
"'Heroes of Islam and the country': Taliban promises land to families of suicide bombers who targeted U.S., Afghan troops","The Taliban have promised property plots to the relatives of suicide bombers who perpetrated attacks against American and Afghan troops, according to the Associated Press.

""The Taliban's acting interior minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani, offered the reward to dozens of family members of bombers gathered at a Kabul hotel, Interior Ministry spokesman Saeed Khosty tweeted on Tuesday,"" the AP reported.

Speaking to those present at the assembly Monday, Haqqani lauded the sacrifices of ""martyrs and fedayeen,"" Khosty tweeted, according to the AP. Haqqani described those individuals as ""heroes of Islam and the country,"" the spokesman noted.

At the conclusion of the gathering, he provided 10,000 Afghanis ($112) to each family and promised each a plot of property, according to the outlet.

""The promise of rewards for suicide bombings signals conflicting approaches within the Taliban leadership,"" according to the AP. ""They are trying to position themselves as responsible rulers, who promise security for all and have condemned suicide attacks by their rivals, the militant Islamic State group. On the other hand, they praise such tactics when it comes to their followers.""



The news comes after the chaotic U.S. pullout from Afghanistan earlier this year for which the Biden administration has faced heavy criticism. The Taliban, which swiftly took control in the country, seized the capital city of Kabul in mid-August. The U.S. announced the completion of its pullout later that month, even as Afghan allies and some U.S. citizens were still in the country.

During an interview with the AP last month, Taliban figure Mullah Nooruddin Turabi indicated that hand amputations would again be carried out under the group's rule in Afghanistan.

""Cutting off of hands is very necessary for security,"" he stated, saying it had a deterrent impact.

""No one will tell us what our laws should be. We will follow Islam and we will make our laws on the Quran,"" Turabi said during the interview, according to the outlet.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taliban,2021-10-19
Double standard? Dem senator calls for investigation into Trump's EPA over something Obama's EPA did,"Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) has called for an investigation into the Environmental Protection Agency to determine whether the agency broke federal law by granting small oil refineries waivers to bypass regulations mandating that corn ethanol be mixed into their gasoline supply.

However, the liberal lawmaker was silent when the Obama administration granted the exact same waivers.

What did Duckworth allege?

According to the Washington Examiner, Duckworth requested the EPA's inspector general conduct an investigation over allegations the EPA has ""misled"" Congress.

""Recent document disclosures reveal that the EPA misled Members of Congress, industry and the public,"" she wrote in a letter to the EPA's acting inspector general. ""This deception by EPA political appointees may indicate improper motives and conflicts of interest, and it warrants a thorough review.""

Shockingly, the waivers in question are somewhat of a bipartisan issue on Capitol Hill. Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) have also petitioned for the EPA to cease granting waivers. The common thread between Duckworth, Grassley, and Ernest? Their states are the two of the nation's leading producers of corn ethanol.

The senators argue most of the companies that have been granted waivers are subsidiaries of or somehow connected to larger oil companies, such as Exxon, therefore not legitimately meeting qualifications for the ethanol-mixing exemption.

Is there a double standard?

As the Examiner noted, Duckworth claims the Trump administration has issued 35 EPA waivers in the last two years, whereas the Obama administration granted only seven.

However, Reuters reported last year that EPA records show the Obama administration granted 14 waivers in 2015 and 20 in 2016 — just one less than the Trump administration over a similar period of time.

So, what's this all about? Is Duckworth really concerned with EPA guidelines? Or is Duckworth motivated by the ethanol lobby of which she is a beneficiary?

From Hot Air:

The reality here is that Duckworth, just like Grassley and Ernst (this is a bipartisan problem), are in the pocket of the ethanol lobby and continually seek to prop up the corn and soybean growers while trying to use the power of the government to damage the oil and gas industry. They don't want to have the waivers issued because they know it will lead to more artificial, government-mandated demand for ethanol while bankrupting refineries, literally in some cases. This request for an investigation is a partisan ploy, working at the expense of private industry.

Taylor Swift cancels concert at horse race after pressure from animal rights activists,"Pop superstar Taylor Swift has cancelled an upcoming performance at an Australian horserace event following outcry from animal rights activists.

Swift was slated to headline the Melbourne Cup on Nov. 5. But the Victoria Racing Club, which hosts the event, released a statement Saturday announcing that Swift had cancelled her performance. The changed was blamed on a scheduling issue.

""Regrettably, Taylor is no longer able to make it to this year's Melbourne Cup. Changes to her Asian promo schedule have made it logistically impossible for her to be here. To all of Taylor's fans, we hope to see Taylor in Australia in 2020,"" the statement read.

However, Swift's cancellation comes after animal rights activists claimed Swift was ""endorsing animal abuse"" by agreeing to perform at the race, according to the BBC.

One group in particular, Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses, even began the social media campaign ""#NupToTheCup"" to pressure Swift into canceling her performance.

""Horses are being killed for gambling profits and entertainment. If Taylor Swift cares at all about other animals the way she appears to care about cats, she will cancel her show and make a strong statement that animal abuse is unacceptable,"" the group said.

The Melbourne Cup has been a lightning rod for controversy in recent years. The race is connected to the deaths of six racehorses since 2013, including one, The Cliffsofmoher, which had to be euthanized on the track last year after suffering a significant injury.



Although Swift's cancelation was blamed on a scheduling conflict, the coalition said Saturday that Swift's decision was related to the pressure placed on her.

""The pressure on Taylor Swift to cancel her performance was significant. Her fans did not want to see her supporting animal abuse,"" the group said. ""Whilst the reason being used by the racing industry is a scheduling mix up, it appears to us that she has responded to those calls.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taliban-promises-to-give-land-to-relatives-of-suicide-bombers-who-targeted-u-s-afghan-troops,2019-09-21
Teacher claims district fired him for tweeting 'Trump is our president' — but there's more to the story,"UPDATE: July 7, 2020 4:42 P.M. ET:

A spokesperson for Walled Lake Schools tells The Blaze that Kucera is no longer employed by the district.

In a lengthy statement, the spokesperson said:

When media stories/issues that garner public attention arise, we want to keep you informed around the District response.



Recently there have been stories in the media regarding a former employee of Walled Lake. As a matter of policy and practice, Walled Lake Schools does not comment on current and/or former employees as it relates to specific personnel issues.



These are difficult times in our community and across our country. When issues arise there's a temptation to view items through the lens of our fractured political discourse. Walled Lake encourages students and staff members to engage each other with mutual respect and civility.



We believe in the power of education and critical thinking. We believe vigorous community discussion, done with civility and mutual respect, leads to productive and innovative outcomes. In the Walled Lake Schools' educational setting, we encourage positive discourse and working together to make decisions that benefit our community.

Original story continues below ...

A Michigan high school teacher says his district fired him for saying ""Trump is our president"" on social media.

His account of the alleged incident is in dispute, however, following a report of conflicting information.

What are the details?

On July 6, Justin Kucera — a social studies teacher and varsity baseball coach at Walled Lake Western High School — wrote, ""I'm done being silent. @realDonaldTrump is our president. Don't @ me.""

That same day, he shared a tweet from President Donald Trump, which says, ""SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!""

Kucera said his statements ruffled feathers within the school and the district at large, and insisted that he was left without a job after speaking with school officials.

In a recent interview, Kucera told the Washington Free Beacon that the school's principal and district superintendent contacted him shortly after he made the remarks on Twitter.

""I was required to meet with [human resources], the superintendent, and my principal [on July 10],"" he told the outlet. ""They initially took my statement on why I tweeted those tweets and they told me they would have a decision about my future employment in the upcoming days.

""When they completed the meeting,"" he continued, ""I was told I had the option to either be fired or resign.""

Kucera added that he wasn't trying to send an inflammatory message with the tweet, but instead, wished to unite people.

""I know a lot of people are just rooting for Tump to fail, and I don't think that anybody should do that,"" he reasoned. ""Agree with him or not, you should want the president to do well. I apologized that [the tweet] brought so much negative attention, but I'm not sorry for what I said.""

What else do we know?



A Tuesday Fox Business report noted that Kenneth Gutman, Walled Lake Consolidated School District superintendent, said that he was not in any meeting with Kucera, and that no disciplinary action had been taken against the social studies teacher and coach for his remarks about Trump.

He said, ""No disciplinary action was taken as a result of any support of President Trump and we are unable to comment on specific staff discipline/personnel matters.""

Ted Cruz slams critical race theory as racist as KKK,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lambasted critical race theory, calling it an ""evil"" concept derived from Marxism, and ""every bit as racist as a Klansmen in white sheets."" Cruz made his fiery comments about critical race theory on Friday during a speech at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Road to Majority Conference.

According to Cruz, a reporter tried to get the Republican senator on a ""gotcha"" question last week, asking him, ""What is critical race theory?"" Cruz theorized the Capitol Hill reporter thought the question would trip him up because the reporter likely believes ""conservatives are morons,"" and they ""don't know what they're talking about.""

""I explained to him and I said, 'Well, it's a theory that derives from Marxism. Carl Marx viewed the entire world as a conflict between classes, between the owners of capital and the working men and women, the proletariat,'"" Cruz said. ""A fundamental battle in society.""

""Critical race theory takes that same Marxist concept except it replaces 'class' with 'race,'"" he explained. ""And it says all of America and all of the world is a battle between the races.""

""Critical race theory says every white person is a racist,"" Cruz stated. ""Critical race theory says America's fundamentally racist and irredeemably racist. Critical race theory seeks to turn us against each other and if someone has a different color skin, seeks to make us hate that person.""

""And let me tell you right now, critical race theory is bigoted, it is a lie and it is every bit as racist as the Klansmen in white sheets,"" Cruz emphatically proclaimed, which was greeted by applause from the conservative audience.

""As a Christian and as an American, I love my brothers and sisters, whatever skin color you are, whatever ethnicity you are, whatever faith you are, whatever creed you are,"" Cruz declared. ""We are commanded to love, period, the end.""

""And those who would divide us, those who would spread lies, it is evil,"" he concluded. ""It is exactly that, it is evil.""

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People countered Cruz's comments on critical race theory.



""Critical race theory is an academic and legal framework that examines the impact of systemic racism on American society,"" the NAACP tweeted. ""Refusing to examine our history denotes that nothing is wrong with our systems or history.""

Critical race theory has dominated headlines in the past months and become a major topic in the culture war between left and right factions. Republican politicians across the country have taken steps to ban CRT from public schools.

Last week, Florida became the latest state to ban critical race theory.

""Florida's education system exists to create opportunity for our children,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) stated. ""Critical Race Theory teaches kids to hate our country and to hate each other. It is state-sanctioned racism and has no place in Florida schools.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/taylor-swift-cancels-concert-at-melbourne-cup-after-pressure-from-animal-rights-activists,2021-06-19
Ted Cruz handles NYT writer who said he has 'no business' using Frederick Douglass' name,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) caused some offense on Twitter on Friday by simply quoting a Frederick Douglass speech in context after Colin Kaepernick cherry-picked an anti-Independence Day excerpt — but the senator easily dispatched his detractors.

The backstory

Kaepernick quoted the following part of a Douglass speech:

""What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? This Fourth of July is yours, not mine…There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these United States at this very hour.""

Cruz replied to the tweet, pointing out that such an isolated quote could be misleading about Douglass' views on America, and went on to quote more of the speech.



The conflict

Cruz quoting Douglass more fully, and directing readers to read the entire speech, was unacceptable to New York Times editorial board member Mara Gay.

""Frederick Douglass is an American hero, and his name has no business in your mouth,"" Gay wrote to Cruz.

Cruz responded by pointing out that Gay's attack lacked any facts or substance.

""Let's see. You're on the editorial board of the NYT,"" Cruz wrote. ""You respond to any view you don't like, not with facts or reason, but w/ ad hominem attack. And you seem dismayed that I linked to Douglass's entire speech, so readers can judge for themselves. You represent your employer well.""

The resolution

Gay seemed to walk back her tweet, acknowledging that Cruz was right to point readers to the full speech and not just Kaepernick's excerpt.

""You're right. Everyone should read these remarks in their entirety,"" Gay replied. ""I was offended because I felt Douglass' powerful words were being used to diminish an American who has tried to make the country fairer for all. In that spirit, peace and Happy Independence Day weekend to you.""

Not the only one



Gay wasn't the only New Yorker to bristle at Cruz quoting Douglass. New York City councilman John Brannan wrote that ""Ted Cruz should not be 'clarifying' Frederick Douglass.""

Cruz easily dismissed the remark.

""I know for NYC elected Dems words can lack 'meaning,' but directly quoting at length is not 'clarifying' (nor is linking to the entire brilliant speech)."" Cruz replied. ""But selectively quoting Douglass to make him seem like a modern America-hating Leftist is, well, the opposite of 'clarifying.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teacher-claims-fired-for-trump-tweet,2019-07-06
Ted Cruz and John Brennan battle on Twitter over Logan Act,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former CIA director John Brennan traded barbs regarding the killing of Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.

""This was a criminal act & highly reckless. It risks lethal retaliation & a new round of regional conflict,"" Brennan wrote on Twitter. ""Iranian leaders would be wise to wait for the return of responsible American leadership on the global stage & to resist the urge to respond against perceived culprits.""



""I do not know whether a foreign government authorized or carried out the murder of Fakhrizadeh,"" Brennan continued. ""Such an act of state-sponsored terrorism would be a flagrant violation of international law & encourage more governments to carry out lethal attacks against foreign officials.""

""These assassinations are far different than strikes against terrorist leaders & operatives of groups like al-Qaida & Islamic State, which are not sovereign states,"" he tweeted. ""As illegitimate combatants under international law, they can be targeted in order to stop deadly terrorist attacks.""

Cruz reacted by saying, ""It's bizarre to see a former head of the CIA consistently side with Iranian zealots who chant 'Death to America.' And reflexively condemn Israel. Does Joe Biden agree?""

Brennan, who was director of the CIA between 2013 and 2017, retorted, ""It is typical for you to mischaracterize my comment.""

""Your lawless attitude & simple-minded approach to serious national security matters demonstrate that you are unworthy to represent the good people of Texas,"" Brennan said, besmirching the senator.

Cruz then hit back, by pointing out that Brennan voted for Gus Hall, a U.S. Communist Party candidate who only secured 0.07% of the vote in 1976.

""Gosh, I touched a nerve. Facts matter,"" Cruz tweeted. ""FACT 1: you've admitted, in 1976 you voted for the Communist candidate for President because, I guess, Jimmy Carter wasn't liberal enough for you.""

Then the Texas senator took aim at the Obama administration's cozy relationship with the Iranian government.

""FACT 2: you gave $150 Bn to Ayatollah Khamenei, knowing it would be used to kill Americans,"" Cruz said.

The two then exchanged blows about the Logan Act, which ""forbids private citizens from engaging in unauthorized correspondence with foreign governments,"" and nobody has been indicted on the legislation since 1852.

""@tedcruz is now misrepresenting the Logan Act. Apparently, he is a poor Senator & a bad lawyer,"" Brennan wrote. ""A private citizen publicly criticizing what could be a state-sponsored assassination of a government official & cautioning against retaliatory killing is called freedom of speech.""

""In contrast, an individual tapped to be National Security Advisor (but not yet one) in an incoming Administration who privately contacts a foreign government official & advises how to conduct relations with the U.S. could be in violation of the Logan Act,"" Brennan said.

""My commitment to Israel's security & my efforts to counter Iran's malign activities are well documented throughout my 33 years of national security work serving Republican & Democratic Administrations,"" Brennan stated, then attacked Cruz. ""Aside from his tiresome rhetoric, what has Senator Cruz ever done?""



Cruz fired back, ""Ok, let's apply your proffered standard: Ben Rhodes has publicly stated, 'foreign leaders are already having phone calls with Joe Biden, talking about the agenda they're going to pursue on Jan. 20.' Does that mean you think Joe Biden should be prosecuted under the Logan Act?""

""The only coherent answer is NO, neither Biden nor Gen. Flynn violated the Logan Act bc it's unconstitutional—which is why nobody has been convicted of violating it in the history of the US,"" Cruz contended. ""But you want to use it as a partisan cudgel, a weapon to attack your political opponents.""

Fakhrizadeh, who was considered the top architect of Iran's nuclear program, was gunned down in a road ambush in broad daylight on Friday. The black sedan the scientist was traveling in was riddled with bullets.



Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the assassination was ""an act of state terror,"" there were ""serious indications"" of Israeli involvement.

On Saturday, Iran's supreme leader promised to retaliate for the killing of Fakhrizadeh. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei demanded that Iranian officials make a pledge into ""pursuing this crime and punishing its perpetrators and those who commanded it.""

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani vowed that the Islamic republic ""will respond in time to the assassination of Martyr Fakhrizadeh.""



""Once again, the evil hands of Global Arrogance and the Zionist mercenaries were stained with the blood of an Iranian son,"" Rouhani added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-critical-race-theory-racist,2020-11-28
Ted Cruz Twitter thread slams WaPo coronavirus origin video,"Sen. Ted Cruz decided to fact-check the fact-checkers over the origins of the coronavirus and China's responsibility for the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Washington Post has released a video titled ""Did coronavirus accidentally escape from a Wuhan lab? It's doubtful."" In the 10-minute video, WaPo talks to virologists, professors, and health experts to try to determine the origin of the coronavirus.

Glenn Kessler, editor and chief writer of Washington Post's Fact Checker, said the video is ""amazing"" and shared a link to the video on his Twitter account.

Cruz watched the video and disagreed with WaPo over its claims that coronavirus didn't come from a Chinese lab in Wuhan.

""'Amazing' is definitely right word for this video. WaPo 'abandoning all pretenses of journalism to produce CCP propaganda' would be another way to put it,"" Cruz tweeted. ""If this reporter submitted this video in a freshman logic class, it wouldn't receive a passing grade. Let's review facts.""

Cruz picked apart the video and challenged the fact-checkers by presenting his own facts in a Twitter thread.

FACT 1: WaPo admits two separate labs in Wuhan were studying coronaviruses derived from bats. One lab was just 300 yards from Wuhan wet market.



FACT 2: WaPo admits bats with similar coronaviruses ""live in caves 1000 miles away.""



FACT 3: WaPo admits both labs had SERIOUS ... safety concerns, resulting in multiple US Dept wires—before this crisis—warning that shoddy safety protocols could lead to a global coronavirus pandemic.



FACT 4: WaPo admits China DESTROYED the lab samples after the pandemic started (raising the natural inference that they were afraid what the samples, if examined, would show. ALL OF THESE FACTS strongly suggest the virus escaped from one of these CCP labs. At this point, the evidence is circumstantial (because the CCP is hiding/blocking any direct evidence). BUT what is WaPo's conclusion? ""The balance of scientific evidence strongly suggest the conclusion that the new coronavirus emerged from nature, be it in the Wuhan market or somewhere else."" This is a non sequitur. None of the aforementioned evidence leads to that conclusion. What's WaPo's basis?

Cruz then poked holes in WaPo's facts and questioned the experts who were used in the fact-check video.

WaPo COUNTER-FACT ONE: The CCP and the lab director (who initially wrote ""could [the pandemic virus] have come from our lab?"") now deny it. ""Shi, her team & the Chinese govt have adamantly denied that it could have come from this lab."" WaPa takes that denial as true.



WaPo COUNTER-FACT TWO: They quote Dr. Peter Daszak, the head of ""EcoHealth Alliance"" as saying ""China's been incredibly open. I believe it's because it's a scientific collaboration & in China they're really proud of their science; they do good work, especially in virology."" That's it. Those two counter-facts form 100% of the basis for WaPo's ""fact check."" And #2, the claim that ""China's been incredibly open,"" is laughably absurd. They DESTROYED THE LAB SAMPLES. They PUNISHED & SILENCED the pandemic whistleblowers. And who is this objective source, Dr. Daszak? Well, his organization, ""EcoHealth Alliance"" was receiving (now cancelled) US taxpayer $ to support bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology! Why does WaPo NOT disclose his enormous bias, litigation exposure & conflict of interest??



And is it relevant that WaPo is owned by Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, who stands to make billions in China if he pleases the communist overlords? Whatever WaPo is doing, this is NOT journalism. It is apologizing for the CCP, trying to cover up their culpability.

It also doesn't help that China has reportedly refused to allow the World Health Organization to participate in an investigation into the origin of the coronavirus.



The U.S. intelligence community has launched an investigation into the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, and while they have ruled out that the virus is a bioweapon, they have found no proof that the coronavirus did not come from a virology lab in Wuhan.

President Donald Trump doesn't believe that the coronavirus started in the wet markets in Wuhan, and said he has a high degree of confidence that the coronavirus originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-handles-nyt-writer-who-said-he-has-no-business-using-frederick-douglass-name,2020-05-03
Top House Republican predicts 'people will die' in imminent armed conflict with China,"The top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation has a stark warning about the future of U.S.-Chinese relations.

According to Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), armed conflict between the United States and China is imminent.

""I would predict there will be a clash within the next three to six months,"" Yoho told the Washington Examiner.

Relations with China have deteriorated in recent years. The erosion has been accelerated by President Donald Trump's trade war with Beijing and the coronavirus pandemic. China has also stepped up its espionage efforts in recent years, forcing the FBI to open a new China-related counterintelligence investigation every 10 hours, FBI Director Christopher Wray revealed last week.



Some national security experts have said China is waging a ""cold war"" against the U.S. — but Yoho said nothing will be ""cold"" about an impending Chinese attack.

In fact, the Florida Republican predicted armed conflict will be triggered by a Chinese naval attack against the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which often commands a strong presence in the South China Sea.

""Knowing China, I think what they would do is ram one of our ships and say it was a mistake,"" Yoho told the Examiner.

""To sink a carrier would be a huge mistake, to attack any of our ships would be a huge mistake, but I think they're willing to risk that to test the waters,"" he explained. ""And unfortunately, people will die. It would just be a mistake if they did that, for them.""

Last week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said U.S. policy on China is based on ""ill-informed strategic miscalculation"" and ""is fraught with emotions and whims and McCarthyist bigotry."" The foreign ministry also said that Washington's belief that China is a threat ""may turn into self-fulfilling prophecies at the end of the day.""

According to Yoho, Beijing is talking tough only because the U.S. is standing up to its bully mentality.

""The United States is willing to stand up to them, and that may force China's hand,"" Yoho told the Examiner. ""That'll be something that they will lose, and they will regret, but we can't be intimidated because that might happen. I think the real threat is, if we don't do anything, we know that it'll happen. And then, that'll give more strength to China to keep doing what they're doing. So, you know, let's just hope that diplomacy works and China backs off.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-john-brennan-iran-logan-act,2020-07-13
Teenager who allegedly brutally murdered his girlfriend's ex a year ago has finally been charged — and he may have murdered someone else in the meantime,"A teenager who supposedly shot his girlfriend's ex on video and in front of several witnesses a year ago has finally been charged with murder — after he allegedly murdered someone else.

On November 7, 2021, Adrian Soto, now 19, accompanied his girlfriend to the parking lot of a neighborhood grocery store in southwestern Chicago where she had arranged to meet her ex-boyfriend so that she could pick up the children she shared with him.

Her ex, a 22-year-old man named Nicholas John Narolewski, arrived at the parking lot with their two children and his mother. Soto's girlfriend got out of her vehicle and retrieved the children from Narolewski's car and returned to her vehicle. Narolewski followed her. Soto then got out of the car and began arguing with Narolewski.

At some point during their heated exchange, Soto allegedly drew a 9mm handgun and shot Narolewski, who was unarmed, six times in the face and body.

Soto then allegedly fled into a nearby alley, where he discarded the gun and the hoodie he had been wearing. Police said they were able to recover both items and that DNA evidence on them matched Soto's DNA. The hoodie also had traces of gunpowder, and the shell casings recovered from the scene matched the gun, police claimed.

Police also alleged that several witnesses who personally know Soto identified him as the shooter. Surveillance footage likewise captured the shooting and indicated that Soto was responsible.

Despite the overwhelming evidence police were able to collect, Soto was not charged in the incident until earlier this month, though the reason he had not been charged for so long is unclear.

That failure to arrest Soto a year ago may have had deadly consequences for another man. According to police records, Soto was arrested less than three months after Narolewski's violent death for yet another murder — this time of an ex-girlfriend's new lover.

According to court documents, on January 26, 2022, Soto saw on a Facebook livestream that his ex-girlfriend had thrown a party attended by her new boyfriend as well as some family and friends. Later that night, long after the party had ended, prosecutors alleged that Soto sent a series of Snapchats to her, stating that if he couldn't have her, then no one could. One message also reportedly threatened that she and her new boyfriend would soon ""catch shots.""

Then, at around 2:30 a.m., Soto supposedly drove over to her residence in a stolen car and fired several gunshots at the house. One of the shots allegedly struck and killed Hector Flores, who was sleeping at the time. Conflicting reports list Flores' age at either 31 or 33. Whether he was the ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend is unclear, as is whether the same woman is connected to each incident.

Two days after Flores' death, Soto was arrested for first-degree murder, attempted murder, possession of a stolen vehicle, and various weapons charges. His public defender has stated that, since January, Soto has worked on earning his GED. The attorney also claimed that Soto had been bullied and had ""encountered some troubling moments"" in high school, which may prove relevant to the accusations against him.

Soto, who has no criminal history, has pled not guilty to the January shooting. He was being held without bail when he was arrested last week for the murder of Narolewski. He is expected to appear in court again on Nov. 23.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-twitter-wapo-china-coronavirus,2022-11-11
Teens murdered dad 'execution'-style because he took away their laptops: Police,"Four South Carolina teenagers are in custody, facing serious charges, after they allegedly lured a man out of his apartment and then shot him to death.

On November 14, four teens — three of whom are 14 and one of whom is 15 — allegedly arrived at the apartment in Rock Hill, South Carolina, approximately an hour north of Columbia, where 38-year-old Larry Ingram Jr. lived. According to reports, the teens then enticed Ingram to exit his apartment by kicking and throwing objects at his door.

Once Ingram walked outside his apartment, police say the teens shot him in the back. Once he was on the ground, he was shot once again. WSOC-TV reported that ""one of the teens shot Ingram several times."" It is unclear whether Ingram died immediately or later succumbed to his injuries.

Rock Hill police Detective Eric Olson called the shooting ""an execution.""

The four teens were arrested hours later after police found the murder weapon, a Glock handgun, wrapped in clothing and tossed in nearby wooded area. There are conflicting reports about whether all four will face murder charges, though at least three of them will. All four have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder.

Police say that two of the four teens are related to Ingram and were motivated to murder him because he took away their laptop computers after they abused their Instagram privileges. They also reportedly resented other disciplinary measures he has imposed on them in the past.

News reports have referred to Ingram as ""a father,"" and a woman claiming to be the victim's sister asserted that two of the teens are, indeed, Ingram's ""sons.""

""His sons just wasn't, you know, they wasn't ready to accept discipline,"" Kimberly Ingram told WSOC-TV through tears. ""And it's very hard on our family, because, not only did I lose my brother ... we dealing with my nephews as well.""

Ms. Ingram has asked for prayers for herself and her family during ""this tragedy of our life.""

On Tuesday, three of the four teens appeared before Visiting Family Court Judge Kimaka Nichols-Graham, who ordered all four juvenile suspects to be held in custody pending trial. The state is hoping to try the three as adults. The fourth is expected to appear in court in the coming days.



Though prosecutor Kevin Bracket expressed gratitude that the teens will remain in custody, he seemed to acknowledge that the overall situation is as heartbreaking as it is outrageous.

""Seeing little kids come into court facing those kind of charges always just hurts the heart. So there’s that,"" Bracket said. ""The allegations are horrible. There is no question about that. I think it’s appropriate that they be detained while we sort this out.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-yoho-armed-conflict-china,2022-11-30
A movement is spreading: Teens are reportedly seeking vaccinations without parental consent,"In the midst of a public debate over exemptions for childhood vaccines, there's evidently a movement afoot by kids raised in anti-vax households who are trying to get immunized without parental consent.

What are the details?

Several news outlets have reported that unvaccinated teens are taking to Reddit to ask adults for advice on how they can get the shots without their parents knowing.

Salon tracked down two young adults who posted online to tell their stories. One was 18-year-old Laura from Colorado who said she was seeking her own options because she needs a number of shots in order to attend college.

""I plan to get Hepatitis A and B, MMR, the flu, HPV, TDaP [tetanus, diptheria and pertussis], and many other immunizations that I was 'exempt' from,"" she wrote in an email, adding that the re-emergence of measles has made her ""seriously anxious.""

A 23-year-old Canadian told Salon that she started researching how to get immunized on her own around the age of 13. Eventually, she was vaccinated for ""everything,"" she said, but did not mention at which age she was able to have the shots administered.

Romper and Fatherly both quoted comments purportedly submitted by minors on Reddit. User /u/Danny691261 posted, ""I am writing because I am the 15 year old son of an anti-vaccine parent. I have spent the last 4 years trying to convince my mother that vaccines are safe. I haven't succeeded. So instead I am trying to research how to be vaccinated without my mother's consent.""

In a thread for those seeking legal advice, a user who claimed to be 13 years old wrote, ""I haven't got vaccines since elementary school, Dad fell down the conspiracy theory rabbit hole, and my Mom agrees with him. Any and all advice is appreciated.""

Fatherly points out that even if health care providers were legally able to provide minors with vaccines behind their parents' backs, ""in most cases it would get billed to the parent's insurance, likely (causing) conflict between the child and their families.""

According to an investigation by KREM-TV, teens under the age of majority are generally prohibited from obtaining shots without their parents' permission in the U.S. There are, however, some exceptions under what is referred to as the ""mature minor doctrine,"" where teens who can prove a certain level of independence such as being emancipated or pregnant, for instance — and are able to find a health care provider willing to give them the shots knowing they could be sued.



Anything else?

Recent measles outbreaks in the U.S. have reignited the debate over whether non-medical exemptions to inoculations should be allowed. Anti-vaxxers say the government should not have the right to demand citizens receive such jabs against their will, while some vaccination proponents argue those who opt out of having their kids vaccinated put others at risk.

Only three states prohibit all non-medical exemptions. Anti-vaxxers cite an array of reasons for forgoing the shots for their kids, including religious and personal beliefs.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teenager-charged-in-brutal-murder-arrested-another-murder-meantime,2019-02-11
"'Tell him I will thrash them,' Putin reportedly declares as he rejects a handwritten bid for peace from Zelenskyy","Roman Abramovich, the former owner of the Chelsea FC soccer team, in recent weeks has been serving as an impromptu diplomat as he works to convey messages between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Abramovich, a fabulously wealthy Russian businessman, is currently attempting to avoid Western sanctions on his wealth by residing in Istanbul, Turkey. Aside from his business endeavors, Abramovich is well known for his close relationship with Putin.

From his residence in Turkey, Abramovich has been acting as a “peacemaker,” according to the Daily Mail, as he flies back and forth between Moscow and Ukraine communicating with Putin and Zelenskyy.

Last Wednesday, Abramovich left his Istanbul residence aboard a private jet for Moscow.

The oligarch flew into the Russian capital to meet with Putin and give him a handwritten note from Zelenskyy that outlined Ukraine’s terms for peace.

In response to this, Putin is reported to have said, “Tell him I will thrash them.”

After meeting with Putin in Moscow, Abramovich returned to Istanbul, where he met with the Ukrainian politician turned negotiator Rustem Umerov.

In Turkey, Abramovich and Umerov were assisted in negotiations with Ibrahim Kalin, the spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Kalin suggested that Ukrainian officials make a deal with their Russian counterparts in which Crimea and Donbas be held under a long-term lease — similar to the situation between Britain and China regarding Hong Kong.

Putin is reportedly considering the agreement, but his intense frustration with his military’s lack of success and disdain for Zelenskyy are holding him back.

Abramovich is one of several Russian oligarchs seeking refuge from Western sanctions in Turkey. He currently has two of his superyachts moored in Bodrum, a city on the country’s southwest coast.

Abramovich, in particular, has been able to work around sanctions from the Turkish government, despite his close relationship with Putin, because of his utility and willingness to participate in and assist with peace talks.

Previous peace talks hosted by Turkey between Russian and Ukrainian coalitions reportedly failed.

This experience is not unique, however.

Efforts to secure peace are proving to be increasingly difficult as the conflict drags on.

Leadership in the Israeli government has also run into trouble trying to advocate for peace.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke with Zelenskyy over the phone in mid-March and urged him to accept Putin’s conditions for peace, including an immediate cease to military action, enshrining geopolitical neutrality in the Ukrainian constitution, officially recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, and recognizing Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

Zelenskyy was not agreeable to these terms.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teens-murdered-dad-execution-style-because-he-took-away-their-laptops-police,2022-03-28
Terrified mother to 911 about protesters: 'They're on my car right now',"A terrified mother's 911 call about protesters in the streets of Fredericksburg, Virginia, has garnered the attention not only of a regional radio host but also Fox News' Tucker Carlson.

What are the details?

The incident took place June 13 during a protest authorized by the city, according to Fredericksburg Today. The caller to 911, Tara Durant, complained to the dispatcher about protesters blocking an intersection — and then things got intense after the dispatcher told her that ""unless you're hurt or something or get in an accident, our officers can't intervene.""

Durant told the dispatcher that the protesters were gesturing at her car and beginning to get ""really threatening.""

After the dispatcher told her that she ""cannot hit people with your car,"" Durant updated the situation, saying, ""They're are on my car, all right? They're on my car right now!""

The dispatcher's reply? ""We can't do anything, ma'am. The city told us that this is a sanctioned event.""



Durant soon was panicking: ""Get out of my car!"" she screamed at protesters. ""You know, this is gonna get dangerous! I've got a kid here!""

'We suggest that you call up City Hall'

""Yes, ma'am,"" the dispatcher replied. ""We would suggest that you call up City Hall to let them know about your frustrations.""

""Get out of the way! ... This is getting scary!"" Durant yelled, adding, ""I cannot get out of here, OK? Get out of the way! ... They're on my car! They're on my car!""

Soon she was in tears: ""They're on my car right now! ... I've got a little girl in the car crying! Are you kidding me?""

Finally Durant was able to get away, and that's when the call ended.

What was the reaction?

Durant spoke to Charlottesville radio host Rob Schilling last week about the incident. Below is their interview, which includes the entire 911 call. The segment begins just before the 19-minute mark:

'Absolute abomination'

Durant told Schilling that her ""very scared"" 12-year-old daughter was ""traumatized"" by the incident and was ""afraid"" the protesters were going to hurt her or her mother and ""wants justice.""

She added that her husband did contact City Hall and that she contacted Mayor Mary Katherine Greenlaw and the city council to little avail. But Durant said one officer who heard the 911 call told her, ""We're as frustrated as you are.""

""I would like to see our community return to a place where it's safe,"" she told Schilling. ""I want my children to be able to go into downtown Fredericksburg again and walk around and get ice cream and not feel like it's not a safe situation."" Durant added that it's an ""absolute abomination to ever even designate them as peaceful protesters.""

Tucker chimes in

Tucker Carlson featured Durant's 911 call on his Fox News program and also offered his reaction to it:

Tucker plays 911 call in Fredericksburg, VA youtu.be

How did the city react?

The City of Fredericksburg offered the following statement to Fredericksburg Today:

The protest on June 13th was authorized by the City Government and monitored by the Police Department. Officers were staged one block from the demonstrations to divert traffic while protesters exercised their First Amendment rights. Unfortunately, protesters did not advise police where they would march, and some vehicles were not able to be diverted.



The 911 Communications Officer informed the caller that the protest was a City authorized event and officers were monitoring the activity from afar. When the caller stated a person jumped on her vehicle (exhibiting criminal behavior), the Communications Officer notified officers staged nearby of the situation.



When officers arrived at the demonstration, the caller had vacated the area. A Patrol Division Sergeant followed up with the caller by phone the following day and began his investigation. Public safety for everyone is the number one priority of the Police Department and the Sergeant exhausted all available resources to identify the suspect who jumped on her vehicle. His investigation continues.

Anything else?

According to local paper the Free Lance Star, a representative of various protesting groups said a 13-year-old boy who wasn't with the protesters did jump on Durant's car and that the group immediately pulled the boy away.

""We do not condone or participate in that type of behavior,"" the protesters wrote in a statement to the paper.

Durant responded to the Free Lance Star's story in her Facebook page saying the paper ""did not make any attempt to interview me and my little girl to determine the facts of what happened.""

More from her post:

The Fredericksburg Police have actively searched for video evidence. My daughter and I saw several cell phones presumably capturing what was transpiring. None have surfaced. I challenge these protestors to prove the false assertion I attempted to run protestors over. There is no doubt that video evidence would have been produced had there been a shred of truth to what they are saying now.



But therein lies the problem. These protestors cannot get a consistent story straight. Case in point: the conflicting articles published by the Free Lance Star and Potomac Local.



For weeks, various protestors have vehemently denied the incident occurred. Now, there has been acknowledgment, according to the Free Lance Star, that someone did in fact jump on my car; allegedly a minor 13 year old boy not affiliated with a protest group. This is news to both me and the Fredericksburg Police.



Conversely, The Potomac Local also published an article today on the incident. The Potomac Local interviewed protestors who deny anyone jumped onto my car.



The protestors who were interviewed for both articles have acknowledged they laid hands on my car, ostensibly to prevent me from striking the protestors on the road. This is a lie. As heard in my 911 call, I was unable to move due to my car being surrounded. I was only allowed to proceed onto Caroline Street after a motorcyclist that we have since identified in various other protest videos ordered the protestors off of my car. He then repeatedly swore at us to get the f*** out of there.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teens-reportedly-seeking-vaccinations-without-parental-consent,2020-06-29
"Armed 'anarchist and anti-fascist' attempted to firebomb ICE facility in Tacoma, killed in confrontation with police","On Saturday, a man armed with a rifle and Molotov cocktails or flares, according to reports, and angered by ""factually inaccurate portrayal"" of the facility, according to the company operating the facility, attempted to set fire to an ICE detention center in Tacoma, Washington.

In a subsequent confrontation with police, the Antifa activist was killed. And some of his fellow activists called him a martyr for it.

Nevertheless, the media has not reported any connection with Antifa, nor are they speculating about what may have motivated this man, who made the attempt to set fire to the building amid protests against the building.

On the CNN and MSNBC websites, you'll need to hunt to find the story at all, in fact. CNN's on air report, in particular, is striking in its above-and-beyond effort to remove this bomber from anything even remotely related to objections to ICE facilities or, one can surmise, calling them ""concentration camps.""

The Seattle Times, however, reported extensively.

Willem Van Spronsen, who has been arrested before during immigration protests at this very facility, was shot and killed on Saturday. Police say the man threw his incendiary devices at the building, striking some vehicles and setting them ablaze, while armed with a rifle. He also attempted to ignite a propane tank.

Police reported ""shots fired,"" although it is unclear who fired first. Emergency responders found Van Spronsen dead when they arrived.

Here's an early report from local station KING 5 News in Seattle.

A friend of the man spoke with the Seattle Times. She believes it was his intent that this end in his own death. And her description of him politically should raise the eyebrows of anyone living in the state of Washington. Because it is a familiar one.

Deb Bartley, a friend of Van Spronsen's for about 20 years, described him as an anarchist and anti-fascist, and she believes his attack on the detention center was intended to provoke a fatal conflict.



""He was ready to end it,"" Bartley said. ""I think this was a suicide. But then he was able to kind of do it in a way that spoke to his political beliefs … I know he went down there knowing he was going to die.""

She said he is an ""anti-fascist."" Yet the press refuses to use the word ""antifa"" here.

Nevertheless, as Sooper pointed out at The Right Scoop, fellow ""anti-fascists"" were quick to claim him. And praise him. Here is just one example. But there are more.



His name was Willem Van Spronsen of Vashon Island, Wash.

Age 69.

The announcement was disclosed in an internal email to employees in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, CNBC reported. The outlet noted, however, that it wasn’t immediately clear whether the policy had been or would be extended to employees in North America and elsewhere around the globe.

The company reportedly said that after the three-month time period, it would reassess the situation depending on how the conflict is going.

""For any Tesla employees who is a Ukrainian national and has been asked to return to Ukraine for active duty as a reservist, we will maintain their employment and salary for 3 months, with a view to assessing after this period as needed,"" read the email, sent by Axel Tangen, Tesla's director of Northern Europe.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called up military reservists late last month as Russian troops continued to mass around the country's borders. Only days later, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion, sending Europe into its bloodiest land war since World War II.

Since the start of the invasion, Zelenskyy has leaned on the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people, promising to supply weaponry to any citizen who would remain and fight.

The United States and several other Western nations have responded to Russia's unprovoked attack by heavily sanctioning the invading country while supplying Ukraine with a deluge of armaments and high-tech weaponry.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, too, has been aiding the war efforts. Tangen's email announcing the three-month pay for military policy shed light on Musk's enterprise to quickly bring fortified internet service to Ukraine.

""Tesla teamed up with SpaceX to provide coverage expansion for its Starlink services to help provide an alternative internet infrastructure,"" Tangen wrote, noting that volunteers tested, configured, and shipped several hundred Starlink units to Ukraine this month.

He added that ""in true Tesla fashion, the solution has been put together in less than 3 days.""

Additionally, Tesla’s Energy team assembled and provided lithium-ion battery storage systems known as Tesla Powerwalls to run the Starlink equipment.

Ukraine vice prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov, who also oversees digital transformation for the country, personally thanked Musk on Twitter, writing, ""Received the second shipment of Starlink stations! [Elon Musk] keeps his word! Thank you for supporting Ukraine and peace in the entire world!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/terrified-mother-911-call-protesters,2022-03-10
Texas bill would prohibit colleges from rejecting speakers just because they're controversial,"The Texas Senate passed a bill this week aimed at prohibiting schools from banning speakers on campus due to the controversial nature of their content or reputation, according to The Dallas Morning News.

The bill is SB 18, authored by state Sen. Joan Huffman, a Republican from Houston, who believes that as long as speech is protected under the Constitution, it should be allowed on public college and university campuses.

""The bill requires that universities embrace the idea that each and every person at the university has a constitutional right to speak freely,"" Huffman said. ""Just because speech is offensive does not mean that it's not protected.""

What does the bill do?

One of the key purposes of the bill is to set specific regulations regarding the grounds on which a university may reject a speaker from appearing on campus. From the bill:

""In determining whether to approve a speaker to speak on campus or in determining the amount of a fee to be charged for use of the institution's facilities for purposes of engaging in expressive activities, an institution of higher education: (1) may consider only content-neutral and viewpoint-neutral criteria related to the needs of the event ... (2) [an institution of higher education] may not consider (A) the anticipated attendance of persons not intending to participate in the event; or (B) any anticipated controversy related to the event.""

The bill also includes language protecting student organizations from any punishment or denial of benefits ""on the basis of a political, religious, philosophical, ideological, or academic viewpoint expressed by the organization or of any expressive activities of the organization.""

Why was this bill created?

Some Texas schools have had issues with politically-motivated student organization conflicts, and with controversial speakers, according to The Dallas Morning News.

Young Conservatives at the University of Texas reportedly had disputes with liberal students over a table on campus supporting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, resulting in damage to the Young Conservatives' signs.

Texas A&M stirred controversy by hosting Richard Spencer on campus in 2016, and then rejecting him in 2017 in light of the violence and the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/terror-armed-antifa-member-attempts-to-firebomb-ice-facility-in-washington-is-killed-in-confrontation-with-police,2019-03-21
Texas college student leaders want Chick-fil-A thrown off campus — and their vote is unanimous,"The senate of Trinity University's Student Government Association unanimously passed a resolution recommending the removal of Chick-fil-A from the San Antonio campus, the Trinitonian reported.

""Trinity's values of diversity and inclusion and Chick-fil-a's values regarding the LGBT+ community are mutually exclusive,"" last week's resolution said, according to the San Antonio Express-News.

In March, the city of San Antonio banned Chick-fil-A from its airport over the restaurant's ""legacy of anti-LGBTQ"" behavior.

'Looks really bad'

""Obviously [the presence of Chick-fil-A] has the potential to make a lot of people feel uncomfortable on campus, and also it looks really bad for Trinity in the context of recruiting potential students who may be a part of the LGBTQ community,"" senator Claire Carlson told the Trinitonian.

Chick-fil-A doesn't have a permanent presence at the private college but is one of several chains at the Commons Food Court that come to campus on a rotating basis, typically once every two weeks, the Express-News said.

The May 1 resolution cited Chick-fil-A's donations to the Salvation Army, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and the Paul Anderson Youth Home, as well as its score of zero on the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign's 2015 Corporate Equality Index ""for failing to protect their LGBT+ employees from discrimination in the workplace,"" the Express-News added.

""Underrepresented students from the LGBT+ community have expressed the drastic assault on their identities and beings as a result of Chick-fil-a's ideals and actions, and SGA stands to represent all students regardless of the size of the community,"" the resolution added, the paper said. ""Trinity is a university that emphasizes its commitment to diversity and inclusion. Having Chick-fil-a in the rotation at Revolve conflicts with those values.""

Ty Tinker, student government president, told the Express-News the SGA decided to go after Chick-fil-A when ""a lot of proactive folks, including PRIDE [Trinity's student LGBT group], came to student government and university administrators.""

Small minority



But student Christopher Ault told the Express-News that only a small minority of students have pushed to oust Chick-fil-A: ""I like the values that it stands for,"" he told the paper in reference to the restaurant's Christian values.

Isaiah Mitchell, president of Trinity's Young Conservatives of Texas, told the Express-News that Chick-fil-A's donations do not harm LGBTQ people.

""The Salvation Army, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, these other organizations that Chick-fil-A supports, do not actually cause harm to the LGBT community,"" he told the paper, noting that standing ""against the political goals of the LGBTQ left"" does not rise to the level of ""actually harming.""

The Trinity student government's resolution in and of itself doesn't affect Chick-fil-A's on-campus presence, but it can be sent to administrators for their consideration.

Anything else?

The vice chair of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's academic senate likened Chick-fil-A to ""pornography"" as the faculty body earlier this week voted overwhelmingly to kick the restaurant off campus after 25 years.

"Chaos erupts in Texas as judges issue conflicting orders regarding the release of over 1,000 inmates from Harris County Jail","One of the lesser-covered hot button political issues caused by the coronavirus pandemic has been the large-scale release of prisoners from jails and prisons across the country as officials attempt to avoid coronavirus outbreaks among inmates in the close quarters of criminal incarceration.

Lawsuits have been filed by the ACLU and other organizations across the country arguing that it is unconstitutional or otherwise illegal to incarcerate inmates during the pandemic outbreak, based on a number of legal theories. Residents, meanwhile, have expressed anxiety concerning the release of prisoners while police resources are increasingly tied up managing the coronavirus outbreak, and police departments have been disproportionately hit with COVID cases.

This has played out in dramatic fashion in Harris County, Texas, which contains a large portion of the Houston metropolitan area and is the third most populous county in the nation. There, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo announced earlier this week that she planned to issue an order that would release over 1,000 prisoners from jail in an attempt to avoid a ""public health catastrophe."" Hidalgo stated that her order would not apply to anyone with a violent record and that the prosecuting DA would have to sign off on each prisoner's release.

Hidalgo issued the order on Wednesday, and Harris County Sheriffs began combing through inmates to identify the most ""medically vulnerable"" inmates for possible release. The order sparked widespread community unrest and unease, until criminal court supervisory judge Herb Ritchie issued an extraordinary order on Friday, commanding Harris County sheriffs to ignore Hidalgo's order as ""null and void,"" and threatening them with contempt and/or fines if they continued to release felony prisoners.

According to Ritchie's order, felony defendants' cases are the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of one of the ""22 felony district courts"" in the state, and any order issued by a county judge ordering their release is ""VOID ON ITS FACE and of NO FORCE AND EFFECT."" The order goes on to direct the Harris County Sheriffs to ""IGNORE and WHOLLY DISREGARD any order and/or directive from the Harris County Judge regarding... any [] order of release, as the same purports to affect felony inmates or probationers now in custody of Harris County Sheriffs or the Harris County Community Corrections and Supervision Department[.]""

The order concludes with a stern warning, threatening fines and possible jail time for any Harris County Sheriffs Department personnel who attempt to release prisoners under Judge Hidalgo's order.

Almost immediately, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez took to twitter to declare that he did not know how to resolve the conflicting orders, saying, ""This is obviously a legal matter and I have two conflicting legal documents. I'm a cop, not a lawyer. I'll let the lawyers figure it out.""

Prior to Judge Ritchie's order, seven inmates had been freed under Judge Hidalgo's order. Most legal observers in Texas believe that this case is headed for a hopefully speedy resolution before the Court of Criminal Appeals in Texas.

According to local news reports, so far three inmates in the Harris County corrections system have tested positive for coronavirus, with an additional 30 more displaying symptoms and awaiting test results. Approximately 800 inmates have been placed into quarantine.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-bill-would-prohibit-colleges-from-rejecting-speakers-just-because-theyre-controversial,2020-04-04
"A Texas judge just ordered all county residents to wear masks in public or face fines, jail time. But law enforcement is punching back hard.","A Texas judge in Harris County issued an order Wednesday demanding that all county residents wear masks in public or face a fine and possible jail time.

The new rules, which require adults and children age 10 and over to cover their nose and mouth when venturing outside the home, were ordered by Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo. The rules will go into effect Monday and last for 30 days (or May 27), according to a report by the Houston Chronicle.

The report notes that residents do not need to purchase N95 masks to be in compliance, but that acceptable coverings include homemade masks, scarfs, bandanas, or handkerchiefs.

Violators of the new mask rules could face a harsh penalty, including a fine of up to $1,000 and a maximum of 180 days in jail.

Houston law enforcement isn't having it

In response to the ruling Wednesday, the unions representing Houston police officers and Harris County deputies shot back saying their officers do not intend to enforce the new mandate.

""The citizens of Harris County are working hard together through this pandemic and do not need the added stress and fear of being fined or arrested for failing to wear a mask/face covering they may not have,"" said David Cuevas, president of the Harris County Deputies Organization, in a statement.

Houston Police Officers Union President Joe Gamaldi called the order ""draconian."" He added that the union has reached out to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office ""seeking an opinion on the legality of imposing a criminal penalty/fine for anyone not wearing a mask in public.""

In the meantime, Gamaldi said, officers have been reminded that they have ""discretion"" in such matters.

Does the judge have the authority?

It was not immediately obvious whether or not Hidalgo has the authority to implement such an order during the county's declared emergency.

But in a radio interview with Glenn Beck Wednesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) argued that during a crisis, the governor's disaster declaration trumps that of local jurisdictions.

""By law, when we are in a time of disaster, it is the governor's disaster declaration that has the supremacy power over local disaster regulations,"" he said.

If that is indeed the case, a subsequent declaration by the governor could overrule Judge Hidalgo's order.

What else?

In Dallas County, commissioners voted on Tuesday to extend the county's stay-at-home order until May 15, according to the Dallas Morning News. Abbott could issue an order next Monday that would supersede the local order, but Judge Clay Jenkins said Tuesday that he believes the county's stay-at-home provisions won't conflict with the forthcoming changes at the state level because the local order will still direct people to stay home unless visiting a business that is allowed to open or for exercise.

Texas state rep submits bill that would make abortion a homicide,"A Texas state representative reintroduced a bill that would make abortion a homicide, sparking intense debate in the Texas state Legislature this week, according to The Washington Post.

Whose bill is it? The bill was authored by state Rep. Tony Tinderholt (R). He first introduced the bill during the 2017 legislative session. The Texas Legislature only convenes every two years. In 2017, Tinderholt received so many threats over the bill that he was placed under state protection.



What's in the bill? The bill seeks to amend Texas law to include abortion in the definition of criminal homicide. The way the penal code is currently written, abortion is explicitly excluded from the definition of homicide.



The bill, seemingly acknowledging the legal challenges it would face even if passed due to its conflict with Roe v. Wade, calls for its enforcement ""regardless of any contrary federal law, executive order, or court decision.""

Why did he submit this bill? Here's what Tinderholt said in 2017 when he first introduced the bill, according to the Texas Observer:



""Right now, it's real easy. Right now, they don't make it important to be personally responsible because they know that they have a backup of 'oh, I can just go get an abortion.' Now, we both know that consenting adults don't always think smartly sometimes. But consenting adults need to also consider the repercussions of the sexual relationship that they're gonna have, which is a child.""

Tinderholt also said his goal is simply to ""equalize"" the law, pointing out that people who kill pregnant women are charged twice.

What are opponents saying? ""I'm trying to reconcile in my head the arguments that I heard tonight about how essentially one is okay with subjecting a woman to the death penalty for the exact — to do to her the exact same thing that one is alleging she is doing to a child,"" said state Rep. Victoria Neave (D).

What's next? The bill is a longshot to pass, but that it has gotten a hearing in committee is already further than it got in 2017. The bill is still pending in the Committee on Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence.

Texas Supreme Court temporarily reinstates Abbott's ban on mask mandates,"The Texas Supreme Court on Thursday sided with Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and Attorney General Ken Paxton, temporarily blocking San Antonio and Bexar County from implementing a mask mandate.

At the request of Abbott and Paxton, the court granted a stay on the injunction issued by a lower court that permitted the mask mandate to move forward despite the governor's executive order banning public entities from implementing such requirements, KSAT-TV reports.

""The Texas Supreme Court has sided with the law, and the decision to enforce mask mandates lies with the governor's legislatively-granted authority,"" Paxton said in a statement praising the decision. ""Mask mandates across our state are illegal, and judges must abide by the law. Further non-compliance will result in more lawsuits.""

However, the matter is not concluded. The state supreme court must now review the case before deciding whether Abbott's order was legal.

""While I am personally disappointed in the order handed down today by the Texas Supreme Court, I will continue to do all that I can to fight for the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Bexar County,"" Bexar County District Attorney Joe Gonzales said. ""We are continuing to work with the City of San Antonio to determine the next steps in light of the order issued today.""

Earlier in August, Bexar County sued the Abbott administration, arguing the governor overstepped his bounds by barring local governments, schools, and other public entities from issuing mask requirements to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. District Court Judge Toni Arteaga, ruling in favor of the county, issued an injunction against Abbott's order, saying that schoolchildren were vulnerable given a recent surge of COVID-19 cases in Bexar County.

Abbott and Paxton appealed the case to the state supreme court after the Fourth Court of Appeals upheld the injunction last week on Aug. 19.

The County's lawyers have argued that the governor's executive orders contradict Texas Health and Safety Code, which gives local health officials the power to enact restrictions including mask requirements for public health reasons.

The governor's administration counters that the governor has the authority to issue a prohibition on mask mandates under the Texas Disaster Act. The administration further argues that localized mask mandates are adding to ""statewide confusion arising from the multiple, conflicting orders that courts at all levels of the judiciary have issued in the past several weeks.""

Aside from Bexar County at large, several local San Antionio area school districts have enacted their own mask requirements in violation of Abbott's order, which according to KSAT-TV could remain in effect until they are challenged in court as well.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-judge-orders-masks-police-punch-back,2021-08-26
The ACLU offers some truly terrible political conversation starters for Thanksgiving dinner,"As a matter of tradition, organizations and media outlets address the issue of talking politics or other controversial subjects with family during Thanksgiving dinner.

There are two main approaches to this. One school of thought advises people to avoid these topics at all costs, because others either don't want to hear about them, or they could cause conflict.

The American Civil Liberties Union is an example of the opposing approach, which is to force uncomfortable conversations with loved ones by hitting them over the head with liberal talking points.

In case you're uncomfortable with this approach, or unsure how to start, the ACLU Twitter account offered some prompts to get things going.

""My pronouns are..."" to start a conversation about the difference between biological sex and gender identity.

""Firing people for being LGBTQ is illegal and Trump asked SCOTUS to change that"" for those interested in bashing Trump and discussing LGBTQ legal rights at the same time.

""Who loved Pose season 2?"" in case anyone at the table wants to break down a show described as a ""drama television series about New York City's African-American and Latino LGBTQ and gender-nonconforming ballroom culture scene in the 1980s and, in the second season, early 1990s""

And, ""Please pass the pie, and the Equality Act"" a subtle segue into discourse about a law that, despite what Taylor Swift says, is a bit more complicated than simply making everyone equal.

This list is, of course a bit of social media trolling (I think) by the ACLU at the expense of conservatives. Because, as the narrative goes, the problem with Thanksgiving dinner is dealing with bigoted conservative relatives.

However, there is a bit too much truth in there, whether it's a joke or not, as there are some who feel it is their responsibility to fix the wrong-think of their family members over turkey and stuffing. Everyone should resist that urge, as there is a clear indication that most people would rather talk about literally anything else.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-state-rep-submits-bill-that-would-make-abortion-a-homicide,2019-11-27
The Chinese government is accelerating the build-up of its nuclear arsenal as tensions with the US rise,"People familiar with the thought process of China’s leadership say that the Chinese government has begun to accelerate the development of its nuclear arsenal after reassessing the threat posed to mainland China by the United States.

The Wallstreet Journal said that China’s nuclear effort “long predates Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but the U.S.’s wariness about getting directly involved in the war there has likely reinforced Beijing’s decision to put greater emphasis on developing nuclear weapons as a deterrent.”

It is believed that Chinese leaders see a stronger nuclear arsenal as a way to deter the U.S. from involving itself in a potential future conflict over Taiwan.

The Chinese government has also accelerated work on more than 100 suspected missile silos that could be used to store nuclear-tipped missiles in remote western regions of China.

American officials and independent security analysts who study nuclear proliferation say they are unsure about what is motivating Beijing’s race to develop its nuclear arsenal.

The Wallstreet Journal reported that the “people close to the Chinese leadership said China’s increased focus on nuclear weapons is also driven by fears Washington might seek to topple Beijing’s Communist government” as American foreign policy becomes more hawkish towards China.

American military officials and security analysts worry that China rapidly accelerating the development of its nuclear arsenal could embolden the Chinese Communist Party to launch a surprise nuclear strike.

Reportedly, the Chinese government plans to maintain an arsenal “no larger than necessary to ensure China’s security interests.”

A person close to the leadership of China suggested that another reason Chinese leadership is rushing to strengthen its nuclear arsenal is so that the U.S. can’t push them around on the geopolitical stage. The person said, “China’s inferior nuclear capability could only lead to growing U.S. pressure on China.”

This past year, the American security apparatus was caught entirely off guard as the Chinese government launched a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile into space that circled the earth before sailing towards its target on the planet’s surface.

An unnamed U.S. official said, “We have no idea how [China] did this.”

People familiar with the thinking of Chinese leadership have said that it is unlikely that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine has had an impact on the Chinese government’s nuclear acceleration despite the lingering threat of Putin using a nuclear weapon against Ukraine causing immense anxiety within the international community.

The Pentagon estimates that China will have 1,000 nuclear warheads by the end of this decade.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-supreme-court-abbott-ban-on-mask-mandates,2022-04-10
The Federal Reserve is on track to raise interest rates in mid-March,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell believes that the Fed is on track to raise interest rates in mid-March.

“Making appropriate monetary policy in this environment requires a recognition that the economy evolves in unexpected ways. We will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook,” Powell said in prepared testimony before Congress.

Powell said that it was too soon to tell how the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent sanctions on Russia issued by Western nations, could affect the U.S. economy, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The chairman’s remarks highlight the delicate economic climate that the Federal Reserve must navigate as it raises interest rates for the first time since 2018 amid rapid inflation that could be further exasperated in response to Western sanctions on Russia.

He said, “The near-term effects on the U.S. economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain.”

It’s typically unusual for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates during times of geopolitical conflict. That said, the Fed is under increased pressure to raise rates since inflation is running far above the Fed’s 2% target and Western sanctions on Russia stand to further raise prices.

In late February, allied leaders of Western nations issued a joint statement expressing their intentions to restrict Russian access to the SWIFT telecommunications network.

In the statement, Western leaders from the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States said, “As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies.”

Targeting the Russian financial sector, oligarchs, and the Russian central bank with these sanctions will economically isolate Russia and make international commerce extremely difficult for the country.

Similar to previous spikes in inflation being caused by supply chain shortages and difficulty importing goods, Powell and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve believe that the extra duress put on international trade as a result of these sanctions will cause prices to further to inflate for American consumers.

“We are attentive to the risks of potential further upward pressure on inflation expectations and inflation itself from a number of factors. We will use our policy tools as appropriate to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched,” Powell said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-aclu-offers-some-truly-terrible-suggestions-for-thanksgiving-political-conversation-starters,2022-03-02
White House says that China has 'confirmed their commitment' to buy US agricultural goods,"The White House has announced that China has agreed to purchase U.S. agricultural products.

Here's what we know

According to a news release from the White House on Wednesday, while discussing ""topics such as forced technology transfer, intellectual property rights, services, non-tariff barriers, and agriculture,"" the Chinese negotiators ""confirmed their commitment to increase purchase of United States agricultural exports.""

The White House called the meetings ""constructive"" and said it expected ""negotiations on an enforceable trade deal to continue in Washington, D.C., in early September.""

This announcement stands in stark contrast to President Donald Trump's tweets on Tuesday. Trump said that China was ""supposed to start buying our agricultural products now"" but were showing ""no signs that they are doing so.""

These talks took place in China, and were led on the U.S. side by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. The news release also stated that further trade negotiations with China are planned for Washington, D.C., in early September.

What's the background?

After the Trump administration announced steep tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum to the U.S., China responded with retaliatory tariffs. The U.S. issued more tariffs of its own, which led to even more Chinese tariffs. During this trade conflict, U.S. exports of agricultural goods like soybeans and sorghum to China decreased significantly. This has led to the federal government bailing out farmers to the tune of nearly $30 billion.

China is consistently one of the United States' largest trading partners. Last year, the U.S. exported roughly $120 billion worth of goods to China, and purchased $540 billion. U.S. exports to China for the first five months of 2019 (the only ones with data published so far) is down more than $10 billion from the same time period in 2018 ($53 billion to $43 billion).",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-chinese-government-is-accelerating-the-build-up-of-its-nuclear-arsenal-amid-heightened-tensions-with-the-united-states,2019-07-31
'This guy is brutal': Biden calls for Putin to be tried for war crimes,"Russian President Vladimir Putin was met with intense Western condemnation on Monday, as President Joe Biden and his Western allies called for the Russian leader to stand trial for war crimes.

These alleged war crimes were discovered as Ukrainian forces worked to reclaim the areas around Kyiv from withdrawing Russian troops. The Los Angeles Times reported that Ukrainian forces found mass graves in the suburbs of Kyiv. Reportedly, these graves were filled with the corpses of civilians, and the suburban streets are also said to be littered with civilian corpses.

Many of the slaughtered civilians bore mark marks of torture and execution. Bodies were found with their hands tied behind them and seemingly fatal gunshot wounds at the base of their skulls.

“This guy is brutal,” Biden said. “What’s happening in Bucha is outrageous.”

The Ukrainian government said that it has counted more than 400 civilian deaths so far in the suburbs of Kyiv, including those in Bucha.

Biden’s rhetoric towards his Russian counterpart, Putin, has been intensifying as the conflict in Ukraine drags on.

In mid-March, Biden referred to Putin as a “war criminal” in remarks that the White House quickly disavowed, saying the statement reflected the president’s personal opinion and not formal U.S. policy.

About a week later, the U.S. government formally accused the Russian Federation of war crimes.

Toward the end of March, Biden referred to Putin as “a dictator bent on rebuilding an empire.”

Most notably, however, Biden at one point appeared to call for regime change in Russia.

“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” the president said.

True to form, White House officials subsequently had to walk back Biden’s statements.

One official said that Biden “was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change” but was instead insisting that Putin “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.”

This past Monday, Biden said, “[Putin] is a war criminal, but we have to gather information, we have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue to fight.”

His comments come as Russian forces continue to withdraw from Kyiv and the surrounding northern regions of Ukraine. However, this withdrawal is not a retreat, as Russian forces have continued to strike Ukraine’s southern coastal cities and move offensive operations into the country’s eastern region.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited parts of Ukraine’s recently vacated northern region and described the decimated residential areas as a “genocide.”

In a recent address to the Romanian parliament, Zelenskyy said, “Ordinary residents of an ordinary city near Kyiv. Their hands were tied behind their backs, they were shot in the back of the head or in the eye, killed just in the streets. Civilian vehicles were crushed by military equipment. Vehicles with people! They raped women and girls.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-federal-reserve-is-on-track-to-raise-interest-rates-in-mid-march,2022-04-05
"'This is Kristallnacht': Palestinians continue attacks on Israelis with rockets, street violence","Hamas militants continued their barrage of rocket fire at Israel on Tuesday, and the violence escalated in the streets to the point that the mayor of one Israeli town called for help and likened the attacks to the Nazi pogrom against German Jews, declaring: ""This is Kristallnacht.""

What are the details?

The mayor of the central Israeli city of Lod called for the nation's prime minister to declare a state of emergency amid attacks by ""Islamists,"" The Times of Israel reported.

""This is Kristallnacht in Lod,"" said Mayor Yair Revivo. ""I have called on the prime minister to declare a state of emergency in Lod. To call in the [Israel Defense Forces]. To impose a curfew. To restore quiet… There is a failure of governance… This is a giant incident — an Intifada of Arab Israelis. All the work we have done here for years [on coexistence] has gone down the drain.""

Revivo went on to say:

""All of Israel should know, this is a complete loss of control… This is unthinkable. Synagogues are being burned. Hundreds of cars set alight. Hundreds of Arab thugs are roaming the streets… Civil war has erupted in Lod… The Orthodox-nationalist community here has guns. I'm imploring them to go back home but they understandably want to protect their homes. Petrol bombs are being thrown into [Jewish] homes. The situation is incendiary.""

The New York Post reported that Hamas fired 130 rockets Tuesday just at the city of Tel Aviv alone — which has a population of nearly half a million people.

Video posted online shows Israel's Iron Dome defense system intercepting the rockets. Newsmax foreign correspondant Alex Salvi tweeted of the footage, ""Imagine the carnage if these ≈150 rockets landed in Tel Aviv (population of 450,000).""

But Israel has been fighting back. The IDF announced Tuesday that they ""killed the commander of the Hamas anti-tank missile unit, Iyad Fathi Faik Sharir,"" who ""was in charge of carrying out anti-tank missile attacks on Israel.""

The IDF added, ""Our aircraft are currently striking additional terror targets in Gaza.""

The Post said Waseem Awawdeh, 23, was held on $10,000 bail in connection to the Thursday attack and is accused of punching, kicking, and pepper-spraying 29-year-old Joseph Borgen — as well as beating the victim with crutches.

""If I could do it again, I would do it again,"" Awawdeh told one of his jailers, according to a prosecutor at the suspect's Saturday arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court, the paper reported. ""I have no problem doing it again.""

Here's a clip of Awawdeh in custody:

More from the Post:

The attack was unprovoked, said prosecutors, who told Judge Kathryn Paek that Borgen was walking near Broadway and West 49th Street when Awawdeh ""jumped him and attacked him.""



Awawdeh, who has at least one open case in Brooklyn for allegedly speeding and running a red light in March, was charged with assault as a hate crime, gang assault, menacing, aggravated harassment as a hate crime and criminal possession of a weapon, police said.

The Manhattan assistant district attorney told Paek that the attack was a hate crime and said Awawdeh called Borgen a ""dirty Jew"" and said, ""F*** Israel, Hamas is going to kill all of you,"" the paper said.

But friends of Awawdeh's, who refused to give their names, claimed Awawdeh was attacked first, the Post noted.

""They picked somebody that was weak, that was on crutches,"" one of them told the paper.

However, the NYPD released photos of four other men who are wanted in connection with Thursday's attack on Borgen, the Post added.

Awawdeh is enrolled in college and isn't a flight risk, according to his attorney, April White-Small of New York County Defenders, the paper said, adding that Awawdeh did not enter a plea.

What did the victim have to say?

""I felt a liquid being poured on my face, and at first I thought I was getting urinated on,"" Borgen told the Post. ""But it turned out I was getting Maced and pepper-sprayed. My face was on fire. That pain was worse than the concussion and all this other stuff that followed.""

Borgen also told the paper he underwent a wrist X-ray, and although it's not broken it's ""messed up. Every time I move it, it's in pain, probably sprained. I have bruises all over my body. I have a black eye. My face is banged up. I'm just sore all over my body. They were kicking me in my ribs, my stomach.""

The GOP's 'token' black man? Sen. Tim Scott responds perfectly to insulting question about his race,"Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate, was asked by NBC News host Craig Melvin whether the Republicans are using him as a token as they deal with the intense racial conflict resulting from the police killing of George Floyd.

""You have faced a fair amount of criticism, especially over the past few days, because you are the only black Republican senator. Some have said that your party is using you, they've even thrown around the word 'token,' as well. Your response to that criticism?"" Melvin asked Scott during an interview.

Despite the insulting implication of the question, Scott laughed it off and clearly explained how his experience as a black man uniquely qualifies him above his Republican colleagues to take the lead on race matters:

Well, I am also the only person in my conference who has been racially profiled driving while black. I'm the only one in my conference that's been stopped seven times in one year as an elected official, perhaps the only one in my conference wearing this Senate pin that was stopped from coming into the building. So if there's someone in the conference who understands discrimination and profiling, it's me. It's the reason why I asked to lead this charge, because it is a personal issue, it is the right issue. And frankly, I think it helps to have someone who's been a victim of this situation and who still has a tremendous respect for where our country can go together.



So I shrug those comments and criticisms off. But you've got to know, when you're a black Republican, you're like a unicorn. People are going to criticize you when you wake up, when you go to sleep, if you say you like apple pie and football, there's a lot of critics for that, too. So God bless their souls.

Scott is leading Republican efforts to draft police reform legislation. He will lead a working group that also includes Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John Cornyn of Texas, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and James Lankford of Oklahoma.



""None of us have had the experience of being an African American in this country and dealing with this discrimination which persists here some 50 years after the 1964 civil rights bill and the 1965 civil rights bill,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said of his decision to have Scott lead the police reform effort, according to Politico. ""We're still wrestling with America's original sin. … And I think the best way for Senate Republicans to go forward on this is to listen to one of our own.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/this-is-kristallnacht-palestinians-continue-attacks-on-israelis-with-rockets-street-violence,2020-06-15
Tom Brokaw says Hispanics 'should work harder at assimilation.' Outrage follows.,"Typically praised in the mainstream media, veteran NBC broadcaster Tom Brokaw found himself on the wrong side of controversy over the weekend after he claimed Hispanic immigrants do not work hard enough to assimilate to American culture, including by learning the English language.

What did Brokaw say?

During a discussion about immigration on ""Meet the Press,"" Brokaw said:

A lot of this, we don't want to talk about. But the fact is, on the Republican side, a lot of people see the rise of an extraordinary, important, new constituent in American politics: Hispanics, who will come here and all be Democrats. Also, I hear, when I push people a little harder, ""Well, I don't know whether I want brown grandbabies.""



I mean, that's also a part of it. It's the intermarriage that is going on and the cultures that are conflicting with each other. I also happen to believe that the Hispanics should work harder at assimilation. That's one of the things I've been saying for a long time. You know, they ought not to be just codified in their communities but make sure that all their kids are learning to speak English, and that they feel comfortable in the communities. And that's going to take outreach on both sides, frankly.

What was the reaction?

Brokaw was raked over the coals for what many characterized as racist and ""xenophobic"" comments.

Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), whose brother is running for president, reacted on Twitter: ""@tombrokaw, for a celebrated @NBCNews journalist who spent years chronicling American society you seem stunningly ignorant of the Hispanic community in this country. Unfortunate to see xenophobia pass for elevated political commentary.""

Hispanic journalist Julio Ricardo Varela said: ""What @tombrokaw said on national TV today was hard to watch and absorb. It really was a punch in the gut to a lot of people. It was not only factually incorrect, it was also xenophobia in action. Hope @MeetThePress addresses this.""

And despite ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd not addressing the comments on air, PBS correspondent Yamiche Alcindor, who was on the panel with Brokaw, later condemned the comments.

""I would just say that we also need to adjust what we think of as America,"" she said. ""You're talking about assimilation. I grew up in Miami, where people speak Spanish, but their kids speak English. And the idea that we think Americans can only speak English, as if Spanish and other languages wasn't always part of America, is, in some ways, troubling.""

Brokaw was not only denounced for his comments toward Hispanic people. But, as Twitchy noted, many Republicans took exception with Brokaw's claim, which he made without evidence, that Republicans don't want ""brown grandbabies.""

How did Brokaw respond to the outrage?

Through his Twitter account Sunday evening, Brokaw offered a pseudo-apology.

Tom Cotton accuses China of intentionally seeding coronavirus cases in other countries to maintain power,"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said that he believes China purposely seeded the coronavirus in other countries in order to maintain its relative global power.

Cotton made the stunning accusations in an interview with Pat Robertson at CBN News.

""I think it's pretty clear that China is culpable for unleashing this pandemic on the world,"" said Cotton.

""First off, as you just reported, all the evidence, circumstantial to be sure, but all the evidence right now points to these laboratories in Wuhan as the most likely source for this virus. Perhaps it was an accidental breach that resulted from Chinese incompetence, but still they knew the risks, they knew the shortcomings in those labs,"" he explained.

""But even worse, by late December, early January, once it became clear to the Chinese Communist Party leaders that this virus was highly contagious and deadly and was being transmitted from humans to humans, they continued to encourage travel outside of China to the rest of the world,"" said Cotton.

""I believe that was a deliberate decision that was designed to seed cases around the world so China wouldn't be the only nation that suffered a relative decline of its power,"" he said.

""That's why I think China is culpable for this pandemic,"" Cotton concluded, ""and why there has to be consequences for them.""

Robertson was stunned at the accusation from Cotton against China, prompting the senator to list the many human rights violations of the communist government, including concentration camps against religious minority groups.

""They force women to have abortions, they harvest organs from political prisoners. And of course their communist forebears in the Chinese Communist Party, going back to the 1940s, are responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of their own people,"" said Cotton.

""Those kinds of people would think of nothing of putting this virus outside of China's borders, if that's what it took to maintain China's relative power in the world,"" he concluded.

Robertson highlighted the growing possibility of a military conflict over Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. Cotton dismissed any military conflict but said that China must face some punitive consequences for its actions.

Tow-truck driver with concealed carry license turns the tables on armed man who allegedly tried to rob him — and shoots suspect dead,"A tow-truck driver with a concealed carry license turned the tables on an armed man who allegedly tried to rob him Monday in Detroit — and shot the suspect dead.

What are the details?

The tow-truck driver was meeting with the suspect to buy a junk car around 9:35 a.m. in the area of 7 Mile and Kelly when he was ambushed from behind, sources told WJBK-TV, adding that the gun-toting suspect demanded everything the driver had on him.

The victim came prepared, however. The station said the tow-truck driver, who is a concealed pistol license holder, pulled out his own gun and fatally shot the suspect.

Detroit police told Fox News Digital they responded to an armed robbery and found one person shot. Investigators added to the cable network the wounded individual was taken to a hospital, where he later died.

Fox News, citing Detroit police, said the Wayne County prosecutor will review the investigation's findings, but there was no indication the tow-truck driver would face charges given that the situation appeared to be a case of self-defense.

'I heard multiple gunshots'

“I heard multiple gunshots, around six to eight,” one neighbor who did not want to share his name told WXYZ-TV.

Police aren't confirming the suspect's identity, but sources told WXYZ he has ties to the area — and the neighbor didn't want any conflict with relatives as they grieve.

“You have to get these crooks off the street on way or another,” the neighbor added to WXYZ.

The tow-truck driver was in a truck labeled TK Junk Car Removal, WXYZ reported, adding that no one answered at the business when a station reporter stopped by to interview the driver.

One area towing company owner added to WXYZ that some insurance companies don't cover the liability that comes with tow-truck drivers carrying guns — which results in some outfits prohibiting drivers from carrying weapons.

Lenny Baldwin, owner of U WIN Towing in St. Clair County, told the station he wasn't allowed to carry a weapon when he worked for other companies. But being a strong self-defense advocate, Baldwin added to WXYZ that he pays for the insurance available, encourages his drivers to get a CPL if they want, and trains them.

“We will go to the gun range and practice,"" Baldwin told WXYZ. ""It is all about safety and going home at the end of your shift.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tom-brokaw-hispanics-assimilation-outrage,2022-12-28
Blaming Biden: Majority of likely general election voters think that the president's 'policies and spending' are the top cause for soaring inflation,"As Americans continue to get soaked by soaring inflation, a recent Trafalgar Group survey of likely general election voters found that a majority (59.9%) thought that ""President Biden's policies and spending"" are the top factors causing increasing inflation in the country — just 31.6% thought that the war between Russia and Ukraine is the top reason for increasing inflation.

The survey was performed May 25 through May 29 — the Trafalgar Group joined with Convention of States Action for the poll.

While a massive majority of Republicans (87.9%) blamed Biden for the nation's roaring inflation, only a third of Democrats (33.3%) blamed the president. And while 55.2% of Democrats blamed the Russia-Ukraine war as the chief culprit behind rising inflation, only 9.7% of Republicans held that view. A whopping 61.1% of those categorized as ""No Party/Other"" blamed the president, while 27.1% picked the foreign conflict.

Americans have been witnessing the purchasing power of their money be rapidly eroded by high-flying inflation.



""The all items index increased 8.3 percent for the 12 months ending April, a smaller increase than the 8.5-percent figure for the period ending in March,"" the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics noted in a consumer price index report that was released earlier this month.

Gas prices have been on the rise, and as of Tuesday, the AAA national average for a gallon of regular fuel has reached $4.622.

If significant inflation persists, it could bode ill for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterm election cycle.

In an op-ed, Biden described dealing with inflation as his ""top economic priority."" He said that the Federal Reserve is responsible for taming inflation.

""First, the Federal Reserve has a primary responsibility to control inflation,"" Biden wrote. ""I agree with their assessment that fighting inflation is our top economic challenge right now.""

""Second, we need to take every practical step to make things more affordable for families during this moment of economic uncertainty—and to boost the productive capacity of our economy over time,"" the president declared. ""I’ve done what I can on my own to help working families during this challenging time—and will keep acting to lower costs where I can—but now Congress needs to act too.""

""Third, we need to keep reducing the federal deficit, which will help ease price pressures,"" he wrote.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tom-cotton-accuses-china-of-seeding-covid-cases,2022-05-31
Lesbian transgender couple declares their plan to transition their 5-year-old son into a girl,"A transgender couple in the United Kingdom has announced that their 5-year-old will be transitioning from male to female, the Daily Mail reported.

What's the story?

Greg Rogers and his partner Jody Rogers were both born female. However, since Greg medically transitioned to male at 16 years old, the couple identifies as being straight. They share custody of Jody's 5-year-old, Jayden.

Jayden was born a boy, but has worn dresses for the past year. Now Greg and Jody say that they plan to schedule medical procedures to transition Jayden to female.

Sex-change hormones given to children have permanent consequences, and critics question the ability of a young child to make such a dramatic and life-altering decision.

In 2016, the American College of Pediatrics released a statement warning that puberty blockers put children at a higher risk for ""cardiac disease, high blood pressure, blood clots, stroke, diabetes, and cancer,"" in addition to making them unable ""to conceive any genetically related children even via artificial reproductive technology.""

Speaking to the Daily Mail, Greg insisted that Jayden was choosing to transition on his own, and had not been influenced by them.

""We haven't encouraged Jayden to do this, despite what people think, and we are hurt at the suggestion,"" Greg said.

""She has no idea that I'm transgender,"" Greg added. ""Having been through this myself, I have conflicting emotions about her deciding she doesn't want to be a boy any more. It's not an easy life. People will always judge you and I don't think there is a single transgender person on the planet who would push that on a child.""

Jody said that before Jayden began demanding to wear girl's clothes, she had not even been aware that ""a child could be transgender.""

""[I]t isn't until now, after speaking to other parents in our situation, that we realise it is more common than everyone thinks,"" Jody said, the Daily Mail reported.

What else?

Social workers from North Lanarkshire in Scotland where the Rogerses live have reportedly checked in on the family after an anonymous complaint from a neighbor, but determined that there were no signs of abuse.

While still too young to begin hormone treatment right away, Greg told the Daily Mail that Jayden will receive counseling for the next few years ""to explore who she is.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tow-truck-driver-with-concealed-carry-license-shoots-alleged-robbery-suspect,2019-01-22
Trans child molester Hannah Tubbs faces potential life sentence for allegedly beating fellow 'survivalist transient group' member to death with a rock,"Hannah Tubbs — the transgender California child molester sentenced to just two years in prison under progressive Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón — now faces a potential life sentence in prison for his alleged brutal murder of another man in 2019.

What are the details?

Kern County Judge Brian McNamara found that prosecutors had presented enough evidence and ordered Tubbs, 26, to stand trial on a first-degree murder charge this week for his alleged role in the death of Michael Clark, KGET-TV reported.

During court testimony on Monday, sheriff's investigators said multiple witnesses told them that the defendant, formerly James Tubbs, admitted to beating Clark with a rock before dumping him in the Kern River in April 2019. One investigator even said Tubbs himself admitted his involvement.

""[He] made a comment that it was an accident,"" Sgt. Mark Chambless said, according to the outlet. ""[He] said something to the effect that 'it had gone too far.'""

Both Tubbs and Clark were allegedly part of a ""transient survivalist group,"" or a cohort of homeless vagrants who had decided to move from Spokane, Washington, to Lake Isabella in California. Tubbs was considered the second in command and acted as the group's enforcer, making sure everyone stayed in line.



It was Tubbs' ""enforcer"" personality that often led to him becoming angry, blacking out, and doing things he doesn't remember, Kern County District Attorney investigator Donald Krueger testified, based on conversations with the suspect. Krueger added that Tubbs claimed he had another personality, as well, called the ""transgender side.""

What else?

Investigators relayed several other versions of the story while on the witness stand. One included Tubbs and Clark being accompanied by another member of the group, Josef Buffaloe. In this version, Buffaloe was the one who choked Clark until he passed out, after which Tubbs wrapped the body in a blanket and threw it in the river.

In another version, Tubbs claimed that Clark and another individual who had been camping in the area, named Chad Mizer, went for a walk and only Mizer returned.

Clark's decomposed body was found in the Kern River in August 2019. A medical examination concluded he died as a result of drowning.

Defense attorney Kate Lee used the multiple conflicting testimonies between witnesses, which she said amounted to 18 different stories, to argue the case against her client should not result in a conviction.

""I think the whole case is such a mess I don’t think the people can get a conviction on this,"" Lee reportedly said, noting that any member of the group could be a suspect.

Anything else?

The case has risen to the national spotlight due to the defendant's recent child molestation conviction. Tubbs was sentenced to just two years in juvenile detention for violently molesting a 10-year-old girl in the bathroom of a Denny's restaurant in 2014.

Tubbs was just shy of his 18th birthday when he committed the heinous crime, and so, per far-left DA Gascón's policies, he was tried and sentenced as a juvenile despite widespread outcry. The lenient sentence was even criticized by the sentencing judge and the prosecutor who tried the case.

""Very rarely is Tubbs in compliance with anything,"" lead prosecutor Shea Sanna previously told Fox News. ""And now we have an extremely violent, dangerous, unremorseful child predator on the verge of being released, and my boss does not care.""

The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said in a statement that officials were not aware of the murder allegations against Tubbs when the sentencing was handed down.

""We were unaware of the murder allegations against Ms. Tubbs until today,"" the statement said. ""As a result, we were never given the opportunity to consider this critical information before proceeding with our case in Los Angeles County. The murder in Kern County took place before our case was adjudicated.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trafalgar-poll-inflation-president-biden,2022-05-24
Appeals court rules against Minnesota school district that made transgender student use separate restroom,"An appeals court ruled Monday that a Minnesota school district violated the law when it told a transgender boy that he could not use the boys' restroom but instead provided a separate restroom.

The transgender student, only identified as N.H. in court documents, sued in February 2019 after he was made to use a separate restroom from the other boys on the boys swim team at Coon Rapids High School in 2015-16.

""We are suing the school board and the school district for discriminating against N.H. because he is transgender. That violates the Minnesota Human Rights Act and the rights of equal rights and due process under the Minnesota state constitution,"" said attorney David McKinney in 2019.

On Monday, the Minnesota Court of Appeals agreed and said that the Anoka-Hennepin School District had no right to provide a separate locker room and restroom for the boy.

The Star Tribune reported, ""In its decision, the Court of Appeals used what it described as the 'plain language' of the education provision to conclude that 'requiring a transgender student to use a different locker-room facility because of his sexual orientation is discrimination.'

The Minnesota Department of Human Rights joined the lawsuit on the side of the former student and praised the decision as a landmark for transgender rights.

""This decision means that schools are now safer and more welcoming for transgender and gender nonconforming students across Minnesota,"" said Human Rights Deputy Commissioner Irina Vaynerman.

N.H., the transgender boy, was hospitalized over ""mental health concerns"" three times in 2016 and 2017. The student transferred out of the district after one of those incidents.

""They went out of their way and created a problem where there wasn't a problem; they conspired against my son,"" said his mother, identified only as J.H., in 2019.

The school district argued at the time that they were following the best guidelines about how to deal with conflicting rights in relation to the transgender student.

The goal is to ensure that all students feel safe and comfortable. Plans for accommodation for restroom and locker room use are made in consultation with school building administrators, the Title IX coordinator, and superintendent in compliance with state and federal law. This approach is consistent with guidance from the National School Boards Association and the Minnesota School Boards Association. Providing privacy for all students is an important consideration.

District officials said they will consider their options after losing the court case.

"Transgender-rights 'misogynists' screamed, banged on windows of UK feminists' event while 'police did absolutely nothing,' journalist says","Transgender-rights activists intimidated women attending a U.K. feminists' event while police stood by and did nothing, a journalist said.

Activist group Queer AF Brighton descended upon the Woman's Place UK event Monday, claiming the meeting was spreading transphobia, the Daily Mail reported.

Journalist Julie Bindel tweeted video of flag-waving protestors outside the feminists' event:

Bindel noted the ""load of trans-activist misogynists screaming, shouting and banging on the window while the police did absolutely nothing.""

'Like we were under siege'

Ali Ceesay, who helped run the feminists' meeting, told the Daily Mail that ""100-plus protestors ... were shouting, chanting and blocking people's entrance. One young woman had a full blown panic attack inside the building. It was terrifying. They were banging on panes of glass; it was hideous, and the police didn't stop them. The policing was a joke. We also had some of our attendees have liquid thrown in their face. It felt very much like we were under siege.""

Here's what it sounded like inside the event space:

What did Queer AF have to say?

Queen AF called Women's Place UK a ""hate group"" in a Facebook post Tuesday and defended the protest, saying members ""marched to the venue to make noise outside of the building"" and that ""WPUK members were rude and aggressive to the small group of protesters that stood handing out counter fliers.""

The post added that ""protesters successfully held noisy space either side of the building for about three hours until the last members departed, sad and frustrated that their meeting was disrupted throughout. This disruption included chants such as: WPUK, are a hate group! You stop the hate group, we'll stop the protest! Hey, hey, ho, ho, transphobia has got to go!""

What did police have to say?

A police spokesperson said in a statement that officers ""ensured that those wishing to attend"" the meeting ""were able to gain access"" and that ""protest liaison officers spoke with those gathered outside to facilitate this and to reduce the impact that their protest was having on the meeting and the local community,"" the Daily Mail said.

""We accept that the initial protest was very noisy and officers did engage to seek a reduction in scale and to put a stop to those who were banging on windows in an attempt to disrupt the meeting,"" police added, according to the outlet, and that ""there have been no reports of crimes, no damage to the building, no arrests, and the participants left the meeting without further incident.""

Anything else?

Queer AF told the Brighton Argus the women's group running the meeting appropriates feminism and spreads a transphobic message.

But Ceesay — of Women's Place UK — told the Daily Mail that ""in law ... we have several protected characteristics. One of those is sex. It's that piece of law that gives women sex-based rights that protects us. There's a push within some of the more extreme LGBT communities to replace sex for a looser definition of gender identity. What this means is we lose our rights under this nefarious and undefinable concept of gender identity — and therefore we lose our women-only services.""

The outlet added that conflict between the groups includes whether ""gender-neutral"" restrooms are acceptable, or if they deny biological females their right to private spaces.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trans-child-molester-hannah-tubbs-faces-life-sentence,2019-09-24
Transgender teen charged with murder in Colorado school shooting to stand trial as an adult,"A transgender teenager who told police of being bullied as the reason the teen and a friend opened fire on classmates in a suburban Denver high school May 7— killing one student and injuring eight others — will be tried on murder charges as an adult, Reuters reported.

What are the details?

Alec McKinney, 16 — who was born female but identifies as male — told police of being in a ""pre-op transitioning phase"" and seeking revenge on students over being bullied for being transgender, the outlet said.

McKinney and Devon Erickson, 19, were ordered to stand trial on first-degree murder, attempted murder, and weapons charges in connection with the shooting at the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math School in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, Reuters said. The pair each face 43 charges, the Denver Post said.

Kendrick Castillo, 18, was fatally shot when he ran toward one of the two shooters in an attempt to stop the attack and save lives, Reuters said, adding that he was hailed as a hero.

Defense attorneys wanted the case moved to juvenile court, citing McKinney's mental health issues and a troubled childhood that included witnessing domestic violence committed by McKinney's father against McKinney's mother, Reuters reported

But while Douglas County District Judge Jeffrey Holmes agreed the defendant suffered ""serious trauma,"" he declined to move the case Wednesday, the outlet said.

""Based on the totality of the evidence before it, the Court finds that it is has not been proved that the juvenile and the community would be better served by transferring this case to juvenile court,"" Holmes wrote in the seven-page ruling, Reuters said.

More from the Post:



In his decision, Holmes addressed the 11 different factors that must be considered when deciding whether to send a case back to juvenile court. The judge seemed to agree with the prosecution on several points made during the recent hearing, including: the determination that McKinney's actions were ""purposeful and planned""; that he was adequately mature for his age and had a more stable home life than the defense argued; and that evidence of significant bullying was conflicting.



Holmes also cited McKinney's response to a previous arrest for selling Xanax to a friend, who overdosed, as a significant warning sign.

""It is of great concern that despite being involved in the juvenile justice system and seeing the potentially devastating consequences of his actions on another person's life, McKinney moved forward with a plan to cause harm to others,"" the judge wrote, according to the paper.

The prosecution argued that McKinney had support from family, teachers, and mental health professionals but consistently deceived and manipulated them for personal gain, the Post added.

If convicted of the murder charge, McKinney faces up to 40 years in prison, Reuters said, adding that the maximum sentence would be seven years had the case been sent to juvenile court.

The Colorado Public Defender's Office representing McKinney declined to comment, the outlet said, adding that District Attorney George Brauchler had no immediate comment, according to a spokeswoman.

'I'm elated'

John Castillo — the father of fatally shot student Kendrick Castillo — told the Post he was up at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday and unable to sleep due to thoughts about the judge's pending decision.

The Treasury Dept. has provided highly sensitive information about Hunter Biden and associates to GOP senators,"The Treasury Department is complying with requests from GOP senators and has turned over highly sensitive information regarding Hunter Biden and his business associates to Republican senators who have asked for the materials, Yahoo News reported on Thursday.

According to the news outlet, a spokeswoman for Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said that the Treasury Department is ""voluntarily cooperating"" with the Senate Republicans' requests ""at lightning speed.""

""Agencies like the Treasury Department are rapidly complying with Senate Republican requests — no subpoenas necessary — and producing 'evidence' of questionable origin,"" the spokeswoman said.

For months now, Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), chairman of the Finance Committee, and Ron Johnson (Wis.) chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, have been conducting an investigation into ""potential conflicts of interest posed"" by Biden's business dealings.

The two senators have been sending letters to numerous departments and agencies in Washington — including the State Department, the Treasury, the Justice Department, the FBI, the National Archives and the Secret Service — requesting information to aid their investigation.

According to Wyden, their requests to the Treasury Department have been met with cooperation. Yahoo News reports that Grassley and Johnson have sought ""some of the most sensitive and closely held documents in all of federal law enforcement — highly confidential suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by financial institutions with FinCEN, an agency of the Treasury that helps to police money laundering.""

While it seems clear that some documents have been turned over in response to the senators' requests, it is not yet certain that SARs were among those documents.

The Treasury Department website notes that a financial institution is required to file a SAR after it deems an ""initial detection of facts"" constitutes one. Such constituting activities include cash transactions that exceed $10,000 or behavior that ""might signal criminal activity.""

A copy of the senators' letter to the Treasury Department, made available by Reuters, shows that Grassley and Johnson requested SARs and related documents pertaining to Biden, Burisma Holdings, and Rosemont Seneca Partners, along with a number of other contacts.

Grassley's office responded to Democrats' criticisms of the Treasury's compliance, saying, ""it's unfortunate that Democrats whom we've kept in the loop on our investigations would recklessly seek to interfere with legitimate government oversight.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-rights-misogynists-screamed-at-uk-feminists-event,2020-02-06
The Daily Show host Trevor Noah apologizes for 'racist' jokes about India-Pakistan conflict,"Comedian and ""The Daily Show"" host Trevor Noah has apologized for mocking the tensions between India and Pakistan, after being accused of racism over jokes he made about the conflict.

What did Noah say?

In a segment of his show last week, Noah joked that if the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan turned into a war, ""it would probably be the most entertaining war of all time,"" and mimicked Indian soldiers singing and dancing Bollywood-style on the battlefield.

He went on to say ""It would also be the longest war of all time,"" adding, ""Another dance number?""

Noah was branded as ""racist"" and ""insensitive"" on social media, causing him to respond with an apology and explain himself. The South African comic said he used humor to ""process pain and discomfort,"" pointing out that he even joked after his mother was shot in the head.



The Daily Show host also noted that the outrage over his joke had garnered more attention than the border conflict itself, adding, ""sometimes it seems like people are more offended by the jokes comedians make about an issue than the issue itself.""









What's the background?

India and Pakistan have battled for decades over the border region of Kashmir, resulting in all-out war between the two nations on three occasions since 1947.

On Feb. 14, a suicide bomber killed 40 Indian paramilitary troops in an area claimed by both India and Pakistan. According to Reuters, the Pakistani-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) said it carried out the attack, and India responded by sending warplanes across the border and striking a JeM training camp.

A dogfight ensued, with the countries offering conflicting reports over the skirmish and casualties on both sides. But India lost at least one jet, and a downed pilot captured by Pakistan was returned to India on March 1 to a hero's welcome, the BBC reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-teen-charged-with-murder-in-colorado-school-shooting-to-stand-trial-as-an-adult,2019-03-04
"Trump admin will allow churches, other religious organizations to receive federal aid to pay salaries and bills","Churches and other overtly religious organizations will be able to receive economic aid from the federal government under the recently passed economic stimulus package aimed at supporting small businesses through the coronavirus shutdowns, NPR reported.

The allowance for churches to receive forgivable payroll loans from the Small Business Administration, announced last week, brings up questions from critics about whether it is constitutional for the federal government to support religious organizations in such a way.

What changed? The SBA issued new guidance on April 3, clarifying that religious organizations would not be excluded from the program that gives small businesses access to loans to cover payroll and bills — loans which can be largely forgiven if used for qualifying purposes.



""Faith-based organizations are eligible to receive SBA loans regardless of whether they provide secular social services,"" the SBA guidance read. ""No otherwise eligible organization will be disqualified from receiving a loan because of the religious nature, religious identity, or religious speech of the organization.""

Why do churches need this? Churches often rely on donations from attendees to make ends meet. Although some churches utilize online donation platforms, many churches see a significant drop-off in donations when people are not in attendance. Most states have issued stay-at-home orders and limits on large gatherings that have essentially shut churches down.



""There is a portion of that revenue that just by virtue of people's habits and practices doesn't come back,"" Vice President Mike Pence acknowledged during a recent conference call with pastors, NPR reported.

Will this impact religious freedom? Despite the announcement from the SBA, some churches are looking for more assurance that the acceptance of federal funds won't lead to any government infringement on religious freedom. For example, many churches would not hire a member of the LGBTQ community, because that conflicts with Christian beliefs, but such a hiring policy could be ruled as illegally discriminatory in other contexts.



""It is unclear if there is a private cause of action for any individual to bring a discrimination lawsuit against a church that receives these funds or if it is solely a matter of federal enforcement,"" guidelines from the Church of the Nazarene state regarding the loan program. ""In either case, the church should be aware that at least some risk exists.""

The SBA loan application has included federal anti-discrimination language that could potentially conflict with an organization's right to adhere to religious beliefs in employment or services.

Separation of church and state? Some still believe religious organizations should not be eligible for funding from the government.



""The government cannot directly fund inherently religious activities,"" said Alison Gil, legal and policy vice president of American Atheists, NPR reported. ""It can't spend government tax dollars on prayer, on promoting religion, [or] proselytization. That directly contradicts the establishment clause of the First Amendment. This is the most drastic attack on church-state separation we have ever seen.""

The SBA, however, believes it would actually be unconstitutional to exclude organizations from the program just because of religious status.

[Some agency regulations] ""impermissibly exclude some religious entities,"" the SBA said. ""Because those regulations bar the participation of a class of potential recipients based solely on their religious status, SBA will decline to enforce those subsections and will propose amendments to conform those regulations to the Constitution.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/treasury-sends-highly-sensitive-info-about-hunter-biden,2020-04-07
Trump administration reveals details of 'phase one' of trade deal with China,"President Donald Trump announced Friday that the U.S. and China had come to an agreement on ""phase one"" of a deal that could lead to a resolution of the long-running trade conflict between the two nations. Here are some key facts to know about the deal:

The deal is ""tremendous"" for U.S. farmers. President Trump called it a ""tremendous deal for the farmers,"" saying that it included an agreement for China to purchase between $40 and $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products. Farmers have suffered during the trade dispute, as many struggled to sell crops with China unavailable as a buyer.



Trump will hold off on more tariffs. The U.S. agreed to hold off on a tariff increase that was set to take effect this week as a part of a deal that is probably best described as a ""truce."" However, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin did not eliminate the possibility that more tariffs could be imposed in December if a full trade deal isn't done by then. And, the agreement does not roll back tariffs that were implemented in September.



There are some potential obstacles, still. While this agreement represents a foundation upon which the U.S. and China can potentially progress to more detailed talks, there are a few potential roadblocks to a full deal. Christiaan Tuntono, senior economist for Asia Pacific at Allianz Global Investors, told CNBC there are some significant issues to overcome, such as ""more sensitive areas"" like cybersecurity, currency manipulation, and Chinese companies that have been blacklisted from doing business in the U.S.

The Chinese are cautious about what this means. ""The final outcome will depend on whether the U.S. can walk together with China, and create the necessary and sufficient conditions to push ahead,"" China's official statement on the agreement said.

""As based on its past practice, there is always the possibility that Washington may decide to cancel the deal if it thinks that doing so will better serve its interests,"" an article in the state-owned China Daily stated.

Talks are ongoing. Phase one is not a stopping point, as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said that ""phase two will start almost immediately"" after the signing of phase one, which is set to be drafted over the next three weeks.

"Fiery first debate featured virtually endless insults and bickering between testy Trump, Biden","The first presidential debate of 2020 is in the books, and suffice it to say, it was every bit as entertaining — and feisty — as advertised.

For more than 90 minutes on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden fielded questions, but mostly bickered incessantly, in front of a socially distanced crowd in Cleveland, while presumably millions watched on TV and online.

Key takeaways

More than any single exchange or issue discussed, the candidates' general ire toward each other and consistent insult-slinging will likely be regarded as the biggest takeaway from the debate.

The candidates rarely made it two minutes without sidetracking the discussion by interrupting each other with derogatory remarks and personal affronts.

At one point early on, Biden actually jabbed at Trump, saying, ""Will you shut up, man?"" and at another point referred to Trump as a ""clown.""

Trump mocked Biden for wrongly claiming he started his academic career at Delaware State University — the school has since said he never attended — and accused Biden of forgetting.

""Don't ever use the word smart with me ... because you know what, there's nothing smart about you, Joe,"" Trump said.

Biden Tells Trump to “Shut Up"" But Isn't Ready for Trump to BRING THE FIRE! youtu.be

Key exchanges



When it came to discussing actual issues, the candidates worked hard to differentiate themselves from each other. Here were some of the key exchanges from the night.

On recent controversies: Moderator Chris Wallace made sure to bring up several hot-button issues that arose in recent days and weeks, including the New York Times' publication of Trump's alleged tax records and Biden's refusal to indicate whether he would pack the Supreme Court or not if he were elected president.

Trump denied the NYT report, asserting that he has paid millions in income taxes. Biden continued to deflect answering whether he would pack the court.

On the Supreme Court: Trump was unapologetic about his move to nominate Amy Coney Barrett to the nation's high court, saying that ""we won the election, and elections have consequences."" Biden agreed with Trump that elections have consequences, but submitted that the 2020 election, and not 2016, should be the one that matters in this case.

On the coronavirus: Biden perceived this area as a weak spot for the president and sought to drive home the notion that Trump was solely responsible for the more than 200,000 Americans who have reportedly died as a result of the virus.

""You should get out of the bunker and out of the sand trap ... and fund what needs to be done to save lives,"" Biden told Trump.

Trump defended his actions and hit back at his challenger by suggesting Biden would have kept the country open and vulnerable to the virus for months longer than he did. He also warned that under Biden's leadership, the country would undergo a protracted nationwide shutdown.

On law and order: Trump repeatedly taunted Biden by saying he wouldn't declare support for law and order and accusing him of being beholden to the radical left: ""They've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe.""



""We believe in law and order; you don't,"" Trump said.

On race: Biden labeled Trump as ""a racist,"" while Trump lambasted the senator for the 1994 crime bill he helped pass. Trump said Biden has treated black people ""about as bad as anybody in this country.""

""You called them super-predators, and you've called them worse than that,"" he added.

Anything else?

Unsurprisingly, the topic of Russian collusion and global conflicts of interest played center stage at the debate.

Trump repeatedly instigated Biden with the allegation that his son, Hunter Biden, received a $3.5 million wire transfer from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.

Biden hit back several times by alleging that Trump is Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""puppy.""

In the end, there appeared to be no immediately clear winner, though polling may eventually show differently.

President Trump announces that the US will formally cut ties with the World Health Organization,"President Donald Trump announced Friday that the United States was formally severing its relationship with the World Health Organization, citing the disproportionate amount of influence China has over the WHO, CNBC reported.

Conflict between the United States and the WHO resulted from the WHO's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which the president believes was too lax on China and the communist nation's responsibility for the spread.

""China has total control over the World Health Organization despite only paying $40 million per year compared to what the United States has been paying, which is approximately $450 million a year,"" Trump said Friday during a news conference. ""The world needs answers from China on the virus. We must have transparency. Why is it that China shut off infected people from Wuhan to all other parts of China?""

U.S. financial contributions to the World Health Organization, an average of $446 million per year, represent about 15% of the organization's total budget.

President Trump had threatened to cut off WHO funding earlier this month, threatening to make a temporary funding freeze permanent if the organization didn't commit to significant reforms.

WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was elected to his position with support from China, and despite clear evidence that China suppressed the severity of COVID-19 early on, Tedros has credited China with transparency in dealing with the outbreak.

The WHO has been criticized for allowing China to influence its response to COVID-19. One example of that is the exclusion of Taiwan from its response. A WHO official blatantly refused to even acknowledge a reporter's questions about Taiwan's WHO membership during an interview.

In mid-January, the WHO issued a statement saying there was no clear evidence of human-to-human COVID-19 transmission, even though a Chinese doctor had come to the opposite conclusion in late December.

During that same time, China was reporting no new cases of the virus during a 12-day period. Now, it's clear the virus was quickly spreading throughout the city of Wuhan.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-administration-details-of-phase-one-of-china-trade-deal,2020-05-29
President Trump demands Washington leaders take back Seattle area captured by protesters,"President Donald Trump called for Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan (D) to regain control over the ""Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,"" a six-block area of the city taken over by protesters and declared a police-free jurisdiction.

Durkan ordered police to surrender the East Precinct on Monday in an effort to de-escalate conflict between officers and protesters. Protesters then established a barricaded zone around the precinct, with armed individuals reportedly controlling entry and exit.

Assistant Police Chief Deanna Nollette said she has heard anecdotally that businesses within the zone have been asked to pay a fee in order to continue operating.

""Radical left Governor Jay Inslee and the mayor of Seattle are being taunted and played at a level that our great country has never seen before,"" President Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday night. ""Take back your city NOW. If you don't do it, I will. This is not a game. These ugly anarchists must be stopped IMMEDIATELY. MOVE FAST!""

Inslee claimed Wednesday that he was unaware of the situation in Seattle, although it has been the subject of national news reports for days.

""Well, that's news to me,"" Inslee said. ""So, I'll have to reserve any comment about it. I have not, I have not heard anything about that from a credible source, not that you're not credible, it's just like before I espouse an opinion, I should know of which I speak.""

The zone is apparently not run by any one person or group. Activities in the zone have included town hall discussions, mural painting, and a viewing of a documentary about racism in the criminal justice system.

A list of demands from the protesters was published on Medium, and includes the abolition of the Seattle Police Department, including defunding existing pensions for officers. The list also calls for an end to all use of armed force against protesters, a ban on Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the city of Seattle, free college in Washington, and rent-control policies to affect ""de-gentrification.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-biden-first-debate,2020-06-11
Trump-endorsed budget deal passes House despite most Republicans voting against it,"The bipartisan two-year budget deal passed the House of Representatives on Thursday, but despite emphatic endorsements from President Donald Trump, most Republican representatives voted against it.

Republican opposition, however, had no material impact on whether the bill passed or not. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was able to get enough Democrats on board to pass the bill even if all Republicans had opposed. The bill passed 284-149, with 219 Democratic votes.

Out of 197 total Republican votes, 132 voted against the bill, which pushes spending even further into deficit territory over the next few years and suspends the debt ceiling.

The deal was primarily negotiated between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who was given full authority from the president in the matter.



In passing the deal, political concerns outweighed fiscal responsibility, as numerous lawmakers cited upcoming elections as a reason to put debt worries aside and avoid potential financial conflicts or shutdowns in Congress over the next few years.

""It helps everybody, including the majority—not having to deal with that at election time, Rep. John Carter (R-Texas) told Politico.

Those remaining lawmakers who do still care about advocating for fiscal responsibility within the government were not pleased with the result of five months of bipartisan negotiations.

""There's not much conservative about it,"" Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said of the agreement. ""There's stories being written that this is the final nail in the coffin of what used to be the tea party movement. That's sad. But maybe true.""

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), knowing that the bill was inevitably going to pass, made an effort to at least name the bill in a way he felt was more representative of what was happening.

Massie forced a vote to rename the bill ""A Bill to Kick the Can Down the Road, and for Other Purposes."" He got 47 votes on the failed amendment—41 Republicans, five Democrats, and Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.)

The bill will push spending above existing law by about $320 billion over the next two years, which is troubling because the government is already on track to operate at about a $1 trillion deficit.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-cut-world-health-organization,2019-07-25
"President Trump establishes the Space Command, says Space Force to follow soon","President Donald Trump announced the establishment of the U.S. Space Command from the Rose Garden of the White House Thursday.

The president congratulated General Jay Raymond as the first commander of the US Space Command. Raymond had been in command of the Air Force Space Command since October 2016.

The Space Command is not the much promised ""Space Force,"" which the president said would follow soon.

""SpaceCom will soon be followed, very importantly, by the establishment of the United States Space Force as the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, and that's really something when you think about it,"" he said.

""The Space Force will organize, train, and equip warriors to support SpaceCom's mission,"" the president explained.

Establishing the Space Force as the sixth branch of the military would need congressional approval.

""SpaceCom will ensure that America's dominance in space is never questioned, and never threatened,"" Trump added, ""because we know the best way to prevent conflict is to prepare for victory.""

The president also unfurled a Space Command flag during the ceremony, alongside Vice President Mike Pence.

"Trump executive order punishes cities, states that let vandals deface and destroy federal monuments","President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order that will create financial consequences for cities and states that do not protect federal monuments from vandals who attempt to deface, remove, or destroy them, Fox News reported.

What's this about? The president tweeted Friday about a ""very strong"" executive order calling for severe prison sentences for people who attack monuments. Protesters have been targeting statues of Confederate figures, people with ties to racism or slavery, and now even Founding Fathers and abolitionists.



""I just had the privilege of signing a very strong executive order protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues — and combatting recent criminal violence,"" President Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Long prison terms for these lawless acts against our Great Country!""

What does the order do? The executive order adds some positive and negative incentives for localities to enforce existing laws protecting federal monuments. In some cases, there seem to have been few or no consequences for mobs of protesters who take down monuments in public places. Fox News reported:

The new order enforces laws prohibiting the desecration of public monuments, the vandalism of government property, and recent acts of violence, withholds federal support tied to public spaces from state and local governments that have failed to protect public monuments, and withdraws federal grants for jurisdictions and law enforcement agencies that fail to stop their desecration.

Protests and conflicts: Some of the protests around allegedly offensive monuments have been peaceful, but at times they devolve into conflicts with police officers who attempt to maintain order.

A protest in Richmond surrounding a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee over the weekend resulted in police officers being hit with paintballs and other objects and even reportedly having fireworks launched at them. Six people were arrested after the violence led police to declare the gathering unlawful.

Donald Trump fires back at Joe Biden after Biden tried to blame Trump for Afghanistan collapse: 'Failure through weakness',"Former President Donald Trump slammed President Joe Biden in a statement late Saturday as the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan, blaming the disaster on Biden's ""weakness, incompetence, and total strategic incoherence.""

Trump's statement came hours after Biden placed blame on Trump for the Taliban's rapid success.

What did Biden say?

Biden attempted to deflect blame for the imminent fall of Afghanistan onto Trump in a statement late Saturday.

""When I came to office, I inherited a deal cut by my predecessor—which he invited the Taliban to discuss at Camp David on the eve of 9/11 of 2019—that left the Taliban in the strongest position militarily since 2001 and imposed a May 1, 2021 deadline on U.S. Forces,"" Biden said in a statement. ""Shortly before he left office, he also drew U.S. Forces down to a bare minimum of 2,500.""

""Therefore, when I became President, I faced a choice—follow through on the deal, with a brief extension to get our Forces and our allies' Forces out safely, or ramp up our presence and send more American troops to fight once again in another country's civil conflict,"" Biden continued.

How did Trump respond?

Trump responded several hours later, blasting Biden for a ""complete failure.""

In a statement, Trump said:

Joe Biden gets it wrong every time on foreign policy, and many other issues. Everyone knew he couldn't handle the pressure. Even Obama's Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, said as much. He ran out of Afghanistan instead of following the plan our Administration left for him — a plan that protected our people and our property, and ensured the Taliban would never dream of taking our Embassy or providing a base for new attacks against America. The withdrawal would be guided by facts on the ground.



After I took out ISIS, I established a credible deterrent. That deterrent is now gone. The Taliban no longer has fear or respect for America, or America's power. What a disgrace it will be when the Taliban raises their flag over America's Embassy in Kabul. This is complete failure through weakness, incompetence, and total strategic incoherence.



Anything else?

Biden's attempt to blame Trump came despite the president promising on July 8 that America would not suffer embarrassment in Afghanistan.

""The Taliban is not the south— the North Vietnamese army. They're not remotely comparable in terms of capability. There's going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of a embassy of the United States from Afghanistan,"" Biden promised. ""It is not at all comparable.""

However, viral images showed Sunday American helicopters evacuating Americans from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul as the Taliban closed in on the Afghan capital city.

The fall of Kabul to the Taliban is imminent. The terrorist group has claimed they are negotiating a ""peaceful"" transfer of power. According to the Associated Press, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani also fled the country on Sunday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-establishes-space-command,2021-08-15
Trump-hating group terrified he won't leave office if he loses in November concludes only safe election outcome is Biden landslide,"So there's a group out there ironically named the Transition Integrity Project, which came together out of fear that President Donald Trump might not leave office if he loses November's election — a conspiracy theory that's been widely touted by leftists and the left-wing media.

And in a Washington Post opinion piece published Thursday, the co-founder of the group described how it constructed a series of ""war games"" to figure out ahead of time what might happen under various election scenarios.

Oh, don't you worry. Georgetown law professor Rosa Brooks wrote in her piece that the Transition Integrity Project ""sought out some of the most accomplished Republicans, Democrats, civil servants, media experts, pollsters and strategists around"" to help them with this task — so, of course, it was all fair minded.

What did the group conclude?

Brooks, not surprisingly, broke the news that ""a landslide for Joe Biden resulted in a relatively orderly transfer of power. Every other scenario we looked at involved street-level violence and political crisis.""

So, how did they get to the scenarios? Well — and again, never fear — the Transition Integrity Project listened to ""experts"" who offered four election scenarios that are ""most likely."" Brooks said they are:

""a narrow Biden win""

""a big Biden win, with a decisive lead in both the electoral college and the popular vote""

""a Trump win with an electoral college lead but a large popular-vote loss, as in 2016""

""a period of extended uncertainty as we saw in the 2000 election""

No Trump landslide scenario, as has been floated as a distinct possibility? Perish the thought.

One might imagine that getting volunteers to play these war games from the Republican side of the aisle would be a challenge — unless the participants despise Trump. And lo and behold, Brooks noted that they secured the likes of ""former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, conservative commentator Bill Kristol and former Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson.""

But hey, it's OK. Remember this project's middle name is ""integrity.""

One wonders if Democrats lined up to participate, but Brooks' piece didn't mention if such enthusiasm was rampant. In the end the group nabbed the likes of John Podesta, who chaired Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 presidential campaign, Donna Brazile, and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm.

According to Brooks, the remaining participants ""included political strategists, journalists, polling experts, tech and social media experts, and former career officials from the intelligence community, the Justice Department, the military and the Department of Homeland Security.""

Let the games begin

Here's one scenario outlined in the Post piece:

On the morning of Election Day, false stories appear online claiming that Biden has been hospitalized with a life-threatening heart attack and the election has been delayed. Every mainstream news organization reports that the rumors are unfounded, but many Biden supporters, confused by the bogus claims, stay home.



Still, by late that night, most major networks have called the election for Biden: The former vice president has won key states and has a slender lead in the national popular vote, and polling experts predict that his lead will grow substantially as Western states count an unusually high number of mail-in ballots. The electoral college looks secure for Biden, too.



But Trump refuses to concede, alleging on Twitter that ""MILLIONS of illegal ALIENS and DEAD PEOPLE"" have voted in large numbers and that the uncounted ballots are all ""FAKE VOTES!!!"" Social media fills with posts from Trump supporters alleging that the election has been ""stolen"" in a ""Deep State coup,"" and Trump-friendly pundits on Fox News and OAN echo the message.



Soon, Attorney General William P. Barr opens an investigation into unsubstantiated allegations of massive vote-by-mail fraud and ties between Democratic officials and antifa. In Michigan and Wisconsin, where Biden has won the official vote and Democratic governors have certified slates of pro-Biden electors, the Trump campaign persuades Republican-controlled legislatures to send rival pro-Trump slates to Congress for the electoral college vote.



The next week is chaotic: A list of Michigan and Wisconsin electors for Biden circulates on right-wing social media, including photos, home addresses and false claims that scores of them are in the pay of billionaire George Soros or have been linked to child sex-trafficking rings.



Massive pro-Biden street protests begin, demanding that Trump concede. The president tweets that ""REAL PATRIOTS MUST SHOW THESE ANTIFA TERRORISTS THAT CITIZENS WHO LOVE THE 2ND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER LET THEM STEAL THIS ELECTION!!!"" Around the nation, violent clashes erupt. Several people are injured and killed in multiple incidents, though reports conflict about their identities and who started the violence.



Meanwhile, Trump declares that ""UNLESS THIS CARNAGE ENDS NOW,"" he will invoke the Insurrection Act and send ""Our INCREDIBLY POWERFUL MILITARY and their OMINOUS WEAPONS"" into the streets to ""Teach these ANTI-AMERICAN TERRORISTS A LESSON."" At the Pentagon, the Joint Chiefs of Staff convene a hurried meeting to discuss the crisis.

Yes, you read that correctly.

Brooks even admitted that in each scenario, the war gamers simulating the Trump campaign were ""ruthless and unconstrained right out of the gate"" and in one instance made ""repeated allegations of fraudulent mail-in ballots"" that ""led National Guard troop [sic] to destroy thousands of ballots in Democratic-leaning ZIP codes, to applause on social media from Trump supporters."" (Think Steele and Kristol enjoyed that? Nah.)

Of course, she added, Team Biden repeatedly ""urged calm, national unity and a fair vote count, while Team Trump issued barely disguised calls for violence and intimidation against ballot-counting officials and Biden electors.""

And while both teams wanted followers to take to the streets, Brooks wrote that ""Team Biden repeatedly called for peaceful protests, while Team Trump encouraged provocateurs to incite violence, then used the resulting chaos to justify sending federalized Guard units or active-duty military personnel into American cities to 'restore order,' leading to still more violence. (The exercises underscored the tremendous power enjoyed by an incumbent president: Biden can call a news conference, but Trump can call in the 82nd Airborne.)""

What does the Transition Integrity Project suggest?

In order to ""avoid democratic collapse,"" the Transition Integrity Project has a few ideas — and the first is that officials must ""commit to protecting the integrity of the electoral process against partisan meddling.""

In addition, Brooks noted that ""military and law enforcement leaders can prepare for the possibility that politicians will seek to manipulate or misuse their coercive powers. Partisans, including Trump, may try to deploy law enforcement, National Guard troops and, potentially, active-duty military personnel to 'restore order' in a manner that primarily benefits one party, or involve troops and law enforcement in efforts to interrupt the ballot-counting process.""

For whatever reason Biden wasn't mentioned alongside Trump as one of the ""partisans."" Who knew?

The group also hopes the media can help folks ""understand that voter fraud is extraordinarily rare, and, in particular, that there's nothing nefarious about voting by mail.""

Standoff between Trump Jr. and the Senate Intel Committee for his testimony has been resolved,"Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee have reportedly made a deal with Donald Trump Jr. to give his testimony after he indicated that he was very reticent to return after testifying previously.

Fox News reported that Trump Jr. already had a letter drafted that would have dared Democrats to hold him in contempt after refusing to appear. Democrats on the Intel Committee had issued a subpoena to him on Wednesday.

But at the eleventh hour before a second deadline, it was reported that Trump Jr. struck a deal to testify in June and avoid worsening the legal conflict.

CNN's Manu Raju reported that they agreed to limit his interview to between 2 and 4 hours, and to limit the scope to 5 or 6 topics.

CNN had earlier reported that Trump Jr. was considering declaring his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, or not showing up at all.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) had opined that Trump Jr. should refuse the subpoena outright.

""If I were Donald Trump Jr.'s lawyer, I would tell him, you don't need to go back into this environment anymore,"" Graham said. ""You have been there for hours and hours and hours, and nothing being alleged here changes the outcome of the Mueller investigation.""

President Donald Trump decried the action from Democrats, saying that his son had already testified for hours and that there was no reason for him to do so again.

""Now they want him to testify again, and I don't know why, I have no idea why, but it seems very unfair to me!"" said the president about the demand from Democrats.

'No way to dress that up': Trump lawyer’s Biden-Burisma arguments draw praise from even CNN’s Jeffrey Toobin,"Pam Bondi's breakdown of the corruption concerns surrounding Hunter Biden's business dealings in the Ukraine during the Senate impeachment trial were so effective, that even CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin had to give her credit for it.

During the White House defense team's opening arguments Monday, the former Florida attorney general argued that questions about potential corruption surrounding the Bidens' dealings in the Ukraine while Joe Biden was vice president and Hunter Biden was employed as a board member at the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma were indeed legitimate.

""When the House managers gave you their presentation, when they submitted their brief, they repeatedly referenced Hunter Biden and Burisma,"" Bondi began, adding that ""they referenced Biden or Burisma over 400 times"" during opening arguments ""and when they gave these presentations, they said there was nothing, nothing to see.""

Bondi went on to say that Democrats' ""case crumbles because they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no basis to raise this concern, but that's not what public records show.""

In addition to giving a detailed timeline of Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma during his father's time in office, as well as the political events in Ukraine at the time, Bondi pointed out how even witnesses called by House Democrats during the impeachment investigation saw potential problems with the matter.

""In fact, every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Bondi said. ""Multiple House Democrat witnesses, including those from the Department of State, the National Security Council, and other unanimously testified there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest. These were their witnesses.""



She also pointed out how multiple legacy media outlets raised questions about Hunter Biden's role at Burisma before the matter ended up at the center of congressional Democrats' efforts to impeach President Trump.

www.youtube.com

During a CNN segment later Monday, Toobin, the network's legal analyst, admitted that Bondi had done an effective job of pointing out the bad optics of Hunter Biden's Ukrainian employment.



""I thought Attorney General Bondi did an effective job at showing how sleazy the hiring of Hunter Biden was,"" Toobin said. ""There is no way to dress that up. He was given a great deal of money for a job he was unqualified for and the only reason he got it is because he was the vice president's son.""

However, Toobin then immediately pivoted to the Trump defense's team's discussion about Joe Biden's role in the matter, ""a parade of lies"" and ""outrageously false in every fact, in every insinuation.""

During an interview with ABC News last year, Hunter Biden also admitted that he ""probably"" wouldn't have gotten the lucrative position at Burisma if his last name weren't Biden.

"Trump announces another Middle East peace deal, this time between Israel and Bahrain","President Donald Trump announced another peace deal Friday, as Israel and Bahrain established diplomatic relations just weeks after a similar agreement was struck between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Fox News reported.

Bahrain becomes just the fourth country in the region to establish formal peaceful ties with Israel, joining Egypt, Jordan, and UAE. President Trump was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the deal between Israel and UAE.

""This is a historic breakthrough to further peace in the Middle East,"" a joint statement from the U.S., Bahrain, and Israel said. ""Opening direct dialogue and ties between these two dynamic societies and advanced economies will continue the positive transformation of the Middle East and increase stability, security, and prosperity in the region.""

The announcement of the deal comes on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and President Trump pointed out the significance of pushing for peace in the region.



""There's no more powerful response to the hatred that spawned 9/11 than this agreement,"" Trump said.

CNN reported that officials believe this deal could be significant toward a potential agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, since Bahrain is viewed in some ways as an extension of Saudi Arabia:

Bahrain, a tiny island nation that is home to the US Navy's Fifth Fleet, is regarded in some ways as an extension of Saudi Arabia, partly because they are physically linked by a causeway but also because the Bahraini monarchy is heavily reliant on Riyadh.



Officials said the agreement with Israel announced on Friday could likely not have happened without Saudi Arabia's blessing, signaling that Bahrain may serve as a test case for a future Saudi-Israel deal.

A signing ceremony that will include Bahrain, UAE, and Israel is scheduled on Tuesday.

The White House emphasized the impact of the agreements as Trump runs for reelection, pointing out the historic nature of the peace deals and using them as examples of the president's desire to end long-term conflicts in the region.

""This is an extraordinary achievement,"" White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern told Fox News. ""The president made the first major breakthrough like this in 26 years. In less than a month, he's made yet another one.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-jr-agrees-to-testify,2020-09-11
"Climate activist calls Trump, other ‘strongmen’ leaders ‘true planetary arsonists determined to torch the planet with glee’","In a ""NowThis"" video on Twitter, author and journalist Naomi Klein raged against President Donald Trump and other ""strongmen-style politicians"" calling them ""planetary arsonists determined to torch the planet with glee.""

Klein, who is also currently the chair of Media, Culture, and Feminist Studies at Rutgers University, recently published a book titled, ""On Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal"" where she draws sweeping comparisons between climate chaos and the political chaos that leaders like Trump supposedly ignite.

In the video, which serves as a brief summary of the arguments in her book, Klein argues that the world presently has two fires raging: ""The fires of climate destruction"" and ""the political fires, the fires of hate"" — and that somehow these fires are related.

""It's not a coincidence that these strongmen figures are coming to power all over the world because they're tapping into feelings of profound unease,"" Klein argues. ""But these men are also tapping into our moment of ecological insecurity.""

'They are true planetary arsonists' — Journalist and author @NaomiAKlein explains how Trump and other 'strongmen' leaders are perpetuating the climate crisis pic.twitter.com/OCllnqwHGY

— NowThis (@nowthisnews) December 5, 2019

Klein lists leaders like Trump, Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, and Australia's Scott Morrison as examples of the so-called ""planetary arsonists.""

These men's one true skill, Klein says, ""is making other people's fear work for them."" By stirring up division, these leaders are then free to get on with their real business of plundering the environment.

Their method is a circular firestorm, argues Klein, who says the leaders cause environmental fires, which directly intensify armed conflicts, which lead to migration, which in turn is used by them to fuel fires of hate — are you dizzy, yet?

But, ""there is a third fire and it is also blazing,"" she says, alluding to youth climate strikers like Greta Thunburg. ""It is our fire.""

Thunberg, 16, has recently garnered international attention for her defiant, impassioned activism for climate change, and like Thunburg, Klein weaves climate issues with societal issues.

In an op-ed last Friday, Thunberg argued that if humanity is to adequately address climate change, we must overhaul everything, including ""colonial, racist, and patriarchal systems of oppression.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-lawyers-biden-burisma-arguments-draw-praise-from-jeffrey-toobin,2019-12-05
Trump pushes Tulsa rally back to avoid Juneteenth conflict at request of black supporters,"President Donald Trump announced Friday that his first campaign rally since the COVID-19 lockdowns began would be pushed back one day at the request of black supporters, in order to avoid holding it on the same day as the Juneteenth holiday.

The president was scheduled to hold a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Friday, June 19. The rally will now be on Saturday.

""We had previously scheduled our #MAGA Rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for June 19th – a big deal,"" Trump tweeted. ""Unfortunately, however, this would fall on the Juneteenth Holiday. Many of my African American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date out of respect for this Holiday, and in observance of this important occasion and all that it represents. I have therefore decided to move our rally to Saturday, June 20th, in order to honor their requests. We have already had ticket requests in excess of 200,000 people. I look forward to seeing everyone in Oklahoma!""

What is Juneteenth? Juneteenth is a holiday to remember June 19, 1865, when federal troops arrived in Texas to ensure that all slaves in the state were freed. Texas had become something of a safe haven for slavery, even 2 1/2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Slavery was formally abolished in December of that year by the 13th Amendment.



Texas is among 47 states that recognize Juneteenth as a holiday, although efforts to make it a national holiday have been unsuccessful.

Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the only black Republican U.S. senator, said he didn't think President Trump was aware of the significance of Juneteenth.

""My understanding is he moved the date once he understood the Juneteenth,"" Scott said, according to USA Today. ""I'm not sure that the planners on his inner-circle team thought about June 19th, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and race riots.

"Trump repeatedly interrupts Jim Acosta during news conference, accuses him of having an agenda and being 'fake news'","President Donald Trump talked over CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta in a heated exchange during a news conference Friday at the White House. Acosta accused the president of fabricating a crisis on the border in order to declare a national emergency after he could not get a border wall approved by Congress.

What was the news conference about?



Trump called a news conference on Friday morning to announce that he planned to declare a national emergency in order to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border without congressional funding.

What happened with Acosta?

After making his announcement, Trump took some questions from reporters.

When the president called on him, Acosta began: ""Thank you,. Mr. President. I wondered if you could comment on this disconnect that we seem to have in this country, where you are presenting information about what's happening at the border, calling it an invasion, talking about women with duct tape over their mouths and so on. And yet, there's a lot of reporting out there, there's a lot of crime data out there, there's a lot of Homeland Security data out there that shows border crossings at a near record low—

""That's because of us,"" Trump interrupted him. ""It's still, excuse me, it's still massive numbers.""

Acosta continued ""—that shows undocumented immigrants committing crimes at lower levels — that shows undocumented criminals — or undocumented immigrants committing crimes at lower levels than native born Americans. What do you say—""

""You don't really believe that stat. Do you really believe that stat?"" Trump interjected. ""Take a look at our federal prisons.""

""I believe in facts and statistics and data but— "" Acosta said

""OK, real quick, let's go,"" Trump said, trying to make him hurry up.

""What do you say to your critics who say you are creating a national emergency, that you're concocting a national emergency here, in order to get your wall because you couldn't get it through other ways?"" Acosta asked.

""Let's ask the angel moms. Do you think I'm creating something?"" Trump said, referring to the mothers of people killed by illegal immigrants whom he had invited to the press briefing. ""Ask these incredible women, who lost their daughters and their sons. OK? Because your question is a very political question, because you have an agenda. You're CNN. You're fake news. You have an agenda. The numbers that you gave are wrong. Take a look at our federal prison population. See how many of them, percentage wise, are illegal aliens. Just see. Go ahead and see. it's a fake question.""

Trump spars with CNN's Acosta: You have an agenda, you're fake news youtu.be

Do we know what percentage of federal inmates are illegal immigrants?

Figuring out the number of illegal immigrants in federal prisons is not as easy as it sounds. In the past year, the pro-border wall Federation for American Immigration Reform put out a study that claimed that illegal immigrants are three times as likely to be convicted of crimes on average than American citizens.

A few months earlier, however, the Libertarian think tank CATO released a study claiming that immigrants are about half as likely to commit crimes.

These two studies are so different because there is no direct way to get at the number of how many illegal immigrants are incarcerated in the U.S., so researchers need to find creative ways to get at that information through other data sets.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-planetary-arsonist,2019-02-15
Trump now says he agrees '100 percent' that some US troops need to stay in Syria,"When members of Congress wrote to President Donald Trump expressing their desire to leave a ""small contingent"" of American forces in Syria, he wrote back saying that he agreed with them ""100%,"" NBC News reported.

Here's what we know

The letter was signed by a bipartisan group of 12 senators, including Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

The letter said, in part:

It is a tremendous accomplishment to defeat the caliphate, and we join you in deep appreciation for the efforts of our military and our allies. Our goal now must be to ensure ISIS is not able to regenerate and pose a threat to American security here at home or abroad.



To that end, we support a small American stabilizing force in Syria. We agree that a stabilizing force, which includes a small contingent of American troops and ground forces from our European allies, is essential to ensure stability and prevent the return of ISIS. It also serves to help set the table for a negotiated settlement to the Syrian war in Geneva.

With a marker, Trump highlighted one paragraph in particular, which stated that:

Like you, we seek to ensure that all of the gains made in Syria are not lost, that ISIS never returns, that Iran is not emboldened, and that we consolidate our gains and ensure the best outcome in Geneva for American interests. Those are all important objectives. An international presence will also help prevent conflict between our NATO ally Turkey and the Syrian Democratic Forces that have been central to the counter-ISIS campaign.

Trump's earlier decision to pull all U.S. troops from Syria led to the resignation of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy for the coalition targeting ISIS.



The decision to withdraw also caused concern among U.S. Kurdish allies. While the Kurds have proven to be invaluable allies in the fight against ISIS, Turkey considers all ethnic Kurds to be terrorists due to the actions of a Kurdish militant group inside Turkey. In October, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to ""descend on them [the Kurds] with more comprehensive and effective [strength].""

The Kurds make up part of the multi-ethnic Syrian Democratic Forces mentioned in the letter.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-pushes-tulsa-rally-back-to-avoid-juneteenth-at-request-of-black-supporters,2019-03-05
Trump speaks from Walter Reed as more updates indicate his health is improving: 'Substantial progress',"President Donald Trump addressed the nation in a four-minute video late Saturday, explaining that his health has improved since arriving at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

""I came here, I wasn't feeling so well. I feel much better now,"" Trump said. ""We're working hard to get me back. I have to get all the way back because we still have to make America great again. We've done an awfully good job of that but we still have steps to go and I have to finish that job. I'll be back, I think, I'll be back soon.""

""We're going to beat the coronavirus, or whatever you want to call it, and we're going to beat it soundly,"" he later added.

Indeed, Sean Conley, D.O., the president's physician, released another update Saturday evening indicating Trump's health continues to progress as he battles coronavirus.



President Trump continues to do well, having made substantial progress since diagnosis. This evening he completed his second does of Remdesivir without complication. He remains fever-free and off supplemental oxygen with a saturation level between 96 and 98% all day.



He spent most of the afternoon conducting business, and has been up and moving about the medical suite without difficulty. While not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic.



The plan for tomorrow is to continue observation in between doses of Remdesivir, closely monitoring his clinical status while fully supporting his conduct of presidential duties.

In addition, the White House released two photos of Trump working while isolated inside the executive suite at Walter Reed.

The positive update came after conflicting reports triggered a wave of confusion earlier in the day.

Just minutes after Conley had concluded a press conference updating the media on the president, an anonymous source told the White House media pool that Trump's health had been worse than what was being said publicly. ""The president's vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning, and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care,"" the source said. ""We're still not on a clear path to a full recovery.""

White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was later identified as the anonymous source after he was captured on video and audio asking the media pool to talk off the record.

However, Meadows struck a much more hopeful tune Saturday evening.

Meadows told Fox News that Trump ""is doing extremely well. In fact, I'm very, very optimistic based on the current result,"" the Washington Examiner reported.

""He's made unbelievable improvements from yesterday morning, when I know a number of us, the doctor and I, were very concerned,"" Meadows explained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-repeatedly-interrupts-jim-acosta,2020-10-04
President Trump says he doesn't want his supporters confronting rioters: 'Leave it to law enforcement',"After some high-profile and deadly clashes between rioters and people seeking to defend property from destruction, President Donald Trump urged his supporters to allow law enforcement to handle riots and not to take matters into their own hands.

During an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, the president seemed to try to tone down some of the conflict between citizens in the streets of numerous American cities.

""Do you want your supporters to confront the left-wing protesters, or do you want to leave it to law enforcement?"" Ingraham asked the president.

""No. No, no, I don't want them. I want to leave it to law enforcement,"" Trump responded. ""But my supporters are wonderful, hard-working, tremendous people. And they turn on their television set, and they look at a Portland, or they look at a Kenosha, before I got involved and stopped it, or they look at Chicago, where 78 people were shot last weekend and numerous people died, or they look at New York, where violence is up by like, what? 150%. … They're looking at all of this, and they can't believe it.""

A Trump supporter was killed in Portland during a protest, and the suspect in that case identified himself as being a member of Antifa.

President Trump angered some of his opponents by not condemning Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old Trump supporter from Illinois who has been charged with two homicides for allegedly shooting two people in Kenosha, Wisconsin during riots.

""I guess he was in very big trouble,"" Trump said when asked about Rittenhouse. ""He would have been, he probably would have been killed. But it's under — it's under investigation.""

The president is traveling to Kenosha on Tuesday to meet with law enforcement officials and survey the severe damage that was causes last week by days of riots that left entire city blocks burned to the ground.

This latest round of national unrest was triggered by the police shooting of Jacob Blake. The shooting is still under investigation, but police have said they were attempting to arrest Blake for his involvement in a domestic disturbance and for a third-degree sexual assault warrant. Blake resisted arrest and was shot seven times in the back when he reached into his car.

Trump-supporting NFL owner allegedly pressured to step down from league's social justice committee,"Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross is no longer on the NFL's social justice committee, just weeks after facing criticism from the media, and one of his own players, for supporting President Donald Trump while leading social justice efforts, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

There are conflicting accounts about Ross' departure from the committee. Ross, through a team spokesperson, said he voluntarily stepped down.

""Stephen made the decision last week and informed the NFL and members of the working committee that he was going to step aside from the group and continue to focus his efforts on RISE (Ross Initiative in Sports for Equality),"" the spokesperson said. ""He believes in and is still fully committed to the work that has been done by the group and will always be a passionate supporter and tireless advocate for social justice causes, the fight for equal rights and education.""

Former NFL player Chris Long, a member of The Players Coalition, said that Ross left the committee as a result from pressure by players, but said it was not simply because he's conservative. Instead, it was specifically related to President Trump's previous comments about NFL players.

""He held a fundraiser for a guy who called protesting players 'sons of bitches' + campaigned for them to lose jobs,"" Long wrote on Twitter. ""The working group is directly involved. You can see how that's a conflict of interest that transcends politics. I respect [Ross'] work w RISE. Don't get it? Can't help.""

Ross has been friends with Trump for decades, but it became an issue for players after Dolphins wide receiver Kenny Stills tweeted about Ross's fundraiser for Trump.

"Trump takes shots at AOC, Ilhan Omar, while defending Pelosi against suggestions of racism","In remarks of a kind you don't necessarily expect to hear from President Donald Trump, the president actually came to the defense of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of his chief political rivals, after Pelosi has faced criticism from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and others in the far-left wing of the party.

President Trump was addressing the recent conflict between the Democratic establishment and the progressive wing, which resulted in Ocasio-Cortez accusing Pelosi of singling out ""newly-elected women of color.""

""I'll tell you something about Nancy Pelosi that you know better than I do, she is not a racist, okay?"" Trump said Friday. ""She is not a racist. For them to call her a racist is a disgrace.

""I don't think Nancy can let that go on. A group of people that came...I don't know where they came from,"" Trump continued.

For the record, despite the strong implication of racism in her comment to the Washington Post, Ocasio-Cortez has since said that she does not believe Pelosi is racist, according to CNN.

Although Trump called Ocasio-Cortez's words to Pelosi ""very disrespectful,"" respect is not how one would classify the president's typical way of speaking about the Democratic leader. Trump has called Pelosi ""nasty,"" ""horrible,""""a mess,"" and ""crazy,"" in recent months.

The president also had some words for another new progressive Democrat, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who is closely allied with Ocasio-Cortez.

""If one-half of the things they're saying about her are true, she shouldn't even be in office,"" Trump said.

Omar countered with an ""I know you are, but what am I""-style response by saying ""If one-tenth of what they say about you is true, you shouldn't be in office...next.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-supporters-no-confronting-rioters,2019-07-13
ACLU demands investigation into Trump's use of tear gas on protestors — but there are conflicting reports,"Many observers — both on the left and on the right — are incensed over President Donald Trump's controversial photo op Monday at St. John's Episcopal Church and are calling the clearing of protesters to make way for Trump and his entourage ""cowardly,"" ""dangerous,"" and ""shameful.""

But the American Civil Liberties Union took it a step further Tuesday demanding investigation into whether Trump broke international law by allegedly calling for the use of tear gas to disperse the crowd.

""This appears to be grossly unjustified use of a chemical weapon on protesters and raises serious human rights concerns under international law,"" the ACLU said. ""Elected officials, including Congress, must investigate this politically-motivated, life-threatening use of indiscriminate weapons.""

What are the details?

The alleged use of tear gas to clear demonstrators who were protesting George Floyd's death in Lafayette Square has been widely disseminated in online reports and on social media since Monday night, as people on the ground recalled feeling a stinging sensation in their lungs.

The Washington Post reported with apparent certainty that tear gas, flash-bang shells, and rubber bullets were used by the National Guard to clear the path. Attorney General William Barr visited the scene at 6:30 p.m., the Post reported, and shortly thereafter, ""chaos ensued"":

Members of the National Guard knelt briefly to put on gas masks, before suddenly charging eastward down H Street, pushing protestors down toward 17th Street. Authorities shoved protestors down with their shields, fired rubber bullets directly at them, released tear gas and set off flash-bang shells in the middle of the crowd.



Protestors began running, many still with their hands up, shouting, ""Don't shoot."" Others were vomiting, coughing and crying.

Roughly 30 minutes later, after the president finished his remarks in the Rose Garden, he and a small company of top advisers made their way through the streets to the church, Bible in hand.

What are the conflicting reports?

But a definitive statement has yet to be made regarding the use of tear gas by any of the law enforcement and military agencies involved, which includes the Park Police, the D.C. police, the Secret Service, and the National Guard.

WTOP-TV reporter Neal Augenstein is pushing back against reports that Park Police deployed tear gas, suggesting that a source from the agency told him that smoke canisters, without uncomfortable irritant, were used instead.

He added that his source said the Park Police were not even aware that the president would be moving through the area, but rather deployed the canisters after protesters began heaving water bottles at them.

When Augenstein asked the Secret Service and the D.C. police, both agencies declined to comment one way or another on the use of munitions. Of course, the Post article indicates that it was the National Guard in concert with other law enforcement that deployed the tear gas.

While Augenstein notes that something was assuredly fired since several reporters on the ground took notice of an irritating munition, it is simply not confirmed that the munition was tear gas as is being widely reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-supporting-nfl-owner-allegedly-pressured-to-step-down-from-leagues-social-justice-committee,2020-06-02
"When Trump heard about Mueller's appointment, he thought his presidency was over: 'I'm f***ed'","According to the newly released report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, when President Donald Trump first heard about Mueller's appointment, the president said he believed it was ""the end of my presidency,"" adding ""I'm f***ed."" He then blamed former Attorney General Jeff Sessions for allowing that to happen.

What does the report say?

The report says, on Page 78 of Volume 2:

According to notes written by [Sessions's Chief of Staff Jody] Hunt, when Sessions told the President that a Special Counsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in his chair and said, ""Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I'm f***ed."" The president became angry and lambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse himself from the investigation, saying, ""How could you let this happen, Jeff?"" The President said the position of Attorney General was his most important appointment and that Sessions had ""let [him] down,"" contrasting him to Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy. Sessions recalled that the President said to him ""you were supposed to protect me,"" or words to that effect. The President returned to the consequences of the appointment and said ""Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won't be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.

After this interaction, Trump reportedly told Sessions to resign. Sessions agreed, but Trump ultimately changed his mind and refused to accept his resignation.

White House Counsel Don McGahn had warned Trump that ""knocking out Mueller"" would only end up being ""[a]nother fact used to claim obst[ruction] of just[ice],"" the report stated.

Despite McGahn's warnings, a month after this incident, Trump asked McGahn to tell Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ""that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed."" McGahn refused to comply ""deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.""

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was also reportedly asked to carry out a similar order, according to Mueller. However, ""Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President's message personally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions.

President Trump says remaining US troops in Afghanistan should be 'home by Christmas',"On Thursday, President Trump announced that the remaining U.S. troops in Afghanistan — which peaked at 100,000 under the Obama administration but has since been reduced to under 8,600 during the Trump administration — should be home by Christmas.

Trump touted the news on Twitter, saying, ""We should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas!""

The withdrawal is the immediate result of a historic agreement between the U.S. and Afghanistan struck in February in which the U.S. offered to withdraw all troops from the country by May 2021 in exchange for counterterrorism guarantees from the Taliban.

The president has been outspoken during his presidency about the need to end America's ""endless wars,"" and has taken major steps to withdraw U.S. troops from areas such as Afghanistan and Iraq.

The total military withdrawal from Afghanistan would be a major achievement for the president. Though it should be noted that Trump's tweet appears to be at odds with a statement made hours earlier by his national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, who said that the number of troops would be reduced to 2,500 by the new year.

The end of a nearly 20-year war

It was 19 years ago in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that American troops were first deployed to Afghanistan to root out and combat the terrorists responsible.

According to a startling report from Stars and Stripes that puts the length of the U.S. conflict in Afghanistan in perspective, some of those same troops have watched as their sons and daughters deployed to the same fight.

""When we started this, people asked why I was going, and my response was, 'So my sons don't have to fight this war,'"" Master Sgt. Trevor deBoer told the military news outlet this week. deBoer has been deployed to Afghanistan three times with the 20th Special Forces Group since 2002, the outlet reported.

Despite his wishes, nearly two decades later, his son, Specialist Payton Sluss, was deployed to Afghanistan to fight on the same ground.

""My feet were walking the same land you were,"" Sluss reportedly told his father in a joint phone interview, referring to Forward Operating Base Fenty, near the city of Jalalabad.

Michael Kreuger, a former Army sergeant, fought in Pech Valley in 2010. Eight years later, his son Trenton was deployed to Afghanistan to serve in the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, just like his father.

Kreuger told Stars and Stripes recently that he just hopes his grandson won't also be deployed to Afghanistan to fight the same battles ""for the same reason.""

The Mavalwallas, a father and son who share the first name, Bajun, had the unique experiencing of serving together in Afghanistan at the same time and even met up in 2012 while serving.

The Mavalwallas are not alone, either. Fox News reported last year about Command Sgt. Maj. Michael Kirby and his son, Specialist Kyle Kirby, who were deployed together in February 2019 to join more than 150 other soldiers serving in Afghanistan as part of Operation Spartan Shield.

""This is my 5th deployment, it's his first, we're fortunate to be in the same unit now, so I know mom's pretty excited about that,"" Michael Kirby said at the time.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-tear-gas-on-protestors,2020-10-08
"TSA: We aren't looking for your weed, so don't let us find it","The Transportation Safety Administration has come out warning flyers that while its officers are not looking for marijuana or other drugs at checkpoints, they have to turn folks over to the law if they stumble across an illicit substance during security screening.

What are the details?

The agency issued a public service announcement on Instagram last month, saying, ""Are we cool? We like to think we're cool. We want you to have a pleasant experience at the airport and arrive safely at your destination. But getting caught while trying to fly with marijuana or cannabis-infused products can really harsh your mellow.""

""Let us be blunt,"" the message said, weaving in a little weed lingo, ""TSA officers DO NOT search for marijuana or other illegal drugs. Our screening procedures are focused on security and detecting potential threats.""

""But,"" the caption continued, ""in the event a substance appears to be marijuana or a cannabis infused product, we're required by federal law to notify law enforcement. This includes items that are used for medicinal purposes.""

Where did this come from?

While several states have legalized marijuana in various forms, the federal government still classifies the drug in the same category as heroin, LSD, and ecstasy, Forbes reported. Thus, the TSA is attempting to clear up confusion among toking travelers.

""There are all kinds of mixed messages being sent, but that's because we have mixed messages in the legal system,"" attorney and consultant David Bannard told Forbes. ""We've got such a conflict right now between states that have legalized marijuana for either recreational or medical use and the federal requirements that continue to make it a Schedule I controlled substance.""

Enforcement varies not only between jurisdictions but airport policies whenever a traveler is found with less than an ounce of pot. In some places, a person turned over to police for possession may or may not be arrested, issued a summons, or given the option to surrender their stash without punishment.

Some airports allow passengers to sail on through if they have an amount of pot within compliance of state law, while McCarran International Airport in Nevada prohibits possession of any marijuana — even though carrying less than an ounce is legal in the state. McCarran does, however, have ""amnesty boxes,"" which are receptacles provided for travelers to voluntarily ditch their weed before going through security.

Regardless of the variances in rules between destinations, the TSA's policies are consistent. Agency spokeswoman Lorie Dankers told USA Today last year, ""TSA's response to the discovery of marijuana is the same in every state and at every airport.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-thought-mueller-appointment-was-end-of-his-presidency,2019-05-06
Tulsi Gabbard goes scorched-earth on Kamala Harris over Ukraine-Russia performance: 'Grade-school understanding',"Democrat Tulsi Gabbard said Monday that Vice President Kamala Harris' recent performance on the world stage proved she lacks the foreign policy prowess necessary for top American leaders.

What is the background?

While President Joe Biden remained stateside, the Biden administration dispatched Harris to Germany last week to meet with top European leaders and hopefully decrease the chances of war between Russia and Ukraine.

The trip ended with an embarrassing press conference in which Harris made contradicting claims. On one hand, Harris claimed Russian President Vladimir Putin had ""made his decision"" to invade Ukraine. On the other hand, Harris claimed the U.S. was prepared to impose crippling economic sanctions that Harris promised would ""absolutely"" deter Putin from invading Ukraine.

What did Gabbard say?

Speaking on Fox News, Gabbard called Harris' performance ""embarrassing"" and charged that the vice president was dispatched as a ""purely political calculation,"" presumably to beef up Harris' foreign policy résumé.

""My gosh, this is embarrassing. It’s hard to keep track of all of those jumbles of words. It’s clear she was sent there to be the voice of the United States as a purely political calculation,"" Gabbard said. ""She has no foreign policy background, she has no foreign policy understanding. She has no concept of the cost of war, nor does she have the temperament necessary to be the voice of the United States on the global stage. It’s embarrassing to see this play out.""

Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, added that Harris' threats of deterrent sanctions defied the laws of ""grade-school understanding.""

""She talked about deterrence and sanctions. How do you deter someone by punishing them before they do it? It’s very simple. This is kind of like grade-school understanding,"" Gabbard said. ""If you say, 'I’m going to punish you before you do something,' wouldn’t a kid say, 'Fine, I might as well go ahead and do it anyway.' This is not rocket science.""

Gabbard later explained the American people ""will be left holding the bag"" for the Biden administration's response to Ukraine-Russia conflict, meaning they will pay the price incurred by U.S. involvement.

Twitter debuts new 'crisis misinformation policy',"Twitter rolled out a new global ""crisis misinformation policy"" on Thursday that the company says will combat misinformation during emergencies and other crisis situations.

In a blog post, Twitter said it will censor posts that spread misinformation by placing a warning notice in front of tweets from high profile accounts that violate the policy. The company aims to slow the spread of ""the most visible, misleading content, particularly that which could lead to severe harms.""

Judgements on which content is true or false will be made with ""verification from multiple credible, publicly available sources,"" including journalists, non-governmental watchdog groups, and other conflict monitoring groups.

Once Twitter determines that a claim is misleading, it will stop promoting that content in the Home timeline, Search, and Explore features. Examples of content that could be suppressed include false reporting of a major conflict, false allegations related to the use of weapons or war crimes, or false information relating to how the international community responds.

There will be an exception to this policy for commentary, fact-checkers, and people sharing personal accounts of their experience.



""Content moderation is more than just leaving up or taking down content, and we’ve expanded the range of actions we may take to ensure they’re proportionate to the severity of the potential harm,"" wrote Yoel Roth, the company's head of safety and integrity.



A tweet with content that violates the crisis misinformation policy may be placed behind a warning label that reads: ""This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules on sharing false or misleading info that might bring harm to crisis-affected populations. However, to preserve this content for accountability purposes, Twitter has determined this Tweet should remain available.""



""We’ve found that not amplifying or recommending certain content, adding context through labels, and in severe cases, disabling engagement with the Tweets, are effective ways to mitigate harm, while still preserving speech and records of critical global events,"" Roth wrote.

These new standards will be specifically enforced during ""emergent global crises,"" with the first iteration of this policy being activated for the ongoing war in Ukraine. Twitter said it will rely on the United Nations Inter-Agency Standing Committee's emergency response framework and other global humanitarian frameworks to determine when a major crisis is occurring.

The new policy comes as billionaire Elon Musk is attempting to acquire Twitter in a $44 billion deal. Musk, a free speech advocate, has criticized the company's content moderation policies. His deal to buy Twitter has been put on hold pending an investigation of how many fake or spam accounts are on the platform.

Twitter may hide or label coronavirus tweets it deems to be misleading or disputed,"Twitter will post warnings for users, and in some cases hide content, for posts it deems to be misleading, false, or disputed regarding COVID-19, the Associated Press reported.

Depending on the perceived problem with the tweets in question, Twitter may assign a warning underneath a tweet alerting users that it contains disputed information, or it may attempt to direct users to a link with verified information from public health experts.

Other situations might call for a tweet to be completely covered by a warning message stating that ""some or all of the content shared in this tweet conflict with guidance from public health experts regarding COVID-19,"" AP reported.

This initiative is not a full fact-checking operation, Twitter said, and the site will not outright label things as misinformation. From AP:

Twitter won't directly fact check or call tweets false on the site, said Nick Pickles, the company's global senior strategist for public policy. The warning labels might direct users to curated tweets, public health websites or news articles.



""People don't want us to play the role of deciding for them what's true and what's not true but they do want people to play a much stronger role providing context,"" Pickles said.

This policy change is in addition to Twitter's current policy of taking down tweets it views as being harmful to others, such as tweets that push fake coronavirus cures, or posts that say social distancing or masks don't help stop or slow the spread of COVID-19.

YouTube recently announced that videos containing information that contradict guidance from the World Health Organization are subject to removal, with CEO Susan Wojcicki citing examples such as videos claiming hydroxychloroquine prevents COVID-19 or that taking vitamin C is a cure.

""Anything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations would be a violation of our policy. And so remove is another really important part of our policy,"" she told CNN's Brian Stelter.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tulsi-gabbard-kamala-harris-ukraine-russia-performance,2020-05-11
"Twitter assisted in government psyop campaigns, new 'Twitter Files' reveal","Twitter employees assisted the Pentagon with covert psychological operations by helping push propaganda through a network of Twitter accounts in different languages, as revealed by investigative journalist Lee Fang.

""How Twitter Quietly Aided the Pentagon’s Covert Online PsyOp Campaign,"" Fang writes, revealing documents obtained from Twitter's internal communications dubbed the ""Twitter Files.""

The files reveal that in 2017, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) sent Twitter a list of 52 Arab language accounts that the military used to ""amplify certain messages."" A government official asked for priority service for six of the accounts, verification for one, and special ""whitelist"" abilities for another.

""Our [special operations command] guys mentioned they'd love to be able to come and meet up for a face-to-face,"" the email also says.

The same day, Twitter applied a special ""whitelist"" tag that acts similarly to a verification without a blue checkmark, meaning it provides exemption from spam and abuse flagging and is more likely be to seen or trend.

The Arab-language accounts are fairly cut and dried as far as messaging goes. They promoted U.S. messaging in the Middle East on topics such as the Yemen conflict, anti-Iranian messages, and how ""accurate"" drone strikes have been, claiming to kill only the intended terrorist target.

In May 2020, a Twitter employee seemingly emailed the Department of Justice proactively, providing a list of accounts Twitter had discovered along with a list that had been provided. The detected accounts tweeted in Russian and Arabic similarly to the aforementioned, yet were not disclosed to Twitter as having government ties.

Many of these accounts continued operations well into May 2022, according to Fang, meaning Twitter allowed their accounts to operate under shadowy pretenses for at least two years in some cases.

In August 2022, a Stanford Internet Observatory report discovered several of these accounts, finding that a network across social media platforms was using ""deepfake"" images and memes against U.S. foreign adversaries to promote pro-American messages.

""An interconnected web of accounts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and five other social media platforms [have] used deceptive tactics to promote pro-Western narratives in the Middle East and Central Asia,"" the report reads.



""The platforms’ datasets appear to cover a series of covert campaigns over a period of almost five years rather than one homogeneous operation. These campaigns consistently advanced narratives promoting the interests of the United States and its allies while opposing countries including Russia, China, and Iran,"" it concluded.

According to Fang, ""Twitter was cast as an unbiased hero for removing 'a network of fake user accounts promoting pro-Western policy positions,'"" despite the company's obvious assistance in allowing these accounts to operate against their terms of service.

Twitter officials even praised each other when reports came out on the subject and were clearly pleased that they were not exposed for their government cooperation.

Two men spray homeowner with mace while trying to invade home after midnight. But homeowner has a gun — and fatally shoots one intruder in head.,"A homeowner in Jefferson County, Missouri, told sheriff's deputies two men came to his residence in the 400 block of Sequoia Drive after midnight Thursday and knocked on the door, KSDK-TV reported.

The homeowner told deputies he asked who was there, and an unfamiliar voice replied, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Even scarier was the sound of the doorknob being shaken — as if those outside were trying to enter the residence, the paper added.

What happened next?

With that the homeowner grabbed his revolver, the station said.

Then the homeowner opened the door and saw two men standing on the porch with masks on, the Post-Dispatch said, citing court documents.

One of the men reached inside the home and sprayed mace, the paper said. The homeowner said he was hit with the mace, KSDK reported — after which he fired multiple gunshots at the men in self-defense and then ran into a room to call 911.

The station said the homeowner figured the men ran off.

Well, one did — temporarily — and the other one apparently didn't make it off the porch.

When deputies arrived at the residence around 1:40 a.m., they found a man with a gunshot wound to the head lying on the doorstep, KSDK reported, adding that the sheriff's office said he died at the scene. The man was identified as 36-year-old Wayne Roam of House Springs and determined to be one of the suspects involved in the incident, the station added.

Second suspect located

Just minutes after their arrival, deputies told KSDK they saw an SUV drive slowly past the home. The Post-Dispatch, citing court documents, said deputies stopped the vehicle and questioned the driver and a front-seat passenger.

More from the paper:

The two men had ""conflicting stories"" about why they were in the area and deputies noticed the passenger's shirt had red stains on it, believed to be blood, charging documents said.



The passenger was later identified as 29-year-old Sean Ramsey, of Festus. He and the driver were arrested on outstanding warrants at the scene.



Ramsey is now facing charges with second-degree murder because a death occurred during a crime, charges said. He was also charged with first-degree burglary and third-degree assault.



The homeowner was not arrested.



Sheriff Dave Marshak said this incident seems to be targeted, KSDK reported, adding that investigators don't believe there is any danger to the public.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/twitter-hide-label-coronavirus-tweets-misleading-disputed,2021-09-17

Texas man arrested after his 1-year-old daughter is found abandoned in a car seat on the side of the road,"A Texas man was arrested after he allegedly abandoned his 1-year-old child on the side of the road in her car seat while he was intoxicated.

The harrowing incident unfolded on Tuesday in Tyler, a city located east of Dallas, when a cyclist found the child on the side of Rhones Quarter Road at about 8 p.m. He went to a nearby home and called the police.

KYTX-TV reported that only five minutes later, another call was made to the police to report an intoxicated man at a parking lot of a gas station.

EMS found that the child had only suffered an abrasion on her hand, and she was later picked up by her family members.

Tyler police said they were able to find 37-year-old Paul Hanna, the father of the child, on Tuesday at the Cefco gas station. When they questioned him, he said that he believed the child had been with a full-time nurse who was also attending to his 4-year-old son.

The night nurse told police that the man lived with two children but that she hadn't seen the baby girl or her father for three hours that night. She also identified the child as Hanna's daughter based on photographs that police showed her, according to an affidavit.

Police said that Hanna sounded ""uncredible and intoxicated"" during the interview and that he had given conflicting stories. They also determined that he had been the last person seen with his daughter.

Smith County Jail records indicated that he was arrested on Tuesday and was held on bonds totaling $752,500. He is facing charges for driving while intoxicated and child endangerment.



The girl was placed in custody of her grandparents.

U.S. citizen who spent 23 days in immigrant detention alleges 'inhumane' conditions,"UPDATE, 7/25 at 9:45 p.m. CST: Brian Hastings, the Chief of Law Enforcement at the U.S. Border Patrol, testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday that Francisco Erwin Galicia claimed to be a Mexican national when he was stopped at the Customs and Border Protection checkpoint in Falfurrias.

However, the Department of Homeland Security accused Galicia of falsely claiming to be a citizen, according to a notice to appear in immigration court obtained by The Dallas Morning News. Galicia also reportedly presented his birth certificate showing birth in Dallas to CBP and ICE.









Original story:

A Texas resident and U.S. citizen who was held in immigration detention for more than three weeks told The Dallas Morning News that the conditions in which he and others were being held were ""inhumane.""

Galicia was reportedly first held at the Customs and Border Protection checkpoint in Falfurrias, Texas, and later at the South Texas Detention Complex in Pearsall.

""It was inhumane how they treated us,"" Galicia told DMN. ""It got to the point where I was ready to sign a deportation paper just to not be suffering there anymore. I just needed to get out of there.""

Galicia said he lost about 26 pounds during his detention because he wasn't given enough food, and said he was not allowed to shower. He also said he was held in a crowded area with 60 other men who were all forced to sleep on the floor, and some of whom he said were very sick.

CBP declined to specifically address Galicia's claims about detention facility conditions when contacted by TheBlaze on Thursday. The two agencies issued the following statement to TheBlaze about the situation:

""This individual provided conflicting reports regarding status of citizenship after being apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol and transferred into Immigration and Customs Enforcement Custody. Situations including conflicting reports from the individual and multiple birth certificates can, and should, take more time to verify. While we continue to research the facts of the situation, the individual has been released from ICE custody. Both CBP and ICE are committed to the fair treatment of migrants in our custody and continue to take appropriate steps to verify all facts of this situation.""

Galicia, 18, was stopped at the CBP checkpoint in Falfurrias, Texas, on June 27 as he, his brother, and some friends drove from Edinburg in South Texas to a soccer scouting event at Ranger College in north Texas.

Galicia was born in Dallas. His brother, Marlon, was in the country illegally and voluntarily deported a few days into his detention. At least one of the friends in the car was also detained.

When Galicia was stopped, he had his Texas state ID, a wallet copy of his birth certificate, and his Social Security card on him. Authorities doubted the validity of the documents and detained him anyway, possibly due to the fact that his mother, an illegal immigrant still living in Texas, used a fraudulent visitor's visa to get Galicia back into the U.S. when he was a baby, and claimed he had been born in Mexico.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/two-new-identifications-of-world-trade-center-victims-announced-ahead-of-9-11-anniversary,2019-07-25
Ukraine and Russia are both using Chinese commercial drones for psychological warfare and spying,"We've officially entered the age of drone wars.

The Ukraine-Russia war started with the mobilization of Russian tanks, but now more than ever, the two countries are fighting, spying, and engaging in psychological warfare with the use of both military drones and commercial/residential ones, according to a new report by the Washington Post.

With massive amounts of money being sent to eastern Europe, Republicans have been asking for details regarding the weapons being provided, but the use of handheld drones was likely not on anyone's mind or at the very least has been severely underreported.



Currently, there are ""hundreds of reconnaissance and attack drones flying over Ukraine each day"" — all varying in type and size — in what appears to be an obvious result of, and solution to, attrition. Drones are being used in all integral militaristic phases on both sides, with radar jamming and air defense being carried out by large fleets.

Russia is reportedly using it's own six-foot drones, along with Iranian drones that are nearly twice the size. Ukraine is being provided the American Switchblade 300 ""suicide drone"" alongside its use of the gigantic Bayraktar TB2, a Turkish drone with a 12-meter wingspan.

However, both sides are using what's called the Mavic 3 drone — a small, easily obtainable product for home or commercial use that can be bought off the manufacturer's website or Amazon. It's use was recently called a ""true symbol of modern warfare"" by a retired Russian general earlier this year.

They are so widely prevalent that Ukrainian soldiers say they often ""don’t know if the drone they spot is friend or foe.""

The Chinese-made drone typically used for aerial photography or video has a vastly different purpose in this armed conflict than those of its larger cousins. Among its uses include dropping explosives fashioned out of recycled soda bottles, a strategy Ukrainian special forces claim they used in November 2022.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine, the aerial units are explicitly used as a method of psychological warfare by dropping small munitions on Russian bases.

Ukraine is publicly collecting funds to buy up swaths of drones around the world to add to its fleet. A charity run by a Ukrainian TV star openly boasts on its website about the number of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles it has provided the military:

""Drones, the eyes in the sky Strengthened Ukrainian army with 2984+ Drones,"" it reads.

Also mentioned are the captured/damaged enemy vehicles that have been repurposed:

""Repaired 2 T-72 tanks, 2 BMP-3, 1 APC, and BREM for the needs of Ukrainian defenders.""

The pursuit for even more drones is apparently endless; Ukraine's United24, the official crowd-funding arm of the country, has an initiative called the ""Army of Drones"" which seeks to by around 1,000 UAVs. Its fundraising achievements are posted proudly on the website.

""Total collected: $237,850,771 ... Current Balance: $36,724,286.""

The goal, according to the report, is 10,000 drones all across the front lines to broadcast the war ""without interruption.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tyler-texas-abandoned-baby-drunk,2022-12-02

What are the details?

In recorded remarks, Zelenskyy said that Western allies are not doing enough to help Ukraine stop Russian aggression amid the deadly invasion.

“This morning, we are defending our country alone,” Zelenskyy lamented. “Just like yesterday, the most powerful country in the world looked on from a distance. Russia was hit with sanctions yesterday, but these are not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil. Only through solidarity and determination can this be achieved.”

""Who is ready to fight with us?"" he asked. ""Honestly, I do not see such. Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO? ... Today we heard from Moscow that they still want to talk. They want to talk about Ukraine's neutral status. I tell all the partners of our state: Now is an important moment — the fate of our country is being decided. I ask them: Are you with us? They answer that they are with us. But they are not ready to take us to the Alliance.""

He continued, ""Today, I asked the twenty-seven leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer.""

In the video, Zelenskyy also added that he and the Ukrainian citizens appreciate the outpouring of support from Russian citizens who took to St. Petersburg to protest against the country's invasion.

""To all the citizens of the Russian Federation who went out to protest, I want to say: We see you,” he said. “This means you heard us. This means you are starting to believe us. Fight for us, fight against the war.”



Elsewhere in his remarks, Zelenskyy said that Russia's attacks on civilians will not be forgiven.

""The enemy strikes not only at military facilities, as it claims, but also at civilians. They kill people and turn peaceful cities into military targets. This is vile and will never be forgiven.

What else?

Biden on Thursday said that U.S. troops would not be sent to Ukraine, but would instead defend NATO member states that may be impacted by the aggression.

""Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine,"" Biden said in remarks on the ongoing invasion. ""Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies.""

""They have transitioned into a new stage of terror, in which they try to physically liquidate representatives of Ukraine’s lawful local authorities,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared in a video address Friday, according to the Associated Press.

Zelenskyy's comments come as Ukraine fights to repel Russian invaders who have been conducting a brutal campaign that has wreaked death and destruction.

The AP reported that the website for the prosecutor's office of the Luhansk People's Republic, a Russia-backed rebel area of Ukraine, indicates that there was a criminal case against the mayor. The outlet said that the office accused the man of ""terrorist activities.""

"Ukrainian GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz passionately condemns Putin's 'genocide,' calls on Biden to 'get his act together and exercise some leadership'","Indiana Republican lawmaker Victoria Spartz, who was born in Ukraine and emigrated to the United States, gave an impassioned plea for more action from the United States government to stop the ""genocide"" of the Ukrainian people at the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invading troops.

""This is not a war. This is a genocide of the Ukrainian people by a crazy man who cannot get over that Ukrainian people do not want socialism, Soviet Union, communism,"" Spartz said Tuesday at the House Republican leadership press conference. She wore the colors of Ukraine's flag to stand in solidarity with the people there, who have been attacked by Russia without provocation. ""They want to be with the United States of America. They want to be free people, they want to be with the West,"" she said.



Spartz shared a personal story about her Russian-born grandmother, who is 95 and is currently living in Chernihiv, a city in northern Ukraine. The city has been hit by heavy shelling from Russian artillery, and the most recent news is that Belarusian forces have crossed the border and joined the siege.

""They are bombing civilians non-stop, day and night. The whole city,"" Spartz said, becoming emotional as she related what she's heard from her grandmother, who spoke with another relative living in a small village outside Chernihiv.

""Her daughter told her [the Russians] came into [the] village with heavy machine guns [and] killed almost every person in that village. And whatever people were left, women and children, they forced them to walk in front of the tanks as a human shield because they cannot take that city,"" the congresswoman told reporters, fighting tears.



She shared words from her grandmother, who said: ""No, don't cry. We are not crying here. We're going to fight, but just give us some guns so we don't just fight with sticks.""

The lawmaker told other stories of how Russian troops are allegedly shooting women and children and committing war crimes, including using illegal thermobaric weapons. Reports indicate that Russia has used ""vacuum bombs,"" also known as fuel-air explosives, which use one explosive charge to spread fuel in a cloud that sucks up oxygen and flows around objects. A second charge then detonates the cloud, causing a massive explosion that is particularly destructive inside closed spaces like buildings or foxholes.

""They are leveling the cities to the ground! Destroying the people, slaughtering them like animals. They are killing people — it is not a war, it's a genocide because we have a crazy man that believes he has the whole world hostage,"" Spartz said, speaking with righteous indignation.

She criticized President Joe Biden for not doing enough to support Ukraine, emphasizing that America is not being asked to go fight, but the Ukraine is asking for more help with defense and for ""serious"" sanctions.

The United States, European Union, and other allied nations have imposed severe economic sanctions against Russian financial institutions and government personnel, including Putin himself. Western governments have also pledged to remove some Russian banks from SWIFT, a messaging service that connects financial institutions around the world, as punishment for Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

But Republicans have criticized Biden for not going further and sanctioning Russia's energy sector. While White House press secretary Jen Psaki told Fox News on Tuesday that energy sanctions are not ""off the table,"" she said the president is focused on ""minimizing the impact on the global markets and the American people.""

Economic sanctions on Russia's energy industry, while extremely punitive, would cause energy prices in countries that import oil from Russia to increase sharply, including in the U.S.

But for Spartz and others opposed to Russia's aggression, the sacrifice may be worth it to stop the war.



""I can tell you one thing. If we don't stop [Putin] there, he is not going to stop. He is going to go further. And then we'll have to send our children to die to fight this. So I think we have an obligation and duty to save this world, help Ukrainian people to survive,"" Spartz said.



""And this president needs to get his act together and exercise some leadership. What's happening under his watch is [an] atrocity. What he's doing to this country and to the world is unforgivable, but I think we'll get together as Republicans and Democrats, but act decisively fast or this blood of many millions of Ukrainans will be on his hands too,"" she warned.

'False flag': Ukrainian kindergarten hit by military shells as US officials warn Russian invasion is 'imminent',"A kindergarten was struck by artillery shells in a town on the Ukrainian government-controlled side of the front line in eastern Ukraine Thursday, wounding three adult civilians, the Ukrainian military said.

In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian Joint Forces Operation accused ""Russian occupation troops"" of shelling the town of Stanytsia in the Luhansk region, referring to Russian-backed separatist troops that have been causing violence in the area for eight years. The separatists in turn accused the Ukrainian government of opening fire on the territory four times over the past 24 hours, according to Reuters.



A spokesman for the Kremlin did not comment directly on Ukraine's allegation, but said there is ""an ongoing exchange of strikes"" near the border between Ukraine and Russia and that ""the first strike came from the Ukrainian side,"" the New York Times reported.



The breach of a tenuous cease-fire agreement in the region was received by western leaders as a possible ""false flag"" operation by Russia to create a pretext to launch an invasion of Ukraine.

U.K Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters Thursday, ""the picture is continuing to be very grim.""

""A kindergarten was shelled in what we are taking to be, what we know was a false flag operation designed to discredit the Ukrainians, designed to create a pre-text, a spurious provocation for Russian action,"" Johnson said.

""We fear very much that that is a thing we will see more of over the next few days,"" he added.

American officials have likewise warned that ""evidence on the ground"" suggests a Russian invasion of Ukraine is ""imminent.""

""We have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in,"" President Biden told reporters on Thursday. ""Every indication we have is they are prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine.""

Moscow has repeatedly denied having plans to invade Ukraine and earlier this week claimed that troops deployed along the border had completed military exercises there and were returning to base.

But the United States and NATO allies have said there was no evidence to support Russia's claims. Satellite images reported by Axios show a military pontoon bridge has been established over the Pripyat River in Belarus, less than four miles from the Ukraine border. Moscow has actually increased troop presence on the border ""by as many as 7,000 troops,"" according to a senior administration official.



U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the reports of the shelling were ""troubling.""

“We’ve said for some time that the Russians might do something like this in order to justify a military conflict. So we’ll be watching this very closely,” he said, speaking from Brussels.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba blamed Russia for a ""severe violation"" of the cease-fire agreement and President Volodymyr Zelensky called it a ""provocative shelling.""

Russia turned the accusations around and blamed Ukraine for a ""further escalation of tensions.""

“We have warned many times that excessive concentration of Ukrainian forces near the contact line, together with possible provocations, can pose terrible danger,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukraine-says-russia-kidnapped-mayor,2022-02-17
Ukrainian leadership says Russia has a 'multifaceted plan to destabilize' Ukraine,"Ukrainian officials believe that Russia is more likely to pursue a destabilization campaign than launch a large-scale invasion.

Oleksiy Danilov, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s top national security adviser, said, “The No. 1 task for Russia is to undermine us from the inside.”

The Wall Street Journal reports that in a recent interview, Danilov said that a military invasion would be too costly for Russia, given the size of Ukraine’s army and the Ukrainian people’s will to fight. He also said that the West constantly pressuring Russia will cause the Russian leadership to pursue alternative forms of warfare instead of a conventional invasion.

Danilov believes that the Russians will pursue a series of intense cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and will apply economic pressure to foment discontent among the Ukrainian public. He said, “It will be very difficult for them to achieve their aims by military means. I think, impossible. They have a multifaceted plan to destabilize the domestic situation on the territory of our country. That’s the number one task for them.”

Russian leadership continues to deny that it has any plans to invade or cause harm to Ukraine. They argued that Western countries are ignoring their security concerns by working to integrate Russia’s neighboring countries into NATO and the European Union.

As NATO and the European Union continue to grow their ranks, Russia grows increasingly frustrated. Russian leadership perceives these growing coalitions as an explicit threat to their country’s sovereignty.

In early February, Putin said, “We didn’t see an adequate response to our key concerns.”

In 2014, Russia invaded parts of Ukraine and, according to the Wall Street Journal, has “employed a variety of tactics to try and sap the country’s resources and will to fight.”

Russia’s destabilization efforts in Ukraine over the past years have had mixed results. The Kremlin is in communication with and supports Russian nationalist, Ukrainian separatists in the eastern regions of Ukraine. It uses these proxies to disrupt the daily operations of the Ukrainian military and cause chaos in the daily lives of the region’s inhabitants.

It is theorized that Russia is sponsoring the separatists so that the country has pretext to send its military further into Ukraine. This strategy is similar to Russia’s antagonism of Georgia prior to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.

Despite Ukrainian leadership’s skepticism about Russia’s intentions for outright war, Western nations are reducing their presence and encouraging citizens to leave Ukraine.

The U.S. State Department drastically reduced the American diplomatic presence in Ukraine and is working to funnel American citizens into Poland where they will be far away from any potential fighting.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-gop-rep-victoria-spartz-condemns-putin-calls-on-biden-for-leadership,2022-02-13
'Nothing has changed': Ukrainian official says Russia has not withdrawn troops from border after talks with Biden,"There has been no change in the Russian buildup of troops along its border with Ukraine since U.S. President Joe Biden's much-hyped video conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a Ukrainian security official said Wednesday.

According to Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's Security and Defence Council, there are still 92,000 Russian troops at the border, but there's no indication that Russia has imminent plans to invade.

Danilov told Reuters in an interview that the Ukrainian government is still concerned about the military build-up and that there has been no big change since the Dec. 7 meeting between the U.S. and Russia, when Biden threatened severe retaliatory economic sanctions should Putin choose to start a war.

""Nothing has changed,"" Danilov said. ""There has been some [increase in troop numbers] but not critical enough for us to say: this is it, it [an invasion] is going to happen now.""

He estimated that Russia would need at least 500,000-600,000 soldiers at the border ""in order to keep the situation under control in the event of an offensive.""

Danilov also said that Russia could deploy additional troops very quickly at any time, but would need more than 24 hours to bring those troops to the border to mount an invasion.

In the event of war, Ukraine hopes that its Western allies, including the United States, will keep it supplied with weapons, he said.

The world is watching Russia, which for months now has built up troops on its border with Ukraine in what the country says are ""military exercises."" News reports have shown Russian personnel and equipment including tanks, artillery, and armored troop carriers deployed to the Pogonovo training area and Yelnya in Russia and Novoozernoye in Crimea.

A U.S. intelligence report from earlier this month claimed that Moscow is planning a multi-front offensive against Ukraine that could begin as early as next year and involve as many as 175,000 soldiers.

Russia previously annexed the Crimea region from Ukraine in 2014, though Moscow now denies having any intention of invading or seizing more territory, accusing the U.S. and Ukraine of engaging in destabilizing behavior.



Putin has demanded that the U.S. guarantee that Ukraine will not be admitted to the NATO military alliance. He has also called on the U.S. and other Western countries to cease military activity near Russia's border. European Union leaders in turn have threatened more economic sanctions against Russia if it attempts military expansion into Ukraine.

The eastern region of Ukraine is mired in civil war, where pro-Russian separatists supported by Moscow are fighting the pro-western Ukrainian government. Danilov said the government has no intention of escalating the conflict by sending more troops to retake control of the region.

Danilov also said Ukraine must be a party to any discussion of its membership in NATO.

""We will not take orders from anyone, we will not tolerate any tsar, we are a different kind of people,"" he said.

""Is compromise possible? Yes, it is possible, but not at the expense of our independence and our country.""

Following their Dec. 7 video conference, Biden and Putin have agreed to hold more talks to discuss tensions with Ukraine and other issues. The Kremlin said there continue to be very serious differences between Russia and the United States over Moscow's ""red lines"" which it says the West must not cross.

Putin expressed interest in meeting with Biden in person, though the Russian government has not said when such a meeting could take place, Reuters reports.

UN diplomat allegedly gets away with raping woman in New York by claiming immunity,"On Sunday, 46-year-old Charles Dickens Imene Oliha, a diplomat for the United Nations' Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in South Sudan, is reported to have raped a woman in Fort George, New York. The victim called the police after the attack at 11 p.m., resulting in Oliha's detention. Oliha was, however, released just a few hours later.

The victim, Oliha's neighbor in upper Manhattan, claimed the diplomat had made a pass at her while she was walking a friend's dog. She rejected his advances, but he persisted. Oliha allegedly told the victim he was going to follow her upstairs to her apartment on Wadsworth Terrace, and she replied ""No, you're not.""

When the victim opened her door, Oliha reportedly forced his way into her apartment. Inside, he is claimed to have twice raped the victim.

The victim told authorities she had gone into shock after the noontime attack and tried to sleep after the attack. Only after a friend suggested that she should report the alleged rape did she contact police. Afterward, she was taken to Columbia University Medical Center for medical attention.

Upon his arrest, Oliha told the NYPD he had diplomatic immunity. Detectives from the Special Victims Unit released him without charge upon verifying his status around 5 a.m. on Monday morning.

Reporters attempted to contact Oliha for comment, but the only people present at his New York residence were reportedly his female relatives. Oliha is married and has four children.



The U.N. told the Daily Mail that this ""particular case involves a member of the Permanent Mission of South Sudan who is not a staff member of the United Nations. ... This is a bilateral issue between South Sudan and the US authorities.""

A spokesman for the U.S. State Department told Fox News: ""We take these allegations seriously, and we are working closely with the New York Police Department and the Mayor's Office of International Affairs, as we do in all legal and criminal cases involving foreign diplomats assigned to Permanent Missions and Observer Offices at the UN.""

South Sudan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation issued a release on August 23 indicating that, pending the conclusions of an ongoing investigation into the facts of the case, their administration ""will urgently take appropriate measures to address it.""

It is presently unclear whether Oliha has fled the country, in which case he may face extradition.

Oliha's country of origin faces a rape scandal all its own. The U.N. issued a report earlier this year revealing that women in South Sudan face a ""hellish existence."" A 2017 study found that across much of South Sudan, 65% of women and girls experience physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime — one of the highest rates in the world.



In addition to the role that rape allegedly plays as a tactic in the region's geopolitical conflicts, some scholarship suggests there is also a socio-cultural element at play. Alicia Luedke, writing for the London School of Economics' Conflict Research Programme, noted that sexual violence in South Sudan is ""connected to the local political economy of bridewealth in the country, which treats females as property, undermining their sexual agency and control over their own bodies.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-leadership-says-russia-has-a-multifaceted-plan-to-destabilize-ukraine,2022-08-23
"UN official calls out Elon Musk to help end starvation with $6B check. Musk responds, adds one stipulation.","Elon Musk, the world's richest man whose net worth is close to $300 billion, said Sunday that he would cut a check to help end world hunger.



Musk, however, placed a stipulation on his offer that will probably not be well received by the organization that called him out.



What is the background?

Last week, David Beasley, the director of the United Nations' World Food Programme, told CNN that a $6 billion donation from the world's top billionaires — like Musk or Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — could immediately save 42 million people from starvation.

""The governments are tapped out. This is why and this is when the billionaires need to step up now on a one-time basis: Six billion dollars to help 42 million people that are literally going to die if we don't reach them,"" Beasley said.

""It's not complicated. I'm not asking them to do this every day, every week, every year,"" Beasley continued. ""Just help me with them, one time. That's a $6 billion price tag.""

Beasley noted that Bezos and Musk made far more than $6 billion since the pandemic began last year and said Musk's net worth recently increased by $6 billion in a single day.

""The top 400 billionaires in the United States, the net worth increase was $1.8 trillion in the past year,"" Beasley said. ""All I'm asking for is .36% of your net worth increase. I'm for people making money, but God knows I'm all for you helping people who are in great need right now. The world is in trouble.""



""Wake up, smell the coffee, and help!"" Beasley pleaded.

What did Musk say?

In response, Musk said he would liquidate $6 billion worth of Tesla stock to finance Beasley's request. However, Musk added that the U.N. would need to prove that every penny donated went toward feeding people.

""If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it,"" Musk said. ""But it must be open source accounting, so the public sees precisely how the money is spent.""

In response, Beasley said his comments were mischaracterized. In fact, $6 billion would not solve world hunger, he said.

""Headline not accurate,"" Beasley responded. ""$6B will not solve world hunger, but it WILL prevent geopolitical instability, mass migration and save 42 million people on the brink of starvation. An unprecedented crisis and a perfect storm due to Covid/conflict/climate crises.""

Musk responded by reaffirming his commitment to transparency.

""Please publish your current & proposed spending in detail so people can see exactly where money goes,"" Musk said. ""Sunlight is a wonderful thing.""

UN experts say the world will face a global famine of ‘biblical proportions’ due to COVID-19 pandemic,"The United Nations warns that the COVID-19 pandemic is on the cusp of causing global famines of ""biblical proportions.""

What are the details?

According to CNN, the famines will affect the world in a matter of months and will likely push an already coronavirus-struck population of 130 million people to the brink of starvation.

In a Tuesday address, David Beasley — the executive director of the World Food Programme — told the UN Security Council during a video conference that widespread famines could affect ""about three dozen countries"" in the coming months.

CNN reported that Beasley — a former Republican South Carolina governor — cited ""conflict, an economic recession, a decline in aid, and a collapse in oil prices"" as factors that could lead to massive food shortages.

""While dealing with a COVID-19 pandemic, we are also on the brink of a hunger pandemic,"" Beasley said. ""There is also a real danger that more people could potentially die from the economic impact of COVID-19 than from the virus itself.""

A report from the agency identified at least 55 countries around the world that are at elevated risk of famine due to the virus.

A portion of the report read, ""These countries may face an excruciating trade-off between saving lives or livelihoods, or, in a worst-case scenario, saving people from the coronavirus to have them die from hunger.""

What countries will most likely be impacted?

Those countries include:

Afghanistan

Democratic Republic of the Congo

Ethiopia

Haiti

Nigeria

South Sudan

Sudan

Syria

Venezuela

Yemen

CNN reported that while those countries have been mostly spared from the devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic when compared to places like China, Italy, and North America, the countries' food supply was previously being impacted by locust swarms and crop failure.

""Exceptional drought followed by extremely heavy rainfall markedly decreased the seasonal crop yield in the Horn of Africa during 2019,"" the outlet added. ""These irregular weather and climate patterns also contributed to the worst desert locust invasion in 25 years, which further threatened the crop supply in the region.""

Beasley added that other measures — such as lockdowns and recessions — will also lead to a ""major loss of income among the working poor"" around the world.

""The loss of tourism receipts will damage countries such as Ethiopia [and] the collapsing oil prices in lower-income countries like South Sudan will have an impact significantly,"" he pointed out.

""There are no famines yet. But I must warn you that if we don't prepare and act now — to secure access, avoid funding shortfalls, and disruptions to trade — we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a few short months,"" he added.

""The truth is,"" he concluded, ""we do not have time on our side, so let's act wisely — and let's act fast. I do believe that with our expertise and partnerships, we can bring together the terms and the programs necessary to make certain the COVID-19 pandemic does not become a humanitarian and food crisis catastrophe.""

Anything else?

Beasley told the Guardian that famine is more than just hunger.

""We are not talking about people going to bed hungry,"" he said. ""We are talking about extreme conditions, emergency status – people literally marching to the brink of starvation. If we don't get food to people, people will die.""

He added, ""This is truly more than just a pandemic — it is creating a hunger pandemic. This is a humanitarian and food catastrophe.""

UN tells staff to avoid using terms 'war' and 'invasion' to describe Putin's war in Ukraine,"The words ""war"" and ""invasion"" are apparently too politically incorrect for the United Nations, which has instructed staff to avoid using those terms in reference to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Instead, the U.N. communications department would like staff to use terms such as ""conflict"" or ""military offensive"" to describe the nearly universally condemned war of aggression waged by Russian President Vladimir Putin against his country's smaller neighbor. Employees were also asked to refrain from describing the conflict as a war and from adding the Ukrainian flag to their personal or official social media accounts or websites.

“[USE] ‘conflict’ or ‘military offensive’ and NOT ‘war’ or ‘invasion’ when referring to the situation in Ukraine,” an email reported by the Irish Times stated. “Do NOT add the Ukrainian flag to personal or official social media accounts or websites.""



The instructions were given to avoid harming the international body's reputation by offending Russia, which has killed hundreds of Ukrainian civilians and forced 2 million people to flee the country.

“This is an important reminder that we, as international civil servants, have a responsibility to be impartial,” the email stated. “There is a serious possibility of reputational risk that has been flagged by senior officials recently.”

Teachta Dala Neale Richmond, spokesman on European affairs for Ireland's Fine Gael party, blasted the ""illegal war of aggression"" and called on the U.N. to condemn Russia in a statement to the Irish Times.

“The fact is just because Russia is a big country that has an essential role in the UN, they’re influencing policy in a direction that’s simply false,” he said, referring to how Russia holds one of five permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council.

""Quite clearly this is not just any war, but an illegal war of aggression, that should be condemned from a height by all members of the U.N. and the U.N. itself,"" he added.

Russian officials refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation,"" using Putin's preferred euphemism for the war. Putin's government has severely restricted what Russian media outlets are allowed to report about the war with a new law enacted Friday that could put journalists in prison for up to 15 years if they publish any stories the government considers ""fake.""

Thousands of Russian anti-war protesters have also been arrested, two local independent broadcasters were closed down, and international media websites have been blocked in the country.

Unanimous Supreme Court ruling: Illegal immigrants with temporary status can’t pursue permanent residency,"The Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Monday that immigrants permitted to stay in the country temporarily are ineligible to pursue ""green cards"" for permanent residency if they entered the country illegally.

The ruling in Sanchez v. Mayorkas, authored by Justice Elena Kagan, could affect tens of thousands of immigrants currently living in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status, the Associated Press reported.

The case was brought by Jose Sanchez and Sonia Gonzalez, a married couple from of El Salvador who entered the United States illegally in the late 1990s. Later, in 2001, the two were granted Temporary Protected Status in the U.S. after El Salvador was rocked by devastating earthquakes.

TPS is a status granted to foreign nationals from certain designated countries ravaged by armed conflict or natural disaster that allows them to live and work in the U.S. without being subject to deportation.

Then in 2014, Sanchez and Gonzalez applied for ""green cards,"" or lawful permanent resident status, but were denied, and subsequently sued.

The Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, however, ruled against them, arguing that they were ineligible under federal immigration law, which requires applicants to have been ""inspected and admitted"" into the U.S, the New York Times reported.

In Monday's unanimous ruling, the nation's top court agreed with that decision.

""The question here is whether the conferral of TPS enables him to obtain LPR status despite his unlawful entry. We hold that it does not,"" wrote Kagan.

Kagan held that two parts of the immigration laws operate on separate tracks — one track allows some immigrants who entered the country legally to apply for green cards, and the other track allows immigrants, whether they entered legally or not, to pursue TPS.

Though the two tracks can sometimes merge, she noted, individuals who enter the country illegally do not become eligible for green cards because of their temporary status.

""Lawful status and admission, as the court below recognized are distinct concepts in immigration law: Establishing one does not necessarily establish the other,"" she wrote.

""The TPS program gives foreign nationals nonimmigrant status, but it does not admit them. So the conferral of TPS does not make an unlawful entrant ... eligible [for a green card],"" she added.

There are an estimated 400,000 people with TPS in the country currently, and 85,000 of them have managed to adjust status, CNN reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/un-experts-say-the-world-will-face-a-global-famine-of-biblical-proportions-due-to-covid-19-pandemic,2021-06-07
VIDEO: University of Minnesota student telling peers to make life hell for police,"A member of the University of Minnesota's student government was caught on video imploring her peers to make the lives of police officers ""hell"" by placing bogus calls for help.

Lauren Meyers is the chief financial officer of the Minnesota Student Association and the co-chair of the Office for Student Affairs Mental Health committee. During a video conference with fellow members of the MSA, Meyers instructed her fellow student government members to use several tactics to ""annoy the s*** out of"" campus law enforcement.

During the video call, another student asked Meyers, ""When you say disrupt UMPD, what exactly do you mean by that?""

Meyers replied, ""Make their lives hell. Annoy the s*** out of them. Like, use up their resources, make their officers show up to something.""

The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association and Law Enforcement Labor Services issued a joint statement on Tuesday, where the police unions called for an investigation into the situation and warned that making phony 911 calls can be a felony.



""Minnesota law prohibits using emergency calls to report a false emergency or crime, and claims that lead to serious injury or death is a felony publishable by 10 years imprisonment and/or a maximum fine of $20,000,"" the letter reads.

Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association Executive Director Brian Peters added, ""Actively planning to thwart UMPD by generating false calls for help is insulting to the overwhelming majority of the campus community that rely on public safety services.""

""Last month the campus community had 13 incidents of aggravated assault, 52 burglaries, 22 car thefts, 4 sexual assaults, numerous thefts, and a murder on or near campus,"" Peters continued. ""We're frustrated that elected student leaders would purposefully choose to stir further division to make the campus less safe.""

Law Enforcement Labor Services Executive Director Jim Mortenson said, ""Everyone deserves to be safe, and advocating to impede police from assisting victims of crime is mindboggling.""

The police unions called for an outside agency to ""conduct a criminal investigation into this incident to determine if charges are warranted.""

Meyers' comments were reportedly made while MSA members were discussing a recent letter the student government sent to University of Minnesota president Joan Gabel. The letter demands the resignation of University of Minnesota Police Department Chief Matt Clark.

The letter alleges that Clark has failed to increase ""campus safety and wellness"" for students of color and allowed the ""utilization of UMPD as a physical arm of the oppressive state to subjugate and silence community members.""



In the letter, the Minnesota Student Association threatens ""direct actions"" if ""our demands are not met.""

Two members of the University of Minnesota's student government denounced Meyers' comments, according to Alpha News.

""We are two members of the Minnesota Student Association (MSA) Executive Board and we wholeheartedly denounce the comments that were made during the April 14, 2021 Executive Board meeting regarding police interference on campus,"" students Andrew Knuppel and Morgan McElroy said. ""We call upon our fellow student leaders who have stayed silent over the last 72 hours to denounce the comments made in the clip that's been widely circulating in the media.""

""To achieve any progress on critical campus issues such as police reform and campus safety, elected student leaders should strive to engage with administrators and campus law enforcement collaboratively,"" the MSA members added. ""The public comments made by our colleague, unintended or otherwise, have cast a dark shadow on what should be a constructive dialogue among elected student government leaders, the student body, administration, and other stakeholders.""

""The University respects the autonomy of the Minnesota Student Association as an independent governance organization for undergraduate students, including the autonomy of its membership to speak freely,"" a school spokesperson told Alpha News. ""However, in this instance, the University unequivocally disagrees with the ideas expressed about disrupting UMPD's daily work. These ideas are illegal and would directly conflict with ongoing efforts to keep our campus community safe.""

UPS to pay $4.9 million in religious discrimination settlement with the feds over beard and haircut policies,"The United Parcel Service has reached a settlement agreement with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission following a three-year court battle over the company's policies on beards and hair length for male employees.

UPS admitted no wrongdoing, but agreed to pay $4.9 million to end the government's lawsuit accusing the delivery service of violating the Civil Rights Act by discriminating against individuals who have facial hair below the lip or long hair for religious reasons.

What are the details?

In the lawsuit filed in 2015, the EEOC alleged that the UPS uniform policy — which requires male employees in contact with customers to keep their hair shorter than collar-length and prohibits beards — violates the rights of individuals whose religious practices conflict with the company's grooming standards.

Business Insider cited several instances outlined in the government's case. A Native American man who applied for a job with UPS in 2007 said he was told he would have to cut his long hair in order to be employed at the company. The original complaints filed with the EEOC came from two men who wear beards in accordance with their Muslim faith; one was an applicant, and another worked for UPS in Dallas.

As part of the settlement agreement, UPS agreed to pay $4.9 million in damages to applicants, current employees, and former employees affected by the policy. The company also agreed to publicize the right to religious accommodation on its websites, provide training to managers and supervisors, and provide the EEOC with periodic reports on its requests for religious accommodations, according to Law.com.

The EEOC's lead attorney for the case, Elizabeth Fox-Solomon, said in a statement hailing the settlement:

UPS's strict appearance policy has operated to exclude Muslims, Sikhs, Rastafarians, and other religious groups from equal participation and advancement in the workforce for many years. We appreciate UPS's willingness to make real changes to its religious accommodation process to ensure equal opportunity for people of all backgrounds.

How did UPS respond?

UPS defended its practices in its own statement:

(The company) is proud of the diversity of its workforce and does not tolerate discrimination of any kind. While UPS disagrees with assertions made by the EEOC, the company resolved this lawsuit because we choose to focus our energy on our hiring and promotion process, rather than lengthy and costly court proceedings.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/unanimous-supreme-court-rules-against-temporary-illegals,2018-12-27
"UPS employee who reportedly threatened mass murder arrested.

The Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety began investigating 32-year-old Thomas Andrews on Sunday after getting a report that Andrews sent texts to his boss expressing an intent to commit a mass shooting. Police began searching for him after finding that he had five guns registered.

Late Sunday night, officers found Andrews driving, but he fled. Police were able to apprehend him, with assistance from California Highway Patrol.

Upon searching Andrews' home, police said they found 20,000 rounds of ammunition, five rifles, a shotgun, three handguns, and body armor. Andrews had packed up several bags of ammo and placed them near his door, authorities said.

Sunnyvale Police Capt. Dan Pistor said Andrews was upset at his employer, according to KNTV-TV, but he did not elaborate on what the specific conflict was.



""He alluded to a mass shooting in his text messages,"" Pistor said, according to USA Today. ""I definitely think we avoided a tragedy.""

US ambassador to Germany calls out European governments over Iran response,"U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell is not impressed with European governments' reactions to violence coordinated by Iran, and says Western countries need to make it clear that they stand united against Tehran and its attacks.

What are the details?

""When the West stands together and the West says very clearly that terrorism is wrong and terrorism should not be used, then that message is heard by the Iranians and they see a collective force of the West,"" Ambassador Grenell told Der Podcast on Monday, according to Politico.

He added, ""We have seen the Iranians escalate over the last several months. And there has been no, or I should say little response from the European governments.""

Following the United States' targeted killing of top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani last week, America's European allies called for de-escalation, The Washington Post reported.

In response to that, Grenell said, ""If you want to de-escalate, and you think that it's really important to de-escalate, I would say then you must condemn all the way up the ladder of escalation, and that was not done.""

The U.S. Embassy in Germany noted on its Twitter account the day after Soleimani's death, ""The Council of the European Union just two months ago reaffirmed its sanctions against Qasem #Soleimani for his involvement in terrorist acts.""



The Jerusalem Post reported that during a separate interview with German publication Bild on Monday, Grenell said Soleimani was a ""cheerleader of the genocide in Syria.""

Anything else?

NATO met Monday afternoon to discuss Iran and Iraq, and Reuters reported that ""all members of the Atlantic alliance stood behind the United States in the Middle East after it briefed NATO on its drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani.""

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters afterward, ""We are united in condemning Iran's support of a variety of different terrorist groups. At the meeting today, allies called for restraint and de-escalation. A new conflict would be in no one's interest. So Iran must refrain from further violence and provocations.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ups-discrimination-settlement,2020-01-06
US Marine killed in Ukraine fighting Russian invasion,"U.S. citizen Willy Joseph Cancel was killed in Ukraine on Monday while fighting alongside Ukrainian troops against invading Russian forces, family members confirm. ""He appears to be the first U.S. citizen to die while fighting alongside Ukrainians in Ukraine,"" Fox News reported.

Cancel – a 22-year-old former U.S. Marine – leaves behind a wife and a 7-month-old baby.

""He went there wanting to help people, he had always felt that that was his main mission in life,"" Brittany Cancel – the widow of the American citizen who died in Ukraine – told Fox News.

""My husband was very brave and a hero,"" Cancel stated. ""I did not expect to be a widow at 23 years old or for our son to be without a father.""

Cancel's mother – Rebecca Cabrera – told CNN, ""He wanted to go over because he believed in what Ukraine was fighting for, and he wanted to be a part of it to contain it there so it didn't come here, and that maybe our American soldiers wouldn't have to be involved in it.""

""It was something that he believed in his heart, that was the right thing,"" Cabrera added. ""He was the type of man who always stepped up when everybody else stepped back, and there were a lot of men who were like that that were with him.""

Devin Tietze Jr. – Cancel's brother-in-law – told CNN, ""He believed wholeheartedly this shouldn't have happened and he wanted to go help the people in Ukraine.""

Cancel was a correctional officer before going to Ukraine to help fight against the Russian invasion.

""Prior to wanting to help the effort in Ukraine, he was a detention officer in Kentucky,"" the widow told Fox News. ""He had dreams and aspirations of being a police officer or joining FDNY. Naturally, when he found out about what was happening in Ukraine he was eager to volunteer.""

Cancel was hired by a private military contracting company to fight against Russians in Ukraine.

Cancel flew to Poland on March 12 and arrived in Ukraine the next day, according to Cabrera. His mother said Cancel was fighting alongside soldiers from ""all different countries.""



Cabrera said, ""They haven't found his body. They are trying, the men that were with him, but it was either grab his body or get killed, but we would love for him to come back to us.""

Cancel's widow pleaded, ""All I want is for him to come home, and to give him the proper burial he deserves.""



How Cancel was killed in Ukraine is not clear at this time.

An official with the U.S. Department of State told NBC News on Friday that officials ""are aware of these reports and are closely monitoring the situation.""



""Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment,"" the official said. ""We once again reiterate U.S. citizens should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict and the singling out of U.S. citizens in Ukraine by Russian government security officials, and that U.S. citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately if it is safe to do so, using any commercial or other privately available ground transportation options.""

Cabrera said of her son, ""He was just a really thoughtful person. He always put everybody ahead of himself even when situations were so stressful. He always kept everybody laughing and calm. He was the man that stood up when everybody else stood back.""

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry created a special unit consisting of foreign fighters known as the ""International Legion."" Brig. Gen.

"US military bracing for Iranian attack as anniversary of Soleimani's death approaches, officials say","The United States military suspects that an Iranian-linked attack on American personnel and interests in Iraq could be immanent as the one-year anniversary of Iranian terrorist leader Qassem Soleimani's death approaches.

On Jan. 2, 2020, the U.S. launched a drone strike on an envoy near the Baghdad airport that killed the renowned Iranian military leader along with Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

What are the details?

Defense officials reportedly expressed their suspicions of a retaliatory attack on Wednesday as two B-52 bombers finished a round-trip, 30-hour mission from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to the Middle East. The mission was part of an effort to demonstrate American military might in the region and deter any action by Iran.

""The United States continues to deploy combat-ready capabilities into the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility to deter any potential adversary, and make clear that we are ready and able to respond to any aggression directed at Americans or our interests,"" said Gen. Kenneth ""Frank"" McKenzie, chief of U.S. Central Command, according to the Washington Post.

""We do not seek conflict, but no one should underestimate our ability to defend our forces or to act decisively in response to any attack,"" he added.

Another defense official speaking anonymously told the Post that ""the threat streams are very real"" and that a ""fair amount of advanced conventional weaponry"" has flowed over the border from Iran into Iraq in recent weeks.

Last week, McKenzie similarly indicated to ABC News that U.S. forces remained ""in a period of heightened risk,"" but emphasized that the military is ""not looking for war with Iran.""

Those comments came as the U.S. Navy acknowledged that it sent a submarine into the Persian Gulf, ""a move widely seen as sending a message to Iran,"" the outlet reported.

What else?

Soleimani's death was a major blow to the terror-sponsoring Iranian regime as he was the leader of the elite Quds Force, a special wing of the Revolutionary Guard Corps. For years, he had coordinated attacks on U.S. forces and assets in the Middle East.

Given how high profile a leader he was, a retaliatory attack near the anniversary of his death is certainly a possibility, especially as tensions rise in the region.

Last week, unknown attackers launched more than 20 rockets on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, killing at least one Iraqi civilian, though no Americans were hurt. Iran denied any involvement, but the Post reported that U.S. officials believe the attack was carried out by militias coordinating with the regime.

US Soccer star Megan Rapinoe named Sports Illustrated 'Sportsperson of the Year',"Sports Illustrated named U.S. Soccer star Megan Rapinoe as 2019 Sportsperson of the Year after a year in which she led the U.S. Women's National Team to a World Cup victory, and also engaged in a public conflict with President Donald Trump.

""Megan Rapinoe is Sportsperson of the Year, though, not because of her newfound fame but because of how she's handled it,"" the cover story said.

Rapinoe scored six goals during a dominant World Cup run, but the team perhaps gained more scrutiny for a comment made by Rapinoe during an interview, when she said ""I'm not going to the f***ing White House"" if the team won.

Rapinoe and her teammates were busing to their training grounds in the western outskirts of Paris on June 26, in advance of a quarterfinal against France, when Donald Trump fired his Twitter salvo. A video, recorded earlier in the year, was making the rounds; in it Rapinoe declared, ""I'm not going to the f------ White House"" if the U.S. wins. And now POTUS was tweeting: "". . . Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job!"" Midfielder Allie Long saw this and leaned forward in her seat, toward Rapinoe in front of her. ""Pookie,"" she said, ""you a G.""

US and South Korean forces launch missiles into the sea in retaliation to North Korea's aggression,"On Monday, the U.S. and South Korean militaries launched eight ballistic missiles into the sea in a retaliatory show of force that matched a similar display conducted by North Korea just the day before.

The Associated Press reported that U.S. and South Korean forces were conducting a live-fire exercise that involved eight Army Tactical Missile System missiles. The American military provided one missile and the South Korean military provided the other seven.

The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff and U.S. Forces Korea confirmed that the missiles were fired into South Korea’s eastern waters over a span of ten minutes following notifications of air and maritime safety.

The retaliatory missile launches were intended to demonstrate the ability of South Korean and U.S forces to swiftly and lethally respond to aggression from North Korea.

On Sunday, the South Korean military detected eight short-range missiles originating from North Korea. They were launched over a 35-minute span from at least four different locations including western and eastern coastal areas and two inland areas north of and near the North Korean capital city of Pyongyang.

These missile launches are North Korea’s latest provocation of the international community and marks the 18th round of missile tests conducted by the reclusive communist nation so far inn 2022. This round of missile tests from the North came just one day after the South Korean military conducted a naval drill in the Philippine Sea alongside the U.S. aircraft carried Ronald Reagan.

It is believed that Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s supreme leader, is renewing his efforts to develop nuclear weapons.

Yoon Suk Yeol, the newly elected president of South Korea, recently made a speech during the country’s Memorial Day celebrations that his government would pursue “fundamental and practical security capabilities” to counter North Korea’s growing aggression.

Yoon, a conservative who took office in May, has vowed to strengthen the South’s defense through collaborating with the U.S. as a strategic ally.

At the National Cemetery in Seoul, Yoon said, “North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs have grown to a point where they are not only a threat to the Korean Peninsula, but to Northeast Asia and world peace.”

Yoon said that his government would “sternly respond to any kind of North Korean provocation.”

Yoon’s approach to dealing with North Korea breaks with that of his predecessor who emphasized amicable dialogue with the North.

Yoon said, “Just to escape temporarily North Korean provocation or conflict is not something that we should do. This kind of approach over the past five years has proven to be a failure.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-soccer-star-megan-rapinoe-named-sports-illustrated-sportsperson-of-the-year,2022-06-06
USPS pauses operational changes until after election to avoid appearance of tampering,"The United States Postal Service will pause operational changes that have drawn public scrutiny in recent weeks in order to avoid the appearance that they're attempting to influence the election, CNBC reported.

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy announced the pause in a statement Tuesday, in which he emphasized that many of the changes that have caused alarm have been planned even before he took over.

""I came to the Postal Service to make changes to secure the success of this organization and its long-term sustainability,"" DeJoy said in the statement. ""I believe significant reforms are essential to that objective, and work toward those reforms will commence after the election. In the meantime, there are some longstanding operational initiatives — efforts that predate my arrival at the Postal Service — that have been raised as areas of concern as the nation prepares to hold an election in the midst of a devastating pandemic. To avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail, I am suspending these initiatives until after the election is concluded.""

DeJoy went on to ensure that post office hours would stay the same, processing equipment and mailboxes would not be moved or removed, and overtime for employees would continue to be paid to help ensure timely delivery.

DeJoy will testify before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Friday and the Democrat-led House Oversight Committee on Monday. But Democrats are still suspicious of DeJoy, who is a Trump donor, despite his statement.

""This is a start. But we still need to reverse all the damage, fully fund @USPS, & investigate DeJoy's conflicts,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wrote on Twitter. ""And we need to keep our eyes on DeJoy so he keeps his promise & doesn't find new ways to dismantle the USPS. I'll be watching DeJoy's actions — not just his words.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Sunday she would call the House back in session from recess early to block USPS changes by DeJoy.

Democrats are seeing tens of billions of dollars in a proposed COVID-19 relief bill for the USPS to bail out the struggling organization and to help with an anticipated increase in mail-in voting this November. President Donald Trump opposes the funding, and has specifically cited his opposition to mail-in voting as a reason.

In July, the USPS warned states that it could not guarantee on-time delivery of mailed ballots based on current deadlines, but those letters were reportedly planned before DeJoy became postmaster general.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-troops-targeted-by-car-bomber-in-syria-second-attack-in-less-than-a-week,2020-08-18
"Utah doctor charged for allegedly destroying mRNA vaccines, giving out fake vaccine cards and shots to kids at parents' request","A Utah doctor has been accused of doling out nearly 2,000 fake COVID vaccination cards and dumping actual mRNA shots, thereby defrauding the U.S. government.

KTVX reported that Dr. Michael Kirk Moore Jr. of Salt Lake City, his neighbor Kristin Jackson Andersen, and two others have been charged with conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government; conspiracy to convert, sell, convey, and dispose of government property; and conversion sale, conveyance, and disposal of government property as well as aiding and abetting.

Court documents indicate that the accused were both members of a group seeking to ""'liberate' the medical profession from government and industry conflicts of interest.""

Moore was indicted on Jan. 11 by a federal grand jury in Salt Lake City.

What are the details?

Moore, 58, is a plastic surgeon at the Plastic Surgery Institute of Utah Inc. in Midvale, where he worked with office manager Kari Dee Burgoyne and receptionist Sandra Flores, both similarly charged.



According to the federal criminal complaint, Moore and his compatriots destroyed hundreds of doses of government-provided COVID-19 vaccines.

Moore allegedly signed a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement in order to secure COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination record cards and ordered hundreds of doses of vaccines from the CDC.

Instead of peddling the government vaccines, Moore allegedly began giving out fraudulent vaccination record cards in exchange for direct cash payments or direct donations of $50. The approximate value of these cards was $96,850.

Between May 2021 and September 2022, the defendants allegedly also administered harmless ""saline shots to minor children to trick them into thinking they had received a vaccine"" at the request of their parents.

The charging documents indicate that Moore had managed to ""falsely reflect that the Fraudulent Vax Card Seekers had received at least 1937 doses of bona fide COVID-19 vaccines, when, in fact, they had received none.""

As for the real vaccines (i.e., Janssen, Moderna, Pfizer, and Pfizer Pediatric), the defendants allegedly destroyed $28,028 worth by drawing them from the bottles sent by the government and ""squirting them down the drain"" via a syringe.

The scheme reportedly worked on a referral basis.

Those seeking the cards were prompted to provide Andersen with the name of a previous customer. After this preliminary screening process, the so-called ""Fraudulent Vax Card Seeker"" allegedly was directed to a website to make the $50 donation.

The scheme appeared to be going well until an undercover agent managed to get a referral in March 2022. Then, in June, Moore's clinic gave a second undercover agent a fake vaccine record card.



The second undercover agent had Flores confirm that the defendants gave fake vaccinations to kids.

""By allegedly falsifying vaccine cards and administering saline shots to children instead of COVID-19 vaccines, not only did this provider endanger the health and well-being of a vulnerable population but also undermined public trust and the integrity of federal health care programs,"" said Curt L. Muller, special agent in charge with the Department of Health and Human Services, office of the inspector general.

Moore and the other defendants may be on the hook to the government for at least $124,878.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was attracting negative attention for her ""Tax the Rich"" gown inside the Met Gala earlier this week, Black Lives Matter protesters drew some attention of their own as they demonstrated against police outside the lavish New York City event, Fox News reported.

Protesters chanted the name of Mike Rosado — a Bronx man who died last month in a shootout with police, the cable network noted — and a megaphone-toting officer told the protesters they were being arrested for disorderly conduct.

Some major scuffles broke out, with officers restraining a protester while the crowd told cops to ""let go of her!"" Fox News said.

Protester calls cop the N-word

But one of the more eye-catching and ear-catching moments occurred when at least two of the protesters called a black cop the N-word, after which the officer had to be restrained by his colleagues and was led away from the conflict.

The clip begins with a protester yelling ""don't let that [N-word] f***in' walk away!"" in reference to the black officer; the protester also accused the cop of putting his ""hands on people.""

Another protester can be heard yelling ""you done [N-word], you done!""

As the protesters appeared to get closer to the officer in question, the cop began to approach the protesters — and then was quickly pulled away by at least three of his colleagues.

VIDEO: Costco employee tells off customer refusing to wear mask,"A Costco employee is getting a landslide of praise from Twitter users after he was caught on video telling off a customer who refused to wear a mask in the store.

What went down?

After the customer threatens to post cellphone video of the confrontation on Instagram, the employee — whose badge identifies him as ""Tison"" — welcomes the conflict and reads him the riot act.

""Hi everyone!"" Tison says, waving at the camera. ""I work for Costco, and I'm asking this member to put on a mask because that is our company policy.""

The customer then turns the camera to his mask-free face and says, ""And I'm not doing it 'cause I woke up in a free country.""

Image source: Twitter video screenshot

With that Tison takes the customer's cart away: ""Sir, have a great day. You are no longer welcome here in our warehouse. You need to leave. Thank you very much.""

The customer finishes the clip by calling Tison a ""pu**y little b***h"" and saying, ""There he is walking away with all my stuff. There he goes. 'Cuz I'm not a f***in' sheep.""

The clip went viral after journalist Elon James White shared it Tuesday, Newsweek said.

The clip James posted has been getting a ton of attention, and it appears comments are decidedly in favor of the Costco employee.

Outspoken far-left U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) commented that Costco ""has the right to require that customers wear a mask. Businesses have the right to prevent people from spewing saliva droplets in their stores. Because we live in a free country. And because there's a frickin' life-threatening virus that's spread through saliva droplets.""

Who is that masked man?

Tison revealed himself on Twitter in the aftermath, basking in the adoration:

The floodgates open

After Tison's post revealing his maskless face, he seemingly became an instant celebrity on Twitter.

""Thank you Tison & #costco! You won the 'who's balls are bigger' contest by a landslide,"" one user wrote. ""You also potentially saved my life or anybody else's in there. We appreciate you. @Costco give this man a raise! And give the free country plump 'man' a big wet cough.""

""You were BADA$ in how you handled the giant dou*hebag,"" another user wrote. ""You never lost your cool while stating Costco's position. Thank you for protecting Costco guests and your co-workers with class & sass.""

""You are a freaking rock star!"" another user wrote. ""Keep up the great work!""

""Fabulous and professional! You handled that man like a badass!"" another user said. ""Love #Costco!""

Vanquished customer responds

The man whose shopping cart taken created a video response to the Costco altercation, which Mediaite said was deleted from Reddit — but the clip lived on elsewhere.

LIVE VIDEO: Day 3 for President Trump's defense team to take down impeachment charges as Bolton's claims loom large,"President Donald Trump's defense team will wrap up its opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trial Tuesday, beginning at 1 p.m. ET. You can watch a live feed of the proceedings below once it begins.

So far, the president's team has been seen as effectively countering the House impeachment managers' case.

On Day 1 of the defense's presentation, the team launched into its ""six key facts"" about the Democrats' impeachment case that, they say, absolve Trump of wrongdoing. The team also accused lead House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) of concealing the ""potentially exculpatory"" testimony of a major witness. The team's defense was seen by at least one senator as a ""kneecapping"" of Schiff.

The Hill reported that, following Saturday's presentation, at least two Democrats have indicated that they could vote for Trump's acquittal.

The defense continued its statement Monday, with one of the most notable portions being Trump team member and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's takedown of Hunter Biden's alleged shady business dealings in Ukraine. As TheBlaze noted:

""When the House managers gave you their presentation, when they submitted their brief, they repeatedly referenced Hunter Biden and Burisma,"" Bondi began, adding that ""they referenced Biden or Burisma over 400 times"" during opening arguments ""and when they gave these presentations, they said there was nothing, nothing to see.""



Bondi went on to say that Democrats' ""case crumbles because they have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no basis to raise this concern, but that's not what public records show.""



In addition to giving a detailed timeline of Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma during his father's time in office, as well as the political events in Ukraine at the time, Bondi pointed out how even witnesses called by House Democrats during the impeachment investigation saw potential problems with the matter.



""In fact, every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Bondi said. ""Multiple House Democrat witnesses, including those from the Department of State, the National Security Council, and other unanimously testified there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest. These were their witnesses.""

Even more newsworthy than the defense's presentation has been the ongoing debate over the calling of witnesses. Later this week, after the defense wraps up its opening statements and the Senate uses its 16 hours of questions for both sides, senators will likely vote on whether do subpoena further evidence and/or call witnesses.

On Sunday, portions of former national security adviser John Bolton's book manuscript leaked to the media. In it, Bolton claims that the president wanted to continue freezing aid to Ukraine until the Ukrainian government investigated the family of former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden.

Now senators on both sides of the aisle are discussing the increasing likelihood that Bolton and other witnesses could be called. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said Monday that Bolton's book makes it ""increasingly likely"" that GOP senators will actually vote in favor of calling witnesses.

Other Republican senators have, of course, dismissed Bolton's revelations. And GOP Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.) warned Republican senators that there would be ""political repercussions"" if they voted to call witnesses.

Reports Tuesday revealed that Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) is working on a compromise that would offer a Democrats a ""one-for-one"" deal that would allow each side to call just one new witness, with the idea that Democrats would call Bolton and Republicans would likely call either Hunter or Joe Biden.

"VIDEO: Freshman Democratic rep launches into screaming, unhinged rant during debate over coronavirus relief bill","During the House of Representatives' debate over the coronavirus relief bill that unanimously passed the Senate, Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan ran out of her allotted time — and she didn't take it well.

Stevens started off reading a relatively normal speech about the impact coronavirus has had on Americans, imploring lawmakers to take strong measures to help them and to listen to the advice of public health experts on how to respond.

But lawmakers were only allowed a minute during the structured debate, and when she was told her time was up, she asked for more time.

Now, there are a couple of ways one can handle the need for more time to speak in this situation. Here's how Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney approached it:

She calmly asked for more time, and more time was yielded to her so she could continue speaking. No conflict, and order is maintained.

On the flip side, there's the tactic Rep. Stevens chose, which was to start screaming with increasing intensity in an attempt to drown out anyone who might silence her, which also served the purpose of making it much more difficult for her colleague to yield an additional 30 seconds to her.

As Stevens' rant is ramping up, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) is trying to calm her down and let her know she's getting more time, but Stevens does not stop. The result is somewhat chaotic, and additionally no one can really understand or process what Stevens is so desperate to say. Again it is important to note that she was being granted more time, without the screaming.

Later Friday, the House passed the $2 trillion stimulus package that the Senate had approved late Wednesday, which will send money to American individuals and families and allocate hundreds of billions of dollars to small businesses and industries devastated by the impact of coronavirus shutdowns.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-costco-employee-customer-refusing-mask,2020-03-27
Video game websites IGN and Game Informer post and then retract support for Palestinian civilians,"Video game and entertainment media outlets IGN and Game Informer published and then retracted articles encouraging readers to donate to charities for the Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire of the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

On May 14, IGN posted an article titled, ""How to Help Palestine,"" which provided links to five charities and organizations that provide humanitarian relief to Palestinian civilians living in the West Bank and Gaza. The article featured a graphic of the Palestinian flag in IGN's masthead.



""Palestinian civilians are currently suffering in great numbers in Jerusalem, Gaza, and West Bank, due to the active Israel-Palestine conflict,"" IGN staff wrote. ""The NYTimes reported that most of the deaths so far have occurred in Gaza. Below are charities and organizations on the ground in those areas where you can donate funds to help those most in need. We will continue to update this article with other ways you can help.""

Game Informer staff published a similar article on May 15, citing the IGN post and linking to the same charities. Several top gaming outlets posted their own pro-Palestine stories, following IGN's lead.

But on Monday, the IGN and Game Informer articles were taken down. IGN released a statement about the removal, apologizing for appearing to take sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

""We have a track record of supporting humanitarian efforts and charities across the globe. In the instance of our recent post regarding how to help civilians in the Israel-Palestinian Conflict, our philanthropic instincts to help those in need was not in-line with our intent of trying to show support for all people impacted by tragic events,"" IGN said.

""By highlighting only one population, the post mistakenly left the impression that we were politically aligned with one side. That was not our intention and we sincerely regret the error.""

Game Informer has not yet released a public statement on why its article was taken down.

Kotaku reported that after the IGN article went live, IGN Israel shared a statement on its social media accounts condemning the U.S. IGN article and social media posts supporting Palestinian charities as ""misleading.""



""We at IGN Israel support the State of Israel (obviously) and support IDF soldiers who do everything to keep us all in these tough days,"" IGN Israel stated. ""We work in every way possible to remove this misleading and offensive content from the American edition which does not represent our views.""

That post by IGN Israel has since been deleted.

Reacting on social media, various game industry journalists and media figures were critical of the decision and speculated that IGN's Palestinian-sympathetic editorial staff was under orders from the website's corporate owners to take down the post.

Israeli-Palestinian fighting began again after weeks of tensions boiled over into violence when Israel's Supreme Court approved the evictions of six Palestinian families from a neighborhood in East Jerusalem to make way for Israeli settlers. On May 7, Israeli police were deployed to the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, where conflict with Palestinian worshippers there led to rocket strikes on Israel by Hamas and retaliation by Israeli Defense Forces.

President Joe Biden on Sunday spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, raising concerns about civilian casualties in Gaza amid the ongoing violence. Palestinian health officials claim at least 140 civilians, including dozens of children, have been killed by Israeli airstrikes, while nine people, including two children, were killed by Hamas rockets in Israel.

More than 25 Democratic senators, led by Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) have called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Palestine to ""prevent further loss of life and further escalation of violence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-day-3-for-president-trumps-defense-team-to-take-down-impeachment-charges-as-boltons-claims-loom-large,2021-05-17
Video: Homeowner fights off black bear that jumped over porch gate and headed straight for his dog,"A trio of dachshunds — Piper, Pickles, and Pepper — are kind of like kids to Walt Hickox and his wife.

""I don't have any kids, and my wife's kids are gone. We got together in 2006. We got [the dogs] shortly after. And that was our ... that was our family,"" Hickox told WESH-TV.

Last week, Hickox took Piper, Pickles, and Pepper outside his home in Daytona Beach, Florida, in the hopes they could scare off some ""cats,"" the station said.

But instead they found a much bigger — and moreterrifying — visitor.

What happened?

A Ring doorbell video camera caught the moment a black bear bounded over a gate at the porch's entrance last Wednesday evening, the station said in a separate story on the incident.

The dogs actually headed for the gate just before the bear entered the screened-in porch.

""Apparently, it wasn't a cat that they were after because they went, 'Alright, that side is clear.' That's when the bear came out,"" Hickox told WESH.

He told the station the bear made a beeline for Pickles.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

But Hickox immediately turned and charged at the bear, which briefly tangled with Hickox before backing out of the porch. He moved a bench in front of the entrance.

Here's the clip of the terrifying encounter:

Video shows Florida man fending off bear to protect dogs youtu.be

""I just wanted to deflect the tension off the dog long enough for him to realize, 'Hey, there's a human in here, too,'"" Hickox added to the station.

He said he even shared a surreal moment with the animal.

""I swear there was a fraction of time where the bear sat up and kicked his head to the side like, 'What are you screaming about?'"" Hickox recalled to WESH.

The aftermath

The station said Kerry Hickox called 911 and told dispatchers, ""My husband was just attacked by a bear, who do we get hold of to get this thing removed? He's got puncture wounds and scratches, but not enough for an ambulance or anything.""

After he had time to process what had just gone down, Hickox understandably lost it.

""When I had time to just sit and stare, it all hit me,"" he told WESH. ""And I started bawling. I couldn't believe how close to death I was. And I did it for my dog.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Law enforcement and bear biologists tried without success to capture the bear, the station said, adding that wildlife officials said the bear will be humanely killed upon capture since it attacked a human. Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation set a bear trap in the neighborhood, WESH noted.

Hickox told the station he doesn't want anything bad to happen to the bear, but he also doesn't want people to be in danger.

Wildlife officials added to WESH that if a black bear attacks, people should fight back aggressively like Hickox did.

“To reduce human-bear conflicts, remove or secure all food attractants from around your house and yard, including garbage, pet food and birdseed,"" officials added to the station. ""To avoid an encounter between a bear and your dog, bang on your door and flip your house lights on and off to give the bear time to leave the area before letting your dog out. If your dog and a bear get into a fight, make noise and use your bear spray or a water hose if available. If the bear makes contact with you, fight back aggressively.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-freshman-democratic-rep-launches-into-screaming-unhinged-rant-during-debate-over-coronavirus-relief-bill,2022-01-26
VIDEO: Left-wing militants block car of black transgender Minneapolis City Council VP; won't let it move until their list of demands is signed,"Left-wing militants blocked a car in which black transgender Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins was a passenger — and wouldn't let the vehicle move until Jenkins agreed to their list of demands and signed it.

Jenkins was attempting leave a Loring Park event Sunday when the vehicle blocking took place, the Star Tribune reported.

A 23-minute video showing a portion of the incident ended with Jenkins agreeing to ""leave George Floyd Square alone,"" support the creation of a civilian-led commission to oversee police, and call for Mayor Jacob Frey's resignation, the paper said.

But the vehicle blocking purportedly lasted about two hours.

What are the details?

Here's what led up to the vehicle blocking, according to the Star Tribune:

Activist D.J. Hooker posted the video to social media, said in an interview that he approached Jenkins after a ""Taking Back Pride"" event decrying police brutality. The event, according to a posting on social media, sought to prioritize the voices of people who are Black, transgender or queer. Jenkins was the first transgender woman of color elected to public office in a major U.S. city.



Hooker said he approached Jenkins to raise concerns about community groups contracted with the city to de-escalate tensions. Hooker said he grew frustrated when Jenkins told him she didn't have control over them and she wouldn't commit to leaving George Floyd Square alone, so he said they would hold a peaceful protest outside her house. Hooker said he and Jenkins argued and someone jumped between them.



Hooker said Jenkins began walking away, and he yelled, ""Oh, you're gonna call the cops on me knowing ... what the cops have done to George Floyd, what the cops have done to Dolal Idd and Winston Smith and Daunte Wright.""

Hooker's video begins with him narrating and complaining that Jenkins was ""mean"" and ""rude"" and that the car's driver already has called police on him and fellow militants:

The clip shows Jenkins in the passenger seat of the white car as militants surround the vehicle, which also is blocked by a post behind it.

Image source: Facebook video screenshot via Donald Hooker Jr

Jenkins is heard angrily speaking on her cellphone saying it might be ""three days before I get out of here. I got this white kid standing in front of my f***ing car; like he's holding it down ... like this ain't f***ing white supremacy like right the f*** here.""

Image source: Facebook video screenshot via Donald Hooker Jr.

Soon a handwritten list of demands appears, and Hooker gets on a megaphone to read them to Jenkins:

Image source: Facebook video screenshot via Donald Hooker Jr.

More from the Star Tribune:

Hooker begins reading off the list of demands, one by one. He asks if she will pledge her support for the creation of an elected, civilian commission to oversee police, for reopening cases in police killings, for dropping charges against protesters and releasing information about Smith's death. Each time, Jenkins says yes.



Hooker then asks her to pledge her support ""for Jacob Frey's immediate resignation."" Jenkins laughs, shakes her head side to side and, after additional prompting from protesters eventually says ""Jacob Frey resign.""



Hooker then asks her to ""leave George Floyd Square alone. Period.""

""Don't do my job,"" Jenkins replies. ""Is that what you're asking me to do?""

Arguments commenced, and the paper said Jenkins rolled up the window and said she won't sign anything as shouting continued. But then a few minutes later, the paper said Jenkins rolled down her window, and Hooker repeated the demand to leave the square alone.

""Fine, I'll leave George Floyd Square alone,"" Jenkins said, according to the paper. ""I will not do my job.""

'We ain't asking no more white lady!'

Thing also got tense when the driver of the car chimed in to say that the proceedings were not a negotiation.

Then a woman in the crowd yelled back, 'We ain't asking no more white lady! We're demanding!"" and added, ""Do your job and drive."" With that, the driver hoisted a middle finger at the crowd, after which Jenkins pushed down the driver's hand.

At that point in the video, Jenkins takes the paper on which the list of demands were written and signs it. After inspecting the signature, the militants decide Jenkins should print her name and date it also, and the council vice president agrees to that demand as well.

Image source: Facebook video screenshot via Donald Hooker Jr.

Then a militant is heard telling Jenkins, ""Now you can leave!"" And the car pulls away.

Image source: Facebook video screenshot via Donald Hooker Jr.

Here's the video. Content warning: Profanity:

Anything else?

The Star Tribune said the incident occurred during a ""tense time"" marked by re-election campaigns and residents ""making conflicting demands as the city debates how to transform policing following George Floyd's death.""



Hooker told the paper in an interview that his fellow activists confronted Jenkins because they were tired of elected leaders making promises on policing and not following through.

""They come to our events. They want a photo shoot. They tell us they support us, they care about us, and then they go through no action about it,"" Hooker told the Star Tribune, adding that he will be surprised if Jenkins follows through on any of the group's demands.

Jenkins told the paper afterward she wasn't ready to discuss the incident but would do so later.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-game-websites-support-palestinian-civilians,2021-06-30
"VIDEO: Late-night revelers jump on top of police car — with officer inside. Officials, residents are disgusted.","St. Louis officials and residents were left disgusted by videos showing a group of late-night revelers jumping on top of a police car — with an officer inside.

What are the details?

The early Sunday morning incident occurred on Washington Avenue as bars were closing downtown, KMOV-TV reported.

Here are a couple of clips. The first shows police bodycam video as the officer waits inside the patrol car, and the second clip shows the incident from the perspective of another driver:

What are the details?

911 logs indicated calls for shots fired, officers in need of aid, and disturbances on Washington Avenue between 15th and 18th Streets, the station said.

Videos showed numerous police cars responding to the calls, people dancing in the street — and people jumping atop a St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department vehicle, KMOV reported.

Regarding the clip of people jumping on top of the police car, police told KMOV the incident started as officers were called to disperse a large party from an apartment building rooftop.

A citywide call for an officer in need of aid was issued as an officer was inside a patrol car while the mob danced, kicked, and stomped on top of it, the station said.

KMOV said police released the video and asked for information on any of the suspects.

Officials weigh in

St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones released the following statement Monday, according to the station:

Our office has reviewed the video of people jumping on our patrol cars this weekend. While I'm thankful SLMPD responded quickly and dispersed the crowd without conflict or injury, I'm disappointed in those people who will now have to face consequences for their behavior. Let me be clear: You can go out and have a good time without all this nonsense. If we are committed to building a stronger city, we need to show some courtesy and respect.

Alderman Jack Coatar told the station that ""it's ridiculous and totally unacceptable behavior. That crowd damaged city property and put officers at risk.""

Resident Arnold Stricker — who's part of Citizens for a Greater Downtown St. Louis — told KMOV he was ""a little shocked and disappointed that that would be going on. We want a vibrant recovery from the pandemic for all the businesses and the residents in the city, and that wasn't a great way to kick that off.""

More from the station:

Saturday night is not the first time there have been concerns on Washington Avenue. The city erected barricades up and down the street last summer to deal with cruising, speeding and dangerous activities. Some of those barricades in Downtown were removed ahead of this weekend due to large crowds expected with St. Louis Blues and Cardinals playing in town.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-homeowner-fights-off-black-bear-that-jumped-over-porch-gate-and-headed-straight-for-his-dog,2021-05-25
"Horrifying video purportedly shows Russian tank blowing up car, killing two elderly Ukrainians","A video being widely circulated on the internet this week shows a supposed Russian tank obliterating a civilian car in Ukraine, reportedly killing an elderly couple inside.

The video was reportedly shared on Telegram by Ukrainian news agency Yhiah on Tuesday, according to the Daily Mail. However, watermarks splashed across the video indicate it was originally posted by an individual or organization running an account called ""Kyiv Operative.""

It shows the tank opening fire on the car just moments after the vehicle comes to an abrupt stop in the middle of an empty street. In the aftermath of the blast, the car appears to be severely damaged with the doors caved in and the body destroyed in several places.

The video was also shared online by a Twitter account called ""Armed Forces"" Ukraine, which has been compiling and posting relevant content since the start of the war.



(Warning: the following video contains graphic content that may be disturbing to some viewers.)

Multiple reports online claimed the blast killed two elderly Ukrainians, though details about the incident could not be independently verified.

This latest alleged incident comes as a growing number of reports continue to surface showing Russian atrocities in Ukraine as forces carry out violence against civilians attempting to flee battle zones.



Early on in the conflict, photos and videos shared online indicated that the Russian forces were assaulting airports, hospitals, apartment buildings, and other civilian population centers in their advance on the capital, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's insistence that only military installations would be targeted.

The civilian targeting soon became even more direct. One Russian tank was captured on video chasing down and flattening a civilian car. Then, missile strikes began raining down on Ukrainian civilians near Kyiv as they sought safety by fleeing battle over a damaged bridge. A mother and her two children were killed in the attacks.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to hunt down ""every bastard"" who has attacked his people in response to the ""deliberate murder.""

""We will punish everyone who committed atrocities in this war. On our land. We will find every bastard. Which shot at our cities, our people. Which bombed our land. Which launched rockets. Which gave the order and pressed 'start,'"" Zelenskyy said in a televised address, adding, ""There will be no quiet place on this Earth for you, except for the grave.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-left-wing-militants-block-councilmember-car,2022-03-09
Videos: Ukrainians reportedly take joyride on captured Russian tank as other vehicles are set ablaze or hauled away with tractors,"A group of Ukrainian men allegedly took a captured Russian tank for a joyride through snow-covered fields this week while others set fire to the vehicles or hauled them away using tractors, according to video clips shared online in recent days.

In the first video clip — which has now gone viral online — a group of men are seen cheering and laughing as they ride atop a T-80BVM armored battle tank in a field in Kharkiv, Ukraine, the Daily Mail reported.

The man filming the scene on his cellphone reportedly shouts, ""We did it!"" and ""Glory to Ukraine!"" while his compatriots laugh and yell along with him.

The video, purportedly first uploaded to Telegram, has since been shared online by several different social media accounts, including a Twitter account operated by Barstool Sports called ""Zero Blog Thirty.""

It wasn't immediately clear how the men commandeered the vehicle, however, reports of Russian troops abandoning tanks and other weaponry amid fighting in Ukraine have become widespread.

Newsweek reported Tuesday that a barrage of recent social media posts show Russian forces within the occupied country leaving military vehicles behind and fleeing combat.

Open-source intelligence monitor, OSINT Defender, tweeted a video earlier this week reporting that Russian troops fled a depot in the Sumy region, ""leaving behind BMPs, BTR-80s, MT-LBs and Infantry Transport Vehicles.""

Other abandoned vehicles reportedly included ""a 152mm Msta-S self-propelled howitzer, 1V13 command vehicle, T-80U tank, and logistical trucks,"" according to the Twitter account, ""Ukraine Weapons Tracker.""

Belarusian media outlet, NEXTA, posted a video on Thursday purportedly showing a line of Russian tanks being set ablaze near Nikolaev, now known as Mykolaiv.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian farmers have gained some notoriety on social media for allegedly hauling away abandoned Russian tanks using tractors, according to a report from British magazine, Farmers Weekly.

In one video, a tank is pulled down a street as someone chases after it.

The magazine quoted an anonymous source who said, ""A Russian solider got lost and got out of his armored personal carrier. He wandered off and the farmer came and took the tractor. The armored personnel carrier had been left unattended, so the farmer decided to nick it.""

In a separate video, an alleged Ukrainian farmer appears to tow away another Russian vehicle as bystanders wave and cheer.

TheBlaze cannot independently verify the accuracy of the videos included in this report.

"Virginia dad goes nuclear on teachers' union boss: They require 'permission slips' for 'snacks,' 'field trips' but not to 'talk about my son’s penis'","A father in Loudoun County, Virginia, tore into American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten this week after the union boss claimed that a growing parental rights movement in America could lead to civil war.

What did he say?

Brandon Michon — an outspoken parent who is also running for Congress as a Republican in Virginia's 10th district — told Fox News on Monday that union heads and school boards across the country are the ones who started the conflict by pushing progressive ideologies in schools.

""They've already invaded the classroom,"" Michon charged.

""When you think about it, [the union] colluded with the CDC, colluded with the DOJ and this administration on calling parents domestic terrorists,"" he said.

Michon, who has four children under the age of 10, accused Loudoun County Public Schools and other progressive school districts of pushing their radical views surrounding sexual orientation, gender identity, and critical race theory on children without consent from parents.

""They have to have signed permission slips for their snacks, they have to have signed permission slips to go on field trips, but no one is asking me for permission to talk about my son’s penis,"" he exclaimed. ""It is unacceptable. They are pushing indoctrination on the most innocent part of the population.""

What's the background?

Weingarten made headlines last week after going off on proponents of the parental rights in education movement in America during an unhinged radio interview.



""We've been very lucky in America, and we in some ways live in a bubble for a long time. This is propaganda. This is misinformation. This is the way in which wars start. This is the way in which hatred starts,"" the teachers union leader fumed to radio host Rick Smith.

Elsewhere in the discussion, she called backlash against progressive ideology being taught in public schools an ""existential threat"" to the country and complained that ""right-wing extremists"" are ""exploiting"" parents' fears to accomplish political ends.

Weingarten's remarks served as a flash point in the heated battle between parents who want more control over their children's education and the leaders of educational institutions who think they know better.

In recent months, parental outrage over transgender-affirming and critical race theory curricula in schools has culminated in legislation aiming to prevent such unwanted indoctrination. Perhaps the most popular piece of legislation is Florida's House Bill 1557, which bars classroom discussion on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through the third grade and establishes scaleable guidelines for discussion on the subject matter in grades thereafter.

What else?

Outraged over what his children were being taught in school, Michon decided to speak up at school board meetings last year. Now he's running for office with a campaign focused on parental empowerment and putting children's interests first.

""The children just want to learn,"" Michon told Fox News.

""If you want to talk about the biggest equalizer in all of education, literacy. Let’s get back to teaching more literacy. That [lifts] up all socio-economic classes,"" he argued, adding, ""Don’t talk about the vocal minority of parents when there is vocal minority on the other side. We need to renew the focus on our children. Math, science, history, the things that will make them good members of society.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/video-russian-tank-blowing-up-car,2022-04-25
Virginia mom says biracial son was brainwashed by critical race theory lessons and 'totally changed',"A Virginia mom has taken her 13-year-old son's middle school to court over anti-racism policy and curriculum she claims are indoctrinating him with critical race theory.

Melissa Riley, a single mom in the Charlottesville area, says that her biracial son's views on race and his self-image have been warped since the Albemarle School District adopted a policy intent on eliminating ""all forms of racism"" from the school district. She claims that the new anti-racist curriculum adopted at Henley Middle School has ""totally changed his perspective"" in a harmful way, emphasizing racial conflict and division.

""We didn’t have issues before. He is in eighth grade,"" Riley told Fox News host Jesse Waters on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" Monday. ""He's seeing himself just as a black man. He's seeing things that don’t go his way as racism. And he is finding safety in numbers now.""

Riley told Watters that her son, whose father is black, has begun accusing her and others of ""racism"" any time he's asked to do something he does not want to do.



""I asked him to clean the house, [he said] 'racism!'"" Riley said.

She says ever since the school started teaching elements of critical race theory, her son has come to see himself first and foremost as a black man with an extensive system of white privilege in America stacked against him.

""They have totally changed his perspective. They have put him in a box,"" she added.

Riley said her son is ""using it as an excuse because they have told him that that’s how people see him, as a black man that the world is against, and [he] sees it as a negative now.""

A direct appeal to the school resulted in officials dismissing her concerns and telling her that her son could be a ""black spokesman for the black community.""

""When I told them I didn’t think that that would be appropriate, they told me that if he was uncomfortable with the conversations, he and other children of color could go to a safe place during these conversations,"" she told Watters. ""And that’s segregation.""

Riley and her son, along with several other parents and students, are plaintiffs in a lawsuit the Alliance Defending Freedom brought against the Albemarle County School Board in December. ADF attorneys argue that the school district's anti-racism policies are ""discriminatory"" and that the school is ""indoctrinating students in radical ideology.""

The lawsuit was dismissed last month by Albemarle Circuit Judge Claude Worrell II, who said there was no proof that anyone had been harmed by the school district's policy, National Review reported.



ADF counsel Ryan Bangert disagreed with the court's finding. He told Fox News that the school is teaching divisive topics and asserted that the civil rights of students are being violated by lessons that promote ""bigotry.""

""They don’t deny what they are teaching. They simply think it’s fine. They think it’s okay. But it’s not okay. It’s never okay. It’s never right for a school to teach kids that they are determined by their race. It’s never okay for a school to tell kids that bigotry should be fought with bigotry and racism should be fought by doubling down on racism. Those things are not okay,"" Banger said. ""They’re a violation of students’ civil rights.""

"Famed theologian points to 'demonic ideology' behind critical race theory, BLM movement — but says a great awakening is on its way","Black theologian Dr. Voddie T. Baucham says that there is an insidious ""demonic ideology"" behind the teaching of critical race theory, core tenets of the Black Lives Matter movement, and more.

What are the details?

In an interview with the Daily Wire's Jon Brown, Baucham — an American expat who serves as the dean of theology at African Christian University in Zambia — warned that when he visits America, he is always struck by the ever-changing social temperature in the country.

""I've come back three or four times a year for speaking tours, and it's always interesting to be an American expat looking back at the U.S.,"" Baucham, who was born in Los Angeles in 1969, said.

In his latest book, ""Fault Lines: The Social Justice Movement and Evangelicalism's Looming Catastrophe,"" the theologian states that he believes topics such as CRT and anti-racism are flash points in an ongoing spiritual war across the world and specifically in the United States.

Baucham released the book — currently the No. 1 best-seller in Amazon's Christian Personal Growth section — in April.

“I think that's one of the reasons that I just became so keenly aware and so passionate about writing this book, because it was really noticeable to me that things were shifting quickly and deteriorating quickly,"" he told Brown. “And I'm watching families be divided, churches be divided, institutions and schools and denominations be divided over this thing. Being an expat coming back and seeing that, it was just alarming to me.""

'Demonic ideology'

Of Baucham's childhood, Brown said, ""He remembers well the era of desegregation busing and the ravages of the crack epidemic. There, in an impoverished single-parent household in Los Angeles, Baucham eventually came to Christianity and officially converted when he was a freshman in college despite initially being drawn to the ideologies of Malcolm X and other black nationalist concepts.""

“The question of the proper order of faith and ethnicity is critical to understanding the various positions people take in the broader social-justice debate — one with which all people must wrestle, regardless of their ethnicity,"" Baucham wrote in his book. “However, for black Christians, this concept has often been difficult to embrace for several reasons.""

Brown added, ""When he became a Christian, he found he had to renounce [Malcolm X worldviews], but it gave him a unique discernment into the nature of CRT and other ideologies that seek to politically weaponize race and undermine faith.""

""Baucham dissects over several chapters how CRT and the social justice movement twist traditional religious categories into a means by which to assert power,"" Brown wrote. ""Characterizing the battles facing the U.S. as fundamentally spiritual, he deftly traces such philosophies to their origin in what he describes as the 'demonic ideology' of Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, and their neo-Marxist successors in the Frankfurt School.""

CRT, anti-racism, BLM 'very much religious in its overtones'

Baucham added that concepts like ""anti-racism"" are ""very much religious in its overtones.""

""But more specifically, this religion has its own cosmology, its own understanding of the way the world came to be,"" he added. ""This religion has its own theology and theological terminology. It has its own saints, its own priests, it has its own rituals. And it has a dogged commitment to its ideology and its theology and a punitive approach to those who step out of line. So it's a religion, but as a religion, it offers no hope. There is no ultimate redemption in antiracism. You just have to do the work of antiracism for the rest of your life and hope you never step out of line, because if you do, then you go back to zero.""

He also argued that the biggest weapon against division and hatred is not reparations — but forgiveness.

""Antiracism knows nothing of forgiveness because it knows nothing of the Gospel,"" Baucham insisted. ""Instead, antiracism offers endless penance, judgement, and fear.""

Of the Black Lives Matter movement, Baucham wrote, ""I see Critical Race Theory, Intersectionality, Critical Social Justice, and their antecedents — Marxism, Conflict Theory, and Critical Theory — as 'cosmic powers over this present darkness.' The organization is Marxist, revolutionary, feminist, misandrous, pro-LGBTQIA+, pro-abortion, and anti-family, with roots in the occult. It is unacceptable for Christians to partner with, celebrate, identify with or promote this organization.""

A great awakening

Baucham said that he has hope for the future, however, and does not anticipate a race war — but a great awakening.

""I was worried for a while that we're moving toward a race war,"" he admitted. ""I don't see that now. I see a pushback against Critical Race Theory and some of these other things, and so I'm excited about that. The other thing is, I feel like this is running out of steam. There's only so much guilt and self-flagellation that people can go through before they finally say, 'You know what, I'm tired.' I think we're at that point now.""

""Ultimately,"" he added, ""this is about power.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/virginia-dad-randi-weingarten-parents-rights,2021-06-18
Vox lambasted on social media for tweet proclaiming 'we don't know why' anti-Semitism spiked during the Israel-Hamas war,"Liberal news outlet Vox News got lambasted on social media over a headline proclaiming that they were mystified about the rise of anti-Semitic attacks during the latest war between Israel and Hamas.

The tweet of the Vox article from Zach Beauchamp read, ""Violent anti-Semitism spiked in America during the Israel-Hamas war. And we don't know why.""

Beauchamp pondered why there seemed to be a rise in violence against Jewish people during the latest war between Israel and Hamas, and claimed that this was a new phenomenon.



""These attacks appear to be linked to the recent flare-up in fighting between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. In some cases, the perpetrators waved Palestinian flags or shouted pro-Palestinian slogans,"" he wrote.

Beauchamp also claimed that the Anti-Defamation League was exaggerating their statistics on anti-Semitic violence.

""It might be overstating the current level of anti-Semitic animus. But the upsurge in anti-Semitic assaults linked to anti-Israel sentiment, in particular, seems new and different, and it is not something that typically happens in the US during fighting between Israel and Hamas."" he added.

Many on social media pounced on the bizarre claims to mock Vox.

""If only the perpetrators of this violence were carrying signs and flags and screaming at their victims about why they were attacking them, Vox might be able to crack this impenetrable code, figure out this riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma!"" joked opinion editor Batya Ungar-Sargon.

""If you don't know why, it's because you don't want to,"" replied Jerusalem Post editor Lahav Harkov.

""What's striking about normie lefty US thought, particularly re: issues outside the American purview, is this toxic combination of unshakable smugness, neurotic projection, and total ignorance,"" responded writer Antonio Garcia Martinez.

""I knew which Hamas apologist wrote this before I opened it,"" replied David Harsanyi of National Review.

""Because those committing the attacks were already unhinged Jew haters. Gaza just offered them the pretext to go out in the streets and beat up on Jews,"" explained Arsen Ostrovsky, a human rights attorney.

"Walter Wallace Jr.'s family condemns violence and looting in Philadelphia, begs for justice and peace","The family of Walter Wallace Jr., calling for justice and peace, denounced the violence and looting taking place in Philadelphia after video of the deadly police shooting went viral.

""I don't condone no violence, tearing up the city, looting up the stores, and all this chaos going,"" Walter Wallace Sr. said Tuesday night. ""I would like that everybody having respect for my family and my son to stop this violent and chaos, what's going on in the city.""

Speaking to reporters, Wallace Sr. asked for answers on the police shooting of his 27-year-old son, which was captured on bodycam footage. According to the Wallace family, police had visited their home three times on Monday. They said the younger Wallace suffered from mental health problems for years and that night the family called 911 for an ambulance but instead, the police arrived.

Police fatally shot Wallace, who was reportedly armed with a knife, after he allegedly strode toward the officers and refused to drop the knife.

""I was telling the police to stop, don't shoot my son. They paid me no mind and they just shot him,"" said Cathy Wallace, the deceased's mother.

""Justice got to be done to help my son and help my family,"" Wallace Sr. told WTXF-TV. ""That's all I'm sending out, is an S.O.S. to help, and not to hurt and cause no chaos, violent looting, fire ... I wasn't brought up like that.""

In the aftermath of the deadly shooting, riots have erupted in Philadelphia. More than 30 police officers were injured Monday as police are being targeted for assault. Looters are taking advantage of the chaos as well to rob Philadelphia stores. BlazeTV reporter Elijah Schaffer was assaulted inside a Philadelphia store while covering the violence.

The Wallace family has repeatedly called for peace.

""I ain't got time to loot, burn up, and destroy where I live. It's uncalled for, it really, really is and the people doing it ain't helping my family. They are showing disrespect,"" Wallace Sr. said.

In a statement released Wednesday morning, the White House announced it is prepared to deploy federal resources to stop the violence at the request of Pennsylvania officials.

""The riots in Philadelphia are the most recent consequence of the Liberal Democrats' war against the police,"" the Trump administration said.

""All lethal force incidents must be fully investigated. The facts must be followed wherever they lead to ensure fair and just results. In America, we resolve conflicts through the courts and the justice system. We can never allow mob rule,"" the statement said. ""The Trump administration stands proudly with law enforcement, and stands ready, upon request, to deploy any and all Federal resources to end these riots.""

A statement from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris expressed sympathy for the Wallace family, while condemning the violence in Philadelphia.

""Walter Wallace's life, like too many others', was a Black life that mattered — to his mother, to his family, to his community, to all of us,"" the statement said in part. ""At the same time, no amount of anger at the very real injustices in our society excuses violence. Attacking police officers and vandalizing small businesses, which are already struggling during a pandemic, does not bend the moral arc of the universe closer to justice. It hurts our fellow citizens. Looting is not a protest, it is a crime.""

Biden and Harris attacked President Trump in their statement.

""All Donald Trump does is fan the flames of division in our society. He is incapable of doing the real work to bring people together. We will,"" they said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/voddie-bauchman-crt-blm-demonic-ideology,2020-10-28
WaPo: Biden officials 'panicked' that they can't do anything to stop reversal of Roe v. Wade,"A Washington Post report said that the Biden administration was caught off guard by the leak showing the Supreme Court was primed to overturn Roe v. Wade, and officialsare panicked about their inability to stop it.

“A lot of what the Biden administration could do would be window dressing, in that ultimately we’re going to have a system of conflicting access to reproductive health and rights depending upon the state you live in,” said Georgetown health law expert Lawrence Gostin. “And there’s very little that Biden can do about that.”



Many Democrats have called for abortion rights to be codified into law by Congress, but that effort is dependent on all Democrats voting in unison to shut down the filibuster. Both Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have said they would not support the congressional maneuver.

The report said the administration was debating numerous executive and regulatory measures to defend abortion rights, but most of those efforts would likely be doomed if they were challenged and decided in the Supreme Court.

“Every single thing they do is going to get legally challenged, and every lawyer agrees,” said one outside adviser. “A bunch of attorneys general will mobilize, and [the administration] will lose.”

While many on the right are applauding the report that the court might overturn the landmark abortion decision, they are angered that someone apparently tried to intimidate the court by leaking the draft report.

A defiant statement from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts assured whoever was culpable that the court would not be influenced by the unprecedented leak.

""To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed. The work of the Court will not be affected in any way,"" Roberts said.

"WaPo analysis suggests Israel's 'Iron Dome' rocket defense system works too well, 'perpetuates' Gaza conflict — and readers have a field day","Yagil Levy — a professor at the Open University of Israel — penned an analysis for the Washington Post suggesting Israel's ""Iron Dome"" rocket defense system works too well and, as the headline reads, ""perpetuates"" Israel's present fighting against Hamas terrorists.

What's the background?

Levy — who studies ""civil-military relations, particularly casualty sensitivity, civilian control, military-religious relations, and the social makeup of the armed forces"" — wrote last Friday that when Iron Dome was first used in 2012, the idea was to protect Israel's citizens from ""prolonged threat and the disruption of daily life.""

But he also suggested Iron Dome has worked too well — on multiple levels.

Besides also limiting potential harm to Gaza civilians, Levy said the defense system has allowed Israel to gain ""freedom of action against Hamas (for example, imposing restrictions on trade between Gaza and the West Bank), knowing that their responses, and those of other militias, would have limited impact on Israeli lives.""

Essentially, he said because Iron Dome intercepts just about all incoming rockets, it reduces the ""expected costs of bombing Gaza"" and ""allows Israel to act with less concern for civilian casualties, and gives Israel less incentive to find a political solution to its conflict with Gaza.""

Levy concluded his analysis by saying, ""Iron Dome up to this point has saved Israeli lives from Gaza rocket attacks, while enabling air campaigns against Palestinian citizens. But the reduced pressure to resolve the conflict with Gaza also means Iron Dome gives Israelis a false sense of security, based on technological success — which isn't guaranteed forever — rather than political solutions.""

How did readers react?

In light of an analysis that more or less says Iron Dome makes the fighting unfair, readers of the piece had a field day:

"'As empty gestures go, impressive': WaPo's Jennifer Rubin mocks Pope Francis' visit to Russian embassy over Ukraine invasion — and gets torched for it","Pope Francis visited the Russian embassy to the Holy See on Friday to express concern over Russia's invasion of Ukraine — a move that Reuters characterized as an ""unprecedented departure from diplomatic protocol.""

The outlet said Moscow's ambassador, Aleksandr Avdeyev, told the RIA Novosti news agency that during the 40-minute meeting, Francis expressed ""great concern"" about Ukraine's humanitarian situation and quoted the pontiff as calling ""for the protection of children, the protection of the sick and suffering, and the protection of people.""

But formerly conservative Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin wasn't impressed.

What did she say?

Replying to a tweet from NBC News' chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel on the pope's appeal, Rubin remarked, ""As empty gestures go, impressive.""

How are folks reacting?

As you might imagine, a number of Twitter users who caught wind of Rubin's five-word dismissal of Pope Francis' rare act were equally dismissive of Rubin and her words:

""Yeah Jen, there definitely aren’t over a billion Catholics to be spoken for, and the Holy Father has never played a role in liberating Eastern Europe, definitely not a thing that happened 30-40 years ago,"" one commenter noted.

""Like changing your Twitter name to 'I stand with Ukraine.' What does that even mean?"" another user wondered. ""Did you fly to the Ukraine, take up arms, and are right now helping them defend their country?""

""She's literally saved 40 billion lives by changing her Twitter name to include 'I stand with Ukraine,'"" another user mocked in reference to Rubin.

""God you are an awful human being,"" another commenter declared. ""What has your god, Joe Biden, done for the people of Ukraine other than get them killed? Burn in hell, witch.""

""Really Jennifer?!! An empty gesture!! Pope Francis and his words, thoughts, and actions, have significant influence around the world!"" another user said. ""His words have way more significance than yours! So why don’t you take your empty gesture words and go to Kyiv and stand with Ukraine and fight!""

Anything else?

Reuters noted that a pope visiting an embassy to talk to an ambassador in a time of conflict ""is unprecedented in living memory,"" adding that the Vatican's secretary of state usually summons foreign envoys to meet with the pope in the Apostolic Palace.

The outlet also said that prior to Russia's invasion, Andriy Yurash — Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican — told Reuters that Kyiv would be open to a Vatican mediation of the conflict.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wapo-biden-panicked-row-wade,2022-02-25
"Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris named to list of 'worst ethical violators'","A self-described nonpartisan government watchdog has named its ""worst ethical violators"" of 2018.

Who tops the list? Among Democrats, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.).

What are the details?



The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust honored the leading Democratic lawmakers with the distinction for soliciting political donations during the fight over Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Warren and Harris vehemently opposed Kavanaugh, feelings they prominently displayed to the Democratic mainstream.

In October, FACT filed an ethics complaint with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics against Warren and Harris. The group called for an immediate investigation into alleged improper campaign fundraising.



FACT said:

Senators Warren and Harris both sent campaign fundraising emails before the Senate vote on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Specifically, the campaign emails both stated Senators Warren and Harris's official role and positions on the ongoing confirmation hearing and then made direct requests for campaign donations with ""DONATE NOW"" and ""CONTRIBUTE"" buttons. Senate ethics laws prohibit candidates from using the promise of official action or legislative work in a direct ask for campaign cash.

Specifically, Senate ethics rules guard against ""senators from soliciting campaign contributions based upon any action taken in their official capacity. By linking a promise of official action with campaign contributions, a Senator violates a 'basic principle' of Senate Ethics that guards against conflicts of interest.""

Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono (D), the leading anti-Kavanaugh crusader who held tightly to unsubstantiated claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh, also attempted to fundraise from the political tomfoolery. However, once confronted with the ethical implications of such a decision, Hirono apologized.

As FACT noted, when confronted with the apparent ethics violation, Warran dismissed FACT's complaint as ""frivolous.""

Was action ever taken against Warren and Harris?

That remains unclear. If so, it was never publicized.

Anything else?

While Warren and Harris were targeted for their improper campaign fundraising, FACT named House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) 2018's ""top violators"" overall ""for failing to adequately protect congressional staff from sexual and other forms of harassment.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wapo-israels-iron-dome-works-too-well,2018-12-18
Warren nods as audience member calls AIPAC an ‘unholy alliance’ of ‘islamophobes’ and ‘white nationalists’,"At a campaign event in Derry, New Hampshire, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) committed to boycotting the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) annual conference this year, while nodding along with an attendee's criticism that the pro-Israel group is getting too cozy with ""islamophobes"" and ""white nationalists.""

During the Thursday rally, a member of the audience asked Warren whether or not she would boycott the pro-Israel group's annual event, saying that Democrats shouldn't ""legitimize"" the group's supposed ""bigotry.""

""I'm an American Jew and I'm terrified by the unholy alliance that AIPAC is forming with islamophobes and anti-Semites and white nationalists, and no Democrat should legitimize that kind of bigotry by attending their annual policy conference,"" she said to Warren. ""I'm really grateful you skipped the AIPAC conference last year, so my question is if you'll join me in committing to skip the AIPAC conference this March?""

While taking a drink from her water glass, the candidate can be seen nodding along with the attendee's assessment before answering with a quick ""yeah"" to applause from the audience.

Footage of the full event can be found on C-Span, but a snippet containing the exchange can be seen here:

She later went on to outline her vision for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, saying that ""we need to get both parties to the table. We're not getting that if we just stand with one party.""

The leftist Jewish group IfNotNow later tweeted that the question was asked on their behalf as part of an effort along with other leftist organizations to get Democratic presidential candidates to skip the pro-Israel conference.

Warren was one of several 2020 Democrats who joined together to boycott last year's AIPAC annual conference. This year's conference will be March 1-3 in Washington, D.C.

Washington Post claims climate change increases 'domestic violence' risks for women,"Climate change has been accused of being ""inherently racist"" and ""sexist."" It has been blamed for congenital heart defects. It now stands accused of another grievous category of misdeed.

According to an op-ed in the Washington Post, if a man in a poor country brutalizes a woman, his victim could attribute her aggressor's malice and cruelty at least in part to climate change.

The trio of authors advancing this notion — Geoffrey Ondieki, Disha Shetty, and Aie Balagtas See — tend to write about human rights, environmental, and women's issues.

In their article co-published Tuesday by the Post and the Fuller Project, their interests apparently converged, culminating in the suggestion that ""the threat of violence could become more common as climate change makes extreme weather events more intense and frequent.""

Terry McGovern, chair of the Population and Family Health department at Columbia University, told the Post, ""Heat waves, floods, climate-induced disasters increase sexual harassment, mental and physical abuse, femicide, reduce economic and educational opportunity and increase the risk of trafficking due to forced migration.""

McGovern conceded that the data remains limited on some fronts.

Nitya Rao, a gender professor at the University of East Anglia, suggested that the ""climate discourse is all about the numbers, but the evidence on violence and changes in power dynamics cannot be captured that way, and so it is not given the same weight.""

With an apparent dearth of proof to substantiate their claims, the article's authors seized upon an indirect link between bad weather and domestic violence taken up in the U.N.'s intergovernmental panel on climate change's recent report.

The U.N. report

""Climate increases conflict risk by undermining food and water security,"" said the U.N. report, which may ultimately lead to an increase in ""violence against women, girls and vulnerable groups.""

This claim was coupled with a concession: ""The influence of climate is small compared to socioeconomic, political and cultural factors.""



Although not as influential as proven causes of violence, the report noted that there was ""limited evidence, high agreement"" that the fetching of water in poorer countries affected by droughts and other natural phenomena may be associated with domestic violence, specifically in hypothetical instances where women are found not to have completed ""daily water-related domestic tasks.""



While contending that increases in temperature may also be associated with heightened conflict risk ""in certain settings,"" this claim was accompanied with a caution: ""medium agreement, low evidence.""



One 2020 study cited in the report indicated that there was ""no significant correlation between annual homicide rate and annual temperature for New York City,"" for instance, and that no ""linkages between temperature and crime have been reported for Canada.""

The panel did, however, agree with ""medium evidence,"" that ""during and after extreme weather events, women, girls and LGBTQI people are at increased risk of domestic violence, harassment, sexual violence and trafficking.""

The term ""climate change"" was noticeably absent from this claim, where instead ""weather"" was used.

Culpability: A who or a what?

Like gun control activists who diminish human agency and assign blame to inanimate objects for bad behavior, the authors appear keen to link bad behavior to bad weather rather than just bad people.



The Post article cites the story of a Kenyan woman named Pilot Lenaigwanai, who was driven from her home by an abusive husband.

Lenaigwanai's ""husband was abusive even before the drought that's now ravaging Kenya's arid north.""

It is unclear whether Lenaigwanai would still have fled to the Umoja refuge had the weather been better, but it is clear from the article that the drought was not what made her husband abusive.

Rommel Lopez, a spokesman for a local social welfare department in the Philippines, suggested that bad weather may be among the conditions that exacerbate preexisting frustrations.

""When there’s a calamity or disaster or conflict, that can put families in difficulties. The situation at evacuation centers is a contributing factor,"" said Lopez. ""It makes them agitated. It adds to their frustration. When someone is frustrated, they could reach a certain point and that could trigger [violence].""

Shilpi Singh, who helps women in India's poorest state, suffered no illusions about what beside cruel men and the cultural norms that help captivate their victims is at issue: ""It comes down to economic distress. ... The men vent out their frustration by beating the women, who are raised with the belief that leaving is not an option.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/warren-harris-listed-as-worst-ehtical-violators,2023-01-05
Washington Post finally admits mistakes in coverage of Covington Catholic incident,"More than a month after the original incident, The Washington Post has issued an editor's note correcting it's erroneous reporting on the confrontation between Native American activist Nathan Phillips and the Covington Catholic High School students.

Early reports from the event portrayed the students as instigators who were mocking and harassing Phillips. The imagery of a white teenager wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat while smiling and staring down a Native American man fit perfectly with a narrative many in the media, including at The Post, were eager to jump on.

But, the more details that came out about the situation, the more it became clear that Phillips was not an innocent victim of harassment and ridicule from Trump-supporting students.

Here's what the Post had to say about it in the Friday note:



It is important to note that The Washington Post is being sued by one of the Covington students, Nicholas Sandmann, who was most prominently featured in the videos of the incident and whose reputation was significantly attacked in the aftermath.

Sandmann is suing the Post for $250 million, claiming he was defamed based on a ""deceptively edited"" video.

The Washington Post waits 18 months to confirm details of Hunter Biden's deals with Chinese energy company,"Ten days after the New York Times admitted that the Hunter Biden laptop story was real, the Washington Post published a lengthy examination of emails and other documents detailing Biden's multimillion-dollar payout from business dealings with a Chinese energy company.

The Post's report confirms key details about the Biden family's lucrative deals with CEFC China Energy, which had first been reported by the New York Post and others in October 2020. At the time, the mainstream media outlets including the Washington Post smeared the Biden emails story as Russian disinformation, and then-candidate Joe Biden used those reports as a shield against questions regarding his involvement with Hunter's business relationships.



Government records, court documents, bank statements, and emails from Biden's laptop reviewed by the Washington Post now confirm that the Chinese energy conglomerate paid $4.8 million to entities controlled by Hunter Biden and his uncle, James Biden. New documents obtained by the Post include a copy of a $1 million legal retainer, emails related to the wire transfers, and $3.8 million in consulting fees that are confirmed in bank records and agreements signed by Hunter Biden.



While potential energy projects that Hunter Biden discussed with CEFC were never completed, Hunter Biden still received at least $3.79 million in payments from the company through consulting contracts, the Washington Post reported.

Biden was also given a $1 million retainer, issued as part of an agreement to represent Patrick Ho, a CEFC official who was later charged in the United States in connection with a multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe leaders from Chad and Uganda. The Post obtained a copy of the retainer agreement, which contained the signatures of both Hunter Biden and Ho, who has since been convicted and was sentenced to three years in prison.



Hunter Biden's business deals with China and with the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings Ltd. have been controversial and may have been criminal. Federal prosecutors are investigating Biden for potential tax crimes involving failure to pay taxes on foreign income related to these business relationships. Republicans, meanwhile, have sought to link President Joe Biden to his son's activities, claiming that the Biden family profited from their patriarch's public service. Former President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers have also accused Joe Biden of having conflicts of interest involving Hunter Biden's previous tenure as a member of Burisma's board.

In a separate story, the Washington Post explained that outside security experts worked to verify the emails obtained from Hunter Biden's laptop, which is currently in the custody of the FBI. The experts reportedly could not verify most of the nearly 129,000 emails contained on the laptop, nor did they find clear evidence of tampering, which would suggest the contents of the laptop's hard drive were fabricated. The emails related to Hunter Biden's deals with CEFC were corroborated by the other documents obtained by the Washington Post.

The newspaper acknowledged that the contents of Biden's laptop have ""sparked debate and controversy,"" noting that Facebook and Twitter in 2020 ""restricted distribution of stories about the drive’s contents out of concern that the revelations might have resulted from a nefarious hacking campaign intended to upend the election, much as Russian hacks of sensitive Democratic Party emails shaped the trajectory of the 2016 election.""

The Post did not explain why it only now has attempted to verify the contents of Biden's laptop, 18 months after the New York Post broke the story and well after the 2020 presidential election.

The Post's report stated that there is no evidence that President Joe Biden ""benefited from or knew details about the transactions with CEFC."" Reached for comment, the White House directed the Washington Post to previous statements that Joe Biden ""has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever.”

But this claim was contested in 2020 by Tony Bobulinski, a man who claimed to be a former business associate of Hunter Biden. In the weeks after the New York Post broke the Hunter Biden laptop story but before the 2020 presidential election, Bobulinski said that his company, Sinohawk Holdings, had formed a partnership with CEFC and the Biden family.

One of the now-verified Hunter Biden emails reported by the New York Post detailed ""remuneration packages"" for six individuals identified only by initials who were party to the business venture with CEFC. The email, written by James Gilliar of the international consulting firm J2cR, names Hunter Biden as the ""Chair / Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC (China Energy Co)"" and notes his pay was to be ""850."" Hunter Biden was identified with the letter ""H"" in the email, according to the New York Post.

Among the terms of the deal, the email stated, ""10 held by H for the big guy?""

Bobulinski claimed that the ""big guy"" referred to Joe Biden in a statement to the New York Post.

""Hunter Biden called his dad 'the Big Guy' or 'my Chairman,' and frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals that we were discussing,"" Bobulinski said in 2020. ""I’ve seen Vice President Biden saying he never talked to Hunter about his business. I’ve seen firsthand that that’s not true, because it wasn’t just Hunter’s business, they said they were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line.""

He also accused Joe Biden of telling a ""blatant lie"" when he denied having any knowledge of his son's business relationship with CEFC China Energy.

Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) have sought more details on the Biden family's business relationships with ""communist China."" On Monday, the lawmakers gave speeches on the Senate floor defending the conclusions of a September 2020 report they put together on the financial connections between Hunter Biden and China, Ukraine, and other foreign countries.



“Our report exposed extensive financial relationships between Hunter and James Biden and Chinese nationals connected to the communist regime,” Grassley said. ""More precisely, these were Chinese nationals connected to the Chinese government’s military and intelligence services.”

He focused on CEFC, noting the now-defunct company's ties to the Chinese government.

“CEFC operated under the guise of a private company but was for all intents and purposes an arm of the Chinese government,” Grassley said. “Hunter Biden and James Biden served as the perfect vehicle by which the communist Chinese government could gain inroads here in the United States through CEFC and its affiliates.""

The Iowa senator said he and Johnson would soon release new documents detailing ""additional connections between the Biden family and the communist Chinese regime.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-post-claims-climate-change-increases-domestic-violence-risks-for-women,2022-03-30
WATCH: Abortion doctor appears to pull gun on pro-life protester outside clinic,"UPDATE, 10/18/2019, 4 P.M. CST: Dr. Ronald Yunis has been arrested by Phoenix Police and booked into Maricopa County Jail on aggravated assault charges.





Original story:



An abortion doctor in Phoenix allegedly pulled a gun on pro-life protesters outside a clinic last week, and the protesters are now claiming that police are unwilling to do anything about it.

On Oct. 10, Elvis Kesto was among protesters outside Acacia Women's Center holding a peaceful demonstration. The gathering was one of many in the state organized by End Abortion Now, which is a coalition of churches that advocates for ending abortion through ministry at abortion clinics, publicity, and legislative means.

As Kesto and others were standing outside the clinic, a doctor who is identified in the video as Ronald Yunis drives by in a red Tesla, leaving the facility. As he passes, he holds up an object that appears to be a gun and points it toward Kesto before driving away.

Help Us: Abortionist Pulls Gun on Minister youtu.be

Kesto reported the incident to Phoenix police the same day. A week later, on Thursday morning, while demonstrating in front of Acacia Women's Center again, Kesto contacted the police again when he saw Yunis arrive in the same red Tesla, asking them to send officers to the scene.

Within the hour, an officer identified as Bobby Madeira arrived at the clinic to speak with Kesto. Madeira and another officer identified as Officer Wilson entered the clinic to speak with Yunis.

After police talked to Yunis, Madeira told Kesto that there was not enough evidence to make an arrest. Madeira said although he viewed the video and still images from the video, he could not ""conclusively"" say that it was a gun that Yunis was holding. The officer also said Yunis denies that he ever brings a gun to the clinic.

No arrest was made, but Phoenix PD Detective Luis Samudio told Faithwire that detectives are currently investigating the incident, and that it is ""not accurate"" to say that nothing is being done simply because Yunis was not arrested.

Jeff Durbin, pastor of Apologia Church (the church that established End Abortion Now), told TheBlaze he believed that pro-life demonstrators would have been treated more severely by authorities if they were even legally carrying weapons, let alone if they had pointed one at someone.

""We don't actually carry at the abortion mill, because we don't want any confusion about our purposes there,"" Durbin said. ""If we had been involved in anything like [what Yunis allegedly did], there is absolutely no question I'd be behind bars.""

Acacia Women's Center is one of numerous abortion clinics End Abortion Now visits around Arizona regularly. Durbin said right before police arrived Thursday, they had convinced a woman not to go through with her abortion and offered her assistance going forward.

Durbin said Yunis is aware of who they are and sees them on a regular basis, but there has never been any kind of violence or threats between the doctor and protesters on other occasions.

""He isn't nice to us, but I'm not sure if we've ever had any other conflict in the past with him,"" Durbin said. ""This was a shock to us, let's put it that way.""

This was the first time the organization has had any meaningful interaction with the Phoenix Police Department regarding demonstrations.

Kesto declined to be interviewed due to the ongoing legal process.

TheBlaze has left multiple messages with the Phoenix Police Department and is awaiting a response, and has submitted a request for the incident report although the department has said delivery of that report could take up to a month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-post-finally-issues-corrections-on-covington-catholic-story,2019-10-18
Watchdog group claims Fauci has 'handsomely profited’ during the pandemic,"The leader of a government watchdog group is claiming that White House medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci has ""handsomely profited"" during the COVID-19 pandemic.

What are the details?

Adam Andrzejewski, the CEO of OpenTheBooks.com, told Fox News recently that his group has been working tirelessly to obtain financial records for one of the most recognizable and controversial figures to emerge since the start of the pandemic.

Fauci, who also serves as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has long been criticized for allegedly benefitting from the pandemic while many Americans suffered financial loss as a result of the persistent economic shutdowns he supported.

Last year, through a Freedom of Information Act Request, OpenTheBooks.com discovered that Fauci was the highest-paid employee of the federal government, earning a higher salary than even the president of the United States. But Andrzejewski suggested recently that Fauci's salary is only the tip of the iceberg.

""During the pandemic, Dr. Fauci has handsomely profited from his federal employment, royalties, travel perks, and investment gains,"" Andrzejewski asserted.

What else?

Fox News reported that OpenTheBooks.com began filing more FOIA requests for Fauci's records on Jan. 28, 2021, but that the National Institutes of Health has been dragging its feet in fulfilling the requests. It took the department several months to finally send over ""a meager 51 pages of information with redactions.""

That batch of information didn't even include Fauci's current employment agreement or confidentiality and conflict of interest documents, the watchdog group reported, noting the latter could be numerous.

Following more pressure and an official lawsuit filed in October alongside Judicial Watch, the agency ""admitted they were holding 1,200 pages subject to our request,"" Andrzejewski recounted.

""So think about this, we got 51 pages — there were redactions — and there are 1,200 pages,"" Andrzejewski added. ""So they admitted to holding 1,200 pages that were subject to the request and 3,000 pages of line-by-line royalty payments. Every line is a potential conflict of interest and there are up to 1,000 NIH scientists receiving royalty payments. It's legal, but it should be disclosed.""

Due to a reported backlog in FOIA requests, the NIH told OpenTheBooks.com that it is only able to distribute the information 300 pages at a time, once per month. The watchdog said given that rollout, the full release could take up to 14 months.

Anything else?

As a government employee, Fauci's financial disclosures should be readily available to the public upon request, but that has not been the case. Fox News noted the disclosures aren't listed in the same searchable database as many other federal officials.

The lengthy process that OpenTheBooks.com and others have undertaken point to suspicion that Fauci was either being intentionally disingenuous or ignorant when he defiantly claimed in a testy exchange with Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) this month, ""My financial disclosure is public knowledge and has been so for the last 37 years or so.""

""What a moron!"" Fauci muttered about Marshall after the lawmaker pressed him about his finances in a Senate committee hearing.

Days later, Marshall obtained previously unpublished financial disclosures from the National Institutes of Health showing Fauci and his wife have a combined net worth of $10.4 million.

The disclosures also showed that Fauci will make approximately $2.5 million as President Biden's chief medical adviser should he stay for a full four years and highlighted tens of thousands in profits that Fauci has amassed for attending various galas and ceremonies over the past couple of years.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-post-waits-18-months-to-confirm-details-of-hunter-bidens-deals-with-chinese-energy-company,2022-01-19
Watchdog group files ethics complaint against Trump impeachment ringleader Rep. Jamie Raskin,"A conservative watchdog group has filed an ethics complaint against Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin after he failed to properly disclose stock shares that his wife — who was nominated by President Joe Biden to regulate banking at the Federal Reserve — received for advising a Colorado-based financial technology trust company.

The American Accountability Foundation on Monday said in a complaint filed with the Office of Congressional Ethics that the Maryland lawmaker had failed to disclose his wife Sarah Bloom Raskin's ownership of a massive amount of stock and did not report the million-dollar sale of those stocks in the time period required by law.

The complaint was first reported by Fox Business. It cited a Business Insider report that revealed that Jamie Raskin disclosed in August 2021 that his wife Sarah Bloom Raskin sold 195,936 shares of Reserve Trust for $1.5 million, according to his federal financial documents. But Raskin reported the stock sale, which happened on Dec. 12, 2020, eight months after the fact.

According to AAF, Raskin violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge, or STOCK Act, by failing to report his wife's financial gain in time. The law was passed in 2012 and is intended to increase transparency on Capitol Hill by making it illegal for members of Congress or their families to profit by trading stocks with insider knowledge. Under the law, Sarah Bloom Raskin's stock payout should have been reported to Congress within 45 days of the transaction.



""Sarah and Jamie Raskin are career politicians who have used the system to enrich themselves, and it is time that someone holds them accountable,"" AAF founder Tom Jones said in a statement. ""If House rules are going to mean anything, the House Ethics Committee needs to open an investigation and sanction Jamie Raskin for hiding this shady stock deal from the public.""

Raskin, a top House Democrat, is best known for leading the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump. His wife Sarah is Biden's nominee to be vice chairwoman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, the most powerful banking regulator in the government. She previously held positions at the U.S. Treasury and the Fed during the Obama administration.

In a statement to Business Insider, Raskin acknowledged that he turned in his financial disclosure late, explaining that the death of his 25-year-old son Thomas on Dec. 31, 2020, happened just after the stock sale.



""We lost our son during the reporting period, and I filed the report late,"" the lawmaker said.

The AAF complaint recognized the ""tragic loss"" of the Raskin's son, writing that ""any reasonable person would agree that they should be afforded some latitude in meeting filing requirements during that time."" However, the complaint notes that Raskin ""quickly returned to his official duties"" and led the impeachment trial against Trump in January.

""If Representative Raskin was able to perform these official duties during this time, it is reasonable to expect that he should have been able to comply with the Periodic Transaction Report requirements during these times and not frustrate the legitimate ends of Congressional oversight by waiting nine months to disclose the sale,"" the complaint said.

The possible ethics violation is sure to give Republicans ammunition to oppose Sarah Bloom Raskin's nomination to the Fed. GOP lawmakers have already questioned her controversial positions on climate change, which include calling for the Fed to punish banks and financial institutions that have business agreements with fossil-fuel energy companies.

Bloom Raskin has also faced questions about her time with Reserve Trust, joining the company in May 2017 and leaving in August 2019. While she served on Reserve Trust's board, the company received access to the Fed's payment system and was the only non-bank state-chartered trust to do so. The company had previously applied for a master account and was denied in June 2017.

Republicans have questioned whether Bloom Raskin, who served as a Fed governor from 2010 to 2014, persuaded the Fed to give Reserve Trust a master account and then received 200,000 shares of company stock as compensation.

Sarah Bloom Raskin has denied any wrongdoing.

"Watchdog report: Defense Department dropped the ball on US airpower — over past decade, only four of 49 aircraft met mission-capable goals","A new government watchdog report gave a damning review of the U.S. military's aerial mission capability, indicating that only four of 49 aircraft long associated with American air superiority ""met their annual mission capable goal"" in a majority of the years from 2011 through 2021.

Despite the Department of Defense spending tens of billions of dollars annually for a tactical advantage, the report has highlighted a deficit in the health and readiness of the American aircraft fleet at time of increased tensions with both Russia and communist China.

What's in the report?

The Government Accountability Office published a ""Weapon System Sustainment"" report on Nov. 10 — the public version of another report issued in September scrubbed of sensitive information by the DOD.

The GAO examined 49 aircraft and found that only four met their annual mission-capable goal over the past decade.

The mission-capable rate references the ""percentage of total time when an aircraft possessed by a squadron can fly and perform at least one mission.""

The report concluded that ""the average mission capable rate for the selected aircraft has fallen for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, to varying degree."" The average mission-capable rate for select Army aircraft has, however, risen.

A total of 26 aircraft failed to meet their annual mission-capable goal in any fiscal year between 2011 and 2021, including the Air Force's A-10, C-17, CV-22, F-15C/D, and F-22; the Army's AH-64D/E and CH-47F; the Navy's C-130T, C-2A, KC-130T, and MH-60S; and the Marine Corps' AH-1Z, F-35B, F/A-18A-D, and UH-1Y.



In 2021, only two aircraft met their service-established mission-capable goals, and 30 aircraft were ""more than 10 percentage points below the mission capable goal.""

The four aircraft that secured passing grades over the 11-fiscal-year period were the Navy's EP-3E (Aries II reconnaissance plane), the Air Force's B-2 (Spirit stealth bomber), the USAF's RC-135S-W (Cobra Ball reconnaissance plane), and the Army's UH-1N (Twin Huey helicopter).

The Navy's E-6B (Mercury, communications and strategic airborne command post plane) came close, missing the mark by one year.

Source: Government Accountability Office

The GAO indicated that ""a number of sustainment challenges including aging aircraft, maintenance challenges, and supply support issues account for this decrease in mission capable rates.""

The Air Force's F-16, for instance, is showing its age. The aircraft is in routine need of replacement parts that are in short supply or are no longer manufactured. There is also a shortage of trained maintenance personnel to keep the F-16 current and capable.



The operating and support (O&S) costs for the GAO-reviewed aircraft were approximately $54 billion in 2020. Since aging aircraft have required more attention, maintenance costs have increased by $1.2 billion since fiscal year 2011.

O&S costs tend to account for roughly 70% of an aircraft's total life-cycle cost and include the cost of repair parts, field maintenance, engineering support, and personnel.

While Air Force and Army O&S costs have gone down, the Navy and Marine Corps O&S costs have increased. The GAO suggested that ""these trends have largely been driven by changes in the size of aircraft inventory and reduced flying hours.""

Wake-up call

The GAO noted that the DOD under Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III not only failed to meet its goals last year, but that it did so in contravention of DOD policy that ""the military services shall maintain all mission essential systems and equipment to the optimum mission capable status.""

The GAO made clear in a February report that the U.S. faces a significant challenge in the form of an ""increasingly assertive"" communist China, which aims to ""challenge the U.S. military across the spectrum of conventional and unconventional capabilities.""

""Successful preparation for strategic competition with China will depend on continuing efforts to increase U.S. combat credibility and enhance conventional deterrence that can help prevent conflict, protect U.S. interests, and assure allies,"" said the report.

Extra to improving the military's average mission-capable rate, the GAO highlighted other issues the DOD might want to address, including:

supply chain challenges including the F-35's central logistics system;

Navy crew shortfalls;

attack submarine reliability;

cybersecurity;

satellite vulnerabilities;

aging nuclear systems; and

military readiness.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watchdog-claims-fauci-handsomely-profited,2022-11-15
Watchdog firm finds another troubling conflict of interest in Hunter Biden's post at Burisma,"Hunter Biden was paid both as member of the governing board and as a consultant to company management in his post at Burisma Holdings, an arrangement that is prohibited in the United States, an independent research firm reported Tuesday.

Biden also received more than 12 times the comparable pay for board members at similarly sized companies.

The findings come from Watchdog Research and were posted in a RealClearInvestigations report.

According to the report:

The authors, Watchdog Research principles Brian Lawe and John Cheffers, say arrangements such as Hunter Biden's — being a corporate governance monitor while also a paid consultant to company management — are prohibited in the United States. Federal securities law forbids anyone from serving as an independent board member if they ""accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee.""



""Obviously, U.S. law does not apply to a private foreign entity because that company is not subject to federal securities law,"" Lawe and Cheffers write. But, they say, ""by accepting 'consulting' payments AND board compensation, Hunter Biden was potentially breaking a cardinal rule created to promote good governance and stop corruption.""

Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden's son, was hired to the board at Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company, a month after his father was appointed to political advisory responsibilities over Ukraine in March 2014.

Despite Biden having had no experience in the oil and gas industry or in serving on boards of for-profit businesses, the company paid him an uncharacteristically high salary — ""records show 18 months in which two payments of $83,333 per month were paid"" to Hunter Biden's company for ""consulting services,"" according to Reuters.

The payments amount to nearly $1 million per year each for Biden and his business partner and co-Burisma board member Devon Archer.

Watchdog Research, citing a 2017 Harvard study on board compensation, says that the payout amounts to more than 12 times the comparable pay, or more for Biden in a month than board members at similarly-sized companies would be paid in a year.

The Watchdog Research report notes how this puts Hunter Biden between a rock and a hard place: ""If he received the money for consulting, then it would be hard to argue that he was overpaid, but it would be easy to argue that his claims of being an independent director 'focused on governance' are a sham.""

In order to be qualified as an independent director, as Biden claims he was for Burisma, ""the director can have no 'material' relationship with the company prior to serving on the board,"" according to the New York Stock Exchange's guidance.

This appears not to be the case for Biden, as his attorney George Mesires previously said in a statement that Biden was already ""advising Burisma on its corporate reform initiatives"" in his capacity at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner before being asked to join the board.

Also, in that same ABC News interview last month where Biden claimed that his role at Burisma was simply to provide ""corporate governance,"" he also admitted that he would ""probably not"" have been offered the seat on Burisma's board if his father had not been vice president.

The Bidens' involvement with Burisma caught the attention of President Donald Trump, who during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky requested an investigation into the matter.

It was this phone call that led to the House impeachment inquiry against President Trump, proponents of the inquiry claiming that Trump ordering an investigation into his political opponents, and possibly withholding military aid to Ukraine as a quid pro quo, amount to an impeachable offense.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watchdog-group-files-ethics-complaint-against-trump-impeachment-ringleader-rep-jamie-raskin,2019-11-19
White House adviser says he got info from China on Hunter Biden and a $1.5 billion payment from the Bank of China,"Michael Pillsbury, an informal adviser to the White House on China, told the Financial Times that he received ""quite a bit of background"" information from his contacts in the country related to Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, and a $1.5 billion payment from the Bank of China.

Pillsbury would not fully divulge the details of the information he received, but did say he found the Chinese to be extremely secretive and guarded about Hunter Biden's business dealings in China.

""I tried to bring up the topic in Beijing,"" Pillsbury told Fox Business last week. ""I've never seen them get so secretive in my entire life. They would discuss ICBM warheads sooner than talk about what Hunter Biden was doing in China with Vice President Biden.""

While we don't know what exactly Pillsbury allegedly learned from his Chinese contacts, the $1.5 billion amount referenced is the same as the amount President Donald Trump claimed Hunter Biden received from the Bank of China, although that claim was not backed up with evidence.

Pillsbury would not say whether he was asked by President Trump to ask about the Bidens in China. He later denied that he told FT he received info on the Bidens, but the reporter, Demetri Sevastopulo, shared an email confirming the report.

Biden has dismissed all accusations of wrongdoing in China and in Ukraine as ""flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears"" that the president is using to ""undermine my candidacy for the presidency.""



President Trump and his allies have been working to highlight alleged conflicts of interest and corruption by Joe and Hunter Biden in Ukraine, where Hunter was paid $50,000 per month as a board member for the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma. Trump allies have also claimed that Biden's corruption extends past Ukraine to other countries, including China and Romania.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watchdog-report-dod-airpower,2019-10-10
Ethical concerns at the White House: Partner of Biden's new press secretary is CNN correspondent Suzanne Malveaux – conflict-of-interest allegations emerge,"Ethical questions are being volleyed after details surfaced that the new White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, is in a serious relationship with CNN national correspondent Suzanne Malveaux, a possible conflict of interest.

Current White House press secretary Jen Psaki is set to leave her position on May 13.

There were already ethical concerns regarding Biden's White House after an Axios report claimed that Psaki was negotiating a deal with potentially two major cable TV networks to host a show at the same time as being the press secretary for President Joe Biden. Psaki reached a deal to host a show on NBCUniversal's streaming platform Peacock and join MSNBC as a pundit for political commentary during live cable news shows, according to NPR.

Psaki's departure after almost 18 months in the role opened the door for Jean-Pierre to be President Biden's new mouthpiece. On Thursday, Jean-Pierre was named as Psaki's successor – which presented a new possible conflict of interest.

Jean-Pierre, 44, is in a longtime relationship with CNN national correspondent Suzanne Malveaux, 55. The couple live together and are parents of a 7-year-old daughter.

In their coverage of the new White House press secretary, CNN mentioned, ""Jean-Pierre's family includes her partner, CNN national correspondent Suzanne Malveaux, and their daughter."" However, CNN focused on Jean-Pierre's race and sexuality by running with the headline: ""Karine Jean-Pierre to become White House press secretary, the first Black and out LGBTQ person in the role.""

CNN opened its article by saying, ""Karine Jean-Pierre will become the new White House press secretary when Jen Psaki departs her role next week, President Joe Biden announced in a statement Thursday, becoming the first Black and out LGBTQ person to hold the position.""

Jean-Pierre previously worked for NBC and MSNBC.

USA Today reported, ""Prior to joining the White House, Jean-Pierre worked as chief public affairs officer for MoveOn.org and as an NBC and MSNBC political analyst. She was regional political director for the White House Office of Political Affairs during the Obama-Biden administration and deputy battleground states director for President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.""

Malveaux's biography on the CNN website states, ""Award-winning journalist Suzanne Malveaux serves as the network's national correspondent, covering national and international news and cultural events. Previously, she co-anchored CNN's Around The World and co-anchored the network's Emmy-winning coverage of the revolution in Egypt and the network's Peabody Award-winning coverage of the Arab Spring.""

Malveaux was also a White House correspondent for more than a decade – covering Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.

Mediaite contributor Juwan Holmes expressed some concerns about the conflict of interest.

""One thing of interest for media coverage: Jean-Pierre’s wife is Suzanne Malveaux, who is a CNN anchor sub (formerly a WH Correspondent),"" Holmes wrote on Twitter. ""I'm sure there won’t be Cuomo-level conflict of interest violations but expect it to have it bought up in the future.""



CNN dismissed the accusations of a conflict of interest.

""Suzanne Malveaux will continue in her role as CNN National Correspondent covering national/international news and cultural events but will not cover politics, Capitol Hill, or the White House while Karine Jean-Pierre is serving as White House Press Secretary,"" CNN told the Daily Caller.

CNN was recently involved in another ethical debacle, as its former anchor Chris Cuomo assisted his brother – former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

CNN confessed that its prime-time anchor engaged in ""inappropriate"" conversations with staff members of the disgraced ex-governor.

CNN fired Cuomo in December after ""new information that came to light about his involvement with his brother's defense"" of several scandals – including multiple allegations of sexual harassment.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watchdog-troubling-conflict-biden-burisma,2022-05-06
"White House briefing on Ukraine invasion to TikTok influencers, claims Russia hacked 2016 election","The White House welcomed popular personalities from the Chinese social media platform TikTok to deliver a briefing on the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the influencers. During the briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki pushed a claim that the 2016 election was ""hacked"" by Russians.

The White House spoke to 30 ""top TikTok stars"" on a Zoom call on Thursday, according to the Washington Post.

The White House has been closely watching TikTok's rise as a dominant news source, leading to its decision to approach a select group of the platform's most influential names. This week, the administration began working with Gen Z For Change, a nonprofit advocacy group, to help identify top content creators on the platform to orchestrate a briefing aimed at answering questions about the conflict and the United States' role in it.

Psaki told the influencers, ""Thank you all for everything you're doing. I mean, use of your platforms to educate, to inform, to debunk, to demystify, during what is a very tumultuous, heartbreaking time in the world is remarkable, and we recognize and value all of your platforms.""

The platform the influencers use is the Beijing-based short-form video app TikTok – which has been scrutinized for potentially having security risks. The Department of Defense stated that the social media app features ""potential security risks associated with its use."" In 2020, the U.S. Army, and Navy prohibited TikTok from being used on government-issued phones. Last July, the massively popular social media app gave itself permission to collect biometric data of U.S. users – which includes faceprints and voiceprints.

Jules Suzdaltsev – a TikTok personality who was born in Ukraine – claimed the officials at the meeting dodged hard questions and said, ""The energy of the call felt like a press briefing for kindergarteners.""

One of the influencers at the briefing on the war in Ukraine is Ellie Zeiler – an 18-year-old with over 10.5 million followers on TikTok where she typically does dances and makeup tutorials.

""I’m here to relay the information in a more digestible manner to my followers,"" Zeiler told the Washington Post. ""I would consider myself a White House correspondent for Gen Z.""

During the call with the TikTok influencers, Psaki claimed that Russia ""hacked"" the 2016 election in which Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.

""If you look back at 2014, and frankly even 2016, when Russia invaded Ukraine and then in 2016, when they, you know, of course, hacked our election here, we did not do that, we did not declassify information,"" Psaki told the group of TikTok stars.

Fox News notes, ""While Russian hackers were behind the stealing of emails from Democratic officials like John Podesta, there is no evidence that they tampered with election results as part of the 2016 hacking spree.""

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence investigated possible Russian influence on the 2016 election and released a report in 2017.

""We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,"" the DNI investigation found.

""Russian intelligence accessed elements of multiple state or local electoral boards,"" the report stated. ""Since early 2014, Russian intelligence has researched US electoral processes and related technology and equipment.""

""DHS assesses that the types of systems we observed Russian actors targeting or compromising are not involved in vote tallying,"" the report declared.

Coincidentally, Russia is also using high-profile TikTok influencers to push its narrative regarding the invasion of Ukraine, according to a report from Vice News.

The outlet reports that there is a ""coordinated campaign to pay Russian TikTok influencers to post videos pushing pro-Kremlin narratives about the war in Ukraine."" Vice News also claims that there is a secret Telegram channel run by the Russian government that ""gave potential contributors a step-by-step guide on how to circumvent TikTok's ban on uploads from Russian accounts.""

This isn't the first time the Biden administration has turned to TikTok influencers.

In December, President Joe Biden appeared in a TikTok video with the Jonas Brothers to promote Americans getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The video was widely panned as being ""cringe.""

Last August, the White House enlisted ""Gen Z"" social media influencer Benny Drama to be Psaki's ""intern"" to help spread awareness about COVID-19 vaccines with a viral TikTok video.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-adviser-hunter-biden-bank-of-china,2022-03-12
Anti-racist teacher stopped teaching Spanish because white supremacy,"A white teacher proclaimed that she is ""dismantling white supremacy in society"" by not teaching Spanish to her students. The anti-racist teacher proclaimed that she is holding herself accountable for her skin color by grappling with her own ""internalized white supremacy.""

Jessica Bridges is a Ph.D. candidate at the College of Education and Human Sciences at Oklahoma State University. She made ""anti-racism and white women's complicity"" her dissertation topic.



Bridges spoke at Southern Connecticut State University's Virtual Women's and Gender Studies Conference, a two-day event in late April that focused on ""Gender, Race, Community & Conflict: Pursuing Peace and Justice."" The conference included presentations such as ""Diverging Feminisms: Engaging Transnational/Translational Activism,"" ""Sex, Work, & Care as Resistance in the Age of Capitalism,"" ""Undoing the White Settler-Colonial Gaze: Asserting Gendered, Racialized, and Radicalized Body Autonomy,"" ""Understanding Your Vicarious Trauma during COVID-19 and Beyond,"" and ""Igniting Social Justice, Community Engagement, and Diversity within the Neoliberal Academy.""

Bridges spoke during the ""White Accountability & Anti-Racist Education"" presentation.

The meeting started off with a ""land acknowledgment,"" which is a ""formal statement that recognizes and respects Indigenous Peoples as traditional stewards of this land and the enduring relationship that exists between Indigenous Peoples and their traditional territories,"" according to Northwestern University.



""Dismantling white supremacy in society looks like dismantling in my heart, first,"" Bridges said, as reported by the Post Millennial. ""It means I'm not going to teach Spanish. Accountability is ongoing because there is not end to the process.""

It should be noted that the Spanish language came from Europe. It was a mix of Latin language and local languages of the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula, including Celts and Iberians, according to Lingvist.

""Learning Spanish from a white woman? I wish I could go back and tell my students not to learn power or correctness from this white woman,"" she said of herself. ""I would tell them to stand in their own power. White isn't right.""



Bridges continued, ""Racism originates with, and is perpetuated by white people.""

""We're deconstructing our emotions around acknowledging our whiteness and white privilege through the lens of grief and the process of grief,"" Bridges declared. ""I have been complicit as a part of the educational system and as a white woman benefitting from white privilege.""

""We talked about mourning our white morality. I'm holding myself accountable to this journey,"" Bridges added. ""Part of my accountability is to continue to struggle and grapple with my internalized white supremacy.""

Bridges said that as a K-12 teacher, she has been ""embedded in a system that some scholars have identified as reproducing social injustice. Consciously, or unconsciously.""

Bridges pledged to be a ""white ally"" and ""anti-racist coconspirator.""

Also during the critical race theory-themed session, a Southern Connecticut State University professor said schools need to ""attract anti-racist teachers,"" who ""teach through an equity, anti-racist lens."" She also claims that test scores shouldn't be the barometer of ""good schools,"" but instead quality learning institutions are measured by the ""perspective of teachers being engaged in communities.""

White Univ. of Wisconsin grad student resigns from teaching position after lying about being black,"CV Vitolo-Haddad, a white University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate student, has resigned from a teaching assistant position after being caught pretending to be a black person, according to reports.

Following allegations, Vitolo-Haddad admitted she is not black or Latino. She is in fact, a white Italian American. After the revelation of racial misrepresentation, Vitolo-Haddad stepped down from her teaching assistant position. She also resigned as co-president of UW-Madison's chapter Teaching Assistants' Association.

A Medium post from an anonymous person made allegations that Vitolo-Haddad pretended to be a person of color. The motivation for the post came from the recent news about Jessica A. Krug, a white history professor at George Washington University specializing in African studies who ""canceled"" herself earlier this month after admitting that she lied about being black. The school is now offering counseling to students impacted by Krug's racial dishonesty.

""When the Jessica A. Krug story came out yesterday I was shocked, but not by the extent of her deception. What caught my attention, instead, were the parallels between her story and that of someone I know,"" the Medium post said. ""I have long suspected CV Vitolo, a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, of engaging in the same kind of race-shifting and copious lying that now has people enraged with Krug (and which distracts from the important work and struggles of actual Black thinkers, both in and outside of the academy).""



""I first met CV around four years ago, when they joined the Department of Communication Arts at UW Madison where I, as an affiliate of the university, had many friends,"" the anonymous claim reads. ""They were quick to call themselves a 'person of color,' intimating that perhaps we even shared some heritage.""



The Medium entry shared social media posts from Vitolo-Haddad, claiming that she ""heavily implied that they were Latinx"" and was a victim of racism.

""Though their claim to a POC identity was vague, the one consistency was their insistence that they were a constant target of acts of racism and that they came from some kind of nonwhite background,"" the post said.



""According to the post, Vitolo-Haddad's last name, Haddad, was 'appropriated' from a previous marriage, and Vitolo-Haddad grew up in a wealthy Italian family in Florida,"" the Badger Herald reported.

There is also an 11-page document ""compiled and researched by a collective of Madison academics and activists who have had a variety of personal experience with CV."" The document detailed Vitolo-Haddad's actions while at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, including her alleged ""racial misrepresentation.""

Vitolo-Haddad wrote an apology in a Medium post on Sept. 6, the New York Post reported.

""I am so deeply sorry for the ways you are hurting right now because of me,"" Vitolo-Haddad wrote in the post. ""You have expressed confusion, shock, betrayal, anger, and mistrust. All of those things are a consequence of how I have navigated our relationships and the spaces we share.""

""I have let guesses about my ancestry become answers I wanted but couldn't prove,"" Vitolo-Haddad wrote. ""I have let people make assumptions when I should have corrected them.""

""The first step towards that, however, is to resign my position as co-president of the Teaching Assistants' Association (TAA),"" Vitolo-Haddad continued. ""Second, I have resigned from my teaching position at UW-Madison.""

""Education is build on a foundation of trust and accountability, and until I repair that I should not be teaching,"" said Vitolo-Haddad, who worked at UW-Madison's School of Journalism and Mass Communication.

Vitolo-Haddad penned a second apology on Medium on Sept. 8 where she claimed that her ""parents have conflicting stories"" about their ancestry.

""First, I am deeply sorry and regretful to the people I deceived by inserting myself into Black organizing spaces I didn't belong in,"" the post stated. ""That deception was parasitic and harmful.""

""What I know is that I am Southern Italian/Sicilian,"" Vitolo-Haddad stated. ""In trying to make sense of my experiences with race, I grossly misstepped. I went along with however people saw me. I over-identified with unreliable and unproven family history and latched onto anything I remembered growing up.""

""When asked if I identify as Black, my answer should have always been 'No,'"" Vitolo-Haddad said. ""I should have never entered Black organizing spaces. They are not my place. Once realizing this, it wasn't sufficient to just leave; I should have explained that directly to the people who invited me and clarified my identity.""

""I want to apologize for ever taking lies about Cuban roots at face value, and for subsequently attaching myself to people's perceptions of me as though it would provide answers where there are none,"" Vitolo-Haddad added. ""Additionally, I want to apologize for how my failure to own up to these harmful decisions publicly made every conversation on social media about the varied ways I've been racialized a source of confusion and deception.""

""What I know now is that perception is not reality. Race is not flat, it is a social construct rife with contradictions,"" Vitolo-Haddad wrote. ""Fighting racism never required dissociating myself from whiteness. In fact, it derailed the cause by centering my experience.""



The TAA condemned Vitolo-Haddad in a statement. ""We condemn CV Vitolo-Haddad's appropriation of Black and Brown identities in no uncertain terms … we recognize that our union is the product of a labor movement infused with white supremacy and anti-Blackness,"" the TAA said.

The TAA accused Vitolo-Haddad of ""manipulating and gaslighting Black and Brown community members who tried holding them accountable."" The TAA apologized for ""unknowingly rewarded the toxic opportunism of performing Blackness.""

UW-Madison spokeswoman Meredith McGlone confirmed that Vitolo-Haddad no longer works at the university.

""UW-Madison expects that people represent themselves authentically and accurately in all aspects of their academic work,"" McGlone told the The Daily Cardinal.



California State University, Fresno, recently offered a tenure-track job to Vitolo-Haddad for the fall 2021 semester, but is reconsidering after the recent allegations of racial fraud.

""The Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs is aware of the concerns regarding CV Vitolo-Haddad that have been appearing online,"" the school said in a statement released on Sept. 14.

WHO announces new COVID-19 origins investigative team,"The World Health Organization announced on Wednesday the proposed members of a new team to study the origins of the COVID-19 virus.

Of the more than 700 applicants who were considered, 26 scientists were selected to work on the WHO Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens with expertise in fields including epidemiology, animal health, ecology, clinical medicine, virology, genomics, molecular epidemiology, molecular biology, biology, food safety, biosafety, biosecurity, and public health.

The WHO touted in its press statement that ""the composition of the SAGO reflects geographic and gender diversity.""

""The emergence of new viruses with the potential to spark epidemics and pandemics is a fact of nature, and while SARS-CoV-2 is the latest such virus, it will not be the last,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

""Understanding where new pathogens come from is essential for preventing future outbreaks with epidemic and pandemic potential, and requires a broad range of expertise. We are very pleased with the calibre of experts selected for SAGO from around the world, and look forward to working with them to make the world safer,"" he added.

The SAGO will be the second team put together by the WHO to investigate the origins of COVID-19 after the first team published a widely criticized report earlier this year that determined that natural spillover was the most likely origin of the virus. The report also said an alternative hypothesis that COVID-19 was somehow leaked from a Chinese lab was""very unlikely.""

Critics said first team's effort was hampered by interference from the Chinese government and also poisoned by conflicts of interest, notably the inclusion of EcoHealth Alliance president Peter Daszak on the team. Daszak's organization had for years funded bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology — the lab at the center of the lab-leak theory. He and other prominent public health scientists had also worked behind the scenes to discredit the lab-leak theory, even though scientific evidence suggests both hypotheses remain viable, as a U.S. intelligence report commissioned by President Joe Biden earlier this year found.

The widespread criticism and calls for a new investigation prompted the WHO to establish this new team, which will be a more permanent body meant to avoid politicization in future pandemics, the New York Times reported.

""Especially in light of the politicization of this particular aspect, we want to take this back to the science, take this back to our mandate as an organization to bring together the world's best minds to outline what needs to be done,"" Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's Covid-19 technical lead, said in an interview with the Times.



However, at least six proposed members of the SAGO were members of the WHO's first criticized investigative team: Marion Koopmans, John Watson, Thea Fischer, Hung Nguyen, Vladimir Dedkov, and Farag El Moubasher.

Additionally, Koopmans and another proposed member, Christian Drosten, were participants on a secretive teleconference held in February 2020 with White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, Daszak, and others involved in efforts to discredit the lab-leak theory. Before this call, some of the world's top virologists who had participated had raised concerns that the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus had features that ""(potentially) look engineered.""

But after the call, several of those scientists reversed their opinions and publicly condemned the COVID-19 lab-leak theory as a conspiracy theory.

Drosten, who is Germany's leading COVID-19 expert, is noteworthy for sitting on the editorial board of Emerging Microbes and Infections, a scientific journal that on Feb. 26, 2020, published an influential article claiming there was ""No credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of SARS-CoV-2.""

Between the time the article was drafted and the time it was published, the article's authors privately expressed doubts to each other about its conclusions, even as EMI expedited publication of the commentary and waived customary publication fees.

Those concerns were never disclosed before the article was published and only came to light because of records requests from U.S. Right to Know.

The inclusion of Koopmans and Drosten on the new team may undermine the WHO's effort to de-politicize the investigation of COVID-19's origins.

Over the next two weeks, the WHO will consult the public for feedback on the proposed SAGO members before announcing the final membership of the team.

Public comments must be submitted to SAGO@who.int with subject, ""Public comments on SAGO members"" by October 27, 2021.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-teacher-anti-racist-spanish-teaching,2021-10-14
Why did Dianne Feinstein secretly meet with Iranian official amid flaring tensions?,"The United States sent a carrier strike group to the Middle East to send an ""unmistakable message"" to Iran early this month. That message was made even more crystal just a few weeks later when President Trump issued a blunt threat never to mess with the US.

Tensions, in other words, have been extremely elevated, and the stakes incredibly high. Personnel have been called back. Assets have been moved. Footing, as they say, shifted.

While all that was going on between the people whose job it is to do such things and the country toward home that posture was taken, Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein caught a bite to eat with an Iranian Foreign Minister and it took Politico to bring it to light. In a pretty amazing way.

It started with an exposed iPhone screen. Here's what Politico wrote:

SPOTTED: SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-Calif.), who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, walking around the Capitol with her iPhone screen facing outward in full view, and Javad Zarif's contact page on the screen. Zarif is the name of Iran's foreign minister.

After seeing Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif's name on her screen, they asked about it.

That's called good reporting.

They spoke to Feinstein communications director Tom Mentzer, who told them he ""can't comment on who the senator does or doesn't speak with.""

Later, they got a statement from her office: ""War isn't necessary to solve a problem when both sides want a solution. I urge Secretary Pompeo to reach out to Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who I know doesn't want to see a conflict with the United States.""

That's called confirmation. On Saturday, more confirmation came when a spokesperson for the Iranian Mission to the UN confirmed from their side. ""The meeting took place as our routine meetings with members of Congress,"" Alireza Mir Yousefi said in a report from Iran's state news.

Feinstein's office also said that the dinner was arranged ""in consultation with the State Department."" Except the State Department says that is not so.

A State Department official told us that they did not ask Feinstein to go to the dinner with Zarif, a smooth-talking, American-educated Iranian diplomat who worked on the nuclear deal with John Kerry.



Well isn't that curious.

And what's more, as the New York Post points out, it's not just that a Senator met with a hostile foreign power's representative without coordinating it through the State Department or the administration in the White House, it's not even just the fact that this particular diplomat worked closely with the previous administration on a deal that is no longer on the table.

It's that the particular Senator happens to be a leading voice in reinstuting that deal, and who publicly blames this administration, and by extension official U.S. policy, for the current state of tension. Not blaming, in other words, the threat against Americans in Iraq or the sponsoring of terror against our ally Israel. No, blaming us.

Oh also the fact that this foreign minister she had tea and crumpets and negotiations pie with happens have just ""warned"" the United States not to send more troops to the region.

At Politico, no Trump administration fans there, they said in a perhaps understated way that it's ""a bit unusual that Feinstein, the former chair and vice chair of the Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senate minority, is dining with the foreign minister of an adversary.""

Yes. That is unusual. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said when asked about it that ""it's unusual, and more importantly, it's wrong."" He was referring specifically to Feinstein, as well as to John Kerry and others involved in the old Iran Deal who continue to meet with representatives of Iran on their own and outside of the structure of our government and the way foreign policy is crafted and conducted.

""They had their day, it's time to get off the stage,"" said Pompeo. ""These acts border — we all know the Logan Act — we all know the risks that is taken when people act as private citizens on behalf of the United States government.""

The Logan Act forbids unauthorized persons from having private meetings like this, essentially negotiating with hostile foreign governments or governments with which there is a dispute, on behalf of the United States. It was enacted in 1799 and has never been invoked to prosecute anyone.

The U.S. is sending an additional 1,500 troops to the region, and there have been reports that they Pentagon is looking at sending up to 10,000.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-wisconsin-madison-student-resigns-black,2019-05-25
Wife of Russian prisoner and WNBA star Brittney Griner speaks out as fears grow that Putin will use the former Olympian as a 'high-profile hostage',"The wife of WNBA star and Russian captive Brittney Griner says that she and Griner's team are tirelessly working to get the basketball star home after the celebrated Olympian was detained at a Russian airport at least three weeks ago for reportedly having a cannabis-filled vape pen on her person.

The longer Griner spends incarcerated in Russia, the longer fears continue to grow over the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin will use the WNBA star as a ""high-profile hostage,"" the Daily Mail reported on Sunday.

What are the details?

Wife Cherelle Griner on Saturday night shared an update on Instagram, writing, ""I love my wife wholeheartedly, so this message comes during one of the weakest moments of my life. I understand that many of you have grown to love BG over the years and have concerns and want details. Please honor our privacy as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.""

""Your prayers, and support,"" she added, ""are greatly appreciated.""

According to the report, Eveyln Farkas, former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia and Ukraine, said that she fears Russia may use Griner as a ""high-profile hostage,"" and noted that if the U.S. wants Griner out of jail, ""Russia is going to have some terms.""

""It could be a prisoner swap,"" she added. ""They could also use it as an implicit threat or blackmail to get us to do something or not do something. Either way, they find it useful.""

What else?

Griner's agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, told the outlet that the basketball star's team is in ""close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her fears, and the WNBA and NBA.""

""As this is an ongoing legal matter, we are not able to comment further on the specifics of her case but can confirm that as we work to get her home, her mental and physical health remain our primary concern,"" Colas added in the statement.

During a Saturday press conference, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said that she is working hard to return Griner to the U.S.



""Brittney Griner is a United States citizen, she was a guest in Russia ... and I will be demanding her release,"" she said. ""I don't want to disregard a sovereign nation, but Putin has disregarded sovereign nations his entire service in this world and anyone that is killing and attacking and destroying Ukraine, their neighboring country — that does not bother them has no right to hold Ms. Griner. Period. If there is challenges and concerns about her actions, it should be dealt with diplomatically and she should be released.""

She continued, ""I believe that at this time, in the midst of war, how dangerous being Moscow, how dangerous it is to be in Moscow prisons ... it is no place for her. I would call upon Russia at this time to really stop harassing U.S. citizens, but more importantly to release those that are there and to not claim any upper hand or any sense of character in the pillage of murder and terroristic actions against the Ukrainians.""

A timeline

The Daily Mail reported that Griner played for UMMC Ekaterinburg in Russia before the WNBA took a two-week hiatus in early February for the FIBA World Cup qualifying tournaments. Griner was said to have ""made her last communication"" in posting a photo to Instagram on Feb. 5.

On Feb. 11, President Joe Biden called on all Americans to evacuate the region. It is believed she was taken into custody around that time, and by Feb. 24, Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.

On March 5, the Russian Federal Customs Service announced that it detained a ""two-time Olympic basketball champion"" on suspicion of drugs.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/who-announces-new-covid-19-origins-investigative-team,2022-03-06
"Wikipedia discovers undisclosed paid editing scheme, bans the firm and mass-deletes articles","Wikipedia has banned a firm called WikiProfessionals Inc. and mass-deleted articles after it was revealed that the firm was involved in an undisclosed paid editing scheme on the online encyclopedia, Breitbart reported Tuesday.

What are the details?

Wikipedia reportedly first learned about the scheme after an editor, ""The creeper2007,"" divulged that a WikiProfessionals representative had admitted to paying editors to write articles without disclosure during a live chat. Wikipedia subsequently launched an investigation and discovered some troubling connections between the firm and editors who created promotional content on the site.

One such account, ""HappyKatsu,"" was linked to the firm after it created an article on video game developer, Neil Young, who is listed on a WikiProfessionals portfolio page on the firm's website.

According to Breitbart, ""'HappyKatsu' has created a dozen articles about various video game executives, such as a former CEO of THQ and variousexecutivesfrom Zynga, known for being behind various popular Facebook games. Alleged Wikipedia articles from the paid editing included ones on the creators of such ubiquitous titles as Words with Friends and Farmville.""

Other names from the portfolio appeared to have been created by Wikipedia burner accounts and showed signs of promotional editing, though not all did.

A slogan displayed on WikiProfessionals' website reads: ""You cannot afford to leave your Wikipedia page to strangers.""

In consequence of the investigation, Wikipedia editors initiated a discussion about banning the firm and any editors involved and potentially banning all pages suspected of being created by the firm. In the end, there was determined to be a consensus around site-banning the firm and any individuals involved with it, as well as deleting all pages suspected of being created by the firm or associates.

The final decision did note, however, that ""if any editor in good standing believes that a given article is appropriate and can be salvaged, it should be restored to draft for them.""

What else?

Blaze Media's Wikipedia article was listed as an article suspected of being created by the firm, despite no signs of promotional editing.

Here's more from the Breitbart report:

One article listed in the discussion and proposed for deletion is an article on conservative media outlet Blaze Media, founded by Glenn Beck. Despite the listing, evidence suggests the editor who created the page was not engaged in promotional paid editing. Editing since 2006, the editor who created Blaze Media's page had a long history of smearing conservatives including Beck and Rush Limbaugh.



These edits included numerousones attacking or mocking Beck's 2010 Restoring Honor Rally, such as noting the crowd was mostly white. The rally came several days before Beck announced creation of the Blaze and the page on the outlet was created by the editor that day following news coverage. Such history is suggestive of the editor creating the page as part of an anti-conservative agenda rather than paid editing. Having retired from editing in 2011, the editor has not commented on the paid editing discussion.

As of early Tuesday evening, the article was live on the site.

Anything else?

While ""disclosed"" paid editing is allowed under Wikipedia's rules, ""undisclosed"" paid editing such as the kind WikiProfessionals was allegedly involved in is not. It violates the company's Terms of Use and often more obviously violates Wikipedia's ""Conflict of Interest"" policy.

Conflict of interest editing can contain biases and that is why any ""paid editors are expected to disclose it whenever they seek to change an affected article's content,"" according to the policy.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/who-coronavirus-tweet-china-transmission,2020-07-21
Withdrawal of US troops from Syria begins,"The U.S.-led military coalition has begun withdrawing troops from Syria, a U.S. defense official confirmed Friday.

The U.S. has started ""the process of our deliberate withdrawal from Syria,"" Col. Sean Ryan, a spokesman for the coalition fighting the Islamic State group, told the Associated Press without further elaboration.

""Out of concern for operational security, we will not discuss specific timelines, locations or troops movements,"" Ryan said in a statement to the AP.

The withdrawal follows the drawdown ordered by President Donald Trump after he proclaimed the defeat of ISIS in a tweet Dec. 19. Trump's decision drew intense criticism that the U.S. was abandoning its local Kurdish allies and led to the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis and Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy for the global coalition to counter ISIS.

About 2,000 U.S. troops are in Syria.

When did the withdrawal start?

About 10 armored vehicles in addition to some engineering machines pulled out of Rmeilan, Syria, Thursday night headed for Iraq, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the Syrian conflict.

The withdrawal comes amid a escalating tensions between the Syrian Kurds and the Turkish government, which has promised an imminent attack.

Earlier this week, Trump tweeted, ""we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!""





The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria. No different from my original statements, we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!.....

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2019





What else?

National security adviser John Bolton said Sunday that U.S. troops would not leave the region until ISIS is defeated and the Kurdish allied fighters are protected.

"GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik gets witnesses to admit Hunter Biden's Burisma post spelled 'conflict of interest,' argues he should testify","During the public impeachment hearing Tuesday, National Security Council adviser Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and his counterpart for Vice President Mike Pence, Jennifer Williams, agreed that Hunter Biden's post at Burisma had the ""appearance of conflict of interest"" after Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) pressed the issue.

House Intel Chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) had recently blocked GOP efforts to call Hunter Biden to testify before Congress despite his apparent conflict of interest as a board member of the politically corrupt Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma.

Stefanik was probing the issue Tuesday, citing the witnesses' closed-door testimonies in which both Vindman and Williams described anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine as a key aspect of the United States' policy toward the eastern European nation.

Stefanik directed the focus toward Burisma, pointing out that in 2014 during the Obama administration the first anti-corruption investigation partnered between the U.S., the U.K., and Ukraine was into Burisma's owner.



""Lt. Col. Vindman, you testified that you were aware that Burisma had questionable business practices, that's part of its track record,"" Stefanik continued with confirmation from Vindman, before moving on to Hunter Biden's involvement on the board of governance for Burisma, of which Vindman acknowledged he was aware.

""I know my constituents in NY-21 have many concerns about the fact that Hunter Biden, the son of [former Vice President Joe Biden] sat on the board of a corrupt company like Burisma,"" Stefanik noted. ""The Obama administration State Department was also concerned.""

""Yet Adam Schiff refuses to allow this committee to call Hunter Biden despite our requests,"" Stefanik stated.

""Do you believe that Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma has the potential for the appearance of a conflict of interest?"" Stefanik asked both witnesses. Both responded, ""yes.""

Stefanik noted that every witness who has testified and has been asked that question has answered affirmatively.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wife-of-russian-prisoner-and-wnba-star-brittney-griner-pleads-for-russia-to-return-star-home-as-fears-grow-that-putin-will-use-her-as-a-high-profile-hostage,2019-11-19
"Air Force Academy teaches diversity, inclusion to cadets","The United States Air Force Academy is teaching cadets to embrace an ""inclusive climate"" that includes ""all genders."" The guidance focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion calls for cadets to utilize ""inclusive language"" that bars words like ""terrorist,"" ""mom,"" and ""dad.""

According to Fox News, the presentation for the seminar that began last September at the Air Force Academy in Colorado is titled: ""Diversity & Inclusion: What It Is, Why We Care, & What We Can Do.""

The course concentrates on diversity, inclusion, stereotypes, bias, and microaggressions. The seminar tells cadets to ask themselves, ""What can I do to foster inclusion?""

The presentation states: ""DEI conversations are often not easy; we will navigate the discomfort together.""

""A diverse and inclusive force is a warfighting imperative,"" the presentation declares.

The Air Force Academy defines diversity as ""protected categories,"" such as ""race, ethnicity, nationality, color, religion (or lack thereof), sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy status.""

One of the exercises asks cadets to list as many animals that start with the letter ""G.""

According to the Washington Free Beacon, cadets are asked, ""How many G-Animals did you generate as an individual? How many G-Animals did your class/squadron generate? What does this activity show us about the power of combining our diverse perspectives?""

The U.S. Air Force Academy instructs cadets to only use ""person-centered"" language and words that ""include all genders."" The presentation urges cadets not to use gendered terms such as ""mom,"" ""dad,"" ""girlfriend,"" and ""boyfriend.""

Ironically, the online store for the brick and mortar gift shop located at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs sells ""Air Force Academy Dad,"" ""Air Force Academy Mom,"" ""Air Force Grandma,"" and ""Air Force Grandpa"" merchandise such as hats, shirts, stickers, and mugs.

The academy tells cadets to use ""transgender people/service members"" instead of ""transgendered.""

The military training curriculum states, ""Not The ‘N’, ‘R’, or ‘F’ words, nor ‘Terrorist’ (for nationality; it happened).""

At the end of the presentation, cadets are offered additional diversity and inclusion resources such as the ""D&I Reading Room,"" ""D&I Cadet Positions,"" and ""USAFA Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Strategic Plan 2021.""

An Air Force Academy spokesman told the Washington Free Beacon, ""As part of the Diversity & Inclusion Cadet Leadership Program, this conversation was developed by cadet leaders and USAFA staff to introduce all cadets to Department of the Air Force definitions of diversity and inclusion, as well as how these concepts enhance our warfighting effectiveness.""

""USAFA develops leaders of character that can lead diverse teams of Airmen and Guardians inclusively, to enhance innovation and win future conflict,"" the spokesperson continued. ""It is the diversity of Airmen and Guardians coming from all corners of our nation who perform the Department of the Air Force’s hundreds of critical mission sets that make us the best, most innovative Air and Space Forces the world has ever known.""

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told Fox News, ""Young kids don't join the military to learn how to use the right pronouns. They join the military to learn how to kill the bad guys and defend this country.""

""And if the Biden administration wants to know why recruiting numbers have collapsed, why we have a recruiting crisis, they just need to look at their own policies,"" Cotton proclaimed. ""The recruiting crisis is very dangerous for our country, and it will be dangerous for many years to come if we don't turn it around quickly.""

He continued to bash the woke agenda, ""We need to turn the page at the Pentagon and make it clear to America's young men and women that we want them to join the military because we want them to defend this country, not go to social justice training seminars.""

Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) – a Green Beret and Afghan War veteran – told Fox News, ""Now we're instructing every cadet entering the Air Force to not say mom and dad, to not say boyfriend or girlfriend, and this kind of drive towards gender neutrality. I think the Air Force should be worried about the macroaggressions against America that are happening all over the world.""

The Air Force Academy has reportedly seen applications drop this year by 28% compared to 2021. Officials believe the steep decline is because in-person recruiting has been limited during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Last month, the Department of the U.S. Air Force announced new demographic goals to make the aerial branch of the United States Armed Forces more diverse.

Military.com reported that the Air Force wants to have applications to be 67.5% white, 13% black, 10% Asian, 7.5% multi-racial, 1.5% American Indian and 1% Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander. There is also an ""ethnicity"" goal of 15% Hispanic applications and 36% of all applicants be female.

In 2014, the Air Force had an application pool goal of 80% white, 10% Black, 8% Asian, 1% American Indian and 1% Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wikipedia-undisclosed-paid-editing-scheme,2022-09-22
"Woke hockey reporter suggests NHL player who refused to wear LGBTQ colors should return to Russia, fight Ukraine: 'Go back where you feel more comfortable'","E.J. Hradek, senior reporter for the NHL Network, suggested during a Wednesday broadcast that Philadelphia Flyers player Ivan Provorov should return to Russia and even fight Ukraine after refusing to wear LGBTQ colors during a pregame warm-up this week for religious reasons.

What's the background?

Provorov declined to skate before Tuesday's ""Pride Night"" game since his teammates were wearing rainbow colors for their warm-up, ESPN reported. The 26-year-old defenseman told reporters after the Flyers' 5-2 home win over the Anaheim Ducks that he intended ""to stay true to myself and my religion,"" the sports network said.

""I respect everyone,"" he told reporters, adding that he's Russian Orthodox. ""I respect everybody's choices.""

What did Hradek have to say about Provorov?

During an ""NHL Now!"" broadcast, Hradek had a few ideas about what Provorov could do if he doesn't want to take woke marching orders here in the U.S., including returning to Russia.

“Ivan Provorov can get on a plane any day he wants and go back to a place where he feels more comfortable, take less money, and get on with his life that way if it’s that problematic for him,” Hradek said.

The NHL Network reporter noted that Provorov ""has been in North America for a long time"" after having played two seasons in Manitoba, Canada, in the Western Hockey League and now playing in his seventh season for the Flyers.

“If this is that much of a problem for him to maybe assimilate into his group of teammates and in the community and here in this country, that’s okay — listen, you can feel any way you want. But the beauty is, if it bothers you that much, there’s always a chance to leave. Go back where you feel more comfortable,"" Hradek continued, before suggesting that Provorov join in the Russian war against Ukraine. ""I understand there’s a conflict of sorts going on over there; maybe get involved.”

OutKick said it reached out to the National Hockey League for comment regarding Hradek’s statements about Provorov but didn't hear back.



How are folks reacting?

A number of Twitter commenters have more or less declared war against Hradek and his ideas. Some examples:

""'Assimilate' is a terrible choice of words. No one should be forced into wearing gay pride gear. Sounds a bit authoritarian, no?"" one user said. ""Coming from someone who is all for gay marriage.""

""You are such a douche for criticizing someone for sticking by their beliefs,"" another commenter said. ""It’s called being honorable; you should try it sometime.""

""Telling him to go back if he can’t assimilate into the USA? Do you feel same about those who come to the USA but never learn English? Should they go back to their county of origin?"" another user wondered.

""The minute you punish/cancel those of differing viewpoints, you lose all credibility because when you take that step, it [shows] that your idea/concept is failing, and you can only 'win' by force,"" another commenter said.

""Yes...berate others until they behave how you want. They can't have an opinion. That's the leftist way,"" another user sarcastically pointed out.

Anything else?

ESPN writer Greg Wyshynski — who penned the sports network's initial story about the controversy and also blastedProvorov on Twitter — wrote a follow-up piece about the NHL's ""social activism partner"" You Can Play, which wants to ""work with"" Provorov after he ""negatively impacted"" Pride Night.

You Can Play COO Kurt Weaver told ESPN he's disappointed by how the Flyers and coach John Tortorella handled Provorov's refusal to wear the LGBTQ colors. Tortorella said he didn't consider benching Provorov and respected his personal beliefs.

""The concept of 'team' can mean a lot of things. I think more coaches have to ask what that cohesion of a team means to them,"" Weaver told the sports network. ""At what point does a decision like this that a player wants to make cross over into basically not showing up for your job? I think [Tortorella] did what a coach needs to do, which is support his player's decision. But I would hope that, behind the scenes, there's some more direct conversations around what it means to be a teammate.""

Weaver also weighed in on Provorov's faith as his reason for not visibly supporting the LGBTQ community.

""Players who do this sort of thing have a very short perspective on what it means. For me, religion is about charity and inclusion,"" Weaver added to ESPN. ""This wasn't just about a player and a jersey on a patch of ice. What else was affected by this? Visibility and proximity is what breeds understanding and inclusion, and those things were negatively impacted by this. It's disappointing to see that's the outcome from this.""

If your child wishes to bring cards for classmates, please consider these recommendations, which we make in an effort to promote kindness and inclusivity within our community …”

“Please coach your child if purchasing commercially produced cards to select something that does not feel 'gender normative,'” the letter said, “Also, consider talking to your child about avoiding cards that portray only White human characters. Representation matters and our students of color also deserve to see themselves in some of the cards they receive, unless we can find cards without people pictured at all.”

This is not the first time that Moses Brown embraced woke insanity. Parents have complained that the school has an “obsession” with “transgender themes” and encourages students to proclaim “it is ok to be Gay.”

One mother told a regional radio show in New England that a teacher explained to her four-year-old daughter that someday the child “might want to marry another girl.” Children enrolled in Moses Brown’s pre-primary education program are taught to announce their pronouns to their class.

According to the school’s website, Moses Brown’s Lower School — which looks after children starting with nursery care through the 4th grade — emphasizes “the importance of being responsible citizens, and caring for others and the world beyond their doorstep” and helping students “develop their talents in a way that is uniquely theirs, while appreciating and celebrating the different abilities of those around them.”

Moses Brown’s high school provides students with several “service/awareness” organizations to participate in. These include the Gender Sexuality Alliance Club where students are encouraged to “explore issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression” and “Equal Voice,” which “focuses on issues of feminism and equality.”

Moses Brown is a Quaker school system. The school says that the “world needs ethical leadership” and its mission as a Quaker school “is to provide the rising generation with an ethical core, an unshakable foundation of integrity that fosters respect, non-violent resolution of conflict, and the desire to make a positive difference in the world.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/witnesses-admit-bidens-conflict-interest,2022-02-08
WWE mocks woke culture with new wrestler who wants to make the ring a 'safe space',"The WWE mocked the woke left this week with the debut of a gentler, kinder wrestler who doesn't need to use his male privilege to get what he wants while attempting to bludgeon his competitor in the ring.

During Tuesday's NXT 2.0 event, woke wrestler Joe Gacy took on Cameron Grimes in Orlando, Florida. Before the violent match, Gacy told the crowd that the ring is a safe space.

""NXT 2.0 is full of conflict, from the smallest microaggression to the most heinous grudges,"" Gacy told the crowd at the Capitol Wrestling Center. ""This is a place where we settle our differences.""

""I come to you tonight with a mindset of conflict resolution where I don't need to use my male privilege to get what I want,"" the politically correct wrestler continued.

""I understand, just like you, that life isn't fair,"" Gacy added. ""I believe that we can achieve unity and tolerance for us all, and I can be the man that will show you we can achieve peace in this safe space. And it starts tonight!""



However, the woke wrestler did not achieve unity and did not make the ring a safe space. Gacy was kicked in the mouth and eventually pinned by Grimes.

While Grimes was celebrating his victory, Gacy confronted his competitor – not for revenge, but for a hug. Gacy walked up to Grimes after the match and gave him a big hug, which thoroughly confused Grimes.

Following his loss, Gacy reiterated his unity message, ""Tonight, the better man won. And I still believe that we can achieve peace and unity. I want to make NXT 2.0 a safe space. Thank you for your time.""

Former WWE wrestler and NXT commentator Wade Barrett reacted to Gacy's pacifist ideas about wrestling.

""That made no sense to me whatsoever,"" Barrett said before the match. ""I've snapped my arm in that ring. I've separated a shoulder. I've broken my nose more times than I can count. That ring is anything but safe.""

Barrett said that Gacy ""looks at the world a little differently than you or I, which is not necessarily a bad thing.""

Gacy has been wrestling since 2006, where he started in Combat Zone Wrestling. Gacy, nicknamed the ""Chainsaw,"" was a three-time CZW Wired Champion before signing with the WWE in 2020, according to Pro Wrestling Fandom.

However, the new woke character is new for Gacy. As recently as a week ago, Gacy had a much different look. The 34-year-old wrestler wrote on Instagram, ""There is darkness and hope in all of us. We are all good and evil.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woke-air-force-academy-diversity-inclusion,2021-09-23
Colorado police seek woman who reportedly attacked a 12-year-old boy over his pro-Trump sign,"Police in Boulder, Colorado, said they are seeking a woman who allegedly assaulted a 12-year-old over his sign supporting President Donald Trump.

The incident unfolded about 3 p.m Monday, according to a police report.

The boy, who was not identified, was riding his bike with a pro-Trump sign when he says that a woman riding on a moped passed him and then took a U-turn in order to confront him about the sign.

Boulder police spokeswoman Shannon Aulabaugh said the woman told the boy, ""You want something to look at?"" or something similar before she punched him.

Aulabaugh said the woman hit the boy with her closed fist on his head, and gave him several more blows. She also scratched him after he fell to the ground.

The boy told the police that the woman attempted to steal his sign but that she was unsuccessful.

Boulder police are seeking a white woman in her 20s or 30s. She was wearing a blue shirt, blue jeans and a tan jacket at the time of the alleged attack. Her moped was blue or gray.

The boy told Denver7 News that it wasn't the first time he had been attack for showing his support for the president, but that it was the first time he had been attacked by an adult.

""I like showing what I believe in,"" he said. ""I didn't want any conflict – I just wanted to show what I believe in.""

He said that he was afraid to show his support for Trump because of the troubling incident. His father added that he wanted to press charges against the woman if she is identified by the police.

"Woman brutally beaten in NYC subway by suspect with lengthy arrest record of physical violence, including murdering his grandmother","A woman was brutally beaten in the New York City subway last week by a man with a lengthy arrest record of physical violence, including the 1995 murder of his grandmother.



On September 20, around 5:15 a.m., 33-year-old Elizabeth Gomes was attacked by a stranger at the Howard Beach-JFK Airport station in Queens.

The vicious assault was captured on surveillance video and showed Gomes trying to get away from the suspicious man.

The suspect, 41-year-old Waheed Foster, allegedly tried to have a conversation with Gomes but became frustrated when she ignored him.

The video shows the man chasing after the woman as she runs across the mezzanine. The man grabs Gomes and slams her into the wall, where she falls to the ground.

While Gomes is still on the ground, the man punches her five times and stomps on her. Another man approaches to confront the conflict but flees as soon as the suspect turns to approach him.

The video shows the suspect returning his attention to Gomes, who has now risen to her knees. He approaches her slowly and looms over her for a moment before kicking her five more times.

Police responded to the scene and arrested Foster. Gomes was transported to the hospital, where she was treated for a severe eye injury.

In an emotional interview with WABC-TV, Gomes recounted the events of that morning and discussed her injuries.

""Do you know how scared I am now? I was never a person to be scared,"" Gomes stated.

The victim explained that she might lose vision in her right eye. She said, ""I can't see anything on my right side, honestly. And it just hurts.""

Gomes noted that her head is still throbbing from the attack, and she has barely slept in a week.

""Man, I watched the video, and it tears my heart out of me,"" said the victim's husband, Clement Tucker.

The victim explained that the man who attacked her was muttering incoherent nonsense and talking about ""Satan"" before grabbing and beating her.

""Every day is an incident in the subway,"" Gomes said. ""What happened to all these police officers they said they will have there to protect us? There's like nobody to be found. I don't understand.""

Following the attack on Gomes, Foster was charged with felony assault and is currently being held without bail.

In 1995, Foster was arrested at just 14 years old for beating and murdering his 82-year-old foster grandmother, Ariela Mascha. She suffered 20 broken ribs, a stab wound to her leg, and a punctured liver. He later confessed to the murder and was convicted.

Foster was arrested six years later for stabbing his sister with a screwdriver.

Foster was arrested again in 2010 when he attacked three workers at a psychiatric care center where he was an inpatient. Police said he punched two workers and stabbed another in the cheek and shoulder. For that assault, Foster was sentenced to parole until November 2024.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woke-private-school-asks-students-not-to-give-out-valentines-featuring-only-white-human-characters,2022-09-27
Woman suing Hunter Biden in paternity suit reportedly worked as stripper at club he frequented,"The woman who is suing Hunter Biden in a paternity suit worked as a stripper in a strip club that Biden frequently attended, according to a report from Page Six.

Lunden Alexis Roberts sued Biden, son of presidential candidate Joe Biden, claiming that he was the father of her infant son. He denied the claim, but a DNA test proved her accusation was true.

The report that Roberts is a stripper is based on numerous sources who place Hunter Biden at the the Mpire Club in Washington D.C., and who also recognize Roberts as the dancer ""Dallas.""

Roberts is a native of Batesville, Arkansas.

A worker at the Mpire Club remembered working alongside Roberts and described her to Page Six, saying, ""She has a heart of gold and is a smarty-pants.""

""She was really sweet,"" said the bartender of Roberts.

Hunter Biden has become the center of a political firestorm over his involvement with Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, at the time that his father was the vice president.

Joe Biden bragged at one point to an audience that he helped pressure the Ukrainian president to fire a prosecutor that he said was corrupt. Allies of the president point out that the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was looking into corruption at Burisma at the time, which could be a massive conflict of interest.

Hunter Biden has also admitted to struggling with a drug addiction.

Woman who blamed Trump for her husband's chloroquine death is Dem donor who was once charged with domestic abuse in divorce argument,"The woman who fed her husband a chemical used for cleaning fish tanks and blamed President Donald Trump for his death has a history of being anti-Trump, donating to Democratic politicians, and of sometimes violent conflict with her husband, from whom she at one point sought a divorce.

President Trump has highlighted medical research from recent weeks that show chloroquine, a drug typically used for anti-malarial purposes, may be an effective treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus from China.

Shortly after the president began touting the potential of chloroquine, a story emerged of a woman and her husband who had ingested chloroquine — not the medical version, but the version that is used to clean fish tanks — and the husband died. National media pounced on the story, giving the woman a platform to blame the president's advice for her husband's death.

""Trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,"" the woman told NBC News. ""Oh my God. Don't take anything. Don't believe anything. Don't believe anything that the president says and his people. Call your doctor.""

Even beyond the obvious problem with this story — that the woman and her husband were taking fish tank cleaner and not medicine — some details from the woman's past cast more doubt on her motive and her account of what really happened to her husband.

In 2001, the woman was arrested and accused of domestic abuse against her husband for an altercation during which she allegedly tried to hit him with a bird house while they were arguing about marriage counseling and potential divorce. She was reportedly found not guilty, but both parties admitted to police that the conflict occurred.

Image source: YouTube/""Louder With Crowder"" screenshot

Court records from a 2015 court case show that the woman admitted in a deposition that she told her doctor in 2012 that she was ""furious"" all the time and ""probably"" wanted a divorce from her husband.



That same court case mentions that in 2004, when the woman was suffering from migraine headaches, stress, and anxiety, she sought out the counsel of at least three doctors before being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. This is notable in the context of her chloroquine claim, which is that she and her husband decided to consume fish tank cleaner because she heard the president mention the chemical's name on television.

The woman has a history of donating to Democratic politicians and causes. In 2016, she donated to the Hillary Clinton campaign.

In 2017 and 2018, she donated $1,450 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and $550 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Again, this is a woman who claims to have trusted President Trump so deeply that she ingested an unfamiliar chemical because she heard him mention it.

"Woman who was jailed while pregnant for waving legal, unloaded gun to be tried again after winning appeal","A woman who was sent to prison, while pregnant, after being convicted of assault for waving an unloaded gun at a neighbor during a conflict, won her appeal and had the conviction thrown out — but now faces another trial, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Siwatu-Salama Ra, a 28-year-old environmental activist from Detroit, was forced to give birth in prison because she was seven months pregnant at the time of her conviction, and the judge wouldn't let her delay the start of the sentence. She served nine months in prison before she won her appeal in August.

The appeals court ruled that the actions that led to her conviction were ""reasonable"" and that the jury was not properly informed. But prosecutors aren't letting the case go, instead opting to retry the case.

About the incident

In July 2017, a neighbor arrived at Ra's mother's house to pick up her daughter. The daughter had been asked to leave the house due to a previous fight with Ra's niece.

Ra said the neighbor was angry when she arrived at the house and was yelling from the car. Ra, who was on the front lawn at the time, said the neighbor backed the vehicle into Ra's parked car, while her young daughter was playing inside.

Ra got her daughter out of the car, then pulled an unloaded, legally owned gun from the glove compartment and pointed it at the woman, who she said would not leave the property.

The neighbor tells a different story, saying she didn't hit Ra's vehicle on purpose, but instead accidentally hit it in fear while trying to leave after Ra pulled out the gun in anger.

Both Ra and the neighbor filed police reports — but the neighbor filed first. About a month later, Ra was arrested and charged with assault and a gun charge that carried a two-year minimum sentence. Ra refused to plead guilty to two felonies, was convicted, and sent to prison.

Ra is a lawful gun owner who had no criminal record. The neighbor was a three-time felon who was on probation and had a previous conviction for assault with a shotgun.

Prosecutors won't drop the charges

The Wayne County Prosecutor's Office issued only a brief, general statement about the decision to pursue another trial.

""The Wayne County Prosecutor's Office will re-try this case,"" the statement said. ""The Michigan Court of Appeals remanded the case for a new trial. The court's ruling was largely based upon the absence of a requested jury instruction.""

Ra's attorney, Wade Fink, doesn't understand why prosecutors won't move on from this, especially considering Ra has already served nine months in prison for an alleged assault in which no one was even harmed and in which she claims she was operating in self-defense.

""That's justice,"" Fink said. ""Just dismiss it. For God's sake, let this woman get on with her life.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-beaten-subway-suspect-violence,2019-10-24
World Health Organization investigates mystery illness that has reportedly killed almost 100 people in Sudan,"Investigators from the World Health Organization are investigating an outbreak of an as-yet-unknown illness that has reportedly killed almost 100 people in southern Sudan in Africa, according to ABC News. The symptoms of the illness reportedly include cough, diarrhea, fever, headache, chest pain, joint pain, loss of appetite and body weakness, and thus far none of the patients who have contracted the symptoms have tested positive for any known disease.

The deaths have flummoxed health department officials in Sudan, which is also dealing with massive flooding that has wrought considerable devastation in the area. Indeed, the flooding has been so severe that the team of researchers from WHO had to be brought into the area via helicopter. The WHO team reportedly has already ruled out cholera, which would normally be the first suspect in an area devastated by flooding, as the potential cause of the illnesses.

According to ABC News, most of those who have died thus far have either been very elderly or very young. The BBC reports that the WHO began investigating the outbreak as early as November, but only recently sent a team onto the ground to collect samples.

A local government official told ABC news that the WHO team left the area on Wednesday, but did not communicate their findings to local officials.

The area of Sudan where the outbreak has occurred is the site of frequent sectarian conflict, flooding, and malnutrition, making it an ideal breeding ground for infectious diseases. Other than indicating that the water in the area has tested negative for cholera, the World Health Organization has not indicated any belief as to what the illness in question might be, or how it might be transmitted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-suing-hunter-biden-worked-as-a-stripper,2021-12-23
"Here are the world's 10 most and least corrupt countries. US takes a tumble, is deemed 'country to watch.'","Berlin-based think tank Transparency International has released the findings of its annual Corruption Perceptions Index, which assesses the public sectors of 180 nations and territories.

Countries are ranked on a scale from 0 to 100 — the lower the score, the more crooked a place is deemed to be by the researchers. Using surveys and assessments from experts, CPI gauged each nation's relative propensity for bribery, diversion of public funds, use of public office for private gain, nepotism in the civil service, and state capture.

Sources also look at countries' existing mechanisms for preventing fraudulent activity within government, such as the effective prosecution of corrupt officials. Excessive bureaucratic burdens hurt a nation's score, while the existence of laws on financial disclosure, conflict of interest prevention and public information help in the rankings.

The United States was noted in the study as a ""country to watch,"" dropping four points from 2017 to a score of 71 and ranking as the 22nd least corrupt nation. Yahoo Finance reported that this was due to ""rising political tensions and uncertainty.""

Writer declares: 'I got a vasectomy because of climate change',"Wes Siler is Outside magazine's Indefinitely Wild columnist. He writes about ""adventure-travel in the outdoors, the vehicles and gear that get us there, and the people we meet along the way.""

His bio says he lives in Montana with his partner Virginia McQueen, and their dogs, Wiley, Bowie, and Teddy.

But one thing he, Virginia, and their trio of canines won't be sharing their residence with anytime soon is children.

Why?

As Siler notes in his recent piece for Outside magazine, he ""got a vasectomy because of climate change.""

He shared that a couple of months before he and Virginia got engaged in June 2018, ""a wildfire destroyed an entire town in California and another one wiped out sections of Malibu. Shortly after that, most of the Mississippi River basin flooded, something that might be the new normal, virtually eliminating the future for industrial agriculture throughout a region that produces much of this nation's food. And, of course, the whole Donald Trump thing has been going on.""

More from Siler's piece:

Is this a world we want to bring kids into? Is this a world it's responsible to bring kids into?



It looks like the pace of climate change is speeding ahead of science's ability to understand or forecast it. Thinking about hypothetical Wes Jr.'s life as far into the future as I've already lived — 38 years — it's tempting to try to forecast stuff like so many feet of sea-level rise or the extinction of some keystone species. But that may not be possible. The future might be worse than any of us currently fear.



Then Virginia and I started talking about something we could do — for ourselves and to make a meaningful impact on the bigger problem. We could just forego the whole kid thing altogether.

He argued that if he ""gave up my 15 mpg pickup truck — basically the mascot for climate inaction — and rode my bicycle everywhere, I'd save the planet 2.4 tons of carbon emissions a year.""

58 tons of carbon emissions annually, per kid

However, by not having a child, Siler said he'd save the world from 58 tons of carbon emissions annually: ""Any other action we could take, even all the actions we could ever possibly add up together, pale in comparison.""

More from Siler's column:

That's because there are simply too many humans on this planet. We've all been told that driving an electric car or putting solar panels on our roofs will help, but that involves buying more stuff, which has a terrible impact on the environment, no matter how green the image. Two people deciding to make fewer humans eliminates the entire cycle of consumption that would fuel that kid's life.



All those people ultimately represent the greatest climate change-related threat. Burning forests and flooded beach houses are sad and all, but it's the human conflict created by dwindling resources needed to sustain the population that stands to really change life on this planet. We're already fighting wars for oil. Many think wars for water will be next, and those are going to hit closer to home.

He concluded things with the following message: ""It might not be enough to save the polar bear, and it might not prevent the next Camp Fire, but this is the absolute biggest difference we can make. We need fewer humans, and getting there voluntarily will be an awful lot less painful than doing it with war, famine, and natural disaster.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-who-was-jailed-while-pregnant-for-waving-legal-unloaded-gun-to-be-tried-again-after-winning-appeal,2019-11-22
WWE wrestlers were allegedly held 'hostage' in Saudi Arabia in dispute over unpaid broadcast bill,"World Wrestling Entertainment stars were stuck in Saudi Arabia for hours, even missing a scheduled live show in the U.S., allegedly due to ""mechanical issues"" — but some reports claim that they were being held hostage in a dispute between Saudi Arabia and the WWE over an unpaid bill, according to the Daily Mail.

More than 150 wrestlers were in Saudi Arabia for the Crown Jewel event on Oct. 31. According to the Daily Mail, WWE CEO Vince McMahon pulled the plug on a live broadcast of the event because the Saudis had allegedly not paid a $500 million bill for two previous broadcasts.

Even though the broadcast reportedly went on about 40 minutes late after the two sides reached a financial agreement, the situation allegedly angered Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman enough to temporarily ground the wrestlers' Atlas Air flight home.

The wrestlers were stuck on the tarmac for six hours, and at one point Saudi military police were even sent to the airport. Reporter David Meltzer told Wrestling Observer that the wrestlers felt like hostages.

""The talent felt they were hostages … nobody was harmed or anything like that,"" Meltzer said. ""It's a really tense story.""

Some of the higher profile WWE stars took matters into their own hands and flew back to the U.S. on chartered flights, but a majority of the group did not have the means to do so. McMahon, Brock Lesnar, Hulk Hogan, Jimmy Hart, Ric Flair and Tyson Fury were among those who arranged their own transportation.

The WWE's official statement made no mention of any conflict causing the delay:

A chartered passenger flight operated by Atlas Air is currently delayed in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia due to a mechanical issue. The flight was scheduled to depart at 3:00 AM AST on Nov. 1. Our top priority is always to ensure our passengers arrive safely and on time at their destination. The aircraft is being repaired and will be inspected and certified before returning to service to transport our passengers to their final destination.

YouTube says it will remove any video alleging widespread voter fraud in 2020 election,"YouTube announced Wednesday that it will begin removing content that alleges widespread fraud or voting irregularities in the 2020 U.S. presidential election now that the safe harbor deadline for the election has passed.

Any new content uploaded to the video hosting platform after Tuesday that alleges widespread fraud changed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election will be removed, the company said in a blog post.

""Our policies prohibit misleading viewers about where and how to vote. We also disallow content alleging widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of a historical U.S. Presidential election,"" the company explained. ""However in some cases, that has meant allowing controversial views on the outcome or process of counting votes of a current election as election officials have worked to finalize counts.""

""Yesterday was the safe harbor deadline for the U.S. Presidential election and enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect,"" YouTube continued. ""Given that, we will start removing any piece of content uploaded today (or anytime after) that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, in line with our approach towards historical U.S. Presidential elections.""

New videos, for example, that claim former Vice President Joe Biden won the election due to ""software glitches or counting errors"" associated with Dominion Voting Systems will be targeted for removal.

The content censorship comes as Texas has filed a lawsuit, supported by the attorneys general of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Missouri, alleging that four battleground states exploited the coronavirus pandemic to make unconstitutional changes to mail-in voting rules. The lawsuit seeks to delay the Electoral College vote to select the next U.S. president until investigations into possible election fraud are completed.

In recent weeks, YouTube has faced heavy criticism for permitting videos that dispute the election results to be uploaded on its platform. Wednesday's statement addressed the potential conflict between demands from the left to censor so-called ""misinformation"" and complaints from the right about free speech.

""We understand the need for intense scrutiny on our elections-related work. Our teams work hard to ensure we are striking a balance between allowing for a broad range of political speech and making sure our platform isn't abused to incite real-world harm or broadly spread harmful misinformation,"" YouTube said.

YouTube content creators like BlazeTV host Dave Rubin reported receiving an email from YouTube Wednesday explaining the new policy.

""Adios free speech. The bannings are coming,"" Rubin said, sharing a screenshot of an email explaining that any video ""alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election"" will be removed.

""There's a historic lawsuit at the Supreme Court alleging massive fraud in our election but we can't talk about it on @YouTube,"" video producer Robby Starbuck said. ""This censorship does the exact opposite of what they intend for it to do. It will only solidify the belief many have that the elite stole the presidency.""

""Notice, they did no such thing with the Russia collusion conspiracy theories that went on for years,"" radio talk show and BlazeTV host Mark Levin tweeted.

""These are editorial guidelines,"" YouTuber Tim Pool said. ""Time to start suing Youtube as they are now issuing direct guidance on what you can publish outside what is prescribed in Section 230.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/worlds-10-most-corrupt-countries,2020-12-09
Amb. Yovanovitch admits she was prepped on Hunter Biden and Burisma by the Obama administration,"During her public testimony in the impeachment inquiry Friday, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch admitted to being prepped on how to answer questions regarding Hunter Biden and his involvement with Burisma by the Obama administration before her Senate confirmation hearings.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) pressed the issue during the second day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.

Stefanik asked Yovanovitch about the first time she was personally made aware of the apparent conflict of interest — that is, when Hunter Biden accepted a paid role on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, at the same time his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, led policy goals in the region.

""You testified that in this particular practice Q & A with the Obama State Department, [that] it wasn't just generally about Burisma and corruption; it was specifically about Hunter Biden and Burisma. Is that correct?"" Stefanik asked.

""Yes, it is,"" Yovanovitch confirmed.

""The exact quote from your testimony, ambassador, is, quote: 'the way the question was phrased in this model Q & A was, ""What can you tell us about Hunter Biden's, you know, being named to the board of Burisma?'"" Stefanik said.

""So, for the millions of Americans watching,"" the congresswoman continued. ""President Obama's own State Department was so concerned about potential conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden's role at Burisma that they raised it themselves while prepping this wonderful ambassador nominee before her confirmation.""



""And yet our Democratic colleagues and the chairman of this committee cry fowl when we dare ask that same question the Obama administration was so concerned about. But we will continue asking it,"" she concluded.

President Trump's concern about Biden's involvement with Burisma has been the center of the impeachment inquiry in the first place.

Republicans have been frustrated by the Democrats, who are stonewalling their efforts to investigate the Bidens' involvement with Burisma in the impeachment inquiry.

Democrats say that the inquiry is specifically interested in the phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urging him to investigate corruption in Ukraine, which would include possible corruption at Burisma, and Trump's alleged withholding of military aid to Ukraine barring an investigation into the Bidens.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/writer-declares-i-got-a-vasectomy-because-of-climate-change,2019-11-15
Fire erupts at Europe's largest nuclear plant in Ukraine during Russian shelling; firefighters are under gunfire,"Editor's note: The original version of this story, based on reporting at the time, said that a projectile struck a non-operational reactor at the plant. Subsequent reports have clarified that only non-reactor buildings were struck. There is no indication at this time that there was ever a risk of radiation leak due to the attack.



A fire has broken out at Europe's largest nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine, and firefighters are reportedly unable to reach the site because they're being shot at by the Russian military.

Officials are worried that if the facility is damaged, it could result in a nuclear disaster. The plant supplies about 25% of the country's energy.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said that a Ukrainian regulator reported no elevated radiation levels yet at the plant.



Tuz went on to say that firefighters have been unable to reach the fire site because they are being fired upon.

""We demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire,"" Tuz warned. ""There is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.""

Video from a livestream at the plant appeared to show explosions and a fire but it was too blurry and grainy to see much detail. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted that Russian soldiers had breached the main building at the plant but he later said that there were conflicting reports.

The claim that the firefighters were being shot at was made in a Facebook post by Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of Energodar where the plant is located.

Ukraine was also the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history at the Chernobyl nuclear energy plant in 1986 when the country was under control of the Soviet Union. That site was captured by the Russians earlier in the invasion of Ukraine.

Zelenskyy rejects the possibility of a Ukrainian ceasefire despite Putin's openness as grain supply issues threaten global food shortages,"This weekend, the leaders of France and Germany pleaded with Russian President Vladimir Putin for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine to no avail as Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy each refused to make concessions to their counterparts and end the fighting in the eastern regions of Ukraine.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pleaded with Putin to begin “serious direct negotiations” with Zelenskyy to reach a “diplomatic solution to the conflict,” the New York Post reported.

In response, Putin said that the West is complicit in perpetuating the violence because of its “dangerous” efforts to supply Ukraine with munitions, military equipment, and financial support. Putin warned Macron and Scholz that the West’s continued support for Ukraine risks “aggravation of the humanitarian crisis.”

Scholz and Macron also sought the release of 2,500 prisoners of war captured by Russian forces and an end to the Russian blockade of the port of Odessa. Ending the blockade of this port is crucial to normalizing global agricultural supply chains as it normally handles millions of tons of grain each year.

Despite Putin’s insistence of “the openness of the Russian side to the resumption of dialogue” with Ukraine, the Russian president moved forward with efforts to expand the size of his military and signed new legislation that will eliminate the upper age limit of the men recruited by the Russian military.

The new law passed the Russian Duma on Wednesday and will allow Russian citizens over the age of 40 to enlist. It also removes restrictions that previously limited the Kremlin’s hiring of foreign mercenary fighters.

Zelenskyy, who spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently, said that the ongoing invasion of Ukraine could cause a global food crisis.

Zelenskyy said, “We must work together to prevent a food crisis and unblock [Ukrainian] ports.”

Nearly 22 million tons of grains are stranded in Ukraine as Russian forces continue to blockade Odessa and other ports, Zelenskyy confirmed.

As fighting continues in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where Russia has claimed victory over Ukrainian cities and continues to advance forces throughout the region, Zelenskyy refused to accept any possible ceasefire that would forefit lands previsouly belonging to Ukraine. Echoing previous statements, Zelenskyy promised that Donbas would be “Ukrainian again.”

Zelenskyy said, “We have to increase our defense, increase our resistance, and Donbas will be Ukrainian again. Even if Russia will bring all suffering and ruination to Donbas, we will rebuild every town, every community. There’s no real alternative.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/youtube-censor-voter-fraud-videos,2022-05-28
Zelenskyy warns of a 'third World War' if peace talks with Putin don't succeed,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that if peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin fail, it will mark the beginning of “a third World War.”

While speaking with CNN host Fareed Zakaria, Zelenskyy said that he is “ready for negotiations” with Putin to try to end the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“I’m ready for negotiations with him,” Zelenskyy said through a translator. “I was ready for the last two years.”

“I think that without negotiations we cannot end this war,” he added.

Zelenskyy went on to say that he would try any method of negotiation that would bring about an end to the conflict. He suggested that if it didn’t come to an end through negotiation, the conflict would lead to greater calamity.

He said, “We have to use any format, any chance in order to have a possibility of negotiating, possibility of talking to Putin, but if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War.”

Noting that diplomatic dialogue does not always yield immediate results that please public appetites, Zelensky said, “All the people that think this dialogue is shallow, that is not going to resolve anything, they just don’t understand that this is very valuable.”

He added, “If there is just [a] one percent chance for us to stop this war, I think that we need to take this chance. We need to do that.”

During the interview with Zakaria, Zelenskyy noted that the Ukrainian military is digging its heels in and fighting back against Russian forces, dealing a “powerful blow” to the invading army.

Zelenskyy also lamented the ongoing loss of life being caused by the conflict.

He said, “In any case we are losing people on a daily basis, innocent people on the ground. Russian forces have come to exterminate us, and to kill us.”

“We have demonstrated the dignity of our people and our arm that we are able to deal a powerful blow,” he continued, “We are able to strike back, but unfortunately our dignity is not going to preserve the lives.”

It is likely that the bloodshed will continue as neither side appears willing to give in to the demands of their counterparts.

Previously, Russian leadership offered to end its invasion of Ukraine if Ukraine agreed to cease military actions, change its constitution to ensure its neutrality on the geopolitical stage, recognize Crimea as Russian territory, and recognize the currently Russian-held areas of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

Zelenskyy rejected this offer.

And, as peace talks drag on, so to does the bloodshed. In recent days, the Russian military debuted a new hypersonic missile that is able to thwart sophisticated defense systems and cause devastating amounts of damage.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/yovanovitch-prepped-on-hunter-biden-and-burisma-by-obama-administration,2022-03-21
WTF MSM!? CNN’s Carl Bernstein stoking ‘civil war’ fears,"WTF MSM!? is a newsletter that puts a dose of sunlight on the mainstream media and exposes how the media twist facts, selectively report, and outright lie to advance their left-wing agenda. You can signup for the WTF MSM!? newsletter here.

Difference of opinion now radical? …

The radical left and its media allies are continuing to fan the flames of conflict between Americans. This time, in the wake of President Donald Trump's pro-America rally in Washington, CNN political analyst and Washington Post veteran Carl Bernstein is saying Trump is trying to ignite a new hot ""civil war.""

This is because Trump is resonating with a slice of America that has had enough of the left's radical agenda. As NewsBusters' Nicholas Fondacaro reports, Bernstein, appearing with CNN's media critic/cheerleader Brian Stelter, blamed Trump for his ""authoritarian tendencies"" and Trump's supporters for, well, supporting him:

Bernstein, a master of hyperbole that NewsBusters reporting can attest to, appeared on Sunday's so-called ""Reliable Sources"" where he, in all seriousness, suggested that ""this cold civil war predates Donald Trump. And Donald Trump understood that we are in a cold civil war in this country. And he has exploited it and brought this cold civil war almost to the point of ignition through his actions and his words, which are unprecedented in terms of presidential conduct.""



""No president in the history of the United States in 246 years has expressed the kinds of ideas and thoughts and undemocratic notions and authoritarian notions that he has,"" he continued to proclaim, a total falsehood (Presidents Woodrow Wilson (D) and FDR (D) come to mind).



Immediately following that false accusation, Bernstein turned to attacking President Trump's supporters around the country. ""We need to start connecting these dots. What do people in the country think of this and why do they think and support him, no matter what he does, no matter how outrageous seemingly his conduct is,"" he decried, as if those people supported Trump's supposed ""authoritarian notions.""

So basically, Bernstein agrees that rhetoric in this country has been heating up. Of course, he sees nothing wrong with the radical agenda the left is pushing and thinks it's all the right's fault, and Trump's, for tapping into the anger of those who are fed up with the radical leftist agenda of Bernstein's allies.

Bernstein's scorn is attached to Trump and not the violent Antifa protesters on the streets in the District of Columbia this weekend.

ukraine commentary,"As the internet continues to be flooded with news about Russia's war against Ukraine, the public's mistrust of the media grows as well. Discerning truth from propaganda seems an increasingly daunting task.

Background



Ukraine is a small country that sits between Russia and Europe. Until 1991, Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. After declaring independence from the USSR, the nation has since wavered between Russian and European associations.

During the Obama administration, the United States accused Russia of meddling in the business of the Ukrainian government. A leaked phone call between U.S. diplomats exposed Russia's meddling as well as an embarrassing admission by U.S diplomats.

In 2014, Ukraine is said to have communicated hope for major non-NATO ally status with the United States. Major non-NATO status is given by the U.S. government to non-NATO counties and offers financial and military advantages.

U.S. involvement in Ukraine often is described as an effort to expand western democracy into a nation that could otherwise fall to Russian control. To help understand this issue, it is essential to understand the meaning of ""democracy."" Here are the characteristics of a democracy:

The people elect their representatives.

The people enjoy civil liberties.

The government has an independent judiciary.

There should be an organized opposition party.

All must observe and uphold the rule of law.

Citizens in a democracy have rights and the responsibility to participate in the political system.

There is a real question about whether what the United States has been doing in Ukraine meets the criteria for expanding democracy.

The first clip that illustrates what has been happening dates back to 2014 and comes against a complicated backdrop. After gaining independence in 1991, Ukraine has wavered between a show of support for Russia and the West. In 2014, pro-western groups formed in Ukraine and led to an embarrassing leaked conversation involving Victoria Nuland, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.

In the original coverage of this video, U.S. diplomat Victoria Nuland made headlines for a rude comment about the European Union; however, journalists buried the lede in the story. The clip showed Washington discussing meddling in the Ukrainian government with U.S. ambassador to the Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt — something that the Obama administration denied it was doing.

The National Endowment for Democracy, a non-profit on a mission to promote democracy worldwide, decided that Ukraine's democratically elected president Yanukovych was undermining its goals and began to socially engineer Ukraine's future by supporting the opposition and strengthening the country's democratic institutions.



Militias in Ukraine

In this 2018 video, Vice reported the stalemate between Ukraine's military and Russian-backed separatists where ""civilians are left to pick up the pieces.""

Following Russia's takeover of Crimea, the Russian military moved in and began training Russian-backed separatists. But Ukraine's army was not prepared to fight separatists and called on citizens to take up arms and defend Ukraine. Years later, Ukraine claims to have disbanded civilian militias.

Evidence suggests that militias in Ukraine have not been disbanded, making western military assistance problematic. Although Putin's claim that he invaded Ukraine to ""denazify"" it was almost certainly pretextual, it is doubtless true that Ukraine does, in fact, have a neo-Nazi militia problem. Before the current conflict erupted, this problem was widely reported on by such outlets as The Guardian, Yahoo, and Reuters. Multiple reports have accused the American CIA of having trained these neo-Nazi groups, and there is a real question how much control, if any, the Ukrainian government is actually able to assert over them.

Consequences of western involvement in Ukraine?

American political scientist and international relations scholar Joseph Mearsheimer wrote that Putin's move to take Crimea in 2014 should have come as no surprise. Ukraine waivered between joining the E.U., the west's growing encouragement of a pro-democracy movement.

""The West's triple package of policies—NATO enlargement, E.U. expansion, and democracy promotion—added fuel to a fire waiting to ignite. The spark came in November 2013, when Yanukovych rejected a major economic deal he had been negotiating with the E.U. and decided to accept a $15 billion Russian counteroffer instead. That decision gave rise to antigovernment demonstrations that escalated over the following three months and that by mid-February had led to the deaths of some one hundred protesters. Western emissaries hurriedly flew to Kyiv to resolve the crisis. On February 21, the government and the opposition struck a deal that allowed Yanukovych to stay in power until new elections. But it immediately fell apart, and Yanukovych fled to Russia the next day. The new government in Kyiv was pro-Western and anti-Russian to the core, and it contained four high-ranking members who could legitimately be labeled neofascists."" -

In Mearsheimer's view, Russia and the West have been fighting over Ukraine — a fight which Russia believes that it must win in order to ensure its survival. According to Mearsheimer, Western involvement in Ukraine has led to disastrous consequences for the Ukrainians because of the existential threat it posed to Russia.

Coup or Revolution?

This clip highlights Ukraine's one constant theme of Ukraine's history — Ukraine wants to be a sovereign nation that will fully subscribe to the highest European standard while building relations with Russia that are just and fair.





Connecting the Dots

While the United States' interest in Ukraine has, at times, proven to undermine Western principles, for Russia, a Ukraine-NATO alliance would be a massive defeat. It seems probable that Putin will go to great lengths to make Ukraine appear unfit for NATO. The United States has funded much of the military training exercises over the years to prepare the aspiring country for a NATO alliance. Considering the time and money invested, the United States must learn from mistakes made during the Obama administration and stop undermining the democratic process. Ukraine should decide on Ukrainian elections without outside influence.

Click here for part 2 of this series: Cash, COVID, and cover-up, part 2: The gain-of-function controversy

On Jan. 27, 2020, EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak sent an email to Dr. David Morens, a subordinate of Dr. Anthony Fauci at NIAID, that contained a not-very-subtle warning. Fauci had not yet been appointed to former President Donald Trump's Coronavirus Task Force and was thus largely unknown to the public at large at this point. Daszak would later become perhaps the most prominent public scientific figure in the world to denounce the lab-leak theory.

He was also, perhaps not coincidentally, the link between U.S. taxpayer dollars and research funded at the Wuhan Institute of Virology — it was through his EcoHealth Alliance that the WIV had received NIAID grants.

As the coronavirus pandemic was emerging in Wuhan and scientists began looking for the source of the outbreak (some of whom were considering the possibility that the virus might have leaked from the WIV), Daszak alerted Morens to a rather explosive fact: The NIAID had, in fact, been funding the WIV indirectly. Not only that, Daszak provided Morens with a handy list of talking points that Fauci could use, if he saw fit, if he was asked about what, exactly, the NIAID had been funding at the WIV.

""Great info, thanks,"" Morens replied. ""[Dr. Fauci] doesn't maintain awareness of these things and doesn't know unless program officers tell him, which they rarely do, since they are across town and may not see him more than once a year, or less.""

It is reasonable to assume that, prior to this point, Fauci may not have personally known that NIAID had funded research at the WIV that any reasonable person would have concluded constituted gain-of-function research. However, he certainly knew after this heads-up from Daszak — who was aggressively shaping the public message even this early in the pandemic.

+++++++++

The first officially reported human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, although there is evidence the virus was circulating and infecting people at the Wuhan Institute of Virology before December. At the beginning of the month, patient zero, a 55-year-old man from Hubei, went to the hospital with pneumonia-like symptoms. Though the outbreak would later be traced to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, patient zero had not been there. In the next few weeks, more patients would present themselves to the hospital with similar symptoms, and on Dec. 8, 2019, the Wuhan City Health Committee and the World Health Organization reported that 41 people had been tested and confirmed positive for a new viral disease that would come to be called COVID-19.



Reports of this novel coronavirus were of immediate interest to Drs. Fauci, Baric, Daszak, and the other virologists, researchers, and public health officials who had dedicated their lives to studying, controlling, and preventing infectious disease. Their jobs, after all, were to guide the public response to a pandemic. But the circumstances surrounding the outbreak of the virus, and the possible, though unproven, connection of its origins to dangerous gain-of-function research — which those involved had an ideological and financial stake in — created a conflict of interest that perhaps motivated their public statements and compromised their official response to COVID-19.

To say that the government has not been voluntarily forthcoming about its response to the COVID-19 pandemic would be to engage in massive understatement. Only a bevy of repeated FOIA requests filed by media and nonprofit organizations, combined with the incessant prying of the DRASTIC internet sleuths, have uncovered as much information as we now have. And what we have represents only a small fraction of the total: enormous portions — perhaps the majority — have been redacted, including entire lengthy emails.

We, ordinary members of the public, remain largely in the dark about what these men and women did and said to each other as they scrambled to formulate a public response to the largest public health emergency in recent memory. For that matter, it seems that another key person appears to have been kept in the dark: former President Donald Trump, who was, if you will recall, the boss of virtually all the government officials involved in these communications. And yet, one searches through these hundreds of pages of released emails in vain for any indication that the president was consulted or even informed about deliberations that were occurring regarding how his administration would handle what would come to be his defining crisis.

While we might know but little of the full picture, what we do know does not look good. In the early days of the pandemic, a group of scientists led by Fauci, Farrar, and Daszak held a number of teleconferences and meetings, over which there remains a blanket of almost total secrecy. The end result of these initial teleconferences is that all the participants would emerge to publicly declare the lab-leak theory a conspiracy, including some (like Dr. Kristian Andersen), who had just days earlier announced that the virus looked potentially engineered.

In the months following these internal discussions, Fauci, Dasak, and other public officials and influential members of the scientific community would coordinate a messaging campaign to discredit the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 leaked from the Wuhan lab. Discussion of the lab-leak theory would be shut down in public spaces by their repeated insistence that such questions were conspiracy-theory, fringe ideas that promote disinformation during a global pandemic.

They instead advanced the hypothesis that COVID-19 had natural, or zoonotic origins — that the virus began in some animal host, possibly bats or pangolins, and evolved to become transmissible among humans. This became the prevailing narrative accepted by the media, and those who questioned its truthfulness were smeared as conspiracy theorists and in some cases de-platformed by tech companies for contradicting the opinions of respected, scientific experts and organizations — read: the views endorsed and promoted by government officials like Fauci.

Here is how the plan unfolded.

+++++++++

The chain began in late December 2019. On Dec. 31, 2019, at 8:16 a.m., Dr. Baric emailed Daszak with the subject line, ""RE: have you heard any news on this? maybe as many as 27 cases with 7 severe in wuhan---ards like pneumonia."" The email contained an update from ProMed, an email list that provides readers all over the world with crowdsourced disease alerts, on the latest news regarding an emerging pneumonia-like disease reported in Wuhan.



Daszak, a zoologist, was the leader of the only U.S.-based nonprofit organization researching coronavirus evolution and transmission in China. He is also a strong proponent of and fundraiser for gain-of-function research. For years, his organization has received federal funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and its sub-agency the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to support research on bat coronaviruses conducted in China. He was on friendly terms with Wuhan researcher Dr. Shi Zhengli, as well as NIAID Director Fauci, and had contacts with both of their colleagues.

He replied to Baric indicating that his EcoHealth colleague Hongying Li was feeding him information on the pneumonia cases in what appeared to be real time. Daszak's emails were made public as part of a records request from U.S. Right to Know.

On Jan. 6, 2020, Daszak replied to an email from Erik Stemmy, the program officer for the Respiratory Diseases Branch Division of Microbiology and Infections Diseases at NIAID, indicating that he had some off-the-record information on the viral outbreak in China. Chinese scientists on Jan. 12 published the genetic sequence of the virus causing the outbreak. EcoHealth Alliance analyzed the Chinese data and determined the virus was related to SARS. Daszak wrote another email to Stemmy informing him that the new virus is ""close to SARSr-CoV Rp3 that we published from our past NIAID work. This came from a Rhinolophus bat in S. China."" He added that Baric was ""already working to reconstruct and rescue the virus in the lab from the sequence, so he can do further work on it.""

It would appear that Daszak had early access to information Shi's research team wouldn't make public until Jan. 23, when they reported the genetic sequence for SARS-CoV-2 was 96.2% similar to a previously discovered bat coronavirus called RaTG13. Daszak confirmed as much in another Jan. 9 email exchange with NIAID senior scientific adviser Dr. David Morens, who had emailed Daszak asking if he had any ""inside info on this new coronavirus that isn't yet in the public domain.""

""Yes — lots of information and I spoke with Erik Stemmy and Alan Embry yesterday before the news was released,"" Daszak replied. ""Erik is my program officer on our coronavirus grant specifically focused on China."" These emails were obtained by Judicial Watch.

Later in a Jan. 27 email, Daszak sent Morens talking points on EcoHealth Alliance's work with the Wuhan lab for Fauci to mention ""when he's being interviewed re. The new CoV."" He highlighted that NIAID had been funding research at the Wuhan lab through EcoHealth Alliance for ""the past 5 years"" and that the work involves identifying ""cohorts of people highly exposed to bats in China"" and determining ""if they're getting sick from [coronaviruses].""

Daszak also pointed out the ""results of our work,"" which included the discovery of ""SARS-related CoVs that can bind to human cells (Published in Nature), and that cause SARS-like disease in humanized mouse models."" He was referring to Baric and Shi's 2015 collaborative gain-of-function study.

From the beginning, Daszak sought to influence the messaging around his work in China, casting it in the most positive light.

""Great info, thanks,"" Morens replied. ""[Dr. Fauci] doesn't maintain awareness of these things and doesn't know unless program officers tell him, which they rarely do, since they are across town and may not see him more than once a year, or less.""

The early work of scientists to identify SARS-CoV-2 and trace its origins inevitably attracted the attention of the media. Science magazine published an article on Jan. 31 detailing those efforts, covering Shi's work and leaning in to the emerging hypothesis that the virus occurred naturally in bats and made the leap to infect humans. The article also briefly discussed ""conspiracy theories"" linking China's coronavirus research to weapons research. At the time there were unsubstantiated claims that China engineered the virus at the Wuhan lab as a bioweapon, but soon the ""conspiracy theory"" label would be expanded to any suggestion that the virus originated in the lab, no matter how credentialed those promoting the idea were or how carefully they avoided drawing conclusions.

The Science article did note that there were concerns about the Wuhan lab's security and gain-of-function research. Dr. Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University and a critic of gain-of-function experiments, was quoted suggesting that data on SARS-CoV-2 was ""consistent with entry into the human population as either a natural accident or a laboratory accident.""

The mere suggestion that it was possible for COVID-19 to come from a laboratory accident drew immediate, fierce attack from Daszak.

""Every time there's an emerging disease, a new virus, the same story comes out: This is a spillover or the release of an agent or a bioengineered virus,"" Daszak told Science. ""It's just a shame. It seems humans can't resist controversy and these myths, yet it's staring us right in the face.""

This unjustified, angry reaction to a reasonable point was a prelude to what was to come.

+++++++++

At 8:43 p.m. on Jan. 31, the Science article was emailed to Dr. Anthony Fauci, who in turn forwarded it to several of his NIH colleagues and associates, including Dr. Jeremy Farrar, the director of the London-based Wellcome Trust megacharity, and to Dr. Kristian Andersen, a respected virologist at Scripps Research. Fauci's emails were made public via a Freedom of Information Act Request from BuzzFeed News.

Andersen, who had studied the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, wrote back praising the article but adding an astounding claim: He had analyzed the genetic sequences from China and determined that ""some of the features (potentially) look engineered."" He told Fauci that ""after discussions earlier today, Eddie, Bob, Mike and myself all find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory,"" before adding that ""those opinions could still change."" According to reporter Nicholas Wade, Eddie is Edward C. Holmes of the University of Sydney, Bob is Robert F. Garry of Tulane University, and Mike is Michael Farzan at Scripps Research.

Andersen would later walk back what he said privately, claiming that he and other scientists strongly considered the lab-leak possibility before evidence convinced them that the natural origins theory was more likely.

But in that moment, Fauci was told the unanimous opinion of several well-respected virologists was that the virus causing a growing pandemic was possibly engineered. The fact that the viral outbreak happened just 20 miles away from a laboratory conducting coronavirus research, research his agency may have funded, put him into action.

The next morning, Saturday, Feb. 1, Fauci sent an urgent email to NIAID principal director Hugh Auchincloss, writing, ""It is essential that we speak this AM. Keep your cell phone on ... read this paper as well as the e-mail that I will forward to you now. You will have tasks today that must be done."" Attached was a copy of Baric's and Shi's 2015 collaborative gain-of-function study, which stated in its acknowledgements that it was funded by NIAID and exempted from a moratorium on funding for gain-of-function research that was in effect at the time. Fauci also forwarded the study to the Wellcome Trust's Farrar. Fauci told Farrar the study was ""of interest to the current discussion.""

Auchincloss replied a few hours later: ""The paper you sent me says the experiments were performed before the gain of function pause but have since been reviewed and approved by NIH. Not sure what that means since Emily is sure that no Coronavirus work has gone through the P3 framework. She will try to determine if we have any distant ties to this work abroad.""

NIAID was tied to that work. Documents obtained by Judicial Watch show that NIAID awarded a 10-year grant to Peter Daszak to study bat coronaviruses in the East, and that between 2014 and 2019, $826,300 had been sub-awarded by EcoHealth Alliance to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Did NIAID fund an experiment at the Wuhan lab that engineered this new SARS-like virus? This would be the question on Fauci's mind as he prepared for a teleconference later that day with well-known and highly respected global virologists to discuss the emerging pandemic.

+++++++++

The teleconference was organized by Jeremy Farrar, who like Fauci is an enormously important gatekeeper of billions of dollars for medical research. Information to be discussed on the call would be ""shared in total confidence and not to be shared until agreement on next steps,"" a Feb. 1 email blast Fauci received explained. Farrar would lead the conference and present the ""introduction, focus, and desired outcomes."" Andersen would be summarizing what he and the other virologists had analyzed about the virus. What was said exactly is unknown, as an email summary of the call was redacted, as well as notes taken by Ron Fouchier, the Dutch scientist who authored a highly controversial gain-of-function study in 2011.

What is known is that following this conference call, the public campaign against the lab-leak theory intensified. Many of the participants who voiced concerns that the virus looked engineered abruptly changed their positions.

Andersen, for example, was recruited by Daszak to consult on drafting a ""statement in support of the scientists, public health and medical professionals of China."" Just four days after writing to Fauci about the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 virus looks ""engineered,"" Andersen in a Feb. 4, 2020, email recommended to Daszak that the statement ""be more firm on the question of engineering.""

""The main crackpot theories going around at the moment relate to the virus being somehow engineered with intent and that is demonstrably not the case,"" he wrote, reversing his position.

Farrar, meanwhile, was contacted by NIH Director Francis Collins on Feb. 2 about the need to get in touch with World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""Let me know if I can help get through his thicket of protectors,"" Collins wrote to Farrar, copying Fauci on the email. ""Really appreciate us thinking through the options ...,"" he said in another email, before a redacted line.

Later that day, Farrar emailed Fauci and Collins, writing: ""Tedros and [WHO representative in China Dr. Bernhard Schwartländer] have apparently gone into conclave ... they need to decide today in my view. If they do prevaricate, I would appreciate a call with you later tonight or tomorrow to think how we might take forward."" At the end of the email, Farrar wrote ""meanwhile"" and included a link to a ZeroHedge article published that day that reported on claims that COVID-19 was engineered in the Wuhan lab.

The very next day, Tedros delivered a speech to the WHO executive board stating the need to ""combat the spread of rumors and misinformation.""

""We have worked with Google to make sure people searching for information about coronavirus see WHO information at the top of their search results,"" Tedros said. ""Social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Tencent, and TikTok have also taken steps to limit the spread of misinformation.""

On that same day, ZeroHedge was banned from Twitter for publishing a ""coronavirus conspiracy theory.""

The campaign was beginning to work.

Meanwhile, Daszak worked in the background to recruit more colleagues and associates to sign his statement, which was intended to authoritatively discredit the lab-leak hypothesis. In emails, Daszak wrote that he wanted the statement to ""not be identifiable as coming from any one organization or person"" but rather to be seen as ""simply a letter from leading scientists."" He also emphasized how important it was ""to avoid the appearance of a political statement.""

Baric, a leading gain-of-function researcher, was also consulted for the draft, but Daszak told him it would be best if he didn't add his name to it ""so it has some distance from us and therefore doesn't work in a counterproductive way."" Baric agreed in reply, writing, ""otherwise it looks self-serving and we lose impact.""

Likewise, Andersen did not sign the final product. He later claimed in a since-deleted tweet that he didn't attach his name to the letter ""because I (+ coauthors) found it premature to conclude there was no lab leak without carefully analyzing available data first."" He has never explained why it was not ""premature"" for him to help draft the statement.

The completed statement was published in the Lancet on Feb. 19 with 27 prominent public health scientists signing on to condemn ""conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.""

The importance of this event cannot be overstated.

The Lancet letter was instrumental in shaping the media narrative condemning all discussion of the lab-leak theory as conspiratorial, fringe, and otherwise harmful. To quote a landmark Vanity Fair article about the investigation into the origins of COVID-19, Daszak's Lancet letter ""effectively ended the debate over COVID-19's origins before it began.""

Farrar, also a signatory of the Lancet statement, was working behind the scenes to discredit the lab-leak hypothesis, too. A spokesman for his office told the Daily Mail in June that Farrar recruited five scientists to author a letter to the scientific journal Nature Medicine that would argue for the natural origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Two of those scientists, Andersen and Holmes, attended the Feb. 1 teleconference and had before that conference believed the virus looked ""potentially"" engineered.

Incredibly, Farrar admits to the fact that he signed the Lancet letter even though, by his own estimation, he was ""50-50"" on the question of the lab-leak theory after the Feb. 1 teleconference with Fauci, and he further admits now that he cannot definitely make a statement one way or the other. Perhaps most astonishingly, Farrar's memoir ""Spike,"" which discusses his ruminations at length about the lab-leak theory, fails to even mention the Lancet letter or his signature on it.

Not content with relying on the Lancet letter, the scientists who were involved in the mysterious Feb. 1 teleconference launched other avenues of attack. On Feb. 26, 2020, Emerging Microbes and Infections published another influential article titled, ""No credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of SARS-CoV-2."" The paper was written by Shan-Lu Liu, Linda J. Saif, Susan R. Weiss, and Lishan Su. Christian Drosten, Germany's leading COVID-19 expert and a participant in Farrar's conference call, sits on the editorial board for EMI. This paper, if possible, represented an even more obvious exercise in wagon-circling and hiding conflicts of interest.

Lishan Su, it should be noted, was a colleague and coworker of Dr. Ralph Baric at UNC up until 2020, a fact not mentioned in the paper even though the primary purpose the paper served was to exonerate Baric and his work. Even more astonishingly, Baric was consulted beforehand about what the paper should say. According to emails unearthed by U.S. Right to Know, Baric was provided with an advance copy of the paper by Su and asked for comments and revisions.

Perhaps understanding how bad such an arrangement would look, Baric responded to Su's request that he review the paper by saying, ""sure, but I don't want to be cited in (sic) as having commented prior to submission."" Su agreed to keep Baric's name out of the paper, and Baric agreed to redline the paper that would exonerate him. Bizarrely, Baric attempted to claim in one comment that the SHC014-MA15 virus that he created with Shi decreased the pathogenicity of the virus, rather than increased, as it clearly did. Baric's comment confused the authors of the EMI paper, who ultimately rejected that particular edit.

Incredibly, Baric was not the only gain-of-function researcher asked to review the draft. His Chinese counterpart, Shi Zhengli, was also approached by the authors for edits to their work and, like Baric, her involvement was not acknowledged by the paper's authors. Another document discovered by U.S. Right to Know shows that Shi made three substantial edits to an early draft of the EMI commentary. U.S. Right to Know summarized her edits as follows:

Shi proposed three edits of note. First, she proposed changing the presentation of the number of nucleotides that differed between RaTG13, which was the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 identified at that time, and SARS-CoV-2. The authors wrote this difference was ""greater than 1000 nucleotides."" Shi proposed deleting ""1000"" and replacing it with ""1100"" nucleotides. This edit appears to maximize the presentation of the difference between the two viruses.



Second, Shi proposed deleting a paragraph discussing the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV virus, MA15 (that had been used in Ralph Baric's lab in collaboration with Shi), and how its serial passage had increased viral replication and lung pathology in mice. This appears to be an effort at distancing from the gain-of-function debate surrounding the research done together by Shi, Baric and the EcoHealth Alliance.



Third, Shi edited a statement on bats as natural reservoirs, and civets as intermediate hosts, of SARS-CoV.

Shi's second edit is most concerning. While the paper authors ultimately rejected her suggestion to cut the paragraph discussing her prior work with Baric, the fact that she wished the commentary to ignore that gain-of-function research demonstrates her desire to keep her research obscured — for what purpose?



The paper was finished on Feb. 13, 2020, and Shan-Lu Liu, who also serves as EMI's editor-in-chief, wrote a bizarre email recommending publication of what he described as ""timely commentary... perfectly written"" from himself to ... himself.

Unsurprisingly, the paper, which never disclosed Baric nor Shi's involvement, was published a couple weeks later.

But between the time the article was finalized and the time it was published, the paper's authors privately expressed doubts to each other about its conclusions, even as EMI was rushing to expedite publication of the commentary and waiving customary publication fees. Shan Lu acknowledged to Weiss in a Feb. 16 email that they ""could not rule out the possibility"" that the virus escaped from the lab, which led to changes to the paper that focused on refuting the idea that the virus had been engineered in a lab, as opposed to merely having escaped from the lab. But some of the papers' authors continued to harbor doubts about this possibility, as well.

On Feb. 16, Weiss emailed Shan-Lu Liu, still expressing her ""doubt"" that the virus was engineered in the lab, but noting regarding the distinctive furin cleavage site, ""lineage B Bat viruses generally do not have the furin site.""

Five days later, Shan Lu responded, ""Susan, I completely agree with you, but rumor says that furin site may be engineered. Importantly, the virus RNA sequence around the furin site (288 nt), before and after, has 6.6 % differences, but with no amino acid changes at all.""

Weiss then responded, ""Henry and I have been speculating- how can that site have appeared at S1/S2 border- I hate to think to [sic] was engineered- among the MHV strains, the cleavage site does not increaser pathogenicity while it does effect entry route (surface vs endosome) . so for me the only significance of this furin site is as a marker for where the virus came from- frightening to think it may have been engineered[.]""

None of these doubts or concerns would be mentioned when, five days later, the paper, ""No credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of SARS-CoV-2,"" was released.

+++++++++

On Mar. 6, Andersen emailed Fauci, Farrar, and Collins announcing that his letter had been accepted by Nature Medicine and would be published shortly. He encouraged them to provide comments or suggestions about the paper or its press release. Two days later, Fauci replied, ""Nice job on the paper.""

This third article, ""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2,"" was published March 17. Farrar's name was not attached to it. ""We do not believe any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,"" the authors wrote, in what would became the most-cited scientific document discrediting the lab-leak hypothesis. National media outlets seized on the letter, often referring to it as a ""study,"" as the final word on COVID-19's origins. Anyone who offered a contrary opinion, including President Donald Trump, was dismissed as ignorant, anti-science, conspiracy-minded, and racist as far as the media were concerned. And they'd be censored on social media too.

The Proximal Origins letter was championed by opponents of the lab-leak theory.

Daszak used the letter in interviews and on social media to forcefully attack ""conspiracy theorists"" calling for investigations into the Wuhan lab.

Fauci, who by now was the chief spokesman for the White House at the daily coronavirus response briefings and the nationally recognized face of the government's pandemic response, endorsed the letter on April 18 and publicly rejected the lab-leak hypothesis. Fauci did not mention that he was involved with the authors.

In an email after that press briefing, Daszak wrote to Fauci with glowing praise for his remarks.

""I just wanted to say a personal thank you on behalf of our staff and collaborators, for publicly standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to-human spillover, not a lab release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,"" Daszak wrote.

""From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel the myths being spun around the virus' origins,"" he added.

Daszak was thrilled because the most important and influential voice during the pandemic said that ""science"" had determined SARS-CoV-2 was not engineered in a lab. As far as he knew, the lab-leak theory was defeated. The United States government would support that conclusion in an April 30 statement endorsing the ""scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.""

The actual evidence presented by the ""Proximal Origins"" paper, however, was almost farcically thin. The bulk of the paper discussed the basis for a possible zoonotic origin of the virus — which will be discussed in greater detail in subsequent parts of this series. As for the scientific evidence discrediting the possibility that the virus was engineered, Andersen and his fellow authors raised exactly two points.

First, the paper claimed, ""While the analyses above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may bind human ACE2 with high affinity, computational analyses predict that the interaction is not ideal7 and that the RBD sequence is different from those shown in SARS-CoV to be optimal for receptor binding7,11. Thus, the high-affinity binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection on a human or human-like ACE2 that permits another optimal binding solution to arise. This is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not the product of purposeful manipulation.""

Stripped of dense scientific language, the authors essentially argue that, while SARS-cov-2 is extremely effective at infecting human cells, it is not as effective as it could be, and thus if someone was trying to engineer a virus that was as infectious as possible, they would have done better. This may or may not constitute ""strong evidence"" that the virus was engineered specifically as a bioweapon, but it ignores the fact that viruses are engineered by the scientists who perform gain-of-function research for a whole host of reasons, including to develop vaccines and treatment modalities. It also ignores the somewhat obvious fact that a person who was, in fact, seeking to create a bioweapon might want to maintain some plausible deniability that it was not, in fact, an intentional bioweapon.

Second, the paper claimed, ""Furthermore, if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone."" This contention, however, is definitely four words too short, because it fails to finish, ""that we know of."" The idea that the genomic database — particularly of backbones that might have been generated in Wuhan — can be relied upon for completeness is absolutely ludicrous given what we know now. For just one example, the infamous chimeric virus created by Baric and Shi in their 2015 paper was ""inadvertently"" not uploaded to any databases until after the current pandemic began and people began asking uncomfortable questions.

But, while the actual contentions of the paper were laughably weak, they were hidden behind a patina of dense scientific lingo and an air of authority and certainty, which was enough to convince the media and social media companies.

+++++++++

There were still voices arguing that the lab-leak theory shouldn't be dismissed. Trump drew fire for contradicting his administration with claims that he had seen evidence that COVID-19 originated in the Wuhan lab. When the media demanded the president offer proof, he said he was ""not allowed"" to share the evidence with them. Already antagonized by the president, the national media doubled down on their efforts to declare him a liar, as well as anyone who agreed with him.

In the months following, Fauci and other public health officials continued to dismiss the lab-leak theory as a conspiracy theory. In May, Columbia University virologist and Proximal Origins author Ian W. Lipkin thanked Fauci for his ""efforts in steering and messaging.""

As summer drew to a close, the lab-leak theory appeared to be thoroughly discredited. Gain-of-function research was safe. In August 2020, NIAID awarded 11 new grants with a total first-year value of $17 million to 10 participants for a global network to investigate viruses and other deadly pathogens emerging in the wild. Kristian Andersen and Peter Daszak, who worked with Fauci on messaging about the origins of the coronavirus, were among the recipients of this funding.

Only recently, more than a year after the beginning of the pandemic, is discussion of the lab-leak theory permitted in the mainstream because proponents of the natural origins theory have been unable to prove their claims. In May 2021, several influential scientists including Dr. Ralph Baric, the leading coronavirus researcher in the United States, signed a letter in Science magazine calling for a full investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. The letter acknowledged that both the natural origins and lab-leak theories ""remain viable"" and that the two theories ""were not given balanced consideration"" at the onset of the pandemic.

Further demonstrating that discussion of the lab-leak theory is now officially acceptable, a declassified summary of a U.S. intelligence report on the origins of the coronavirus requested by President Joe BIden and released last Friday did not draw definitive conclusions but left open the possibility that the virus was leaked from the Wuhan lab.

Discussion of both theories should be welcomed, as it is of paramount importance to learn how the coronavirus pandemic began so that a future pandemic can be prevented or stopped before millions of lives are lost.

What is troubling is that there was no obvious, science-based reason for any of the officials and scientific experts involved to want to prevent public discussion of the theory last year after the onset of the pandemic. Preventing public discussion of alternate theories of the virus' origin served no scientific purpose at all. It did not advance our understanding of the virus or how to treat it.

There is, however, a clear political purpose to preventing discussion of the lab-leak theory, one that served the interests of the scientists involved in promoting and funding coronavirus research in China and, to the shame of journalists responsible for holding the powerful accountable, one that went unscrutinized for more than a year as the pandemic raged.

"Cash, COVID, and cover-up, part 1: ​The questions we should have asked of Fauci about the origins of COVID-19","Click here for part 2 of this series: Cash, COVID, and cover-up, part 2: The gain-of-function controversy



Less than two years ago, an outbreak of a new, flu-like virus that would eventually be known as COVID-19 began in Wuhan, China. Today, almost 5 million people globally have died from this pandemic, and we are no closer to understanding how it began.

Well, that's not entirely true. We are closer, but only by virtue of being allowed to ask in public a rather inconvenient question: Was a foreign lab that received U.S. taxpayer funding for years responsible for the start of the spread of this pandemic?

For months, this question was considered publicly taboo, prohibited from discussion (except as a topic of derision as a wild-eyed conspiracy theory) by a group of scientists who were, incredibly, some of the same people who should have been under the most intense scrutiny. The bizarre tableau would not have played out in any other walk of life. If ExxonMobil had conducted drilling operations that resulted in a massive oil leak, the media would not have refused to investigate the cause of the leak because respected scientists who happened to be employed by ExxonMobil insisted that it was not ExxonMobil's fault.

And yet, incredibly, that appears to be exactly what happened to the most significant question that has faced our generation. The very people who stood to lose the most were allowed to hastily exonerate themselves, and for months — when important information should have been uncovered — social media companies and the media actually covered for them and are still covering for them today.

The decision to rule this topic out of bounds was made in late January 2020, just a few days after the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in Washington state. Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has perhaps done more to shape coronavirus response policy than any other person in America, was a central figure in those discussions.

+++++++++

It is difficult, after all that has happened over the last two years, to remember a time when Dr. Fauci was not famous, but it is important to remember that when the discussions that would shape the investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic began, the men and women who conferred with him were not conferring with the celebrity who would soon come to dominate American media coverage. They were, rather, conferring with a bureaucrat — one whom a vast, overwhelming majority of Americans could not have picked out of a lineup when he was announced as a member of then-Vice President Mike Pence's coronavirus task force on Jan. 29, 2020.

But just because he wasn't famous doesn't mean he wasn't powerful. Not only is he literally the highest-paid employee of the entire federal government, but Fauci's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) provides billions of dollars for research projects in the United States and around the world. NIAID was responsible for doling out nearly $3 billion annually in federal taxpayer dollars to research scientists between fiscal years 2017 and 2019. In FY 2021, NIAID received an annual budget of $6,067,071,000. The agency plans to fund another $3.8 billion in research grants this year, 62% of its budget.

The director of NIAID wields enormous power and influence over which research projects receive that funding, which scientists will be paid to continue their work, and which therapies, vaccines, diagnostic tests, and other technologies get developed in the competitive field of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. And Fauci is the longest-serving head of NIAID, having been appointed director in 1984 and supervising research both within and without the agency from that position for nearly four decades since.



So, while the average American might never have heard of Dr. Anthony Fauci prior to sometime in February or March 2020, the people who study viruses for a living certainly had. Not only had they heard of him, but they were also acutely aware that he was in charge of the funding upon which a significant portion of their livelihood depends. Risking the disfavor of Fauci was not a move many in the field of infectious disease research would make.

Another important individual in that field was Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the megacharity known as the Wellcome Trust. With an annual total disbursement budget of over $11 billion — a significant portion of which is spent on infectious disease research — Farrar also represented an enormously important gatekeeper of medical research funding. The Wellcome Trust had a financial endowment of £29.1 billion, or just over $40 billion, in 2020, making it the fourth wealthiest charitable foundation in the world.

Both Fauci and Farrar would play key roles in shaping the public response to questions about the origins of COVID-19. And they would serve — whether willfully or not — to stamp out questions that would have tended to implicate recipients of their funding largesse — and thus ultimately themselves. Somehow, very few people in the media found this worthy of curiosity, much less rigorous investigation.

Indeed, when Fauci finally faced aggressive questioning on the subject, from Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, CNN's Jake Tapper exemplified the approach of most of the media by treating Paul's questions as scandalous in and of themselves and not worthy of even being repeated on air. Thus has our watchdog media completely failed to fulfill its responsibility to hold powerful bureaucrats in government accountable.

+++++++++

Although the particulars of the lab-leak theory, as it would come to be called, would not be fleshed out for several months after the pandemic began, when COVID-19 introduced itself to the world in late 2019, it did not take long for a couple of salient facts to begin circulating on the internet. The first was that Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID outbreak, was home to a virology lab that had been the subject of a scathing State Department report that blasted the lab for inadequate security procedures, saying the Wuhan Institute ""has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.""

The second was that one of the lab's top scientists, Shi Zhengli, had for years led a team of researchers into the field to collect dozens of coronavirus samples in the wild. Her virus-hunting expeditions took her deep into bat caves, earning her the nickname ""bat woman,"" a fact that was of particular interest in early 2020 because Chinese scientists had published a paper showing the SARS-CoV-2 virus was 96% identical to a previously discovered bat coronavirus.

A video released by Chinese state media just weeks before the first official reports of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan also gained attention. The video showed Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention staff (not to be confused with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a separate lab) collecting virus samples from horseshoe and pipistrelle bats in caves found in China's Hubei province. The video demonstrated that Chinese scientists had been handling bats and collecting virus samples similar to SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pandemic was linked to Wuhan, and right there next to the city were a laboratory and a health institute that studied coronaviruses.

Given that the early scientific evidence strongly pointed to bats as the original host animal of what would become COVID-19, this led many to naturally wonder, ""Could this lab have been the source of the pandemic?""

Topping it all off, the lab in question, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was funded by taxpayer dollars that were funneled to it via the nonprofit organization EcoHealth Alliance, whose president, Peter Daszak, is one of the leading scientific voices discrediting the possibility that the virus came from the lab. Daszak's nonprofit received at least $15.2 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health since 2005, according to the NIH's RePORTER website. Between 2014 and 2019, EcoHealth Alliance directed at least $600,000 in NIH sub-grants from Fauci's NIAID to study bat coronaviruses in collaboration with the Wuhan lab, a fact confirmed by Fauci himself in testimony given to Congress.

In June, Daszak recused himself from a U.N.-partnered commission investigating the origins of COVID-19 because of his apparent conflict of interest. Meanwhile, Fauci served as a member of President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force all through 2020, is now the top White House adviser on the coronavirus response, and continues to be sought after by the media as an expert authority on all things related to a pandemic that possibly has origins tied to research his agency funded.

It is almost unimaginable that the above series of facts alone did not lead to months of endless public interrogation of Fauci. Every media organization and governmental watchdog in the country should have immediately been calling for nonstop investigations — especially given the eagerness of the press to tar anyone connected with the Trump administration. The national media spent endless hours speculating, without any factual basis, about the contacts with Russia of every obscure member of Trump's team. Surely they would have interest in whether the man who was fast becoming the face of the Trump response to coronavirus was complicit, even indirectly, with the release of the virus into the world?

It turned out they would not. Somewhere along the line, Fauci became synonymous with ""science"" for many liberals and other opponents of President Trump. Perhaps nothing shielded Fauci from criticism or even investigation more effectively than the fact that, while he was nominally a member of the Trump administration, he was erected in the minds of liberals as the COVID foil to Trump.

Fauci himself encouraged this deification, telling MSNBC's Chuck Todd, ""So if you are trying to get at me as a public health official and a scientist, you're really attacking not only Dr. Anthony Fauci, you're attacking science. And anybody that looks at what is going on clearly sees that, you have to be asleep not to see that."" Fauci became the scaffolding upon which the entire edifice of COVID-fighting measures favored by Democrats was built, and to attack him was seen as an indication that you probably sided with the ""anti-science"" crazies who think the virus is fake.

And the story of how this prevented the press from questioning Fauci or anyone else associated with him about how this pandemic began is one of the most regrettable failures of investigative journalism in all of history. But even more bizarre, as evidence has begun to mount that the very people who set forth to immediately stamp out all discussion of the lab-leak theory were a) the very people who would be implicated if the lab-leak theory proved true and b) were beholden to Fauci, the press seems curiously uninterested.

Only recently have cracks begun to appear in the façade, such as last week's surprising Washington Post article that finally began asking government officials in various health agencies some difficult questions about exactly what level of oversight was exercised over the increasingly risky research being funded by taxpayer dollars. A shocking number of government officials absolutely stonewalled even the Post's inquiries.

This series is not intended to prove that the lab-leak theory is true. That can probably never be known with any certainty at this point, thanks largely to the intentional destruction of evidence by the Chinese government. But it is intended to ask questions that every person in the entire world should be interested in — and it seeks to encourage the public and the politicians who are theoretically accountable to them to demand answers that should have been demanded long ago.

+++++++++

Over the next days and weeks, this series will investigate what we know, what we don't know, and what we may never know about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Part 2 will examine the ""gain of function"" controversy and what we know about the research that was done on coronaviruses by Shi Zhengli, Ralph Baric, and others and the evidence regarding the structure of the virus that has led many to wonder if COVID-19 was, in fact, engineered in some way.

Part 3 will examine the early response to the pandemic by the group of scientists who would be responsible for shutting down any discussion of the lab-leak theory and the decision to control the message.

Part 4 will examine the scientific arguments put forth by opponents of the theory and the issues they have either glossed over or failed to examine.

Part 5 will track the effort that was made by social media companies to silence any questions about the theory as conspiracy theories.

Finally, part 6 will discuss the current state of knowledge and suggest a path forward for the debate.

The trail of suffering left across the globe by the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant measures that have been undertaken to attempt to slow its spread are almost incalculable. Millions have died, millions more have suffered severe diseases, and almost everyone has been severely economically and emotionally impacted. Perhaps most devastatingly, so many of those who died during the pandemic had to die alone, isolated from friends and loved ones by fear of the contagion. The full downstream effects of this catastrophe cannot even be guessed at, and the possibility remains that the mutations of the virus may make it virtually undefeatable by vaccines in the long term.

In the face of all this human suffering, humanity deserves answers. We must do everything in our power to determine why this happened, so that we can do everything in our power to prevent it from happening again. The search for answers must be inexhaustible, and any person who might possibly be involved in any way should be an appropriate subject of aggressive investigation. After all that COVID-19 has done, humanity deserves no less. And it certainly deserves more than legacy media and social media companies have given it thus far. We will attempt to find those answers.",https://www.theblaze.com/newsletter_writeups/wtf-msm-cnns-bernstein-stoking-civil-war-fears,2021-08-31

Click here for part 3 of this series: Cash, COVID, and cover-up, part 3: 'You will have tasks today that must be done'

In the classic short story ""The Adventure of Silver Blaze,"" Sir Arthur Conan Doyle once famously had Sherlock Holmes solve a case based on what might be called the absence of a key piece of evidence. And while Holmes' solution of the case might have been a bit of an unwarranted leap, sometimes the absence of evidence can be quite compelling, especially when it appears that evidence was likely destroyed. If a woman is found dead, and the next day her husband vanishes, leaving behind a house that has been scrubbed floor-to-ceiling with bleach, well ... it doesn't prove he murdered her, but pretty much everyone will have justified suspicions to that effect unless some compelling evidence surfaces to the contrary.

In examining whether the lab-leak theory is true or not, it is difficult to come to a hard and fast conclusion based on scientific evidence; however, that's not because the science is in some way necessarily unclear. That's because the Chinese government has gone to extraordinary lengths to destroy evidence and hamper any investigation into what happened at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China.

That transparently obvious effort to cover up the truth is, in and of itself, a compelling piece of evidence.

++++++++++

Many years ago, the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) was created as a collaboration between the National Institutes of Health's GenBank, the European Nucleotide Archive, and the DNA Databank of Japan. Information on the INSDC is available to the public as one of its foundational principles, which means that any person with access to the internet can find information about genetic sequences that have been uploaded to those databanks. In theory, this means virtually all genetic manipulations that have been the subject of any research project that has been published, since most scientific publications require genetic sequences to be deposited in the INSDC prior to publication.

The INSDC exists for several reasons, but one of the most important reasons is that if, say, an infectious disease pandemic breaks out somewhere in the world, scientists are supposed to be able to compare its genetic sequence to other known genetic sequences in order to quickly pinpoint the potential source of the virus; this information can help develop early treatments.

When the COVID-19 outbreak began, biologists began a similar search and did not find any likely candidates — until, that is, Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Institute of Virology conveniently uploaded the sequence of a virus she called RaTG13 into GenBank on Jan. 23, 2020, shortly after the pandemic entered the public consciousness. RaTG13, as the story went, was collected from a cave in Yunnan province in 2013, and its genetic sequence matched the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 by 96.3% — making it the first plausible natural ancestor to SARS-CoV-2.

The public opponents of the lab-leak theory latched on to RaTG13 as a savior. Here, at last, was a virus that had been found in the wild that was really quite close to SARS-CoV-2. The fact that it was miraculously unearthed just as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was gaining widespread global public attention in a laboratory that coincidentally was housed in the city where the pandemic began was apparently not a source of concern to these scientists. It was, for example, prominently referenced in what would become the seminal scientific article arguing for a natural origin of the pandemic, ""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2.""

The immediate question that arises, given this sequence of events, is why, if RaTG13 was collected in May 2013 (as Shi claims), was it not uploaded to GenBank until after a pandemic caused by a virus that was so closely related to it began? Well, that is because China does not participate in the INSDC. The WIV, China's first biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facility, decided to keep genetic sequences discovered and/or created in their lab in its own proprietary database.

Implausibly, the United States government appears to have been OK with this arrangement and even approved taxpayer funding of research conducted in China that contained no guarantee that the United States would be provided with the results of that research, including the genetic sequences of viruses being studied.

Allow that to sink in for a moment: Your tax dollars were used to conduct research in a foreign country, with the express understanding that the foreign country was not obligated to even share the results of that research with the United States government, much less its public.

Well, you might be thinking, what's so bad about allowing the Chinese government to maintain control over its own data? Surely we can just go to the WIV's database and perform an additional search there?

As you may have already guessed, we cannot. The reason: The Wuhan Institute of Virology took its entire database offline.

When, you might ask, did this event occur? In what is surely merely a spectacular coincidence, the WIV databases were pulled down on Sept. 12, 2019, which is probably a pretty good approximation of the actual date the first human was infected with SARS-CoV-2.

The Chinese government's official story is that the WIV databases were pulled down because they were under attack by hackers. This might have been a plausible story, had the databases been pulled down after the pandemic became public knowledge and internet sleuths began aggressively investigating the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It is not a plausible story for why the databases had to be pulled down in September 2019, before anyone in the world had even heard of COVID-19 and before there was virtually any internet interest in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

In a separate article published by researchers at the WIV, the WIV further claimed, perhaps by way of explanation as to why the genetic sequence of RaTG13 was unknown to the scientific community prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, that its scientists had never fully sequenced the virus before and only did so after the pandemic began, when they discovered that a ""short region of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13) — which was previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province — showed high sequence identity to 2019-nCoV."" According to the authors of this paper, who again worked at the WIV, at this point they finally ""carried out full-length sequencing on this RNA sample,"" whereupon it was uploaded to GenBank, thus showing that ""the close phylogenetic relationship to RaTG13 provides evidence that 2019-nCoV may have originated in bats.""

Normal people, possessed of even a moderately healthy sense of skepticism, would have looked at this chain of events and concluded that the Chinese government obviously had something to hide. EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak, on the other hand, who would repeatedly lambaste proponents of the lab-leak theory as crackpots and conspiracy theorists, apparently found nothing untoward in what was happening. In a London Times interview, he uncritically repeated Shi's assertion that RaTG13 had been discovered while Chinese researchers were exploring a cave where six miners had died in a now-abandoned mine in Tongguan, whereupon they threw it in a freezer and forgot about it until 2020.

The ""crackpots"" and ""conspiracy theorists"" would soon be vindicated in their suspicions about the miraculous and entirely-too-convenient ""discovery"" of the supposedly thrown-in-a-freezer-and-forgotten RaTG13.

In the first place, DRASTIC sleuths began to notice that the genetic sequence to RaTG13 shared a curious affinity — a 100% affinity, in fact — with a partially revealed genetic sequence from a virus that was then called BtCOV/4991. DRASTIC members noted that not only were the two viruses genetically identical in the brief strip of BtCOV/4991 that had been published, but also the purported collection details of the virus were exactly the same. Faced with a growing paper trail, Shi would finally publicly admit in July 2020 that they were the same virus.

This admission made the entire purported origin story of RaTG13 a lie.

BtCOV/4991 was not collected and then thrown in a freezer and forgotten. It was, in fact, studied extensively by researchers in China, and its discovery and study was discussed in a 2016 paper published by Shi and her colleagues. It was mentioned again in a separate 2019 paper published by Shi and colleagues. Further, during the course of her admission that BtCOV/4991 and RaTG13 were the same virus, Shi made another startling admission: RaTG13 had, in fact, been fully sequenced in 2018, which indicates clearly that a) not only was RaTG13 not thrown in a freezer and forgotten, it was still being actively researched by the Wuhan Institute of Virology five years after its discovery, and b) it was not, as Shi's colleagues had claimed, only fully sequenced after the pandemic began.

The official story of RaTG13 — that it was discovered in 2013 and then thrown in a freezer and forgotten until someone finally bothered to sequence it after the outbreak of COVID-19 — had now been exposed thoroughly as a lie, even by the concession of the people who originally made the claim. No one has yet been able to extract an answer from Shi or her colleagues as to why they falsely pretended that the full genetic sequence of RaTG13 was only discovered after the pandemic began, or why they pretended (by omission), for several months, that RaTG13 was a different virus from the BtCOV/4991 virus they had already extensively studied and written about.

Internet sleuths were quick to discover that many of the other claims made by Shi about RaTG13 were, at best, highly suspect. Recall that the specific event that precipitated the search of the Tongguan cave was that six miners who worked in the mine had died of a respiratory illness of uncertain etiology. Shi claimed in a March interview with Scientific American that the Tongguan miners had actually died due to a fungal infection they caught in the mine and that it was mere coincidence that during the exploration of the cave, they found RaTG13 — a clear attempt to downplay the lethality of RaTG13. However, DRASTIC member TheSeeker268 unearthed a master's thesis by Chinese doctor Dr. Li Xu of Kunming Medical University, which clearly stated that the miner deaths were ""caused by SARS-like CoV or bat SARS-like coronavirus that has been isolated from the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat."" The symptoms the miners died of were noted to be ""identical to what we now call Covid-19.""

Furthermore, TheSeeker268 unearthed a 2016 thesis ""written by Huang Canping, a student of Gao Fu, the current director of China CDC ... In addition to what was already known, this document clearly states that WIV had tested the four miners (two had died by then); and all four of them had tested positive for SARS-like antibodies.""

Which raises the obvious question: Why would Shi lie and say that miners who died in the cave where the closest natural ancestor to SARS-CoV-2 was discovered actually died of a fungal infection?

+++++++++++

In addition to scrubbing the record of all genetic sequences researched at the WIV, and in addition to the demonstrably false statements from WIV researchers about their discovery of RaTG13, the Chinese government was working overtime in the early days of the pandemic to ruthlessly suppress any information about the pandemic from reaching the general public.

Dr. Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist who first brought the attention of public awareness to the emerging pandemic, was pressured and threatened by Chinese authorities to recant his statement that the new coronavirus even existed and was infecting people. Li eventually allegedly caught COVID-19 himself and allegedly died from it in a Chinese hospital, despite his young age (34).

The Chinese government also engaged in a breathtaking campaign of internet and social media censorship designed to squash any internal debate — or even discussion — of the pandemic in China. The government campaign even reached into popular chatting app WeChat and livestreaming platform YY and included a shockingly broad list of terms, including, notably, a number of phrases that referenced the ""Wuhan lab.""

These efforts were wrapped into China's well-documented effort to censor and suppress negative coverage of its response to the pandemic as well — efforts that included the expulsion of American journalists and the disappearing of one of China's most prominent citizens.

The importance of the disappearance of Ren Zhiqiang cannot be overstated in this story. While most Americans have likely never heard of him, he was, before his untimely disappearance, one of China's most prominent private citizens, and he was involved in a very public criticism of China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Imagine if, say, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban suddenly vanished from the face of the earth without a trace during the middle of a Twitter spat with then-President Donald Trump in March 2020, and no government agency seemed particularly interested in finding him, and no one who mattered even asked pointed questions of government officials as to whether they were involved in his departure.

Almost no one believes that Ren is not either dead or imprisoned at the hands of the communist Chinese government at this point, and the Chinese government does not seem particularly interested in combating that perception publicly. Imagine the impression such an event would make upon the average Chinese citizen — or, for that matter, any researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who might feel tempted to contradict the government line about what happened in that laboratory.

++++++++++++

If the censorship campaign the Chinese government conducted against its own citizens was thorough, it was nothing compared to what the Chinese government would do to the international community. From the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, China lied, hid information, and stonewalled World Health Organization researchers as they attempted to learn about the virus.

Publicly, both sides acted as if everyone was getting along. Chinese authorities told WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a Jan. 25, 2020 letter they would welcome international experts to China to help ""strengthen epidemic prevention and control."" Tedros met with President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Jan. 28 and praised the Chinese for their openness and transparency. In reality, as the Associated Press would report, China frustrated WHO officials by delaying the release of information, and Tedros and others were only lauding China in public ""because they wanted to coax more information out of the government.""



In early January, three different Chinese labs had fully decoded the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, but instead of sharing that information with the world, China sat on it. The virus was first decoded on Jan. 2, but it wasn't until after the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese scientists had discovered a new coronavirus on Jan. 8, a week later, that Chinese state media announced the discovery of the new coronavirus. China did not include any information about its genome, diagnostic tests, or detailed patient data that would have given scientists a clue about how infectious the disease was.

There was also a two-week period when Chinese officials censored reports of new infections in Wuhan. Operating under the belief that infections weren't spreading, Chinese researchers, unaware of the censorship, told WHO officials that the virus didn't transmit easily between humans. This led the WHO on Jan. 5 to announce that based on preliminary data from China, there was no evidence of significant transmission between humans and no need for travelers to take precautions. Of course, once the genetic sequence of the virus was made public and it turned out the virus was highly contagious, the WHO was made to look ""doubly, incredibly stupid"" for downplaying the virus, in the words of Dr. Tom Grein, chief of the WHO's acute events management team.

Meanwhile, people began getting sick with COVID-19 throughout the region. When one woman fell ill in Thailand on Jan. 8, researchers attempted to match the virus to illnesses that had been reported in China, but the Chinese authorities hadn't yet published the viral sequences. China's obfuscation of data about COVID-19 prevented countries from taking steps to mitigate spread early in the pandemic, resulting in people getting sick and dying.

The SARS-CoV-2 sequence wasn't published until Jan. 11, when a team led by Chinese virologist Zhang Yongzhen angered Chinese authorities by uploading the virus to virological.org. The next day, Zhang's lab was temporarily shut down. But now that the viral sequence was out there, the Chinese CDC, Wuhan Institute of Virology, and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences each published their viral sequences for SARS-CoV-2 to GISAID, a platform for scientists to share data on viruses. The WHO's first investigative team arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 14. One of the team's tasks was to visit the Huanan Seafood Market, where scientists believed the virus' first major outbreak took place, but from the beginning there was uncertainty about where Chinese authorities would allow the researchers to go and who they would be permitted to talk to. China had strongly opposed an independent investigation that it could not fully control, and before the terms of the investigation were agreed to, the WHO complained that China was taking too long to finalize arrangements for the investigators.

But after senior WHO delegation met with Chinese officials in Beijing on Jan. 28, Tedros made no public mention of China's obstruction in the hope that the Chinese would be more forthcoming in the future. On Jan. 30, the WHO declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of global concern. In the following months, WHO researchers continued to work with Chinese and on March 11, 2020 WHO declared COVID-19 could be characterized as a pandemic.

In May, the 73rd World Health Assembly charged WHO Director-General Tedros to form an international investigative team ""to identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population."" But even the vote on this resolution was delayed as Chinese officials ""were negotiating over every comma,"" as one former U.S. official described to the Wall Street Journal.

Chinese officials continued to play hardball with the WHO until in July 2020 an agreement was reached for a ""terms and references"" document that stated the goals of the investigation, was silent on the lab-leak theory, and gave China veto power over who would be on the WHO team.

The WHO investigative commission that eventually formed was fatally flawed by the prominent inclusion of one Peter Daszak in its ranks.

Daszak, by way of reminder, had been literally the global and public ringleader of the group of scientists who had been publicly ridiculing lab-leak theory proponents and attempting to quash public discussion of their theory for over a year. He was also the president of an organization that had for years funneled significant amounts of money to the lab he was purporting to investigate and that had widely publicized its frequent collaboration with that lab — meaning that if the lab-leak theory were true, he would be one of the first people in the public hot seat.

Sending Daszak as part of the team was grossly inappropriate not only because of the obvious conflicts of interest he was subject to, but also because, even in the absence of those conflicts of interests, Daszak had publicly and loudly made up his mind about the subject of the investigation before it even began.

Daszak was, in fact, the only scientist from the United States who was part of the WHO's investigative team.

However, that did not stop the Chinese from stonewalling anyway. On Jan. 5 2021, some members of the Team began their journey to China, only for Chinese officials to deny the WHO team entry into the country for several days until Jan. 14.

After two weeks of quarantine, the WHO investigation proceeded under severe restrictions. According to the Wall Street Journal, the team was restricted to one part of their hotel by quarantine rules, forced to eat separately from their Chinese partners, and had limited contact with anyone outside the team. They proceeded to take a propaganda tour visiting the hospital where Beijing claims the first COVID-19 case was officially reported, another hospital where they visited an exhibition commemorating President Xi's leadership, and cold-storage facilities at the Huanan market where Chinese officials claim the virus entered China from abroad.

Accounts from team members reported by the Journal indicate Chinese authorities refused to share raw data with the investigators, instead handing over their own data analysis. Even the team's visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology was limited to only three hours.

Nevertheless, the WHO released a report in February 2021 that determined it was ""extremely unlikely"" that COVID-19 leaked from a lab, determining instead that the most likely origin of the virus was a zoonotic event — a bat virus transmitting to another animal carrier and then leaping to humans sometime toward the end of 2019. Part of the investigation included inspecting the Wuhan Institute of Virology's lab, under Chinese supervision, and WHO team leader Peter Ben Embarek said that the safety protocols at the lab led them to conclude ""it was very unlikely that anything could escape from such a place.""

But the WHO investigation has since been highly criticized. On March 2, 2021, two dozen experts, including virologists, signed an open letter that called for a new international investigation on the origins of COVID-19. They said that the WHO did not have the independence or access ""to carry out a full and unrestricted investigation"" into the lab-leak theory. During a ""60 Minutes"" interview in March, Jamie Metzl, an advisory board member for WHO and one of the letter's signatories, said the WHO team ""didn't demand access to the records and samples and key personnel"" while they visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He blamed China for denying the investigators access to those materials. Metzl further said that the WHO agreed to let China do the ""primary investigation"" into the origins of the virus and then share its findings with the team.

Daszak's inclusion on the team, in particular, led to entirely predictable results.

Speaking to ""60 Minutes,"" Daszak more or less confirmed that the WHO team's investigative process, when it came to the Wuhan lab, was to just ask the lab staff questions and take their answers at face value.

""We met with them,"" Daszak told Lesley Stahl. ""We said, 'Do you audit the lab?' And they said, 'Annually.' 'Did it you audit it after the outbreak?' 'Yes.' 'Was anything found?' 'No.' 'Do you test your staff?' 'Yes.' No one was —""

""But you're just taking their word for it,"" interjected Stahl.

""Well, what else can we do?"" Daszak replied.

Incredibly, he argued that the answers the WHO team received from China were ""correct and convincing,"" even though Chinese authorities had demonstrably worked to suppress information about the virus.

When Stahl pointed out how China had ""engaged in a cover-up,"" Daszak was dismissive.

""Well, that wasn't our task to find out if China had covered up the origin issue,"" he said.

That jaw-dropping assertion was certainly a surprise to the rest of the world, which was told by the WHO that that was exactly what the purpose of their investigation was, and to Daszak's fellow investigators, who were charged with going to China to ""better understand the origins of the virus,"" according to the terms of the report they prepared.

Only someone as thoroughly dedicated to the proposition that there was no chance China could have been in any way dishonest as Daszak could have concluded from such a charge that actually checking out any of the statements made by Chinese scientists was not part of the scope of work. It was as if, seeking to investigate the disappearances of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, the WHO had sent a spokesperson for O.J. Simpson as their lead investigator and was surprised to learn that he didn't feel like it was his job to question O.J.'s denials.

Governments weren't happy either. In a joint statement, the United States and 13 other countries raised concerns that China had refused to provide investigators with ""complete, original data and samples. Additionally, in apparent contradiction of his own organization's findings, WHO Director-General Tedros acknowledged on March 30 that ""all hypotheses remain on the table,"" as to the origins of the virus.

In remarks to WHO member states, Tedros said, ""Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions."" He called on China to be more forthcoming with data in the future.

China reacted by denying that it hid data from WHO investigators. It accused the West of politicizing the report. At the same time, the Chinese government has shared disinformation and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 being engineered as a bioweapon in the U.S. and brought to China by the U.S. military.

In July 2021, China rejected WHO requests for a renewed investigation in China, asserting that such investigations should be conducted elsewhere. Chinese authorities have also deflected responsibility for COVID-19 by claiming the virus was brought to China via frozen food packaging.

On July 22, Vice Health Minister of the National Health Commission Zeng Yixin slammed the door shut on a second investigation by denouncing the WHO's request as ""arrogant"" and ""shocking.""

""In some aspects, the WHO's plan for next phase of investigation of the coronavirus origin doesn't respect common sense, and it's against science. It's impossible for us to accept such a plan,"" said Yixin.

With official investigations now thoroughly blocked by China, independent investigations have proceeded but with extremely limited success. The medical journal The Lancet established an international task force to investigate the origins and spread of COVID-19 in November 2020. But the task force was led by Daszak, who in June 2021 was forced to recuse himself after his connections to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and potential conflicts of interest became widespread knowledge.

In June 2021, an American scientist discovered evidence that Chinese researchers deleted SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences from the National Institutes of Health's Sequence Read Archive (SRA). NIH later confirmed that after Chinese scientists submitted the data in March 2020, they were ""requested to be withdrawn"" three months later in June. On July 5, 2021, the missing viral sequences reappeared in a database controlled by Chinese authorities. Chinese authorities claimed that the viral sequences were removed and later reuploaded elsewhere to correct a copy-editing error.

The Chinese researchers have not explained why they didn't mention the copy-editing error when they requested that the NIH take down their sequences, nor why they waited for a year before uploading them to another database. The bottom line, as this episode demonstrated, is that any investigation into COVID-19's origins remains at the mercy of China's willingness to be open and transparent — which they are not.

+++++++

What, then, are we to make of the actual scientific evidence about what the virus looks like?

In the absence of being able to access honest records at the WIV, which will likely never happen, or thoroughly examine its lab personnel, which will also likely never happen, the honest answer is: not much.

Scientific opponents of the lab-leak theory have expended a tremendous amount of energy arguing that the genetic features of the virus are consistent with natural evolutionary mutations and that there are no sequences that evince evidence of being an obvious man-made creation. We cannot cast doubt on the veracity of those conclusions, but they are, essentially an argument against a straw man. Very few people have suggested that the virus was specifically engineered as a bioweapon, and even if it was engineered as a bioweapon, surely the Chinese would have taken care to make it look natural.

It ignores, furthermore, two facts that are central to the discussion of this issue.

First, the work undertaken at the WIV (that we know about) specifically involved the creation of chimeric viruses that were intended to mimic possible evolutionary processes. Recall what the ostensible purpose of gain-of-function research is, which is to develop treatments and/or vaccines for viruses that might occur naturally.

Members of the media, who relied on the group of scientists who confidently declared the lab-leak theory a baseless conspiracy theory (most of whom have now backtracked) have assumed that scientists are somehow able to determine that a virus is engineered merely by looking at its genetic structure, as if the process of creating a chimeric virus leaves behind some irrefutable fingerprint, and that in the absence of such a fingerprint, a virus is obviously naturally occurring. That is not how it works.

Although it would certainly be possible to engineer a virus that has characteristics that would be obviously artificial, It is also entirely possible — in fact, it is what people like Ralph Baric have spent the entirety of their professional lives learning to do — to artificially engineer a virus that looks for all the world like a virus that might have evolved naturally. Recall that a central purpose of the gain-of-function research community is to develop vaccines and/or treatments for diseases that don't yet exist but have a reasonable probability of someday existing in the future. One does not accomplish such a goal by generating viruses that could not possibly be produced by natural evolution.

Every virus created by Shi or Baric in a lab is one that, if you didn't have access to a research paper telling you they created it, you would look at and say, ""Well, this looks like a virus that might have arisen through natural evolutionary processes."" That is the entire point of what these researchers were doing. So pointing out that the viruses don't look obviously artificial, as has repeatedly been done, is no answer at all, and anyone who confidently tells you that they can tell a virus wasn't engineered just by looking at it is selling something. We have no way of knowing, as just one example, that RaTG13 itself was not engineered, except to take Shi's word for it about where she found it. We can't even verify that it hasn't been substantially modified since she found it, since the genetic records have been intentionally erased.

One thing that would help us definitively rule out the possibility of a lab leak would be the discovery of an intermediate host, either animal or human, but no such host has yet come forward. These hosts have been found with other respiratory outbreaks, but none have yet come forth for SARS-CoV-2, in spite of the fact that Chinese researchers have, as previously noted, been assiduously collecting and cataloguing samples from bats for years.

The initial prime suspect for intermediate host was the poor pangolin, a kind of anteater that is found in China, based upon the fact that the receptor binding motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV-2 bears striking similarities to SARS strains that have been found in pangolins. Additionally, pangolins were found to be infected with other coronaviruses that were reasonably similar to SARS-CoV-2; however, no pangolins have yet been found to be infected with a virus that could plausibly serve as the actual ancestor to SARS-CoV-2, even though early papers touting a natural origin for the virus heavily promoted the theory that pangolins had served as an intermediate host for the virus between bats and humans.

It also might have helped shed light on the situation if researchers had been permitted to investigate laboratory staff early on in the pandemic, but the Chinese government refused.

The fact of the matter is, as an international group of respected scientists recently wrote in The Lancet, ""There is so far no scientifically validated evidence that directly supports a natural origin.""

These scientists challenged the arguments put forward in the ""Proximal Origins"" letter and elsewhere that ruled out the possibility of the lab-leak theory by showing how proponents of the natural origins explanation fell for a logical fallacy (edited for readability):

The question of the proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2—ie, the final virus and host before passage to humans—was expressly addressed in only one highly cited opinion piece, which supports the natural origin hypothesis, but suffers from a logical fallacy: it opposes two hypotheses—laboratory engineering versus zoonosis—wrongly implying that there are no other possible scenarios.



The article then provides arguments against the laboratory engineering hypothesis, which are not conclusive for the following reasons. First, it assumes that the optimisation of the receptor binding domain for human ACE2 requires prior knowledge of the adaptive mutations, whereas selection in cell culture or animal models would lead to the same effect. Second, the absence of traces of reverse-engineering systems does not preclude genome editing, which is performed with so-called seamless techniques.



Finally, the absence of a previously known backbone is not a proof, since researchers can work for several years on viruses before publishing their full genome (this was the case for RaTG13, the closest known virus, which was collected in 2013 and published in 2020).



Based on these indirect and questionable arguments, the authors conclude in favour of a natural proximal origin. In the last part of the article, they briefly evoke selection during passage (ie, experiments aiming to test the capacity of a virus to infect cell cultures or model animals) and acknowledge the documented cases of laboratory escapes of SARS-CoV, but they dismiss this scenario, based on the argument that the strong similarity between receptor binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins provides a more parsimonious explanation of the specific mutations. However, the pangolin hypothesis has since been abandoned so the whole reasoning should be re-evaluated.

The main point they advance in their letter is that both the lab-leak and natural origins hypotheses remain viable, because we don't have all the evidence, and both should be encouraged as a matter of open and honest public debate.

All that having been said, there are features of SARS-CoV-2 that are, in fact, similar to chimeric viruses that have been created in a lab. DRASTIC member Yuri Deigin catalogued some of those similarities at great length in a fascinating Medium post in April 2020. Specifically, Deigin noted that the virus looked like a virus that was ""based on the ancestral bat strain RaTG13, in which the receptor binding motif (RBM) in its spike protein is replaced by the RBM from a pangolin strain, and in addition, a small but very special stretch of 4 amino acids is inserted, which creates a furin cleavage site that, as virologists have previously established, significantly expands the ""repertoire"" of the virus in terms of whose cells it can penetrate.""

Deigin, whose work is worth reading in full, was careful to emphasize that such a chimeric mutation could have occurred in nature. However, creating just such a kind of virus was also consistent with the exact sort of work Shi, with the help of Baric, had performed in the past:

Indeed, virologists, including the leader of coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Shi Zhengli, have done many similar things in the past — both replacing the RBM in one type of virus by an RBM from another, or adding a new furin site that can provide a species-specific coronavirus with an ability to start using the same receptor (e.g. ACE2) in other species. In fact, Shi Zhengli's group was creating chimeric constructs as far back as 2007 and as recently as 2017, when they created a whole of 8 new chimeric coronaviruses with various RBMs. In 2019 such work was in full swing, as WIV was part of a $3.7 million NIH grant titled Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence. Under its auspices, Shi Zhengli co-authored a 2019 paper that called for continued research into synthetic viruses and testing them in vitro and in vivo.

Further information that has come to light since Deigin's work has further solidified the fact that Shi, with the help of Daszak, Baric, and others, were seeking funding for the creation of a chimeric bat coronavirus that would behave in ways eerily similar to SARS-CoV-2. As we have reported previously, in 2018, Daszak's EcoHealth Alliance sought $14 million in funding from DARPA for a collaborative project between Baric, Shi, and others that would ""synthesize spike glycoproteins which bind to human cell receptors and insert them into SARSr-CoV backbones to assess whether they can cause SARS-like disease.""

Even more specifically, the project's goal stated that it intended to release ""enhanced airborne coronaviruses"" into Chinese bat populations in order to inoculate them against diseases that could spread to humans. Although DARPA ultimately refused to fund the proposed Daszak project, deeming it too risky, neither Daszak nor Baric returned a request for comment as to whether the research continued with alternate funding. Certainly, there is no way to determine whether Shi and her fellow WIV researchers undertook the project on their own and simply used funding from the Chinese government to do so. If they had, the end result of such a project would have looked a lot like SARS-CoV-2.

At the end of the day, it may now be impossible to scientifically prove the truth or falsity of the lab-leak theory. But that isn't by accident: It's because the Chinese government undertook an extensive, obvious, and thorough effort to destroy and restrict access to evidence that was necessary to conduct a full and thorough investigation. The conclusion you draw from that is, of course, up to you.

And if it is impossible to tell with any certainty now that the virus didn't escape from the WIV, it was definitely impossible to rule the possibility out with certainty in the early months of 2020.

Which raises the somewhat important question: Why did scientists like Peter Daszak, et al., pretend that it was?

"OpEd: More Than Dystopian Lockdowns, A Weak Party Means a Dangerous China","China, which for the lion's share of the COVID-19 pandemic was heralded as the model in dealing with the disease, is currently experiencing its harshest wave yet with a 7-day rolling average of just over 27,000 cases per day. A bulk of these cases are emanating from Shanghai which is under uber-strict lockdowns. Now, it would be foolish to trust any data coming out of the People's Republic given the government's propensity to embellish statistics , but given the trove of evidence currently pouring in via social media, whatever the actual number of infections is, it's clear what's happening now is the most serious event since the outbreak originated in Wuhan.

Throughout the pandemic, China has not been shy about proclaiming how successful its model has been, especially in comparison to the United States. Recall the video produced by Xinhua from the early days of the pandemic mercilessly mocking America's 'failed' response to the outbreak. Communist Party officials like Hua Chunying, China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson, have also been in on the act of patting themselves on the back. Hua, who pushes insane amounts of English language propaganda on Twitter, crafted a Tweet last week claiming China has one of the best records for handling COVID.

If the nice spokesperson would take a trip to Shanghai, she may find that things aren't running as smoothly as her profile indicates. Distressing videos from the locked-down city seem to be popping up on US social networks every minute. They show scenes of apartment dwellers screaming in despair out of their high-rise buildings, citizens fighting for food, health workers beating individuals who aren't complying with orders, and government officials executing pets, just to name a few.

Shanghai is showing that even as the Party in Beijing, led by Xi Jinping, is trying desperately to maintain its Zero-COVID policy, its ability to govern effectively has been massively over-hyped, especially to the domestic populace. Even the most conditioned population will start to lose faith when there's nothing to eat, and right now in Shanghai, there's nothing to eat .

MORE THAN PANDEMIC PROBLEMS

It's not just the backlash to the dystopian lockdowns that Beijing has to worry about, either. Party governance as a whole is in serious trouble of losing control on two other key issues. The first is the massive real estate bubble that has been created via debt-driven growth by developers and speculative buying by individuals. Essentially, property developers like Evergrande, China's second-largest developer, took out massive debt to build large projects. They then passed the debt off to the customers by selling apartments that don't exist yet. As much as 80% of Chinese household assets are tied up in real estate, so a crash in the market would have devastating effects. The aforementioned Evergrande, which is over $300B in debt, defaulted on its payments in December of last year, and last Monday, China's fourth-largest developer, Sunac, missed its first bond payment.

The other concern that must be at the forefront of Xi Jinping's mind is China's demographic timebomb. From 1980 to 2016 China implemented the One Child Policy, which was designed to curb population growth and spur economic growth under Deng Xiaoping's planned economy. Unfortunately, what resulted were many unintended consequences that are currently threatening China's future development.

The current fertility rate in China is 1.3 percent, well below the replacement rate. It is expected to continue falling, and according to state media outlet The Global Times , the number of women aged 22-35 (childbearing age) will decline by 30 percent in the next 10 years. With China's population aging fast, it's leaving fewer taxpayers to contribute to pension funds. In 2020, there were five taxpayers per pensioner, and by 2050, it's expected to be a 2-to-1 ratio. This also means no replacement workforce will be coming in to take over for retirees, and this is especially hurtful given China's reliance on domestic manufacturing.

To combat these negative demographic trends, China has implemented major policy changes, including moving to a "" Three Child Policy ."" However, societal constraints like education costs, lack of maternity support, and the financial burden of having to care for older relatives mean that young Chinese aren't enthusiastic about the idea of having more children. In a now-deleted Xinhua poll, 29,000 out of 31,000 respondents said they would never think of having more children. China also plans to gradually increase the retirement age, but this, too, has faced major backlash online.

A CORNERED PARTY

From the perspective of China's rivals, like the US, Japan, and Taiwan, watching this meltdown of CCP governance might seem like cause for celebration. After all, each of these countries considers China its biggest security threat, so if Beijing is too wrapped up in trying to fix domestic turmoil, then it will have to temper ambition when it comes to foreign policy, right?

Remember that Xi's and the CCP's mandate to govern is not derived from the vote of the population, no matter how many times Hua Chunying Tweets about ""Chinese Democracy"" . To maintain legitimacy amongst the population and the Party, Xi is dependent upon sustained economic growth. For the last 30 years, this growth has allowed the leadership in Beijing to rule without substantial pushback from its citizenry. Though not ideal, it's much easier for people to shelve concerns about human rights and autonomy when their standard of living is consistently increasing.

It's no coincidence then that in 2018, when Xi Jinping removed presidential term limits, setting himself up for lifetime rule, China's GDP growth sat at an impressive 6.75 percent. Even as authoritarian policies increased dramatically under Xi, Chinese people were still getting richer, so there was no immediate motivation from the wider populace to oppose his agenda. As long as bank accounts are growing, it is palatable for Xi to amass more and more power.

However, given what we know about China's domestic instability, this gravy train of massive economic growth looks like it's getting closer and closer to running out of steam, or in China's case, coal-fired electricity. Between the Zero-COVID failure, a massive housing bubble, and a looming demographic crisis, it's hard to imagine things are going to get easier for the CCP. And when the domestic population does start turning on Party leadership, China's rivals would be wise not to get complacent.

It has become clear by now that Xi fancies himself a modern-day emperor, the leader of the CCP dynasty if you will. Like most emperors, his ego is not exactly small. When his legitimacy starts to be questioned as domestic conditions deteriorate, the US and its allies should not expect him to accept responsibility and work with the people to fix the problems. They should expect him to do what the CCP does so well: blame the failings of the Party on outside forces.

In order to deflect blame from himself for his and the Party's failings, Xi Jinping will need a target he can funnel domestic anger towards. This has been the playbook for power-hungry leaders for as long as they have existed. Examples of this diversionary foreign policy include Tsar Nicholas II using Japan as an outlet for Russia's revolutionary sentiment and Otto von Bismarck utilizing the Franco-Prussian war as a means to unify Germany.

It's not a stretch to imagine Xi using similar tactics to pacify his own population. The most likely target of his ire will be the United States and, by proxy, its Northeast Asian allies, as well as Taiwan. A likely scenario would see Xi blaming domestic failures on the unrealized unification of Taiwan and the ""American Imperialists"" who have propped up the ""illegitimate"" regime in Taipei. In order for China to realize its full potential, it must exorcise all of its enemies from the region and all remnants of American influence in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.

Increased aggression then should be expected not only in the Taiwan Strait but around disputed territories like the Senkaku Islands. By stirring up conflict with China's enemies, Xi will hope to move domestic anger away from the Party and onto the Americans, Taiwanese, and Japanese. The ability to offload blame for economic pain onto foreign governments not only offers the potential of relief for the Party but the potential for a motivated populace unified in accomplishing Xi Jinping's Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation.

This isn't a proclamation that China will move on Taiwan in the immediate future, although in today's geopolitical climate that's certainly not out of the question. It is, however, a warning to China's enemies to not get fat and cocky as China's struggles become more apparent. Rather than restricting China's foreign policy ambitions, domestic turmoil will increase and accelerate them. It would be wise for the United States and its allies to keep that understanding at the forefront of their own foreign policy.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/cash-covid-and-cover-up-part-3-you-will-have-tasks-that-must-be-done,2022-04-26
Commentary: AOC is dangerously uninformed about what US forces did in Afghanistan,"“Men… Dec. 7, 1941, was the 'Day of Infamy' for our fathers and grandfathers. The world will come to know that Sept. 11, 2001, is OUR 'Day of Infamy.' The homeland has been attacked on OUR watch. Now it's OUR turn to to respond like so many have before us.""

Those words were spoken by my commander on board a U.S. Navy ship just off the coast of Australia on the night of Sept. 11, 2001. I was a young Marine on my first deployment. None of us could have expected that this deployment would be anything different or special, but the world forever changed that fateful night. The captain put the pedal to the metal in an all-out seaborne sprint to the coast of Pakistan. I was a United States Marine, and I was now going to war.

No memory is more vivid in my mind than this one. I think about it often. This was our Pearl Harbor, and I was right in the middle of it. We all wanted revenge for the fallen. We all wanted justice. We all wanted to ensure that this would never happen again. If you've ever served in a combat unit, you're fully accustomed to the complaining and boredom of typical Marine/soldier life.

You're probably chuckling right now to yourself. We had a saying in the Corps, “If a Marine's not complaining, he isn't happy."" But no one was complaining during those early days leading up to the invasion of Afghanistan. No one was bored. Everyone was locked in laser focus. We had been attacked, the Taliban was protecting our attackers, and nothing could be more justified than to bring these people to justice.

Last night, I read remarks from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) that truly made my blood boil.

In a Twitter fight — of course — with Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.), Ocasio-Cortez stated, “I remember a time when it was 'unacceptable' to question the Iraq War. All of Congress was wrong, including both GOP & Dem Party, and led my generation into a disastrous + wrong war that virtually all would come to regret.""

She later corrected her remark, stating that she actually meant to say the war in Afghanistan, adding, “honestly we shouldn't have been in either.""

I truly hope this article reaches Rep. Ocasio-Cortez. I hope she reaches out to me to hear what we all felt, went through, and discovered in the days following 9/11. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and hope that she might change her skewed world outlook if she had just a little information on what she's talking about.

This kind of ill-informed rhetoric is dangerous. It's a rewriting of history, spoken through a social media megaphone to a young audience that has no memory of what actually happened. Six years before George Orwell's ""1984,"" he wrote in an essay titled, “Looking Back on the Spanish War"":

Nazi theory indeed specifically denies that such a thing as ""the truth"" exists. ... The implied objective of this line of thought is a nightmare world in which the Leader, or some ruling clique, controls not only the future but the past. If the Leader says of such and such an event, ""It never happened"" — well, it never happened. If he says that two and two are five — well, two and two are five. This prospect frightens me much more than bombs.

Indeed. And what's going on today from actual elected officials is frightening.

Gallup found in a recent poll that Americans ages 18 to 29 have a stronger view of socialism over capitalism. Every other age bracket, from 30 years old to 65-plus, doesn't share this sentiment. Why? Because they saw the horrors of socialism first hand. They saw millions die and nations collapse, and it was all at the altar of the socialist experiment. Our youth have no tangible connection to this history, and people like Ocasio-Cortez are taking advantage of it. And her remarks on the war in Afghanistan have hit a little too close to home for me.

To question the validity of the initial Afghanistan invasion goes completely against the facts, and — in dangerously Orwellian fashion — is a blatant attempt at re-writing history. I truly hope the congresswoman reads this. She, and everyone too young to remember the past couple of decades (she was 12 at the time), need to know our history.

Everything I'm about to reveal has been declassified by now, but in the weeks following 9/11, all this information was coming at us like a 747. My unit was about to embark on the furthest seaborne assault in history. Special Forces units were already on the ground in the North, but we were dropping deep in Southern Afghanistan.

The intelligence reports were shocking. Everyone back home knew, by now, that al-Qaeda was responsible and that the Taliban was harboring them, but what they didn't know was how sophisticated the operation was. Iranian weapons were being found in both Taliban and Al-Qaeda hands. The Iranians were also using their country to provide a safe travel corridor for al-Qaeda operatives to move inside and out of Afghanistan.

Osama bin Laden had gone deeper underground, but he was still training his operatives for additional foreign operations on the West. His vast financial resources were supplemented by Afghanistan's leading terrorist cash crop — opium. Our task force's first target was an opium manufacturing and transit hub in the South. After destroying that hub, we then used that facility as our base of operations. Cutting off that stream of money to jihadis being trained and sent to the West was paramount. A ground assault was the absolute only way to do it.

As al-Qaeda moved to the mountains their capabilities lessened, but our casualties elevated. Every day I'd listen to the reports. It was heartbreaking, but we knew that our lives were being put at risk so that never again would bin Laden and al-Qaeda accomplish another 9/11.

If not for the Afghanistan invasion, the opium financing would have continued, the terror camps would have resumed from the mountains, and al-Qaeda fighters would still be using Iran as a safe haven to move terror cells into the West.

Was everything perfect? Nothing in war and conflict ever is. Was every goal accomplished? Not in the slightest. You can intelligently make a case for discontinuing the current operations in Afghanistan, but what you can never do is delegitimize what we did in those early months after 9/11. You can't deny what we accomplished, and — more importantly — what we prevented in the future.

There's always room for debate and questions on foreign policy. It's essential. But the troubling theme here is that people like Ocasio-Cortez aren't engaging in any kind of real and honest debate. They're attempting to rewrite history, and that's something we must fight with every ounce of energy. Perhaps that war, for those of us who lived it, is our new ""day of infamy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/cash-covid-and-coverup-part-1-the-questions-we-should-have-asked-of-fauci-about-the-origins-of-covid-19,2019-03-05
Commentary: Diplomacy — if we can keep it,"Sen. Rand Paul's (R-Ky.) foreign policy beliefs have been ruffling feathers on the left and the right since he took office in 2011.

Like his father before him, Rand is no stranger to criticism from both sides of the aisle when it comes to his cautious and conservative foreign policy views.

For decades, politicians in the Republican and Democratic parties have beat the war drums against the Middle East and pretty much any other nation that dares to differ from the U.S. culturally or politically. While there are certainly times when military conflict is warranted, the United States has abandoned the restrained and cautious foreign policy of George Washington.

Since 9/11, the United States has sent tens of thousands of troops to fight wars in the Middle East, with many soldiers being younger than the wars they fight in. Too many of our men and women in uniform have left the United States to fight the “War on Terror,"" a war that has largely undefined goals and an ambiguous end date.

While President Barack Obama promised to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he failed to do so, instead expanding the United States' involvement in the conflicts and authorizing use of U.S. forces in Syria as well, all the while spending trillions of dollars in the process. Thousands of American troops remain actively engaged in these conflicts.

With regard to Russia, Obama pretended to adopt “tough guy"" rhetoric and policy positions against Russia, with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hoping to follow in his footsteps with her own run for office, but during their tenures both failed to bring about any significant change from the Bush administration. In fact, they made things worse — making illicit deals with the Kremlin with promises of “more flexibility"" after the 2012 election.

In Sen. Rand Paul, America has an alternative.

Perhaps the most memorable example in recent history of an American politician engaging Russia directly with firm dialogue was when President Ronald Reagan successfully negotiated with Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall in the '80s.

It was under Reagan that “peace through strength"" was exemplified in the modern era, and for arguably the first time, the country saw that a nation does not have to dominate its foes on the battlefield in order to triumph.

Today, the United States and Russia possess about 90 percent of the world's nuclear warheads.

Like Reagan, Paul knows that peace talks with Russia are vital if Americans want to avoid a foreign war that neither nation would win.

“We should have more dialogue with Russia ... we need better dialogue so we won't have an accidental nuclear engagement,"" the senator, who has consistently lobbied for an end to expensive foreign wars, said.

Paul's views have seemingly steered U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump toward a new direction.

Trump has adopted a new tone that will surely resonate with the American people, arguing that it is time to “bring the troops home"" and end the useless foreign wars that the U.S. is currently involved in.

Since the budding friendship began, Trump has called for the withdrawal of American troops in Afghanistan and Syria.

After Trump announced that U.S. troops would be removed from Syria, Paul was one of the few who praised Trump's decision.

Trump noticed, and doubled down on his decision to bring the troops home, tweeting a quote from Paul:

It should not be the job of America to replace regimes around the world. This is what President Trump recognized in Iraq, that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades, and he's right...The generals still don't get the mistake.

Paul also defended President Trump's attendance at the controversial Helsinki Summit last year, maintaining that dialogue and diplomacy with Russia can help combat Islamic terrorism and potentially end the war in Syria.

“Russia doesn't need to be considered our friend. But we certainly have overlapping interests — Syria, Islamic terrorism and energy — that require us to have an open dialogue and relationship,"" Paul wrote in a recent op-ed for Politico.

While Paul hopes the United States will continue to engage in diplomacy with the Kremlin, he comes from a position of strength when criticizing Russia as well, authoring an op-ed in 2014 that slammed Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine as a “gross violation of that nation's sovereignty and an affront to the international community.""

In this regard, Paul shows the world that peace can be obtained without sacrificing or diminishing the democratic values America holds dear.

“Politicizing international affairs is a dangerous game, but that hasn't stopped far too many in Washington, who seem to have forgotten that a vital part of keeping America safe and secure is avoiding war through strong and consistent diplomacy, from playing politics,"" Paul said.

In calling for an end to the foreign wars the United States seemingly finds itself ever-immersed in, Paul embodies the “real patriot"" George Washington referred to in his farewell address, steering President Trump's foreign policy toward a cautious neutrality with other nations while distancing American troops and resources from endless conflict.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/cash-covid-and-coverup-part-4-the-virus-that-didn-t-bark,2019-02-11
"Commentary: Tommy Robinson wasn't 'convicted of journalism' — he was convicted of illegal immigration, assaulting a cop, and fraud. He is no hero.","Editorial note and apology: During the discussion below about Robinson's first arrest, the article correctly noted that Robinson was arrested and convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault with intent to resist arrest. The article stated, without sufficient factual backing, that the domestic argument that occasioned the police officer's intervention escalated to the point of being physical. A representative for Mr. Robinson reached out to TheBlaze and disputed this characterization, stating that the argument with his girlfriend was merely verbal, while it is admitted that Mr. Robinson struck an off-duty police officer who attempted to intervene. In the absence of any specific evidence to the contrary, it should not have been stated that Robinson struck his girlfriend. While researching this story, we focused on original source documents where available and contemporary reports when they were not. During the initial controversy over Robinson's previous incarceration for contempt, the British government refused to comment on Robinson's case, which erroneously led media reports to conclude that he had not in fact actually been transferred. It turns out that he was. It is true, however, that his team did wildly exaggerate the Muslim population in HMP Onley. We apologize for the error.



In England in October 2018, a 15-year-old Syrian refugee was attacked by his classmates. The boy — who was wearing a cast because, according to him, his wrist had been broken in a previous bullying incident — was dragged down to the ground by his neck while his attacker said, ""I'll drown you,"" and then attempted to waterboard him with a water bottle.

Previously, this same Syrian refugee's sister had attempted to commit suicide at school because of anti-Muslim taunting and assaults she received. The perpetrators in both cases were revealed to be avid fans of a man who has found himself in the news in the United States recently — a man named Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, whom you might know as Tommy Robinson.

Robinson quickly sprang to the defense of his 16-year-old fan who was accused of assaulting the boy. He interviewed the attacker, who claimed that the reason for the attack was that the Syrian refugee — who was Muslim — had bullied two non-Muslim schoolgirls and that the school authorities had refused to do anything about it.

Stop me when this begins to sound familiar.

Robinson even said he had proof: He provided a screenshot from a text conversation with another student's mother who claimed that her daughter had been bullied by the Syrian refugee. He also posted a photo that he claimed was from the school that purportedly showed that gangs of Muslim youth were beating up white children in England.

There was only one problem: The proof was all fake. The mother who was supposed to have texted Robinson about her daughter learned about the allegation and protested that she never made such statements to Robinson. Furthermore, the photo that purportedly showed gang violence at the school was actually ripped from a completely unrelated news article about a teenage cancer patient in Britain. Eventually, Robinson confessed that the image was fake and that the text message was not genuine, and then issued a bizarre, flippant apology in which he blamed the entire incident on having been faked out by liberals.

Convicted of journalism?

Robinson was sentenced to jail Thursday for contempt of court. His crime dates back to May 25, 2018, when he recorded a video of himself outside Leeds Crown Court, confronting defendants in a trial who had been accused of grooming underage girls for rape and trafficking in sexual slavery. The legal proceedings against him have been complex and convoluted, but the bottom line is that he now faces a prison sentence for contempt of court as a result of having violated a court order that prohibited his livestream.

Robinson is in the news now because he made his way onto the Alex Jones show to plead for asylum in the United States, and has received sympathetic coverage in some conservative circles after Donald Trump Jr. tweeted his support for Robinson's plea. Trump Jr.'s tweet at least suggests that the president is taking the plea seriously, or might soon.

Back to the video that started this whole incident. In the video, Robinson claimed that no one was taking these crimes seriously. The British government and the courts were conspiring to provide leniency to Muslim offenders to avoid seeming discriminatory, he said. Yet, the jury was about to resume deliberations about the fate of these Muslim men — who were eventually convicted of their crimes.

On the surface, Robinson's complaint might have seemed odd. After all, the event that attracted Robinson's attention was ... a criminal trial featuring these men, which means that police had arrested them, prosecutors had prosecuted them, and a jury was about to decide on lengthy prison sentences for them. Indeed, the trials Robinson protested would result in 16 men being sentenced to a combined total of 220 years. The story became a national news item in Britain because of the reporting of outlets like the BBC and Examiner Live, which publicized the story well before Robinson latched onto it as a cause celebre.



Additionally, Robinson's behavior was puzzling for another reason — he had been here before. He was found in contempt for doing this exact same thing in May 2017 (when he was again ""exposing"" a story that had been reported in the media) and he surely knew that what he was about to do will get him sent to prison.

The crimes being tried during the 2018 trial were first reported in March of 2017, with reports appearing in both the BBC and Examiner Live. According to Examiner Live, the West Yorkshire Police initially arrested 27 men on rape, trafficking, and child sex charges for offenses that occurred between 2004 and 2011 against victims as young as 11. Two women were charged with child neglect.

So, by the time Robinson was berating the defendants outside the Leeds Crown Court, the crimes of the so-called Huddersfield Grooming Gang had been public knowledge for more than a year — including extensive reporting by the BBC, which is literally funded by the British government.

If the British government was really trying to cover up these crimes, as Robinson has claimed to a credulous United States audience, then they might have made a smarter play than having their government-funded press organ repeatedly cover them.

Robinson's first contempt conviction was a result of a similar action on May 8, 2017, during which Robinson recorded video outside the Canterbury Crown Court during a trial for four rape suspects. The four men were convicted of gang-raping a 16-year-old girl who had come by their restaurant intoxicated.

Robinson was there to expose pedophiles, he claimed, and police were trying to stop him by ... enforcing clearly posted rules that attempting to record or photograph at the court may result in an arrest for contempt. During his sentencing, the judge reminded him that security had warned him of the potential violation.

The identities of the suspects had been published in various mainstream media outlets, such as the Daily Mail, in the days before Robinson's appearance at the courthouse, with the exception of a teenage suspect who, at the time, was believed to be a minor.

In both cases, according to families of the victims, local media reported on these crimes before Robinson ever got involved. They didn't need exposing. They were already in the news and on trial.

The U.K.'s strict contempt of court laws are not for the purpose of covering up crimes; they exist to preserve fair trials and prevent the outside influences from reaching juries. They are there, in other words, to make sure that criminals get punished rather than being let off after their lawyers argue that one of the jurors saw Robinson's inflammatory videos during deliberations.

Since Robinson has been banned from the major social media platforms, it's unclear when he began talking about these cases initially. However, it is clear that whatever Robinson was doing at Canterbury Crown Court and Leeds Crown Court on the days he committed contempt of court, he was not exposing any hidden crimes.

So what is he doing? And, why is he doing it?

To understand that, you have to understand where Tommy Robinson comes from.

Who is Tommy Robinson?

Before he was Tommy Robinson, he was Stephen Yaxley-Lennon of Luton, Bedfordshire. His biological father left the family when he was 2 years old, and his hyphenated last name stands as a symbol that he was raised by his mother and her second husband.

From a young age, Robinson had issues with Muslims. He has openly talked about getting into fights with Muslim gangs while in school and recalled wider conflicts between white students and Muslim students. The Muslim men at the school ""always seemed to be waiting for trouble,"" Robinson told the Telegraph.

Luton, an industrial town, had attracted a significant Muslim population from places such as Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Even after his school days, Robinson found himself clashing with Muslims at Luton Town Football Club matches, because the stadium was located in a Muslim part of town. It was during those fights, Robinson has said, that he learned ""you either back down or get your head kicked in.""

After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S. turned a bright spotlight on radical Islamic terror, Robinson founded a group called ""Ban the Luton Taliban"" after allegedly seeing Muslims recruit men to fight for the Taliban in Afghanistan.

In 2004, Robinson spent a year or so as a member of the overtly racist, anti-immigration, anti-Muslim British National Party. The party's constitution dictated that only whites could join, until 2010 when it was forced by legal pressure to amend its constitution to, at least in word, allow non-white members.

Some of the stated goals in the party's 2005 election manifesto included ""abolishing multiculturalism"" and a claim that ""multi-racialism"" is a ""recipe for disaster."" The party was especially preoccupied with reversing the ""Islamification"" of Britain.



Robinson has said he left the party due to its opposition to him having black friends. Still, even having left that party, Robinson didn't stray far from the driving belief that the No. 1 enemy of his country is Islam.

In 2009, when a Muslim group called Al Muhajiroun protested a homecoming parade for British soldiers who were returning from Afghanistan in Luton, Robinson led protests against them that resulted in the formation of the English Defense League, a rowdy, often violent anti-Muslim group that gained national attention.

It was at this point that the man who would become famous as Tommy Robinson — even though that was not his name and he had used numerous other aliases in the past — gained national attention. After years of conflict with Muslims and growing anti-Muslim perceptions, when Yaxley-Lennon took the mantle as de facto leader of the EDL, he adopted the pseudonym Tommy Robinson after the name of a local soccer hooligan firm. His battle against Islam made him a nationally — and eventually internationally — known figure.

Robinson quit the EDL in 2013, saying he was put off by the fact that neo-Nazis were growing in influence within the group, and because Robinson was internally questioning the effectiveness of combating radical Islam without the help of moderate Muslims.

During an interview with the Telegraph in 2013, while discussing his exit from the EDL, Robinson took an EDL wristband off his arm, tossed it to the reporter, and said, ""I don't want anyone else to represent me. I want to be representing myself.""

Robinson's long and repeated criminal history



Throughout his Luton upbringing and into adulthood, Robinson has had some serious run-ins with the law. In 2005, during a drunken argument with his girlfriend, Robinson used kicked an off-duty police officer attempted to intervene in the head.

The activist was ultimately convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and assault with intent to resist arrest against the, for which he received his first prison sentence. That conviction derailed what looked to be a promising potential career as an aircraft engineer.

If one is inclined to forgive Robinson for assaulting a cop during a domestic dispute with his girlfriend — a crime for which conservatives typically have little or no tolerance — the remainder of Robinson's rap sheet should be enough to convince even the casual observer that this incident was not merely a drunken mistake, but rather part of a pattern with a man who is repeatedly and flagrantly criminal — and in particular, a fraudster.

Some of Robinson's criminal activity can at least plausibly be excused by his allies as part of his, shall we say, vigorous activism. For instance, in 2010, Robinson was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer during clashes at a poppy burning protest. In 2011, he was again arrested and charged with assault for head-butting a man who verbally confronted him during the protest. Later in 2011, he was convicted of leading a riotous mob of soccer fans into a fight with fans of the rival team.

But quite apart from a criminal history that clearly suggests a man who is not in very good control of his temper, Robinson also has the criminal history of a man who is well-practiced — if perhaps not particularly skillful — at concocting elaborate frauds for his own enrichment.

For example, in 2013, Robinson was arrested and charged with using fraudulent documents to travel to the United States. In a bizarre incident, Robinson was literally jailed for having been an illegal immigrant to the United States after using a passport with the name ""Andrew McMaster"" to board a plane to the United States. Because of his lengthy criminal history, Robinson had been denied a visa, so he ""borrowed"" McMaster's to travel here.

Once he arrived at JFK airport in New York City, customs officials took his fingerprints and realized that they did not belong to Mr. McMaster. As they attempted to find him and conduct an interview about this discrepancy, Robinson somehow eluded ICE officials, left the airport, and entered the U.S. illegally. The following day, he returned to England using a passport with the name ""Paul Harris,"" one of several aliases Robinson has used.

If you are struggling to keep up with what you are supposed to call Tommy Robinson, you are not alone. As the judge at his trial remarked:

I am going to sentence you under the name of Stephen Lennon, although I suspect that is not actually your true name, in the sense that it is not the name that appears on your passport.



You knew perfectly well that you were not welcome in the United States. ... You knew that because you tried before and you had not got in, and you knew the reason for that — because, rightly or wrongly, the US authorities do not welcome people in their country who have convictions of the kind that you have.

The judge went on: ""What you did went absolutely to the heart of the immigration controls that the United States are entitled to have. It's not in any sense trivial.""

Robinson was ultimately sentenced to 10 months in prison.

If at this point you are still inclined to be sympathetic to Tommy Robinson, consider the level of sympathy that you would have for a person who had been charged and convicted with multiple assaults in Mexico and deliberately circumvented U.S. immigration law by using a fraudulent passport to enter the United States. Then ask yourself why anyone should feel differently about an illegal immigrant from the United Kingdom.

Almost immediately after his release, Robinson was back in court again, to once again plead guilty to criminal fraud. This time, there was no possible political motive for his fraud; rather, he merely attempted to hoodwink a bank into giving him a mortgage under fraudulent pretenses. In this case, Robinson admitted to conspiring with fraudulent mortgage broker Deborah Rothschild, who used fake pay slips and income statements in order to fraudulently obtain a £160,000 loan from a British bank.

All of which is to say, maybe the word of a person who is known to have used at least four different aliases and has multiple fraud convictions on his record perhaps should not have his word taken at face value.

Is he really a journalism martyr, or just self-profiting criminal?

All of which brings us to the reason that Robinson has become a cause celebre in the United States over the last week or so: his alleged work bringing to light certain instances of admittedly heinous sexual assaults in Britain.



These assaults, in some cases, actually happened. And if Robinson really is responsible for helping bring his perpetrators to justice, then he perhaps deserves credit for that in spite of his unsavory past. Robinson has been leaning on this angle for all he is worth, particularly with an audience in the U.S. that is blissfully ignorant of most of his colorful history and knows only that he is described by the media as ""far right."" In fact, during protests about his contempt conviction and sentencing, Robinson wore a T-shirt that was emblazoned ""Convicted of Journalism"" to drive the point home — and some figures on the American right have picked up his claim and repeated it.

But as with all things pertaining to Robinson, we must ask: Is he telling the truth? Is he actually responsible for shedding light on this situation? Have his efforts helped in this regard — or have they hurt?

It is again important to note here that Robinson was not breaking news about these horrible crimes. He was not the driving force behind these criminals being brought to justice. The crimes and charges had been reported, were being prosecuted, and Robinson's content served more to grow his personal anti-Muslim brand than they did to aid in justice.

By confronting the then-suspects outside of the courthouse to berate them on camera so that he could post the video on his own or his employer's website and social media pages, Robinson was simultaneously profiting himself while potentially jeopardizing the legal proceedings themselves.

Robinson's efforts during the course of the filming incident that landed him in contempt were not calculated to ensure that the heinous criminals in the Huddersfield Grooming Gang received justice. Tommy Robinson is a well known person in Great Britain. A live video stream hosted by Robinson was sure to be seen by tens of thousands of people, as the one that landed him in jail actually was.



At least one of those tens of thousands — perhaps hundreds of thousands — of people might be one of the jurors deciding on the fate of the men at trial.

And if one of those happened to see Robinson filming, spewing invective at the defendants as they entered and left the courtroom, the judge would have had no choice but to grant a mistrial. And all the hard work put in by the police, detectives, and prosecutors — you know, the people who were actually trying to get justice for the victims of the Huddersfield Grooming Gang — would have been thrown out the window.

And that is the reason that Tommy Robinson faces jail time today. Not because he was heroically trying to obtain justice for heinous acts of rape, but because he idiotically and recklessly almost stopped the government from obtaining justice for the victims in the interests of his own self-promotion. The idea that the government was or is trying to sweep the Huddersfield Gang's crimes under the carpet, when they actively prosecuted the offenders (and continued to do so in additional other trials after the one at issue concluded) simply beggars the imagination.

Why should he get asylum in the U.S.?

One final ludicrous claim of Robinson's does bear examination. Robinson claims that he needs asylum in the United States because if he goes to prison, he will be killed by gangs inside the prison. Somewhat more sensationally (and ludicrously), he claims that the actual government of the United Kingdom is trying to kill him.

If you've read this far into what is an admittedly lengthy piece, you will no doubt not be surprised to learn that when he says this, Robinson is full of crap. The truth is that the British government has actually taken absolutely extraordinary measures to protect his safety throughout the course of his numerous incarcerations. During the time he served his sentences for his immigration fraud and mortgage fraud convictions, he spent the entire sentence in protective custody because of the perceived danger to his life as a controversial public figure in Britain. The judge who sentenced him in the mortgage fraud case even specifically mentioned the expense of providing for Robinson's protection as a reason for not giving him a longer sentence.

It should be noted that Robinson and his camp have been caught flat out lying about the conditions of his imprisonment before. During the course of his prior incarceration for contempt, Robinson claimed through his representatives that he had been moved from a prison that was ""2 per cent Muslim"" to a prison that was ""71 per cent Muslim."" These claims were repeated uncritically by Alex Jones, the same conspiracy theorist to whom Robinson ran with his plea for asylum in the United States.

However, they were at best wild exaggerations. The prison he was transferred to (and ultimately, safely released from) had a Muslim population of 14 percent, which is substantially different from 71 per cent. In fact, no prison in the UK has anything close to a 71 percent Muslim population.

The facts are clear

Robinson is not being jailed for the crime of journalism, as he claims.

He is being jailed because he almost allowed men who committed heinous crimes to go free.

Furthermore, he is no hero, as he claims. He is a repeat criminal and a repeat fraud whose main interest throughout the course of his career has been his own self-aggrandizement by feeding off the fear and ignorance of others.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/china-lockdowns-party-dangerous,2019-07-12
Communist-friendly Bernie Sanders' surge is the fulfillment of the left's longtime hatred for what America has always stood for,"Bernie Sanders was so uninspired by the Miracle on Ice in 1980 that eight years later he was honeymooning in Moscow. Do you believe in miracles, Bernie? Nah, too busy seizing the means of production, I guess. And he was actually living out his honeymoon bliss when the Soviet Union's devious wish-casting about communism had nearly come to its wretched close.

Yet here he is, 40 years later and nearly 80 years-old himself, somehow having catapulted himself to the top of the Democratic pack in the race to become the next president of these United States. That should literally be impossible in this land of ours, but the progressive religion now competing for our souls has a bizarro world of dumpster fire miracles to offer all its own.

In that realm, Sanders excusing Fidel Castro's murderous ways as mere bumps in the road on the way to wonderful literacy programs is easily digestible propaganda. Especially when standing next to the, ahem, grotesque shock and awe of the actual Miracle on Ice players celebrating the anniversary of their achievement with the current president, Donald Trump.

Trigger warning: Some of them wore the terrible red baseball hats of your worst nightmares and everything.

Former cable news apparatchik Soledad O'Brien tweeted, ""Ugh.... so disappointed by the @1980MiracleTeam. I loved that game as a kid with my dad. Loved watching the movie with my kids. To see them on a stage, in MAGA hats — kinda crushing I have to say.""

The funny thing here is that being of Cuban dissent herself, O'Brien is — per her Twitter feed — rather conflicted right now about Sanders. Yet she still can make plenty of time to get her undies in a bunch about a celebration that could have just as easily been ignored by her, like a grown up who ignores a musician or actor who campaigns for a politician they don't like but is still willing to attend their concerts or movies.

Do you believe in Miracles, Soledad? No, just dying to virtue signal those guys for beating the Communists and then having the nerve to actually be free and stuff.

Because this really isn't about any differences two America haters might have but their similarities as destroyers of worlds. They, those who vote for them, or have engaged in journalism like them, share in common a deep-seated iconoclasm where hatred of the traditional other is paramount. There is no other explanation for why one of the single greatest sporting/pop culture moments in all of American history — beating the Russians in hockey — can give people the existential vapors if celebrated by the wrong person, yet a Castro cheerleader can be living his best life now.

It's because of the same people. It's because the National Anthem isn't an honorable melody to them. It's a threat.

Sure, Trump is likely to win the coming election as long as the economy doesn't tank, but the ethos that has fueled and sustained Bernie all these years is clearly close to permanently winning the day. Freedom is running on fumes, so much so that a ridiculous personality like his and his brazen tyrant-humping will barely get in the way of being nominated by one of our two major parties for the nation's highest office.

Bernie and his plans for the rest of us seem to eventually be, in fact, inevitable. For this isn't a hijacking of the Democrat Party he is engaged in. No, he is fulfilling it.

Do the rest of us still believe in miracles? We better.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-aoc-uninformed-about-afghanistan,2020-02-26
Commentary: Rep. Dan Crenshaw is right: Religion is the bedrock of a moral society,"Last Sunday, Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R) tweeted that religion is the ""bedrock for a moral society, because it shows us that morality is absolute, not relative or subject to popular cultural whims.""

And he's right.

The laws of a country that are founded on the Law of Moses and the teachings of Jesus are unshakable, but laws rooted in secularism are like quicksand and subject to fail or slip into chaos and oppression.

During its formative years, America became known for its virtue, republicanism, and unrelenting support for individual liberty, which were all based on the Laws of Moses and the teachings of Jesus beginning on Mount Sinai.

These moral laws brought down from the mountain by Moses firmly established God's expectations for humanity.

The Bible (Good News Translation) says in Proverbs 29:18 that, ""A nation without God's guidance is a nation without order.""

When Israel honored God, he blessed them. When they disobeyed Him, they were lost in the wilderness for 40 years. This punishment was a harsh lesson for the Israelites.

God gave us these commandments to serve as a moral framework so that his children could discern what's right and wrong.

In Romans, we are taught that not only are God's laws ""holy and righteous and good,"" they're ""spiritual.""

A moral society should then aspire to follow this moral framework set forth by God because it provides us with instructions on how to exist with each other and with God.

And to deviate from them only leads to emptiness, isolation, and purposelessness.

Of course, not all the American Founding Fathers practiced a religion, some of them were deists, but they all agreed that the foundation of morality was rooted in the belief in God.

In fact, many of their early writings were brimming with spiritual overtones, i.e., The Declaration of Independence.

""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights...""

The most famous phrase being ""unalienable Rights"" was derived from Judeo-Christian teachings which recognizes that everyone is created equal before God.

Whether secularists choose to believe this or not, we are all created in God's image.

Religion forged Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and it was revolutionary at the time. It was also a dramatic shift for a president who historians say flirted with atheism.

The obvious contradiction when speaking of individual liberty is that this wasn't afforded to slaves or indentured servants at the time of America's founding. However, the founders knew that in order to establish the Constitution, they had to make concessions to this necessary evil or they risked losing the Constitution entirely.

We learned a harsh lesson about what happens when we defy God's laws. Slavery almost tore this country apart and we fought the bloodiest war ever wrought on American soil to end it.

The church

If you compare the American Revolution to the French Revolution, it's worth noting that Europeans, unlike the early Americans, believed that liberty was the enemy of religion.

In fact, they were astonished when they observed that one of the most enlightened societies of the 19th century was openly religious, as observed by author W. Cleon Skousen in the ""Five Thousand Year Leap.""

During French diplomat Alexis de Tocqueville's stay in America in 1831, he noticed that freedom and religion — even amongst the differing sects — were ""intimately united,"" which was unheard of at the time.

De Tocqueville found this marriage between the new republic and religion indispensable and so should we.

As de Tocqueville put it:

""Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did I understand the secret of her genius and power. America is great because America is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great. The safeguard of morality is religion, and morality is the best security of law as well as the surest pledge of freedom.""

Former U.S. President John Adams said it best when he said, ""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.""

Sadly, Americans have lost faith in important institutions, churches being chief among them.

According to a Gallup poll, confidence in the church sank to an all-time low of 38 percent in 2018.

Revolution and violence

A violent period during the French Revolution (1789) serves as a grim reminder of what happens when morality is defined by man instead of God.



During the ""Reign of Terror"" in 1793, the French expelled thousands of priests and turned to the deistic Cult of the Supreme Being and the atheistic Cult of Reason put forth by Maximilien Robespierre.

When man defined morality according to their terms as witnessed in France's reign of terror, heads literally rolled.

Irish statesman Edmund Burke, who was critical of the French Revolution, believed that God is necessary for the social fabric of a society.

In his most notable work, ""Reflections on the Revolution in France,"" Burke asserted that the French Revolution was doomed because of its outright rejection of religion arguing that they were ""against, not only our reason but our instincts.""

To Burke, Christianity led society to progress and without God, it was bound to unravel.

He also foretold of the wars that would wreak havoc on Europe thanks in part to the radical changes to institutions that spawned from the French Revolution, and he was right.

The French Revolution led directly to the dictatorship of Napoleon and the Napoleonic wars that ravaged Europe, and which led (directly or indirectly) to conflict between the French and Prussians/Germans that would break out into war in 1870, World War I, and World War II.

The effects of the Chinese Communist Revolution, which required its members to pledge an oath to Marxist atheism, had negative and lasting effect on the Chinese people.

During the Great Leap Forward under former Chairman Mao Zedong, an estimated 20 to 48 million Chinese citizens were killed— more than twice as many as were killed in the Holocaust.

But unlike the Chinese Communist Revolution, what made the American Revolution different and its legacy lasting was its regard for morality derived from God and not man.

The Chinese Communist Revolution and the French Revolution was a far cry from what America witnessed because of this.

This isn't to say that if we believe in God alone, He will solve all our problems because He won't, especially if we are a society that rejects His son and His commandments.

The morality of the creator becomes embedded in its creation

God makes it very clear in the Bible that nations who turn from Him will perish.

Proverbs 14:34 (New International Version) reminds us that ""Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin condemns any people.""

America is currently lost in the wilderness because we've rejected the idea that morality is derived from God's supreme laws (just check the comments under Crenshaw's tweet).

Instead, we've relied on our own intellect or even a political party's because it feels good and because they told us everything we want to hear. President Donald Trump isn't going to solve this nation's problems and neither is New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D).

The government cannot solve your problems, only faith in God can help you.

That wilderness is the cultural whims Crenshaw referenced in his tweet last Sunday.

The belief that God is no longer needed, and that man's explanation is supreme isn't going to cut it.

The suicide rate is at its highest in half a century according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Planned Parenthood is killing up to 332,757 babies a year; the divorce rate is over 50 percent, and the only thing Americans can agree on is that we're divided on virtually every issue.

We can't agree on the economy, on racial issues, climate change, abortion, and even gender.

The idea that you can murder a baby inside a mother's womb, the distorted idea that you can choose your gender, or that you can covet your neighbor's lot, is not rooted in what made this country great, it's rooted in a hollow intellect set forth and reliant upon man's meek intellect.

America can only be saved from itself by grace alone.

Founding Father Thomas Jefferson suggested that when dealing with religious problems among the various states, religious institutions of all kinds should use their influence to provide the stability needed for the benefit of the government as documented by Skousen.

Until we acknowledge that morality is objective and rooted in God, we'll continue operating on the whims of a culture that perpetuates the reductions in freedom and the inability to exist peacefully with one another.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-rand-paul-diplomacy-ideas,2019-03-21
How Christians should respond to religious oppression in the coronavirus era,"Nails on the ground blocking cars from entering a church parking lot, and authorities ordering anyone caught attending a drive-up service to be quarantined for two weeks. Police writing $500 citations for church attendance and arresting Christians offering assistance and alternatives to women about to get abortions.

These are real incidents in the United States over just the past few weeks. Jarring infringements on the freedom of religious expression, allegedly in service of public health. How should Christians respond?

Know the rules, obey them whenever possible

""Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves"" (Romans 13:1-2).

Christians sometimes misinterpret this passage. The Apostle Paul does not call for blind submission to all authority, even if that authority commands you to sin. There are limits (more on that later). But he does clearly establish the mandate to respect authority when possible, and not to rebel unnecessarily.

Rebellion based in ignorance, or rebellion simply for the sake of conflict or attention, is unhelpful, and unbiblical. Resist authority only when the authority is unrighteous or unjust. One must know the laws in order to know when they are unjust.

When a Christian is harassed by an authority while obeying the law, it exposes the authority's corruption, and reveals the anti-Christian motive behind the harassment. A Christian who is needlessly violating the law, however, is simply a lawbreaker and the authority will be perceived as justified, even if the motive is corrupt.

It's quite easy to take advantage of someone who doesn't know the rules of the game. Such a person is vulnerable to deception and oppression. Christians should work to educate themselves, not only on their basic rights as Americans, but on the specific rules and guidelines authorities have instituted to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Be wise, and love others

""Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves"" (Matthew 10:16, English Standard Version).

John Gill, in his Exposition of the Bible, explains this verse in a way that applies very directly to our current situation (emphasis mine):

""The serpent is a very sharp-sighted, cunning creature, and uses various arts and stratagems for its own preservation, and especially of its head; and is so far to be imitated by the followers of Christ, as to make use of all proper methods to preserve themselves from the insults and rage of men, and not expose themselves to unnecessary dangers: and, as much as in them lies, they should be careful to give no just occasion of offense, or irritate, and provoke them to use them ill, and to avoid all snares and traps that are laid for them; and, at the same time, maintain the innocence and harmlessness of the dove, being free from all wicked cunning and craftiness, without rancor, malice, and wrath; not meditating and seeking revenge, but meek and humble in their deportment, leading inoffensive lives, and proceeding in the course of their calling, though liable to many insults, and much oppression.""

Wisdom means avoiding unnecessary danger. Gathering large crowds for Sunday service during a pandemic may be unwise. It may also cause offense to those in the community, Christian or otherwise, who would prefer the threat of contagion be treated with more caution. Is it necessary to put a target on your own back, and to potentially endanger others? Does that advance the gospel? Does that draw more attention to Christ, or to you? The answers to these questions are situational, but worth consideration by all.

Wisdom and faith are not mutually exclusive. It could be wise to suspend normal, large in-person gatherings for a time, and it would also require faith to believe that the God you worship can sustain his people even if they can't sit in the pews.

Know when (and how) to take a stand

""Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, 'O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you. If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. He will rescue us from your power, Your Majesty. But even if he doesn't, we want to make it clear to you, Your Majesty, that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up'"" (Daniel 6:16-18 NLT).

Note reason for rebellion here; they were being ordered to sin. Note the tone of the rebellion; firm, decisive, yet respectful. Note the courage; we will face the consequences of this decision whether God shields us from them or not.

Unnecessary conflict can do more harm than good to the reputation and advancement of the Christian faith. At the same time, unnecessary concession can lead to a forfeiture of rights which cannot be reversed. Aggressors do not respond to concessions by relenting; if you give up a right today that you should've held onto, they will come back for another tomorrow.

Christians operating in secular society don't have to go out of their way to find resistance. We don't have to start trouble. Jesus told us that the world will hate us because it hated him first. Opposition will come. And when it does, we must be uncompromising in our principles, immovable in our convictions, radical in our love for others, and above reproach in our words and demeanor, as Christ himself was in the face of far more extreme persecution.

""I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me. Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows. But take heart, because I have overcome the world"" (John 16:33 NLT).",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-tommy-robinson-is-no-hero-and-he-wasnt-convicted-of-journalism,2020-04-14
Horowitz: 120 doctors ask JAMA to retract misleading Colombian study downplaying efficacy of ivermectin,"We knew this would happen. The health establishment didn't use fabricated data from a study authored by a science fiction writer and porn star (later retracted), as they did with hydroxychloroquine, but it was almost as bad.

No, they didn't find any harm from ivermectin, but after every study showing the amazing efficacy of ivermectin against SARS-CoV-2 at every stage of the disease, the media breathlessly promoted a Colombian study supposedly showing no statistically meaningful benefit among those COVID-19 patients who were treated with it.

Last month, a group of Colombian researchers published a study inthe Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) concluding that, contrary to the findings of every other study, ivermectin showed no signs of bettering outcomes in COVID-19 patients in Cali, Colombia. ""Among adults with mild COVID-19, a 5-day course of ivermectin, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve the time to resolution of symptoms,"" concluded the authors. ""The findings do not support the use of ivermectin for treatment of mild COVID-19, although larger trials may be needed to understand the effects of ivermectin on other clinically relevant outcomes.""

After ignoring dozens of other studies on ivermectin for months, the New York Times got hold of this study the day it was published and penned an article titled, ""Popular Drug Does Not Alleviate Mild Covid-19 Symptoms, Study Finds."" I immediately thought this sounded suspicious, given all the evidence that ivermectin helps against even more severe symptoms.

It turns out that the study design was flawed from the beginning, in addition to the fact that the study's own results do not bear out the conclusion posited by the authors. In a letter signed by 120 doctors, concerned clinicians who have successfully treated patients with ivermectin note the following flaws with the design:

The study's flaws span subject population, design, execution and controls. The small sample size (n = 400) had a median age of 37 and a BMI of 26, making them extremely low risk for COVID-19 hard endpoints. Faced with this low-relevance study group, the study authors improperly changed primary endpoint midway, moving the main endpoint to full symptom resolution by day 21. This self-reported subjective endpoint, obtained through telephone survey, is not credible for avoiding nondifferential nullward bias of the results.

Anyone who has paid attention this past year knows that people in their 30s who aren't overweight rarely get severe symptoms, and most suffer quite unremarkable symptoms that are some degree less than a flu. To attempt to prove improved outcomes with a group like this never made any sense.

The letter also highlights three other flaws with the study:

The authors incorrectly administered ivermectin on an empty stomach, reducing drug bioavailability in lung tissue, the critical drug target, by a factor of roughly 2.5. Additionally, ivermectin is readily available over-the-counter in Colombia, where sales have been ubiquitous (1.6 doses per COVID-19 case) in Cali during the study period.[2] Lack of serum testing in the study prevented identification of subjects who may have used the drug at intervals longer than the study lookback.

Thus, you literally had a placebo control group where they didn't ensure they were not taking ivermectin! It would be bad enough not to control for this factor (the primary study point) in an area where ivermectin was not widely available. But it turns out that the department of health in the state of Valle del Cauca – where this study took place – began distributing ivermectin to COVID patients right when the study period began.

Also, just from June to July of last year when the study period began, over-the-counter sales of ivermectin in the Cali region quintupled — to the point that there were more doses administered than number of recorded COVID patients. Given the popularity of the drug in that region at that time, it's inconceivable that a number of those who tested positive in the placebo group did not avail themselves to this drug. In fact, so popular was ivermectin in Valle del Cauca during the study period that during the week of July 5, Google searches for ""ivermectina"" outpaced searches for ""vacuna covid"" (COVID vaccine) by a factor of 33.

Contrast that to the U.S., where ivermectin is essentially unknown outside small circles.





Thus, Cali, Colombia, was probably the worst place to study outcomes against those who weren't officially administered ivermectin but were not prevented from taking it on their own preventively, as many people in the region were doing.

The doctors protesting this study originally sent this letter to JAMA to be published, but after JAMA declined, the authors posted it as an open letter on their own landing page.

There are also ethical questions about the Colombian study, because TrialSite News forced the authors to admit that they did not tell the study participants they were receiving ivermectin. Instead, they referred to the drug as ""D11AX22 Molecule."" While this point does not have bearings on the results of the study, it does show they violated participant consent rules, which raises questions about the broad ethics and agenda of the authors.

The Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), which is the lead group in the United States promoting ivermectin as the staple of COVID early therapeutic treatment, wrote a paper calling into question the protocols of the study, noting that a labeling error substituted 38 ivermectin doses as part of the placebo group. They also accuse the authors of a conflict of interest for receiving grants from ""Sanofi Pasteur, a vaccine manufacturer; Janssen, a J&J vaccine partner; and GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, and Gilead, which manufacture COVID-19 drugs.""



Those relationships were properly disclosed on the study's conflict of interest disclosure.

Gilead is the maker of Remdesivir, the super expensive drug that is being used in nearly every hospital with zero evidence of efficacy. Despite its price tag, and the fact that the WHO found Remdesivir use in 11,000 patients across 400 hospitals in the world had ""little or no effect on hospitalized patients with Covid-19,"" it is still being used as the only major treatment.

So why is there such an agenda to discredit other cheap, repurposed drugs but then use expensive, ineffective drugs or questionable vaccines without applying a fraction of the same scrutiny? Follow the money.

Sadly, lives are being lost in the process. As German immunologist Dr. Peter Schleicher recently said , ""It is completely incomprehensible that there is no approval for this [ivermectin] in Germany. We would have thousands fewer deaths to complain about"" (translated from German via Google translate).",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/communist-friendly-bernie-sanders-surge-is-the-fulfillment-of-the-lefts-longtime-hatred-for-what-america-has-traditionally-stood-for,2021-04-16
Horowitz: A freedom spring after the dark winter of tyranny?,"It's not just when you're having fun that time flies. I can't believe it's nearly 11 months since my first article noting that locking down and masking children is a crime against humanity divorced from all science. Yet here we are almost a year later, entering a new spring season, with children being forced to mask in school (assuming they are even in school) and being wrongly treated as vectors of spread rather than the future of our country. The consequences are unfathomable and will plague us for years to come.

Last week, CBC News reported that McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, saw a 90% increase in children admitted for eating disorders, along with a tripling of children patients admitted after suicide attempts over a four-month period.

The culprit? A ""lack of social interaction, increased conflict at home, and the inability to rely on friends as main contributors.""

As a result, the hospital has also seen double the admissions for drug-related psychosis.

Sadly, there is nothing unique to Canada. It's occurring everywhere in the world where children were shut out of school and where adults selfishly projected their own fears upon children. In places like Los Alamos, New Mexico, emergency responders saw a tripling of suicides during the first eight months of the lockdowns. In August, the CDC reported that 25% of young adults considered suicide, yet the agency has failed to fundamentally change its policies in the ensuing months.

It didn't have to be this way. Even if one agreed with the unprecedented masking and social isolation of adults, the science was clear from day one that children were less at risk either to get sick from or to spread the virus than from typical seasonal pathogens. We could have left children alone to live much of their normal lives and routines.

Ironically, in September 2019, just months before the coronavirus outbreak became apparent in Wuhan, Johns Hopkins wrote a paper for the World Health Organization gaming out ""Preparedness for a High-Impact Respiratory Pathogen Pandemic."" Hopkins, which became a leading voice for lockdowns just a few months later, warned about the severe consequences of ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"" (NPIs).

""During an emergency, it should be expected that implementation of some NPIs, such as travel restrictions and quarantine, might be pursued for social or political purposes by political leaders, rather than pursued because of public health evidence,"" warned the team from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""WHO should rapidly and clearly articulate its opposition to inappropriate NPIs, especially when they threaten public health response activities or pose increased risks to the health of the public.""

Well, several months later, those political NPIs are exactly what Hopkins recommended. Officials destroyed the health of a generation of children, all for politics, when they knew from day one that this virus was not a danger to children. The evidence from day one showed lockdowns of children would be all pain and no gain, yet Hopkins refused to heed its own advice from September 2019.

""It is necessary to further study the effectiveness of NPIs in a variety of contexts to ensure that they are employed properly with a strong evidence base, and that the value of taking any specific NPI intervention in a particular pandemic setting is not outweighed by the potential harm,"" warned the authors, prophetically. ""It is important to communicate to political leaders the absence of evidence surrounding many NPI interventions and the adverse consequences that may follow them.""

To this day, we never hear a word from people like Anthony Fauci or CDC Director Rochelle Walensky about the negative consequences of COVID cult-like living on children or anyone else. In fact, this is not even a case of the consequences outweighing the benefits, because there are zero benefits to lockdown. We didn't need 12 months of evidence after lockdowns were implemented to predict they'd fail. The same Hopkins paper predicted this just months before. Here is the money quote:

In the context of a high-impact respiratory pathogen, quarantine may be the least likely NPI to be effective in controlling the spread due to high transmissibility. To implement effective quarantine measures, it would need to be possible to accurately evaluate an individual's exposure, which would be difficult to do for a respiratory pathogen because of the ease of widespread transmission from infected individuals. Quarantine measures will be least effective for pathogens that are highly transmissible, have short incubation periods, and spread through true airborne mechanisms, as opposed to droplets.

It was known from day one that this virus was highly transmissible like a cold and that there was no way we could stop the spread of it as we could of Ebola. Shortly afterward, it became apparent that this virus is transmitted through aerosols, not through droplets, which is why it spread like wildfire even after all the measures were strictly adhered to. It's also why masks became useless.

If one had to list the pros of masking and isolation on one side of a paper, and the short and long-term harms on the other side, the pro side would be blank and the con side would not have enough room to enumerate all of the ways we are destroying the social, mental, emotional, physical, developmental, and educational health of our kids.

Now, as more kids finally return to school, the same people who destroyed their lives for a year are now suggesting that they should strictly wear masks and be yelled at all day for not wearing them properly. ""Oh, it's just a mask, what's the harm?"" they ask. Yet anyone with a modicum of common sense understands that a mask, aside from the physical harms, serves as a constant reminder for children to needlessly fear this virus and one another. Would we ever treat our pets this way?



Thankfully, the public is finally starting to fight back. People took to the streets to demonstrate in cities throughout the world , including in nearly every country in Europe. Police in Austria even joined in with the protesters. The question for us is whether Americans will lead the freedom spring marches or follow far behind Europe.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/dan-crenshaw-is-right-religion-is-the-bedrock-of-a-moral-society,2021-03-22
Horowitz: It’s time to ban ‘gun-free’ death zones,"President Biden asked the most salient question following the Uvalde school massacre. “When in God’s name will we do what we all know in our gut needs to be done?” asked the president, after a rare reference to scripture. He’s exactly right. We all know that 100% of school shootings in recent years have taken place where everyone except for the attacker was barred from being armed with a gun or rifle. The time has come to ban the ban on guns at school.

We can debate the root cause behind the unmistakable rise in school shootings over the past decade or two. But clearly, between the mental health crisis, the breakdown of family and religion, and the incessant social media glorification of tragedy upon which so many psychopaths lock their minds, we are in a vicious cycle of copycat attacks targeting schools, among other places.

Throughout the coming days, we will hear many statistics thrown around. But the most important statistic relevant to this issue is “100.” Yes, 100% of school shootings over the past two decades have occurred in places where it was illegal for any parent, teacher, or administrator to carry a gun. Even the most ardent supporter of gun control knows that there will always be numerous forms of firearms available to any sadistic mass murderer. The only question is: Will he be the only one armed and know with full confidence that he can kill scores of people before being stopped?

Obviously, we need a standard, set by local officials, to have one point of entry into schools while they are in session, with a security detail manning that entry. But that is not good enough. Security or police officers are identifiable to the attacker, and if the assailant successfully takes out the guard, he knows that he has free rein in the rest of the “gun-free zone.” This point was not lost on the Buffalo attacker when he wrote in his manifesto : “Areas where” carrying with a concealed weapon “ are outlawed or prohibited may be good areas of attack .” It won’t be lost on the next mass murderer either.

While it is hard to prevent every attack and avoid any loss of life every time, it is simply a disgrace that someone could mow down as many as 21 people without being stopped. With the unidentifiable element of surprise, having multiple workers and administrators in each school carrying concealed every day – with the requisite training and scenario drills – we can at least make sure that a mass murder of this scale never happens again.

None of this gets to the root of the cause of these loner psychopath shootings, but over time, if the gunmen were mowed down on the spot or, in the worst-case scenario, only after killing the first person, the glory that tantalizes their demented brains, knowing that the faces of victims will be plastered over social media after each one of these massacres, will be neutralized. Yes, these attackers are unique and much harder to deter than typical street murderers. They don’t care about dying. But they do want to claim scalps. It is that desire that is in our power to foil. If following the next few attempts, we all see pictures of a dead attacker lying in a pool of blood at the school entrance rather than faces of 20 children, it would clearly deter the next “copycat,” at least to some extent.

While the news coming out of Uvalde is still murky and conflicting – itself an ominous sign – it’s becoming obvious that this atrocity was not about guns. Police now concede that the attacker walked through an open door and was not confronted by a school resource officer or anyone else. The Wall Street Journal reports that one neighbor claims there was shooting outside for 12 minutes before he even entered the building. Then, once he entered, multiple parents are claiming they urged police to enter the building, and one was even restrained by U.S. Marshals for wanting to charge into the building. Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw told reporters it took at least 40 minutes for officers to enter the building, and even then, it might only have been due to the presence of the Border Patrol agents.

In other words, government failed at all levels to protect the children, but they were sure keen on preventing others from stepping in to fill the void. According to Uvalde County law, as in most counties, “a person commits an offense if the person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly possesses or goes with a firearm … on the physical premises of a school or educational institution, any grounds or building on which an activity sponsored by a school or educational institution.” Furthermore, “It is not a defense to prosecution that the person possessed a handgun and was licensed to carry a handgun.”

That law sure performed well, didn’t it?

What would actually work? Well, obviously there should be an officer stationed at a single entry point into the building at all times. But let’s not forget that such a person will become a clear target, and if he is taken out by an assailant, then there is no backstop. What we need is a form of “sheriff’s posse,” in which local law enforcement deputizes citizens to help take shifts and unassumingly patrol the premises and interior of schools in plain clothes with concealed carry. So many communities are full of retired veterans and law enforcement officers who would love to defend American children on American soil after having sacrificed, usually, for dubious foreign missions. Also, the schools should have training programs for multiple administrators and teachers to carry concealed.



After every school district does this, come back to me if there are any future attacks with so many dead people. And the fewer there are, the less glory of such attacks will be piped into the psychotic minds of future ticking bombs. The more the left invokes Uvalde as a means of disarming private citizens on behalf of the government, the more it appears we need more trained, armed citizens to fill the void left by government.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/heres-how-christians-should-respond-to-religious-oppression-in-the-coronavirus-era,2022-05-27
Horowitz: California courts rule elected DA can’t prosecute BLM rioter because he opposes defund police movement,"George Soros’ organization has successfully installed anarchist district attorneys in many major cities over the past decade. But now that the public is outraged at the growing crime wave, an insurance policy was needed to neuter law-and-order prosecutors who couldn’t be beaten at the ballot box. The California courts have now offered a blueprint that will essentially bar any sane prosecutor from working on a case involving a left-wing anarchist from groups like Black Lives Matter and Antifa.



On September 28, California’s Second District Court of Appeal announced that the San Luis Obispo district attorney’s office, headed by Dan Dow, cannot prosecute seven BLM rioters accused of blocking highways and attacking innocent families because of the district attorney’s “well publicized association with critics of the Black Lives Matter Movement.” Mind you, nearly every judge in major cities is inextricably tied to and even involved in left-wing activism. Yet a prosecutor, who is an elected official and, by definition, doesn’t have to judge fairly like a judge, is now able to be booted from a case for simply expressing pro-law-and-order views. That would disqualify essentially any non-Soros prosecutor.

The court cited a fundraising email sent out by Dow’s wife during his campaign stating the following: “Dan needs to know more than ever that you support him, and he really needs your financial support so he can keep leading the fight in SLO County against the wacky defund the police movement and anarchist groups that are trying to undermine the rule of law and public safety in our community.”

There is no mention of the defendants or even their organization, just a generic opposition to the “defund the police” movement, which would essentially be in any campaign material of even non-wacky Democrats running for prosecutor. What’s next? Are they going to force recusal of any DA who ran against gun violence when confronted with a defendant in a gun crime?

Consider the fact that we now have left-wing prosecutors in D.C. and the entire bureaucracy of the DOJ and the FBI indissolubly tied to anti-conservative activism, and they are able to target conservatives for prosecution simply for their beliefs. On the other hand, nobody can say that Dow was targeting these BLM supporters simply for their speech or beliefs but for their actions. Here is how the California Coast News describes the alleged incident from July 2020 that is the subject of this prosecution from which Dow is now being forced to recuse himself:

Last July, Arata is alleged to have led approximately 300 protesters onto Highway 101 from both Osos Street and California Boulevard, blocking all lanes in both directions for nearly an hour. While on the highway, protesters ran after vehicles attempting to drive off the freeway, blocked vehicles, and yelled profanities at some of the drivers, videos of the protest showed.



Grocott and Lastra were among protesters who encircled a car driven by motorist who was attempting to drive around the protesters.



“One suspect jumped on the hood of the victim’s vehicle and an additional suspect broke the rear window out of the vehicle with a skateboard as the vehicle was leaving the area,” according to the CHP.



Glass shattered on a 4-year-old boy who was sitting in the back seat. The boy was not physically harmed.

Not a single person on January 6 attacked random civilians and children like this, yet every single prosecutor, starting with Attorney General Garland himself, has publicly made it clear they could never be partial in their prosecution of the defendants. Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, has sought jail time and pretrial holding for people accused of minor misdemeanors on January 6. He is married to Fatima Goss Graves, a radical anti-Trump activist who railed against whites and said that white women supported Trump because they are “aided by a toxic mix of racism and disinformation …putting them on the same team as the White men society has been largely built to benefit.” Is Graves being forced to recuse himself when he is clearly seeking a level of prosecution well beyond the scope of the crimes committed by the defendants?

Then again, nobody expects full impartiality from prosecutors, but we do expect it from judges. Yet when it comes to the January 6 defendants, even the judges are able to have blatant conflicts of interests with impunity. Judges are regularly holding the political views of the defendants against them as if they were by themselves a crime. Last week, D.C. federal district Judge Beryl Howell sentenced the Munn family parents to 14 days in prison for simply walking into the Capitol lobby peacefully after the cops had already opened the doors, then expressed approval of the children separating from their parents’ political views, which she viewed as a terrible influence.



This is not just hypocrisy but hierarchy. If you are violent as hell for the cause of the communists, then you can make a prosecutor recuse himself even when there is no sign of bias in treatment. Yet if you are a defendant from the right, the judge can act like the most biased prosecutor, regularly scorn the political views of the defendants, and show completely partial treatment toward the lawyers of the government over the lawyers of the defendants, and nobody will force your recusal.

You have to give them credit. They sure think of everything and make sure to perfectly apply it in a way that maximizes their political outcomes through the justice system – be it the defendants or the plaintiffs. Justice in America is no longer blind; it is dead.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-120-doctors-ask-jama-to-retract-misleading-colombian-study-downplaying-efficacy-of-ivermectin,2022-10-17
Horowitz: CDC: 25% of young adults seriously considered suicide during lockdown,"Anthony Fauci and his mini-mes in state health departments never gamed out the cost of a panicked reaction to the country's mental health. But according to the CDC, one quarter of American young adults have thought about committing suicide since the beginning of this panic epidemic.

According to a brand-new CDC report titled ""Mental Health, Substance Use, and Suicidal Ideation During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"" 25.5% of 18-24-year-olds surveyed in late June had serious thoughts about committing suicide during the previous 30 days. Among 25-44-year-olds, that number was 16% – still shockingly high. On the other hand, it was just 3.8% among those 45-64 and 2.0% among those over 65. The levels of suicidal tendencies overall more than doubled since 2018 and nearly quadrupled for people between 25 and 44.

This survey harmonizes perfectly with another study I've highlighted that shows younger people are, ironically, more scared of dying of the virus than older people. The two are clearly related. They are suicidal because of the degree of panic and anxiety the government has caused both by overstating the threat of the virus and by the lockdowns and social isolation. The sad irony is that younger people are more likely to die in a car accident than from COVID-19.

When so many people seriously consider suicide, many of them follow through with it. In Fresno, California, for example, suicides were up 70% in June compared to the same period in 2019. The National Alliance on Mental Illness Help Line has seen a 65% increase in calls and emails since March, particularly among high schoolers.

Just think of the number of young people turning to drugs in their anxiety. Drug overdose deaths are up 47% this year in Davidson County, Tennessee, for example, where there have been 354 fatal drug overdoses from March through July 25. That dwarfs the number of coronavirus deaths in Nashville.

Perhaps these feelings of desperation in young people are also fueling the rioting and looting. What happens when you tell an entire generation of Americans that they are going to die, especially because of the simple breathing of fellow Americans? We have created a tinderbox of young people who are suffering from anxiety and even suicidal tendencies. Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, on my podcast last week, painted a picture of what he is seeing from a law enforcement perspective. He said that they are dealing a greater degree of edginess and violence in domestic disturbances as a result of this national panic.

""Because people were out of work, kids were home, there was a lot of uncertainty, the media was feeding you with so much conflicting information – when we would go on a domestic call where we used to talk those people down, it now immediately escalated into a fight,"" warned the Arizona sheriff. ""You could just see people's emotions were much higher because we put them in a state of uncertainty and a state of panic and fearmongering.""

He noted how the government is making it even worse by forcing law enforcement to get involved in enforcing these ridiculous coronavirus mandates. ""When you make people feel like they are not safe and the world is coming to an end, all of those things combined create more anxiety and feelings of anger in people so when we show up and now all of a sudden that anger has a chance to be released, it's clashing with law enforcement. Now when you start to have law enforcement engaging with normal citizens and trampling on constitutional rights, you are now pushing that again, creating more intensity and creating more potential situations for blowback.""

Sheriff Lamb has a message for the politicians: ""You guys are only making decisions based on public health, but you are totally disregarding public safety. Your decisions are creating multiple public safety issues.""

If only we had the desire and technology to create a dashboard and count all of the suicides, drug overdoses, violence, and depression cases created by the propagation of panic.

Horowitz: Chairman of the Idaho House Health Committee refuses to hold hearings on dangerous COVID policies,"The state motto of Idaho is Esto Perpetua – ""it is perpetuated,"" as if to say that God's blessing and bounty for the Gem State should last forever. But in the mind of Fred Wood, the state House Health and Welfare Committee chairman, it means that the imperial administrative state and federal executive control over our bodies, property, and health care should be perpetuated and last forever without any legislative check or balance reflecting the will of the people. Who needs California when you have Idaho Republicans who behave like this?

To begin with, it took months to even get the GOP supermajority legislature back in session to place a check on this dangerous executive power. Now that leadership is back in session and rank-and-file members have introduced nine bills to reorient the immoral response on COVID to reflect more compassion, science, parental choice, and informed consent and to restore the doctor-patient relationship, the committee chair flat-out refused to hold hearings on them.

""I profoundly disagree with all nine of them,"" Wood (R), told the Idaho Reports.

""If you don't like that company and you don't like its policy, go work somewhere else,"" Wood said. Wood also added, ""I have the right not to be infected by somebody that has a communicable disease.""

Well, gee, if you have your shot and your mask, and they work so effectively, why does someone else who has not chosen to get these shots affect your health? Moreover, how are you to get another job when it is the federal government forcing all businesses across many industries to require the shots?

Hey, Mr. Wood, if you don't want to be a committee chairman or a legislator, then just resign. How dare you decline to hold a single hearing for 19 months probing both sides of a debate that affects every aspect of our health and wellness? For example, two of the bills being blocked would prevent the state medical licensing board from attacking doctors who actually seek to treat patients with FDA-approved drugs that are infinitely safer than the shots or remdesivir. We have people dying, including those who got both shots, because of a war on treatment. How could Mr. Wood not even conduct a hearing on the state of play with therapeutics and treatment of COVID? How many patients has Mr. Wood treated? I can personally attest to the fact that Dr. Ryan Cole of Boise has saved hundreds of lives, yet he is being attacked by Idaho's licensing board.

Here are some of the commonsense bills rejected by Rep. Wood:

HB 424: Prohibits any person, individual, business, or school from releasing one's vaccination information.

HB 426: Bars any state or local governing entity from discriminating based on injection status or any employer from discriminating against one not showing proof of injection.

HB 428: Affirms a parent's right to consent to any vaccination of his or her child.

HB 432: Bars any requirement of a vaccine that has not been fully approved by the FDA.

HB 433: Bars any licensing board from punishing doctors for prescribing FDA-approved drugs to treat COVID and prohibits pharmacists from blocking such prescriptions.

HB 435: Prohibits any local government from enforcing Biden's injection mandate.

The ball is now in the court of Speaker Scott Bedke. If he really wants to stand up to Biden and support health care freedom, he will make sure these bills get a vote. Six other bills that were routed through other committees did pass the House yesterday. One of them was HB 429, which allows parents to opt out of school mask mandates. Shockingly, 16 Republicans still voted against it, including Wood, House Education Committee Chairman Lance Clow, and House Speaker Scott Bedke, who is also running for lieutenant governor. Wood and Clow also voted against HB 414, which prevents employers from questioning sincerely held religious beliefs in the context of injection mandates. Now these bills head to the even more liberal Senate.

Also, where exactly is Gov. Brad Little when it comes to standing up to Biden and the war on treatment for COVID? The reality is that the shots are not working, people have the right to access safe and effective therapeutics, doctors have the right to prescribe them, and state and federal bureaucrats have no right to block them while coercing people to take unsafe and ineffective therapeutics. I can't think of a more important topic on which to hold a hearing.

What is so disappointing about people like Wood, especially as committee chairmen in critical red states, is not just that they are California liberals ruining red states. It's that they have zero interest in representing the people in what was supposed to be the strongest branch of government and the one closest to the people.

We live in a time when the federal and state bureaucrats are essentially running all of the policies that matter to our lives – and now our bodies – through executive fiat without any legislative oversight. They are directing spending for a sum of COVID funds that is larger than the entire state's general fund. How can it be that committee chairs throughout the country like Wood have zero interest in holding hearings on the shots, remdesivir, hospital treatment, early treatment, masks, lockdowns, conflicts of interests, and spending priorities even from a facially neutral standpoint? Wouldn't he want to call in experts from both sides and get to the bottom of some of these disputes?



For those wondering why there is no check and balance on Biden in a state with 4-1 majorities in the legislature, people like Fred Wood are the culprit. They literally agree with Biden – up to and including his sentiment that somehow the unvaccinated could affect the protection of those who are already supposedly protected ... but the ""protection"" failed to protect them.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-ban-gun-free-death-zones,2021-11-17
Horowitz: Why is Deborah Birx pushing lockdown on behalf of this administration?,"One thing is certain if Joe Biden wins the election: There will be intractable pressure put on states to impose lockdown policies on the citizenry. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris keep promising to pressure the states to maintain strict mask mandates indefinitely. But unfortunately, those policies are already being promoted under this administration by Dr. Deborah Birx. The vexing question of the day is how — and why — she continues to pressure governors to impose failed policies that the president himself has already rejected.

Every week, White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx picks a new state to terrorize with her panic pornography. While Dr. Fauci is the more notorious face of lockdown panic policies in the media, Birx is traveling the country demanding that states follow Joe Biden's policies.

On Saturday, Birx visited local health officials in Rochester, Minnesota, to warn them of rising cases. Minnesota has a liberal governor who has promoted restrictions and mask-wearing as strongly as anywhere in the country, yet the fact is lost on Birx that her own policies have failed to stop the spread. She claimed that the early cold weather drove people indoors and is causing the virus to spread in recent weeks. Well, given that Minnesota has a mask mandate, why should that matter? Ooops, I forgot, masks actually don't work.

""We can see the increase in cases coming and continuing unrelentingly unless together as a community of individuals we do things we know will stop the spread of this virus,"" said Birx.

So, what exactly are the things ""we know"" will stop the spread? What has ever worked anywhere in the world to stop the natural progression of a respiratory virus that has taken over the flu for this year?

In comes Birx with the maniacal idea of mass testing for asymptomatic individuals. ""What we're asking people is to empower their communities by coming forward even when you don't have symptoms to get tested,"" she said.

Earlier this month, she said in Rhode Island that ""asymptomatic, silent spread in the community"" is driving the pandemic (at the 4:30 mark).

First, this is not a new idea. We are testing around 1 million people a day, nearly as many as we test for the flu in an entire flu season. It's not stopping the spread. Isn't it time to take ownership for the results?

Moreover, the president just said that we need to stop using ""cases"" that are overwhelmingly mild (and frequently asymptomatic) as pretext to shut down our lives. Why is she opposing the president's position? There is no fourth branch of government headed by Birx.

Birx, just like Biden, is trying to avoid using the word lockdown, but the idea that we are going to test every person in this country and have super-sensitive tests — rather than symptoms and hospitalizations — driving our policies is a recipe for shutting down every aspect of life. When asymptomatic individuals are included, this virus will likely target a large share of the 330 million people in the country. Remember, there is a lot of academic literature suggesting that a large chunk of the country gets the flu asymptomatically every year, possibly accounting for as many as 50% of those infected. There is nothing new about this virus. Were we to randomly test everyone for the flu every day and propose lockdowns in response, we would never survive as a civilization.



The reality is that despite all the hype and fear surrounding asymptomatic spread, every study that has actually examined transmission has failed to discover widespread asymptomatic transmission that could account for a meaningful percentage of community spread. A contact tracing study of 3,410 close contacts of 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases in a Chinese province near Wuhan during the peak months of the virus found that transmissibility seems to increase commensurately with the severity of symptoms presented by the infected individual. Of the 127 secondary infections that were traced to the original 3,410 cases, just eight were from individuals confirmed as asymptomatic.

The World Health Organization said in May that asymptomatic spread was ""very rare."" Then, like any time a major scientific figure reveals the truth, the WHO suddenly recanted that position when the media raised a howl.

A U.S.-based study from the University of Florida, Gainesville, Department of Biostatistics, observed similar low rates of transmission among the asymptomatic. Researchers found symptomatic individuals transmitted the virus at rates 28 times higher than asymptomatic individuals. Another Chinese study from May found very weak transmission capability among asymptomatic infections.

Early on, when he was still motivated more by science than politics, Dr. Fauci said emphatically, ""Even if there is some asymptomatic transmission, in all the history of respiratory viruses of any type, asymptomatic transmission has never been the driver of outbreaks. He added that ""the driver of outbreaks is always a symptomatic person.""

According to Birx, not only would combating coronavirus necessitate endless lockdowns, but we'd never be able to function even after COVID-19 is eradicated. Given that this virus, especially in recent months, has a fatality rate close to that of the flu, if this is the new threshold for civilization lockdown and government control, then we'd have to do the same for the flu. Taking her position to its logical conclusion, given the pervasiveness of asymptomatic flu, you could be killing elderly people every single year and not even realizing it. And unlike with COVID-19, kids are actually strong vectors for the spread of the flu. Schools would be closed all year and kids perpetually kept away from adults unless they test every day during flu season.

The perplexing question is why is Dr. Birx is still able to tour the country as a Trump administration official and propagate panic that directly conflicts with the espoused views of her boss.

The tragic reality is that focusing on universal lockdowns and testing of the healthy hasn't helped save a single life, even as it has destroyed millions of lives from collateral damage. Nobody contextualized this insanity better than the left-leaning Daily Beast. While noting Italy's strong second wave of cases, the outlet observed that ""the country has done everything experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci have been advising."" These ideas include the following: ""Face masks in public places have been compulsory for months, social distancing is strongly enforced, nightclubs have never reopened, and sporting arenas are at less than a third of capacity. Children who are back at school are regularly tested and strictly social-distanced, and yet, the second wave seems completely unstoppable.""



In other words, after destroying a generation's mental and emotional health, they have nothing to show for it but a spreading virus. Yet shockingly, Dr. Birx said in August, ""I wish that when we went into lockdown, we looked like Italy."" She extolled Italy's totalitarian policies of ensuring that ""people weren't allowed out of their houses.""

Sadly, while our lockdown wasn't as bad as Italy's, it still needlessly prolonged the epidemic and killed a great many people.

Indeed, the results of Fauci in this country are terrible. It's enough that we have to endure his ego because of his past reputation, but do we really need to be ruled by this no-name attention seeker who sits on the board of Bill Gates' Global Fund?



The president has been moving in a better direction ever since he brought on Dr. Scott Atlas. But if he wins a second term, he must speak consistently with one voice. Unless there is a policy shake-up, Birx will continue to promote Biden's worldview even after he is defeated.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-california-court-prosecutor-blm,2020-10-26
Horowitz: How is this DOJ witch hunt against congressional conservatives not unconstitutional?,"The seizure of Rep. Scott Perry’s personal cell phone by the FBI is likely unconstitutional. Now that I just gave a constitutional opinion contrary to the view of the government, does that make me a criminal, and will they come to arrest me? Welcome to the Fourth Reich.



On Tuesday, Rep. Perry announced that three FBI agents had seized his cell phone. While information concerning their warrant is unknown at this point, the media is speculating that it has to do with accusations of the January 6 Committee that Perry was involved in the so-called conspiracy to overturn the election results and advocate for an alternate slate of electors from Pennsylvania.

But where is the commission of a crime? The question of whether state legislators or governors are the final say in selecting state electors or whether the vice president is just a ceremonial proceeding officer over the congressional counting of those electors or whether he has the final say is a political/constitutional question. It’s not a criminal act to advocate on behalf of one side, even if another individual believes those are reprehensible views to hold.

The fact that violence resulted from a protest of one side of this debate doesn’t implicate the members of Congress who took the losing side of the argument. It’s like saying the Democrat members of Congress who not only advocated for de-incarceration and defunding of the police, but downright encouraged violent protests, can be criminally charged for the deaths, injuries, and billions in damage caused by BLM and Antifa. Can a Republican president have his DOJ seize the phones of the members who marched at BLM riots where real violent criminal acts were committed?

Now the opposition party in the executive branch has the cell phone of the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, who undoubtedly kept a lot of political strategy and communication on that phone. This is exactly what our Founders sought to protect in the Speech and Debate Clause of Art. I, § 6, which provides that ""for any Speech or Debate in either House, they [Senators and Representatives] shall not be questioned in any other Place.""

For the same reason, in that same section, the Constitution states, “No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States.” Just like the Founders didn’t want collaboration between the legislative and executive branches, they didn’t want the executive branch to be able to prosecute the legislators for speaking their minds. No collaboration with or conspiring against the separation of powers. Yes, that would necessarily foreclose prosecution of sleazy politics (not stand-alone criminal activity), but the definition of sleazy and even immoral politics is in the eye of the beholder, or shall we say the political opponent.

In 1964, Maryland Democrat Rep. Thomas Francis Johnson was convicted in federal court on seven counts of violating the federal conflict-of-interest statute (18 U.S.C. 281) and on one count of conspiring to defraud the United States (18 U.S.C. 371). The main case against him brought by the Justice Department was an accusation that he took money from banking interests in exchange for delivering a favorable speech on the floor of the House. However, the Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court categorically overturned those convictions based on a violation of the Speech and Debate Clause.

In U.S. v. Johnson (1966), the Supreme Court concluded, “However reprehensible such conduct may be, we believe the Speech or Debate Clause extends at least so far as to prevent it from being made the basis of a criminal charge against a member of Congress of conspiracy to defraud the United States by impeding the due discharge of government functions.” In other words, as much as we would like to root out political corruption through criminal charges against this practice, the Founders understood that the collateral damage of affording the executive branch powers to criminalize legislative activity, political opinions, and speeches would be too chilling for a free republic.



Which is why they noted that Johnson’s speech was “precisely what the Speech or Debate Clause generally forecloses from executive and judicial inquiry.” The court made clear that the Clause must be “read broadly to effectuate its purposes,” ultimately concluding that the Clause forecloses prosecution based on evidence relying upon “the legislative acts” of a legislator or “his motives for performing them.”

Keep in mind that Perry is the member of Congress who last year filed articles of impeachment against Attorney General Merrick Garland, the ultimate boss of the FBI, who signed the warrant for the Trump raid. This is exactly the sort of conflict of interest in law enforcement that our Founders wanted to avoid. They particularly feared the collusion between the law enforcement officials of the executive branch and the magistrates, a fear that we are witnessing in real life with magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, a former Jeffrey Epstein lawyer who hated Trump and approved the warrant against Trump. The Supreme Court explains this exact problem in the 1966 Johnson case as follows:

It was not only fear of the executive that caused concern in Parliament, but of the judiciary as well, for the judges were often lackeys of the Stuart monarchs, levying punishment more ""to the wishes of the crown than to the gravity of the offence."" There is little doubt that the instigation of criminal charges against critical or disfavored legislators by the executive in a judicial forum was the chief fear prompting the long struggle for parliamentary privilege in England and, in the context of the American system of separation of powers, is the predominate thrust of the Speech or Debate Clause. In scrutinizing this criminal prosecution, then, we look particularly to the prophylactic purposes of the clause.

Obviously, if someone commits fraud or another criminal act as a member of Congress, he can be prosecuted. If a member of Congress acted violently on January 6, he can be prosecuted. But legislators can’t be prosecuted for offering legal, constitutional, and political opinions or advice for a president of their party to fire people who are fully within his right to fire.

Most people find politics reprehensible and even, in a colloquial way, downright criminal. But what’s worse is to allow one side of politics to criminalize the other side’s politics. Historically, it is the Left that has spawned exponentially more political violence, including in many state capitals, during debates over a political matters, and they didn’t need help from FBI agents provocateur to actually make the violence go kinetic. Are we now to say that any Democrat who took the political side of the protesters is completely subject to questioning, seizure, subpoena, and potential arrest based on the political statements they made in the lead-up to the vote or legislative proceedings?

This is all occurring in the shadow of two years of government officials treating political opponents and their political views as domestic terrorism on par with Islamic jihad. This didn’t begin with Trump. They have been doing this to ordinary Americans who can’t afford high-priced lawyers. Hopefully, the GOP politicians, now seeing they are not immune from the suspension of due process and legal norms, will finally do what it takes to neutralize the tyranny rather than fundraise off it.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-cdc-quarter-young-adults-considered-suicide,2022-08-12
Horowitz: 'Good judges'? Think again: Trump appointee blocks key Trump immigration policy,"The same Trump-appointed judge who gave Jim Acosta a right to demand access to the White House in 2018 has now given 7.8 billion people the potential ""right"" to sue for entry into the country as for asylum, even when they purposefully pass over numerous other countries first. What's next? Can I get standing in court to demand that Trump meet with me every Sunday morning to discuss my ideas? Why is it too much to ask that Republican-appointed judges understand the role of the judiciary, standing, fundamental rights, and sovereignty?

In another failure of the faux conservative legal establishment, Trump appointee Timothy Kelly ruled on Tuesday that Trump could not enforce his policy from last July requiring asylum-seekers to first apply in the first country they pass through before being eligible for asylum status in America. Shockingly, he did so even after the Supreme Court already stayed an injunction by a California judge against this rule.

It's truly hard to overstate how radical this decision is. The entire definition of asylum is that you are seeking safety somewhere else because you are in danger in your own country. The fact that these people are cherry-picking the United States for their destination demonstrates that their claims are bogus.

Plus, the courts have ruled for hundreds of years that foreign nationals have no standing to sue for the right to come into this country. How then could there even be standing to hear such a case? Also, third-party advocacy groups, such as the Capital Area Immigrants' Rights Coalition of Washington, the Texas-based Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES), and Human Rights First were named as plaintiffs. So, could conservative NGOs now become plaintiffs to sue on behalf of foreign nationals to block foreign policy? Can I sue the Pentagon for using our soldiers and taxpayer funding for Kabul urban renewal projects?

For most of our history, the courts were clear that private parties can't bring lawsuits to protect imputed rights of parties not before the court. Even if we are going to countenance the recent deviation from that principle, the third-party standing should not be expanded to foreign nationals. In Warth v. Seldin (1975), the Supreme Court explained, ""Without such limitations — closely related to Art. III concerns but essentially matters of judicial self-governance — the courts would be called upon to decide abstract questions of wide public significance even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the questions."" Nowhere is this more evident than in questions pertaining to international migration and border security during times of peril.

This is the first time I can remember a court messing with a foreign policy of the president. These agreements were hashed out in high-level diplomatic negotiations with Central American countries. This is exactly why the Supreme Court said long ago that the ""exclusion of aliens is a fundamental act of sovereignty"" and that ""the right to do so stems not alone from legislative power but is inherent in the executive power to control the foreign affairs of the nation"" [Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 1950]. It's not just that the president has 1182(f) delegated authority to shut off all immigration, even asylum requests. It's inherent in his Article II powers to govern foreign affairs and foreign commerce.

The court further punctuated this point in Kleindienst v. Mandel, (1972): ""In accord with ancient principles of the international law of nation-states … the power to exclude aliens is inherent in sovereignty, necessary for maintaining normal international relations and defending the country against foreign encroachments and dangers — a power to be exercised exclusively by the political branches of government.""

This is why, even if the president didn't fully abide by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in the way he promulgated this new policy, as Judge Kelly suggests, there is no way there can be valid standing or judicial jurisdiction to adjudicate the consequences of that policy in this context.

Moreover, 5 U.S.C. §553(a)(1) explicitly exempts a ""foreign affairs function"" from the APA. And for good reason. A president doesn't have time to play games while national security is at stake. Border security and immigration policy sit at the nexus of foreign policy and national security. This is exactly why the Supreme Court said in Mathews v. Diaz (1976) that ""decisions in these matters [immigration] may implicate our relations with foreign powers"" and therefore, these ""decisions are frequently of a character more appropriate to either the Legislature or the Executive than to the Judiciary."" In this case, these very policies were born out of bilateral and multilateral agreements with at least four countries.

Ironically, one of the problems we faced from the flood at our border in 2018-2019 was a health crisis overwhelming our hospitals with people coming here for care. Why is it that the courts believe elected officials can violate the Bill of Rights under the guise of combatting a public health crisis, but somehow foreign nationals can assert a right to enter even in the face of a health crisis?

The answer is that we have become strangers in our own land, and even Republican-appointed judges have bought into this inverted thinking that flips the Declaration of Independence and consent-based governance upside down. The lower courts, thanks to tacit greenlighting from the Supreme Court, have been creating rights for illegal aliens at breakneck speed. They have essentially abolished ICE.

Just this month, a federal judge vacated the deportation of an illegal alien with prior battery convictions who was arrested for rioting at a BLM event simply because he had DACA status! An illegal alien has no right to remain in the country even without a criminal conviction, but now that the courts have mandated Obama's amnesty, at least temporarily, they are now staying deportations even of those with criminal records who are ineligible for the status under Obama's system. The illegal alien has now violated the terms of his release and faces yet another court appearance next week.

Once again, we have Trump-appointed judges who not only decline to roll back existing bad decisions but will even add new insane principles to our body of case law that downright conflict with past Supreme Court precedent. Guess what: Judge Kelly is the same man who ruled in 2018 that political activist Jim Acosta had a right to a press badge to access the White House. This judge seems to be confused about fundamental rights, standing in court, and what exactly defines a judicial case or controversy.

Until we declare these court opinions null and void for violating separation of powers, we will never have a sovereign republic. But in order to do that, we need elected officials in the other branches of government who believe in the rule of law and the Constitution. That will not happen under this Republican Party and certainly not under its judicial appointments.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-chairman-of-the-idaho-house-health-committee-refuses-to-hold-hearings-on-dangerous-covid-policies,2020-07-01
Horowitz: Gov’t watchdog reports internal allegations of political interference in science at NIH/CDC/FDA,"""Respondents from CDC and FDA told us they did not report potential political interference in scientific decision-making because they feared retaliation."" While these words from a brand-new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report are not earth-shattering to anyone paying attention over the past two years, they are a bombshell coming from a government agency.

The GAO just released a report on political interference in scientific decisions, based on interviews with employees of the four HHS agencies most responsible for the coronavirus response. The findings were derived from personal interviews as well as tips offered to a confidential hotline set up for the investigation. The investigators’ conclusion, which they conveyed in a letter to leaders of the House and Senate judiciary committees and committees overseeing HHS, was that these agencies “do not have procedures that define political interference in scientific decision-making or describe how it should be reported and addressed.”

The four agencies subject to the GAO investigation were the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR).

The GAO investigators revealed to Congress that ""a few respondents from CDC and FDA stated they felt that the potential political interference they observed resulted in the alteration or suppression of scientific findings."" What were the consequences? ""Some of these respondents believed that this potential political interference may have resulted in the politically motivated alteration of public health guidance or delayed publication of COVID-19-related scientific findings.""

Oh, so you mean political science, cronyism, and fear of retaliation explain why dangerous novel vaccines and therapeutics got immediate approval as standard of care (and even used for mandates) despite sketchy data and no established safety profile, while dozens of promising already-FDA-approved off-label drugs were ignored or denigrated – all for politics? Yeah, no kidding.

The reason this is so earth-shattering is not that pay-for-play is new to government agencies, such as the EPA or the DOD, for example, where outside cronies use politics and money to corrupt good public policy all the time. It’s that our very lives, liberty, and bodily integrity have now been pegged to the whims of “science.” Thus, the agencies tasked with studying that science are not only run by political science, but have zero procedures in place to root out the inevitable political control of that science, which results in nothing short of life-and-death decisions.

Moreover, these agencies suffer from a particular moral hazard in the sense that the very corporations most likely to corrupt the science and poison the bodies of the people pay the bills and salaries of these agencies. Prior to 1992, the FDA was prohibited from accepting fees from drug companies. Following the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), which allowed it to collect fees, “user fees have played an important role in expediting the drug approval process,” according to the FDA’s website. How “important” is this role? By 2017, Big Pharma paid 75% of the FDA’s drug review budget. Much of the agency’s funding comes from the “nonprofit” CDC Foundation authorized in that 1992 bill, which is funded by companies like Pfizer and Merck. Science magazine reported in 2018 that nearly half the doctors and scientists on the FDA’s various advisory committees received funding from Big Pharma companies to get their drugs approved.



Private emails released via FOIA revealed several months ago that the CDC Foundation worked with Facebook, Merck, the WHO, and other pharma entities on an “Alliance for Advancing Health Online” initiative to control the narrative. So whether it’s issues of off-label early treatments, vaccine safety and efficacy, science about asymptomatic transmission, or the threat of COVID to children, every morsel of information put out by the HHS agencies is influenced and controlled by pharma and Big Tech to steer a specific outcome that will always benefit Big Pharma.

Gee, is it any wonder why the FDA has just approved a failed and toxic drug like remdesivir even for babies and toddlers as standard of care for $3,000, while refusing to offer even tacit approval for existing, fully approved drugs like fluvoxamine, budesonide, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin? They didn’t even complete the study on remdesivir for babies, and it won’t be finished until next year! In fact, even this week, the FDA continued to horse around with the Nobel Prize-winning ivermectin, while approving Merck’s true horse drug Molnupiravir, which is so dangerous that even the media has attacked it.

Oh, and now HHS can work with the DHS’ new “Disinformation Governing Board” to enforce Big Pharma fascism on behalf of their benefactors.

This is not your grandfather’s bureaucratic pay-for-play scheme. This affects the lives and bodies of hundreds of millions of people. There used to be a limit to how much they were willing to bend life science for political science and greed. Now, there is no limit.

There’s a reason why the pharma fascists and the biomedical tyrants need this degree of control, collusion, subsidization, and censorship to succeed in their plot. At a recent Canadian parliamentary committee hearing, the president of Astra Zeneca Canada could not answer why the company vigorously lobbied governments for complete exemption from all liability.

I think we know the answer. They can’t afford accountability and liability, and they can get away with ensuring they will never be held responsible. The only immunity the shots convey is for the manufacturers. Who is going to hold them responsible? Can you name the number of Republicans running for office this year on the promise to alter the powers of HHS and its relationship with Big Pharma? You won’t need more than one hand to count the names.

Horowitz: Hopkins analysis showing COVID-19 has 'relatively no effect on deaths' in US retracted from publication. Why?,"If data analysis is insensitive or appears to ""trivialize"" a pandemic, does it make the research false? The arguments of the lockdown and mask totalitarians are so fickle that they must resort to unprecedented censorship in order to win the day. Their views cannot coexist with any trace of dissent on the internet, which is why Johns Hopkins University, which has become a lead advocate for lockdowns, is evidently now censoring its own faculty in academic research.



Last week, the Johns Hopkins News-Letter, a student newspaper, posted an article by Yanni Gu titled, ""A closer look at U.S. deaths due to COVID-19."" It was based on an analysis conducted by Dr. Genevieve Briand, an economics teacher at Hopkins. I originally saw the article on Thanksgiving morning and quickly saw this very catchy conclusion. ""These data analyses suggest that in contrast to most people's assumptions, the number of deaths by COVID-19 is not alarming. In fact, it has relatively no effect on deaths in the United States.""

When I clicked on it Thursday night, the link was dead. Then I saw that the Twitter account for the Hopkins News-Letter announced that it had been deleted:

Thankfully, the internet is eternal and you can still see an archived version here.



Isn't it interesting how any analysis that seems to cast doubt on the prevailing panicked narrative of the virus must immediately be deleted or censored? When was the last time you saw one of the numerous inaccurate papers overstating the threat of the virus taken down from the web or labeled as inaccurate on social media?

How many people really died earlier in 2020?

The article originally posted by Gu seeks to answer the following question: Are there really anywhere near 260,000 excess deaths this year of people who died early due to COVID-19? Gu, the student who wrote the article, notes that based on Briand's use of CDC's excess death data, there have actually been relatively few excess deaths this year. More shocking still is that her analysis shows a commensurate drop in deaths among other typical leading causes of fatality this year. ""Briand believes that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be recategorized as being due to COVID-19.""

So how are the deaths being recategorized?

""The CDC classified all deaths that are related to COVID-19 simply as COVID-19 deaths. Even patients dying from other underlying diseases but are infected with COVID-19 count as COVID-19 deaths. This is likely the main explanation as to why COVID-19 deaths drastically increased while deaths by all other diseases experienced a significant decrease …

If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn't give us a choice but to point to some misclassification,"" Briand replied.

What professor Briand also found peculiar is that the percentage of deaths among those in the 65+ bracket appear to be relatively similar to those in younger brackets and has remained pretty constant even after the epidemic began.

To be clear, the data she is using is just from April. A lot of additional people have allegedly died from COVID-19 since then. However, April is when we experienced the strongest wave, which would have netted the most deaths of any month.

On Friday, following much social media buzz about the publication's retraction notice on Twitter, the News-Letter posted an editor's note explaining why the article was removed but did provide a link to it in a pdf. Just two of the paragraphs even attempt to entertain the points made in the original analysis. The editors claim the article ""has been used to support dangerous inaccuracies that minimize the impact of the pandemic."" Next, they move on to the typical ""credentials"" insult by noting, ""As assistant director for the Master's in Applied Economics program at Hopkins, Briand is neither a medical professional nor a disease researcher.""

The main point the editors' retraction notice makes is that the CDC has said there have been 300,000 excess deaths. However, we already know that many of them have been due to lockdown and that many the CDC considers excess deaths would have died from other conditions during the same calendar year, which is the main point of Briand's analysis. And with conflicting data, who is to say the CDC is correct about that? This is why this needs further study to harmonize and validate all the data, as Briand herself said.

Next, the editors' retraction notes,""Briand presented data of total U.S. deaths in comparison to COVID-19-related deaths as a proportion percentage, which trivializes the repercussions of the pandemic"" and further ""does not disprove the severity of COVID-19."" So now an academic institution is writing an emotional screed about ""severity."" We all understand that people have died from the virus. If this virus killed people a few months early within the same year, we can have a debate over language sensitivity, but it doesn't disprove the point that the excess deaths for a given year are not what they are being portrayed as. While we can debate the language the student used in the original article stating the deaths were ""not alarming,"" the retraction doesn't disprove, and in indeed tacitly agrees, with Briand's main research point – that the distribution of deaths seems to be fairly constant across all age groups.

Hence, one could take issue with some of the language used by the student to portray Briand's research, but the broader findings are intriguing and should be discussed and debated. This retraction is a political decision, not an academic one.

This is not the first analysis to ""downplay"" the human toll of COVID-19

While this analysis, which can be viewed in an hour-long video, needs further study, it's not like the point is entirely novel. The retraction notice notes, ""Briand's study should not be used exclusively in understanding the impact of COVID-19, but should be taken in context with the countless other data published by Hopkins, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).""

Exactly! None of us are using the Briand analysis in a vacuum as an end-all. We want to embark on debate; the censors want to shut it down. This is part of broader evidence that this virus is not killing massive numbers of people well before their natural time to die.

Professor Neil Ferguson, the father of lockdown policies, suggested earlier this year that two-thirds of the people who would ultimately die in the U.K. would have died within the year anyway. Punctuating this point is a brand-new retrospective study published over the weekend by scientists at Rutgers University showing that 89% of those who died of COVID in two New Jersey hospitals had prior ""do not resuscitate"" orders. Thus, these are not exactly new excess deaths who died tragically early. The findings harmonize very well with any analysis showing limited excess deaths caused by the virus this year.

Also, much as with masks, some of the evidence we are now seeing on excess deaths tracks very closely with the original consensus – before the virus became a political issue and a tool for social control. On March 26, Dr. Anthony Fauci, along with National Institutes of Health deputy director of clinical research Clifford Lane and CDC Director Robert Redfield, published an article in the New England Journal of Medicine making exactly this point. They predicted that once the true number of asymptomatic and subclinical cases was factored in, ""the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.""

Well, given that the flu has all but disappeared since COVID-19 has become the predominant respiratory virus in circulation, that would mean there would not be a large number of excess deaths, given that this virus is replacing, not augmenting, the flu deaths. Last year, for week 46 of the CDC's Influenza Surveillance Report (ending Nov. 16), there were 1,786 confirmed flu cases. This year, there were just 41. That is a 97.7% decline! Which tells you that for this year, COVID-19 is the Angel of Death's respiratory fatality tool of choice, to the exclusion of the other typical tools.

The only other criticism the editors' retraction notice had of Briand is that her contention that other deaths were reclassified as COVID deaths is wrong because ""COVID-19 disproportionately affects those with preexisting conditions, so those with those underlying conditions are statistically more likely to be severely affected and die from the virus."" Again, she is discussing excess deaths – meaning people who would otherwise not have died this year. So her point is not just that some deaths have been mislabeled (e.g. motorcycle accidents turning into COVID deaths), but even among those who legitimately did die from the virus, many of them, as the editors' retraction notice is clearly conceding, would have died fairly soon from those other diseases. They are clearly granting the point that, by and large, these people would not have died of heart attacks or the flu 10 years later. These are people who largely would have died within the year. And let's not forget that, thanks to the lockdown policies, many of these people are also dying a few months early because of isolation.

Yes, the CDC's excess death data can be unreliable, and yes, we need more recent months of data to make a better assessment. But rather than engaging in censorship, why are we not debating the merits of both sides? Why does any shred of good news about the virus have to be stifled rather than rebutted or debated?

American media and scientific journals have strong bias against good news



This problem seems to be unique to the U.S., at least to the extreme lengths that the censorship is taken. A brand new working paper published for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that ""ninety-one percent of stories by U.S. major media outlets are negative in tone versus fifty four percent for non-U.S. major sources and sixty-five percent for scientific journals."" This was found to be true even when logic would dictate there should be more positive stories or studies in circulation.

""The negativity of the U.S. major media is notable even in areas with positive scientific developments including school re-openings and vaccine trials,"" observed Sacerdote et al. in the working paper. ""Media negativity is unresponsive to changing trends in new COVID-19 cases or the political leanings of the audience. U.S. major media readers strongly prefer negative stories about COVID-19, and negative stories in general.""

Thus, whenever any study, analysis, or news story surfaces showing that deaths might not be as bad as reported, it is immediately censored. Given that deliberate bias against good news, how are we to fairly evaluate the merits of the data and science? In that sense, the danger to the public is likely more in what is not being published than what is affirmatively being disseminated with pomp and flair across the dark annals of the web.

Nobody made this point better than Kamran Abbasi, executive editor of the British Medical Journal, in a recent editorial in which he accuses scientists and politicians of ""suppressing science"" for political gain.

""Politicians often claim to follow the science, but that is a misleading oversimplification,"" charged Abbasi. ""Science is rarely absolute. It rarely applies to every setting or every population. It doesn't make sense to slavishly follow science or evidence. A better approach is for politicians, the publicly appointed decision makers, to be informed and guided by science when they decide policy for their public. But even that approach retains public and professional trust only if science is available for scrutiny and free of political interference, and if the system is transparent and not compromised by conflicts of interest.""

In other words, ""shut up and mask up"" is not science and certainly does not exude transparency that will give the public confidence in the decision-making process. And as Abassi warns, ""When good science is suppressed, people die.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-doj-wtich-hunt-conservatives,2020-11-30
Horowitz: Hunter Biden’s role in Ukrainian biolabs raises serious questions about gain of function and Ukraine policy,"Recent emails unearthed by the U.K. Daily Mail and the National Pulse reveal that during the last decade, Hunter Biden seemed to have a keen interest in pathogen research in Ukraine and using it as a tool for geopolitical affairs in that country. It just so happens to be that a pathogen connected to gain-of-function research destroyed the world, and then the next “big current thing” on the geopolitical stage was none other than Ukraine. Shouldn’t the American people get some answers as to why our government was so heavily involved – via the vice president’s son – in both pathogen research and Ukraine and to make sure Ukraine is not Wuhan 2.0?

Earlier this month, I detailed the known connections between biotech firm Metabiota Inc., responsible for the pathogen research in Ukraine, the DOD, and EcoHealth Alliance, along with the Wuhan lab most likely responsible for the leak of SARS-CoV-2. I also noted that Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners (RSTP), a subsidiary of the Hunter Biden and Christopher Heinz-founded Rosemont Capital, gave Metabiota, a company accused of dangerous lab protocols during the African Ebola pandemic, its first infusion of cash a decade ago. Now, new emails from Hunter’s laptop demonstrate that his involvement in Metabiota and pathogen research in Ukraine was much deeper than just an initial investment.

On April 4, 2014, Metabiota vice president Mary Guttieri wrote an email to the younger Biden outlining how they could “assert Ukraine's cultural and economic independence from Russia'” with their joint venture, according to an email from Hunter’s laptop obtained by the U.K. Daily Mail. That is quite a curious goal for a company that supposedly does scientific research and analysis about emerging pandemics.

The outlet also posted another email dated April 8, 2014, from Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi referring to a “science project” Hunter had pitched to him involving Burisma and Metabiota in Ukraine. “Please find few initial points to be discussed for the purposes of analyzing the potential of this as you called, 'Science Ukraine' project,” Pozharskyi wrote. Hunter sits on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company owned by corrupt billionaire Mikolay Zlochevsky, who fled to Monaco after he was put under investigation.

Hunter’s dad, as vice president, was in charge of our foreign policy with Ukraine in 2014 when all of this was occurring and when the U.S. government was backing the color revolution that led to the ouster of the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych. It was at this time that the Defense Department began funding the Metabiota operations in Ukraine.

After receiving 18.4 million from the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) between February 2014 and November 2016, with $307,091 earmarked for “Ukraine research projects,” “Metabiota has worked in Ukraine for Black & Veatch, a US defense contractor with deep ties to military intelligence agencies, which built secure labs in Ukraine that analyzed killer diseases and bioweapons,” according to the Daily Mail.

“It raises the question, what is the real purpose of this venture? It's very odd,” said former senior CIA officer Sam Faddis in an interview with the Daily Mail. “His father was the Vice President of the United States and in charge of relations with Ukraine. So why was Hunter not only on the board of a suspect Ukrainian gas firm, but also hooked them up with a company working on bioweapons research?”

Biden was so involved in Metabiota that one email written that same month in 2014 reveals that he and his business partner Eric Schwerin discussed subletting their office space to the San-Francisco-based biotech firm.

So, what exactly were they working on? Last week, the National Pulse reported that a feature in the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine’s 2016 AnnualReport recounts an October 2016 meeting involving U.S. military officials and their Ukrainian counterparts together with Black & Veatch and Metabiota staff to discuss the lab work. The discussion centered around “existing frameworks, regulatory coordination, and ongoing cooperative projects in research, surveillance and diagnostics of a number of dangerous zoonotic diseases, such as avian influenza, leptospirosis, Crimea Congo hemorrhagic fever, and brucellosis.”

The National Pulse cites a 2019 paper authored by researchers from Metabiota and three Ukraine-based institutes and funded by the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency sharing how they isolated a form of African swine flu using a pig from Ukraine in 2016. They also detail their research on Anthrax in animals in Ukraine.

Well, where else have we heard of Metabiota partners working on gain-of-function research of pathogens that typically are in animals? Oh yes, EcoHealth Alliance in Wuhan. In the past, Metabiota has worked with EcoHealth and the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The zoonotic projects being described in Ukraine sound awfully similar to the gain-of-function work EcoHealth was involved with in Wuhan. In Feb. 2016, EcoHealth’s founder, Peter Daszak, explained the company’s zoonotic pathogen work as follows:

So as an example, first of all, we are only looking at viral families that include those that have gone into people from animals. So we narrow it down straight away. Then when you get a sequence of a virus and it looks like a relative of a known nasty pathogen, just like we did with SARS, we found other Corona viruses in bats, a whole host of them, some of them looked very similar to SARS. So we sequenced the spike protein, the protein that attaches to cells. Then we, well, I didn’t do this work, but my colleagues in China did the work, you create the pseudo-particles, you insert the spike proteins from those viruses [to see if they] bind to human cells. And each step you move closer and closer to this virus could really become pathogenic in people. So you narrow down the field, you reduce the cost and you end up with a small number of viruses that really do look like killers. (C-Span, 1:16:22.)

Sure sounds a lot like the coronavirus that actually broke out several years ago and destroyed the world as we know it. Less than a month later, Ralph Baric, the UNC Chapel Hill biologist who spearheaded the gain-of-function projects for Daszak, co-authored a paper warning with certitude of the emergence of this disease. “The results indicate that viruses using WIV1-CoV spike are poised to emerge in human populations due to efficient replication in primary human airway epithelial cell cultures,” concluded the authors.

How did they know? And doesn’t anyone have a concern that the same players were up to no good in Ukraine, especially given Hunter Biden’s ethical problems and the fact that his dad, the vice president and now the president, was overseeing Ukrainian affairs during that time?

Recently, the National Pulse found, based on EcoHealth’s 990 filings and analysis by ProPublica, that the company’s investment income surged by 342% in the year of the pandemic. EcoHealth received millions of dollars from Fauci’s NIAD to work on “killer” viruses with the Wuhan Institute, creating “chimeric” viruses that spread in humans at rates “equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV.”



Now consider the fact that Metabiota’s CEO, Nathan Wolfe, penned an article in Time on Aug. 1, 2014, detailing his opinion on the Ebola outbreak in Africa and then literally predicted coronavirus as the next outbreak:

While Ebola virus won’t be the next global Andromeda strain, there are viruses out there that could be. Coronaviruses (like SARS) and influenza viruses (like the H1N1 virus of 1918) for example, show that some viruses truly can spread around the world in ways that will blindside and impact our entire planet. It is notable that a novel coronavirus, the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and a novel influenzavirus, the H7N9 virus, receive very little attention from the international media. Perhaps as importantly, there are millions of still unidentified viruses in animal reservoirs, among which, almost certainly is a virus that we’d have no capacity to understand or stop were it to suddenly emerge today.

If we didn’t have a pandemic likely created by similar research – possibly by the same players – killing millions globally and injuring tens of millions of others, I wouldn’t be too concerned with these research projects in Ukraine. But given what has occurred, why is there zero concern from the media or the politicians about what we have been doing in Ukraine and elsewhere? And how does it shape our entire geopolitical worldview on the Russian-Ukrainian conflict?

Horowitz: Is it time for a two-state solution?,"For years, everyone was sure that the solution to the endless terror attacks against Israelis was to create a two-state solution for the Jews and the Arabs living in the region. Donald Trump proved this 30-year obsession to be a false god by bringing peace between Israel and its neighbors without forcing Israel to cede more land. Perhaps what we have all missed all along is that the real two-state solution is needed right here at home in the once united states.

During the time of the Revolutionary War, the Patriots and Tories really only disagreed on one fundamental question: whether the existing power grabs by King George were worth further agitating the British and risking their lives against a military much stronger than the American colonies'. They all, however, understood fundamental rights. The question forced some of the colonists to self-separate before and during the war.

During the lead-up to the Civil War, the two sides disagreed on one vital question of fundamental rights of black people living in America. It led to a bloody war.

Today, the two sides disagree over every facet of life: the economy, theology, natural law, constitutional rights, and the purpose of America. Perhaps we need to self-separate before the Marxist political dominance and street violence become reciprocal.

How can we bridge the divide with a group of people who believe that men can be women?

How can we bridge the divide with those who believe government can shut down the First Amendment rights of Americans to work and pray, but it can't stop illegal aliens from coming here and securing welfare?

How can we bridge the divide with those who believe it's cruel and unusual punishment not to offer sex-change operations to criminals in prison but that it's not cruel to vacuum the brains out of unborn babies?

How can we bridge the divide with those who criminalize children who don't place masks on their mouths, but advocate for release of those who rob and maim with masks?

How can we bridge the divide with those who believe certain people and causes have a right to riot, loot, maim, and trap and attack random motorists with impunity, but those who defend themselves against it have no right to live?

Most importantly, how can we bridge the divide when the other side seeks to dominate us at all costs, while we merely seek to abide by the Constitution and don't impose our will on them?

When we win a national election, they can always retreat to their states and pretty much do whatever they want. Life in California and New York didn't change one iota during the Trump presidency. In fact, those states have gotten even more loony. Whereas when they win, we have nowhere to go to practice our faith and earn a living without being molested with coronavirus fascism, life-destroying regulations and taxes, and risks to our safety and security.

Is it perhaps time to divide permanently so that we can actually live in peace?

If they want to abolish the Border Patrol, the military, and the police, let them live in the part of the country without those institutions and most certainly without the nukes. We will have them.

If they want to give illegal aliens more rights than Americans, take away guns from law-abiding citizens, and refuse to lock up violent criminals, including gun felons, let them live with the consequences, while we use our governments for the few core functions it is supposed to serve.



If they want to crush small businesses with illogical regulations, let them try to start business and attract commerce in their states with those onerous rules but leave us free to govern ourselves elsewhere.

If they believe there is a fundamental right to camp out on public streets, let them live on those streets, but don't come to our states when the going gets rough to transform our paradise into your existing hell.

If they feel they could live without fossil fuels, let them take all the windmills, and we will take the oil and gas.

In many ways, this would be the easiest custody battle of any divorce. We are not fighting over the same money, materials, and children. We want the unborn children, while they want MS-13 and the Muslim Brotherhood. We want the energy sources that work, while they want those that are impotent. We want the jails filled with dangerous people, while they want them filled with those who dare to deviate from the COVID religion. We want the police and they want the social workers.

President Lincoln presciently warned in 1858 that ""a house divided against itself cannot stand"" without reaching a crisis point. ""I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free,"" he famously told Republican delegates at their first convention in Springfield, Illinois. Given that today we are divided over infinitely more issues, how can we stand together in the same house without reaching that crisis point?

Horowitz: North Dakota legislature essentially greenlights Biden’s immoral mandate,"Imagine having an 80-14 majority in a red-state legislature a week after Democrats were defeated in a blue state, and you are considering legislation on Biden's unprecedented injection mandate at a time when he likely has a 20% approval rating in the state. One would expect the GOP legislators to easily take ""yes"" for an answer from their constituents and categorically ban all COVID fascism. Instead, they listened to the special interests that are in cahoots with the federal government, rejected a popular bill that would have tackled the problem, and instead passed a bill that explicitly greenlights the mandate.

Last night, the North Dakota House passed HB 1511, a bill that essentially does nothing to protect North Dakotans. Sure, it bans state government mandates, but those were never really a threat. The issue at hand is that the federal government is threatening businesses that they must require injection passports for their workers. The only way to combat that mandate, and yes, restore the pre-COVID free market, is to ban (with the threat of legal action and/or fines) the imposition of such a mandate on employees.

So, what is in HB 1511? It never even attempts to ban the vaccine mandates, but only stipulates that employers must allow for exemptions, which include religious/philosophical objections, medical concerns, prior infection, and a testing opt-out. That might sound like a reasonable compromise that is worth passing, as other states have done, and if written properly, it would effectively protect anyone who wants out of the needle rape. The problem is that the final section of the bill voids even the religious exemptions to the extent that they conflict with the federal regulations. Thus, just like the Wyoming House did (with overwhelming GOP majorities), the North Dakota GOP opposed the federal mandate, unless the feds actually enforce it!

Even the rest of the bill is weak, and worse, it downright greenlights discrimination. The bill does bar any denial of service to customers based on vaccination status, but then places an exception for health care. Thus, at a time when we need a bill doing just the opposite – to ban hospitals from mistreating or denying surgeries and organ transplants to those without the unsafe and ineffective injections (as another draft bill that was rejected purported to do) – this bill explicitly blesses such immoral and illogical discrimination. This bill makes current law worse by explicitly blessing the requirement that someone gets a shot in order to obtain medical care, something that cannot be done under current state and federal anti-discrimination law.

Also, even the ban on vaccine mandates among state institutions was given a carve-out for all state colleges, which are now allowed to deny admission or employment based on someone's injection status. The bill supporters hang their hats on the fact that the bill bans vaccine passports, but the issue is not a specific piece of paper. Students and others will still be required to show some proof of the shot.

There was a better bill that would have categorically banned most vaccine mandates and confronted the feds directly. HB 1510 was drafted similarly to the Montana bill, which was the first in the country to bar mandates. Even that bill had a compromise carve-out for health care. Shockingly, only 38 Republicans out of 80 voted for it!

Here is the target list for the upcoming elections:

Adams; Anderson, B.; Anderson, D.; Anderson, P.; Beltz; Boe; Boschee; Brandenburg; Buffalo; Cory; Damschen; Devlin; Dobervich; Dockter; Guggisberg; Hager; Hagert; Hanson; Hatlestad; Heinert; Ista; Johnson, D.; Johnson, M.; Karls; Kiefert; Klemin; Kreidt; Louser; Martinson; Mitskog; Mock; Monson; Nathe; Nelson, J.; Nelson, M.; O'Brien; Ostlie; Pollert; Porter; Pyle; Richter; Roers Jones; Sanford; Schauer; Schmidt; Schneider; Schobinger; Schreiber-Beck; Stemen; Strinden; Vigesaa; Weisz; Westlind; Zubke.

The watered-down bill that did pass the House passed the Senate 33-14 on Friday. Ironically, even this bill, which in many ways makes current law worse, was too conservative for a handful of Republicans (there are only seven Democrats in the chamber).

The seven Republicans who thought somehow that even this bill was too compassionate for their constituents were:

Howard Anderson, District 8

Randy Burckhard, District 5

Karen Krebsbach, District 40

Judy Lee, District 13

Dave Oehlke, District 15

Nicole Poolman, District 7

Jim Roers, District 46

Watching the Senate debate this morning, I heard one Republican after another suggest, ""There's still people dying in the hospital,"" ""We're all in this together,"" and ""We have responsibilities, not just rights."" Ironically, these are all arguments against the failed status quo that has gotten us to a point where things are worse than they were before the injections, yet North Dakota Republicans are now to the left of even what Bill Gates and others are now conceding about the failures of the shots.

Why is it that conservatives have to be made to feel like we are asking from our legislatures a trip to the moon? We are not asking to reform our entire government and end the Great Society. We are simply asking them to completely erase the now-discredited approach to COVID that has killed so many people without saving a single life. What is so hard? These are the types of bills you would pass when you have divided government, not when you have supermajorities at a time when Democrats are on the ropes and lives are on the line.

On a positive note, the House did pass HB 1514, a bill that bans the medical board from taking action against doctors or nurse practitioners who prescribe ivermectin and against pharmacists who fill the prescriptions. But the original proposal also stopped pharmacists from denying prescriptions, which is the bigger problem on the street. It also had a provision to allow patients in the hospitals the right to try ivermectin and barred any discrimination of care against those without the shots.

""Well, take what you can get, Daniel.""

But why should any of these provisions be removed from the bill? How could anyone – Republican or Democrat – be opposed to these ideas? Again, all these tactics are evil, are unscientific, and reek of medical fascism. The GOP's reluctance to take a categorical stand is incomprehensible from a policy standpoint, as well as from a moral and even electoral standpoint.

And remember, at least North Dakota was willing to go this far. We have numerous other deep red states that won't even get into session and haven't passed a single meaningful bill in 19 months to push back against the greatest threats against our liberties, bodies, and well-being. The science is now 100% clear that all these measures are causing harm, making the virus worse, and blocking our ability to properly treat people. Ideally, if states would actually follow the law, science, and the Nuremberg Code, they would ban the administration of these shots altogether and completely reorient our approach to this virus. So what we are asking for, to begin with, is a compromise.

There's a time to compromise on the will of the people, and there is a time to fully embrace the will of the people. When it comes to countering ""Faucism"" in red states, it is the wrong time, the wrong place, and the wrong issue to embrace compromise – especially one that actually makes current law worse.



Expressing the sentiments of RINO legislators across the country, Ohio Speaker Bob Cupp recently suggested it's time for us to move on from fighting COVID fascism. ""They are reflecting what they hear in their district, but it's, it's clearly time to move on,"" Cupp recently said of efforts from his rank-and-file Republican members to fight for medical freedom. Well, if Democrat districts can get representation for their tyrannical views, why can't our districts get representation for liberty and medical freedom? We will move on from fighting COVID fascism when the RINOs and Democrats move on from imposing it upon us.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-hopkins-analysis-showing-covid-19-has-relatively-no-effect-on-deaths-in-us-retracted,2021-11-12
Horowitz: Now we know why the establishment has always opposed early treatment,"The shots don’t work for many people, particularly the elderly. The establishment is blocking every other treatment option available. At this point, with so many people recovering even from late-stage COVID by taking ivermectin, which is infinitely safer than the shots, how could anyone ascribe anything other than very sinister motivations to those declaring war on its use?

The shills for Big Pharma and the “Great Reset” who don’t want to see people survive this virus claim they don’t have enough data on ivermectin, despite dozens of studies and simple reality showing that it works better than anything they have suggested. They demand massive randomized controlled trials, but then refuse to fund any such expensive study. They refuse to follow up on positive signals with off-patent therapeutics the same way they blithely ignore negative signals from the vaccines and refuse to follow up with investigative studies. Well, Brazilian researchers just published something better than a randomized controlled trial. They did a study of reality.

Everyone in the entire southern Brazilian city of Itajai was invited to participate in a preventive study of ivermectin for efficacy against severe COVID-19 symptoms. 133,051 (60.3%) volunteered to take ivermectin for two days every 15-day period between July and December 2020 at a low dose of 0.2mg per kilogram of body weight. 87,466 (39.7%) chose to enroll their information as the control group without taking the treatment. So no complaints can be made about a small sample size. The results? The hospitalization and mortality rate of the trial group was nearly half that of the control group!

However, the results are much more impressive than the top-line numbers suggest. One of the complaints about studies like this that are not randomized is that it’s possible for the healthier, more treatment-conscience individuals to sign up for the trial group, thereby confounding the conclusion of the trial results. But in this case, the opposite is true. The ivermectin group had nearly twice as many people over age 50 enrolled, which also included many more people with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and pulmonary issues. Thus, the relative risk reduction in mortality rate among those high-risk people taking ivermectin was actually much higher – 71% among those with type 2 diabetes and 67% among those with hypertension. The absolute risk reduction was also even greater among older people who are most at risk.

The overall effect on the city’s population was remarkable. The COVID-19 hospitalization rate decreased from 6.8% before the program with preventive use of ivermectin, to just 1.8% after its beginning (73% reduction). The mortality rate also dropped by 59%, from 3.4% to 1.4%. Most astounding is where the city of Itajai ranked relative to others in the state of Santa Catarina:

“When compared to all other major cities in the State of Santa Catarina, where Itajaí is located, differences in COVID-19 mortality rate between before July 7, 2020 and between July 7, 2020 and December 21, 2020, Itajaí is ranked number one, and far from the second place,” observed the Brazilian researchers in the study manuscript. “These results indicate that medical based optional prescription, citywide covered ivermectin can have a positive impact in the healthcare system.”

In many respects, this is more illuminating than a standard randomized controlled clinical trial. If we actually want to project what the world would look like if everyone would take ivermectin, this is a perfect case study of an entire city and its effect on the hospitals. Contrast these results to the vaccines, where we are seeing no correlation between outcomes and vaccination rates by geography, even though their randomized controlled trials purported to show an unmistakable benefit of 95% reduction in mortality.

Also, another key issue is dosage. FLCCC recommends 0.4-0.6mgs per kilogram of weight, which is 2-3 times the dose used in the trial. Obviously, this was a preventive trial only used for two straight days, but then rather than taking it every week, there was a 15-day gap before the next dose. One has to wonder what the results would be if each one in the trial group ramped up the dosage to 0.4mg every day for five days once they contracted the virus, or at least took the 0.2mg preventive dose twice every week.



Even the most effective drugs need a minimum dose. Ivermectin has demonstrated a strong dose-response relationship in terms of viral clearance; higher doses have not only been required, but have demonstrated clinical efficacy. While critics claim the dose is too high, cancer trials had patients taking ivermectin at a much higher dose for months without any problems.

Moreover, like any other virus, treatment requires a multi-drug approach because the virus has multiple avenues to infect cells. Imagine if every primary doctor treated patients with a mix of ivermectin and several other drugs, along with the appropriate anti-coagulants and steroids in the right patients at the early stage of disease. Imagine if they’d be directed to use Betadine nasal rinse, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and several other proven therapeutics from day one. Imagine if our government had placed as much money, marketing, and logistical facilitation into the monoclonal antibodies as it did the unsafe and ineffective shots.

Well, we already see from doctors in the U.S. who have applied this approach, and their reduction in mortality is near 100%. And all the drugs they use range from safer than over-the-counter medications (in the case of ivermectin) to much safer than anything being administered by the hospital systems, such as remdesivir, baricitinib and tofacitinib.

One thing is certain: Ivermectin is much safer than anything the medical establishment is using, and there definitely is a degree of efficacy. So why would it face such visceral opposition? Had the medical establishment merely talked down its efficacy to a degree, I would probably believe it. But now that they are treating this Nobel Prize-winning drug as if it’s heroin, it actually would appear that it’s super effective. During a pandemic, the FDA is now using resources to collaborate with the post office to hold packages of ivermectin from being delivered.

Last week, the World Tribune published an article revealing information that indicates the WHO likely knew ivermectin was effective for months, but blocked its use, all for Big Pharma. Dr. Andrew Hill, a senior visiting research fellow in pharmacology at Liverpool University, adviser to the Gates Foundation, and researcher for the WHO, was tasked with conducting an ivermectin trial for the WHO. Based on his preliminary findings, Hill testified enthusiastically about the use of ivermectin before the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel on Jan. 6, 2021. But then he suddenly changed course and published a study dinging the drug’s efficacy against COVID.

According to the Tribune, Dr. Tess Lawrie, director of the Evidence-based Medicine Consultancy in Bath, England, who was also involved in the ivermectin research, recorded a Zoom call she had with Hill and revealed a remarkable exchange between the two of them.

In a remarkable exchange, Hill admitted his manipulated study would likely delay the uptake of ivermectin in the UK and United States, but said he hoped his doing so would only set the lifesaving drug’s acceptance back by about “six weeks,” after which he was willing to give his support for its use. […]



Four days before publication, Hill’s sponsor Unitaid gave the University of Liverpool, Hill’s employer $40 million. Unitaid, it turns out, was also an author of the conclusions of Hill’s study.



In the call, Lawrie berated Hill’s study as “flawed,” “rushed,” “not properly put together,” and “bad research . . . bad research,” which Hill appears not to have denied.



Instead, when pressed he admitted his sponsor, Unitaid, was an unacknowledged author of conclusions.



“Unitaid has a say in the conclusions of the paper. Yeah,” he told Lawrie.

The exact exchange on the Zoom call, according to the Tribune, went as follows:

Lawrie: I really, really wish, and you’ve explained quite clearly to me, in both what you’ve been saying and in your body language that you’re not entirely comfortable with your conclusions, and that you’re in a tricky position because of whatever influence people are having on you, and including the people who have paid you and who have basically written that conclusion for you.



Hill: You’ve just got to understand I’m in a difficult position. I’m trying to steer a middle ground and it’s extremely hard.

Now, imagine the difficult position that millions of people found themselves in when they were denied access to this treatment early, and many more, even on a ventilator. Imagine how many other promising treatments we know about (and possibly ones we don’t) because research was squelched in order to deny the public a cheap and effective way around the false choice the establishment has created – either confront the bio-weapon virus without treatment or take their bio-weapon injection as the panacea?

It’s not too late for red-state governors and legislatures to correct this mistake by barring all punitive actions taken against doctors for prescribing FDA-approved drugs off label and prohibiting pharmacists from denying those prescriptions. Hospitals must also allow patients to bring in doctors to administer the drug when they are unwilling to save lives themselves. To paraphrase John Kerry about the Vietnam War, how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a lie?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-hunter-bidens-role-in-ukrainian-biolabs-raises-serious-questions-about-gain-of-function-and-ukraine-policy,2021-12-13
Horowitz: CDC Director Redfield says masks are better than a vaccine. But the virus is still spreading in masked-up places.,"Distribution of a vaccination was supposed to be the candy castle at the end of the Candyland coronavirus journey for all of us. We were told our lives must remain in shambles and our faces must be covered until there is a vaccine. Well, in one fell swoop, whether he meant to say this or not, CDC Director Robert Redfield told a Senate panel that the post-vaccine situation on the ground will be less stable than the current untenable situation in America.

In what is perhaps the most cloddish comment to be uttered by a public official since March, Redfield went out of his way to tell a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday that masks are better than vaccines. ""They are our best defense,"" said Redfield in response to a question from Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.). He added, ""I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine, because the immunogenicity may be 70 percent, and if I don't get an immune response, the vaccine is not going to protect me. This face mask will.""

We have been living through months of universal mask-wearing in many parts of the country and the world, yet the virus is spreading prolifically. Japan, Hong Kong, Israel, France, Peru, Philippines, Hawaii, California, and Miami are just a few examples of places with prolific spread long after very strict mask mandates and high compliance were in place. Is that better than a vaccine? Is Redfield suggesting that a vaccine would net an even worse result?

On the one hand, government officials are panicking about continuing community spread throughout the country and the world long after the mask mandates were in place. On the other hand, Redfield is saying that masks are more effective than a vaccine. I guess that means that even if we immediately obtained the best vaccine imaginable, we would actually have even more cases than we do now? In other words, a vaccine is worthless. Unless it's the masks that are actually worthless, as Redfield himself said clearly, regarding the idea of healthy people wearing them everywhere.

You see, masks are so effective that the CDC recommends that someone exposed to an infected individual indoors quarantine even if both the infected individual and the exposed person were wearing masks. But if both of them have something that offers more protection than even a vaccine does, then what is there to fear?



We literally have the CDC going from saying in May that there is ""no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks"" to the idea that masks are better than a vaccine. Well, if we are all ""vaccinated"" by wearing masks, then why do we continue with all the other shutdowns and restrictions? Why aren't there thousands of people at sports games?

The bureaucrats are willing to insult our intelligence to the point that they think there is no limit to our suspension of disbelief. It's one thing to suggest that masks might be a little more effective than they originally thought. But how are we to believe that they went from 0 to 100 without any political considerations when the politicians are sounding the alarm about the spread of cases long after the mask mandates? In fact, during a February hearing, Redfield went so far as to encourage people not to buy medical-grade masks, saying there's ""no role for these masks in the community."" From ""no role"" to ""the most important"" tool – and we are to believe this is about science and not politics?

Until now, officials might have been able to explain away the spread in places like Hawaii with the speculative, unverifiable assertion that perhaps without mask-wearing, the spread in some of these places would have been even worse. But Redfield now contends that mask-wearing is more effective than a vaccine. How in the world could such a mass spread of the virus occur if that were true? And how could Sweden have achieved such a flat curve and reduced its cases to negligible numbers without a vaccine and without harnessing what Redfield said is ""the most important, powerful public health tool we have""?



Then again, if you are in possession of the most powerful tool, wouldn't you learn how to use it properly? While Redfield was extolling the magical, mythical powers of the mask, he took the mask he had been wearing from an unsterile table and touched the inside and outside without washing his hands. Presumably, that was the mask he put back on when he exited the hearing, in violation of every protocol of one-time mask use, hand-washing, and disposing of the mask. Perhaps that is why the virus is spreading more than ever despite the near-universal use of a ""tool"" that is supposedly better than a vaccine.

Finally, now that Redfield believes that ""this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine,"" why do I need to wear one? If I don't get the flu vaccine this year, that doesn't make Redfield more in danger of getting the flu. If he is wearing his coat of protection, shouldn't that be even more effective, regardless of how others choose to exercise their rights over their own bodies?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-is-it-time-for-a-two-state-solution,2020-09-17
Horowitz: SCOTUS rules Nevada churches can be restricted more than casinos,"""Nip the shoots of arbitrary power in the bud, is the only maxim which can ever preserve the liberties of any people."" ~John Adams

Viruses spread more efficiently in churches than in casinos. That is the upshot of the latest Supreme Court ruling, denying fundamental First Amendment rights under the guise of protecting public safety.

In Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Sisolak, a large church in Dayton, Nevada, sued the governor for limiting church capacity to just 50 people. Anyone else who wants to pray, even following all of the masking and distancing guidelines, must be turned away. Meanwhile, in an obvious catering to special interests, casinos, gyms, restaurants, and bars can entertain up to 50 percent capacity, even if that includes several hundred people. Nobody thought this could pass constitutional muster, but once again Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four liberals and denied an appeal from the church.

""A casino with a 500-person occupancy limit may let in up to 250 people,"" but ""a church with a 500-person occupancy limit may let in only 50 people,"" said Justice Kavanaugh in a separate dissent. There were also dissents from the other three justices, Alito, Thomas, and Gorsuch.

It's truly shocking how four months into this pandemic, governors continue to violate constitutional rights without legislative input and without any benchmarks, time limits, or transparency measures that demonstrate they are using the least restrictive means of achieving a vital state interest when they conflict with individual rights. But this case is worse, because it demonstrates blatant discrimination against a protected right to gather for religious services.

If anything, as Justice Alito pointed out, churches are a calmer, more stable environment in which it is easier to keep a distance than casinos, which are the paradigm of dynamic and wild movement and intermingling.

""For Las Vegas casinos, 50% capacity often means thousands of patrons, and the activities that occur in casinos frequently involve far less physical distancing and other safety measures than the worship services that Calvary Chapel proposes to conduct,"" wrote Justice Alito in his dissent. ""Patrons at a craps or blackjack table do not customarily stay six feet apart. Casinos are permitted to serve alcohol, which is well known to induce risk taking, and drinking generally requires at least the temporary removal of masks.""

Not only that, casinos tend to attract people from all over the country, as opposed to community churches.

Casinos attract patrons from all over the country. In anticipation of reopening, one casino owner gave away 2,000 one-way airline tickets to Las Vegas. And when the Governor announced that casinos would be permitted to reopen, he invited visitors to come to the State. The average visitor to Las Vegas visits more than six different casinos, potentially gathering with far more than 50 persons in each one. Visitors to Las Vegas who gamble do so for more than two hours per day on average, and gamblers in a casino often move from one spot to another, trying their luck at different games or at least at different slot machines.



The majority of justices who denied the appeal did not explain their rationale in a written opinion. But I think we already know what it is. We no longer have equal justice under the law, but rather preferential treatment for special interests. It is the same reason that rioters have been exempted from public gathering restrictions, even though they are, by their very nature, out of control and against protocol. It's why New York Mayor Bill de Blasio canceled all summer parades but encouraged BLM protests to continue, regardless of the size. Contra Costa, California, bans gatherings over 12 people, but has allowed protests up to 100. And I'm sure if they went over the limit, it wouldn't be the protesters who would have to fear reprisal, but the cops.

What has become clear is that ordinary Americans seeking to exercise their fundamental rights in the face of unprecedented tyranny have no pathway to protection through the courts. The courts are giving standing to foreign nationals or their proxies to sue for visa issuance to get around the epidemic-driven travel suspensions, yet American citizens can't pray in church. Criminals and illegal aliens can get standing to be released from prison under the guise of stopping the spread of COVID-19, but we must put masks on our two-years olds. Suddenly, the right to privacy that plays so prominently in case law regarding abortion has no legal standing when it comes to our own bodily integrity.

At this point, our only appeal must be to the heavenly court.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-north-dakota-legislature-essentially-greenlights-bidens-immoral-mandate,2020-07-27
Horowitz: States should block caravan invaders if Biden regime refuses to do its job,"What if our own federal government openly encourages caravans to flood the border states and saddles them with violent drug cartels, crime, social ills, hospitalizations, and the public cost of mass migration from across the border? Are the states completely at the mercy of the federal government's refusal to defend the sovereignty of the whole union and that of the individual states, particularly those like Arizona and Texas at the border?

This is essentially the question Justice Antonin Scalia asked Obama's solicitor general during oral arguments in Arizona v. U.S., when the Obama administration began illegally granting amnesty to illegal aliens and preventing Arizona from enforcing the laws on the books. ""What does sovereignty mean if it does not include the ability to defend your borders?"" Scalia asked, referring to Arizona's right as an individual state to defend its own borders. ""The Constitution recognizes that there is such a thing as State borders and the States can police their borders, even to the point of inspecting incoming shipments to exclude diseased material,"" said Scalia during litigation between the Obama administration and the state of Arizona.



This discussion is even more relevant today, as the Biden regime has de facto invited caravans to come for amnesty by suspending Trump's asylum reforms and has now asked ICE to release some of the worst criminal aliens imaginable.

The Constitution is clear as to the responsibilities of the federal government and why we have one in the first place. The federal government exists not to impose more mask mandates and lockdowns on the people, but to protect their rights and security where states are inherently less capable of doing so effectively — namely, in repelling an invasion. Ironically, it is the one act of war a president can pursue without the consent of Congress, yet the invasion at our border is the only one we refuse to address. So where does that leave the states?

Scalia answered this question in his partial dissent in the 2012 Arizona case:

But there has come to pass, and is with us today, the specter that Arizona and the States that support it predicted: A Federal Government that does not want to enforce the immigration laws as written, and leaves the States' borders unprotected against immigrants whom those laws would exclude. So the issue is a stark one. Are the sovereign States at the mercy of the Federal Executive's refusal to enforce the Nation's immigration laws?



Scalia rhetorically asked:

Now, imagine a provision—perhaps inserted right after Art. I, §8, cl. 4, the Naturalization Clause—which included among the enumerated powers of Congress ""To establish Limitations upon Immigration that will be exclusive and that will be enforced only to the extent the President deems appropriate."" The delegates to the Grand Convention would have rushed to the exits.



He ended his dissent discussing Obama's amnesty and Arizona's response to it:

As is often the case, discussion of the dry legalities that are the proper object of our attention suppresses the very human realities that gave rise to the suit. Arizona bears the brunt of the country's illegal immigration problem. Its citizens feel themselves under siege by large numbers of illegal immigrants who invade their property, strain their social services, and even place their lives in jeopardy. Federal officials have been unable to remedy the problem, and indeed have recently shown that they are unwilling to do so. Thousands of Arizona's estimated 400,000 illegal immigrants—including not just children but men and women under 30—are now assured immunity from enforcement, and will be able to compete openly with Arizona citizens for employment.



Scalia concluded, ""If securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we should cease referring to it as a sovereign State.""

The Constitution is not a suicide pact for the states, as Americans are treated like criminals and criminal aliens are treated like pristine citizens. If courts were able to rule in favor of states abrogating and criminalizing the enforcement of immigration law under Trump, it's for states to enforce them while Biden is seeking to unilaterally nullify them.

As Scalia observed in the Arizona case, ""The naturalization power was given to Con­gress not to abrogate States' power to exclude those they did not want, but to vindicate it.""

What Scalia meant is that states can't be more liberal than the federal government on immigration because that would violate the national sovereignty and the choice of the union of states to deny entry. This is exactly why our Founders assigned control over immigration policy to the federal government. They didn't want states to artificially inflate their representation by flooding the entire federal union with undesirable aliens. Commenting on the power of Congress (as opposed to states) over immigration, Justice Joseph Story explained, ""If aliens might be admitted indiscriminately to enjoy all the rights of citizens at the will of a single state, the Union might itself be endangered by an influx of foreigners, hostile to its institutions, ignorant of its powers, and incapable of a due estimate of its privileges.""

While this was written in 1833, every word is speaking to liberals today in states like California that want to increase their representation at the expense of other states. Let's not forget that once an alien is admitted to the union by one state, he is free to move around anywhere in the country. Thanks to California's sanctuary policies, Americans all over the country must suffer.

Roger Sherman, among the greatest of all the Founders, noted during the House debate on the Naturalization Act of 1790 that ""it was intended by the Convention, who framed the Constitution, that Congress should have the power of naturalization, in order to prevent particular States receiving citizens, and forcing them upon others who would not have received them in any other manner"" (emphasis added). Sherman was emphatic that federal control was designed to ""guard against an improper mode of naturalization"" and prevent individual states from flooding the country with immigrants based on ""easier terms.""

James Madison, in a 1782 letter to Edmund Randolph, noted that a uniform rule of naturalization from a future federal government would cure the existing problem under the Confederation of ""the intrusion of obnoxious aliens through other States."" Writing in Federalist #42, Madison elaborated that the federalized power over naturalization solved ""a very serious embarrassment"" and ""defect"" of the Articles of Confederation, whereby ""certain descriptions of aliens, who had rendered themselves obnoxious"" can force themselves on several states had they ""acquired the character of citizens under the laws of another State.""

Thus, both the Constitution and the inherent right to sovereignty rooted in social compact theory dictates that federal control over immigration should primarily be in one direction: more restrictive than states would want, not less restrictive. Now, obviously, once the feds were given final say over immigration, the letter of the law dictates that states cannot prevent immigrants from settling within their borders where statute otherwise authorizes it. However, as Scalia noted, a state ""has the sovereign power to protect its borders more rigorously if it wishes, absent any valid federal prohibition,"" and in this case, ""Arizona is entitled to have 'its own immigration policy'—including a more rigorous enforcement policy—so long as that does not conflict with federal law.""

To that end, patriots would be wise to pressure every red state to institute a mandatory E-Verify law like the one Florida just implemented. These states must clamp down on tax fraud and identity theft and refuse to accept unaccompanied alien minors being resettled in their states.

In addition, the border states, which have their sovereignty literally violated by the caravans, smugglers, and cartels, have the right to deploy their own National Guard units to push back any invasion. Are Texas and Arizona at the mercy of Biden's criminal disregard for the violent hordes of predominantly young males attempting to crash their borders like we saw in Guatemala last week?



Article I, § 10, cl. 3 (the Compact Clause) states:

No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.



The Constitution is clear that, all things equal, states shouldn't engage in warfare with other countries. But all things are not equal in this case, and the Constitution made an exception for those times when states are invaded and in imminent danger.

Joseph Story in his commentary on the Compact Clause writes that while the prohibition on states making war is obviously necessary, it was ""wisely guarded by exceptions sufficient for the safety of the states, and not justly open to the objection of being dangerous to the Union.""

Still, a state may be so situated, that it may become indispensable to possess military forces, to resist an expected invasion, or insurrection. The danger may be too imminent for delay; and under such circumstances, a state will have a right to raise troops for its own safety, even without the consent of Congress.



Haven't the border states (the ones that still care) waited long enough, with too much delay?

Some might suggest that caravans coming north are obviously not part of a declared war. But if you look at the original language of Article IV's guarantee clause protecting states from invasion, Madison originally drafted its language to be read as protecting against ""foreign violence."" It's clear that this was not necessarily referring to formal warfare with a nation-state, but repelling violent incursions from Indian tribes. If a state can't protect against foreign violence, then what can a state do?

This past year, we have learned that states are evidently so powerful they can call an emergency and suspend our lives, liberty, and property under the guise of protecting hospitals. Perforce, those same states should be able to declare an emergency of illegal immigration (especially as they come over to use our hospitals ) and do the job the federal government refuses to do.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-now-we-know-why-the-establishment-has-always-opposed-early-treatment,2021-01-26
Horowitz: The country with the best data shows infection rates higher among the vaccinated,"The idea of mandating the vaccine to protect other people is built upon a complete lie.

Whatever side of the vaccine debate you may find yourself on, it is clear that none of us predicted cases would grow exponentially a year later, when most adults are vaccinated and there is so much more built-up immunity. The evidence that cases are growing among the vaccinated is too compelling to ignore and makes the entire push for vaccination, and certainly for mandated shots, completely unmoored from reality. Isn't it about time we start asking questions about the consequences of a leaky vaccine?

It's time to stop calling infections among the vaccinated ""breakthrough"" cases. In fact, The U.K., which posts the most comprehensive granular weekly data every Thursday, shows that COVID cases per capita are more common among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated in most age groups.

The data is from table 2 on page 14 of this past week's surveillance report. The above chart was distilled from this data on Twitter by a friend of mine.

As you can see, the vaccinated have more cases per capita in nearly all age groups except for those under 30. The only logical explanation is that the youngest cohorts were vaccinated most recently, when there might still be some degree of efficacy from the vaccine. Which is why, even among the young cohorts, the cases among the vaccinated are higher among those vaccinated earlier. What this clearly means is that its protection wears off after a few months, especially for those who need it the most. According to the Public Health England data, for the 60s age cohort, the infection rates are now 63% higher among the vaccinated than unvaccinated, up from 53% in last week's report.

Thus, any discussion of vaccine passports and mandates is completely contrary to reality. Not only do the vaccinated spread the virus, they might be doing so at greater levels. Whether the shots offer some protection against severe illness for a few extra months is still unclear, given that hospitalization rates are skyrocketing among the vaccinated, but either way, that is a personal decision whether one wants to assume the risks to achieve some lighter symptoms. The notion that unvaccinated health care workers with stronger immunity from prior infection are a greater threat to patients than those without prior immunity who are vaccinated is absurd. This point is underscored by a recent outbreak of the virus in an Israeli hospital where 39 of the 42 patients, staff, and family members infected were fully vaccinated.

At this point, it is impossible to overlook the absolute failure of this vaccine to achieve its stated goal. There were dramatically more deaths this August than last August, something that makes zero sense given the high vaccination rates. The few unvaccinated people can't be responsible for a worse outcome than when nobody was vaccinated.

We are seeing these examples all over the world, not just here and in Israel.

With 92% of adults vaccinated, Wales is experiencing the worst outcome ever:

Data show that 63% of the COVID deaths over the past 7.5 months in England were among those vaccinated:

And here is ground zero for COVID fascism: Australia:

How come nobody wants to inquire why things are worse now than ever and whether, perhaps, the leaky vaccine itself is the culprit?

For those unfamiliar with leaky vaccine syndrome, read this important 2015 PBS article about the leaky chicken vaccine for Marek's disease. The article explains how a leaky chicken vaccine was able to make this devastating virus among chickens both more transmissible and more virulent, bucking the micro-evolutionary phenomenon that forces the two factors to work inversely.

In a second experiment, unvaccinated and vaccinated chickens were infected with one of the five Marek's disease strains, and then put into a second arena with a second set of unimmunized birds, known as sentinels. In particular, the team was interested in a middle-of-the-road strain called ""595"" and whether it would become hotter.



It did. The virus spread to sentinel birds nine days faster if it came from a vaccinated chicken versus an unvaccinated one. In addition, sentinels died faster when exposed to vaccinated chickens versus unvaccinated chickens.

The article explains how a leaky vaccine that only ameliorates symptoms for the vaccinated chickens allows the virus to become more virulent and spread more widely in live hosts. In the case of the Marek's disease vaccine, it devastated all of the unvaccinated chickens. This is exactly what we saw in the American South around July, about six months into the vaccination program, the time when Israeli studies have shown the COVID vaccine (at least Pfizer) begins to leak. Then, as time progressed, even the protection from serious illness among the vaccinated began to wear off, which is why Big Pharma and the media are now pushing the boosters. But why is nobody asking the obvious question: Will endless boosters will continue to perpetuate a cycle of viral immune escape, as great vaccinologists like Geert Vanden Bossche warned about earlier this year?

In the 2015 PBS article, the author ominously warns that if we ever were concerned that such a leaky vaccine phenomenon would occur in human vaccines, the following question would be the first indicator: ""Does the vaccine merely reduce symptoms, or does it also keep patients from getting infected and transmitting the virus?""

Well, that is exactly the way they are now selling the vaccine – that it only helps against some symptoms – and not coincidentally, the spread is worse than ever before! Take Florida, for example: With a very high senior vaccination rate, especially in places like Miami, it had a 94% increase in deaths this August over last August.

What we have been experiencing since July is exactly the nightmare of the leaky chicken vaccine for Marek's disease. And that is one of the many reasons why we have never successfully developed a coronavirus vaccine. A 2003 experimental observation of SARS vaccine development presciently advised, ""Application of a SARS vaccine is perhaps best limited to a minimal number of targeted individuals who can be monitored, as some vaccinated persons might, if infected by SARS coronavirus, become asymptomatic excretors of virus, thereby posing a risk to non-vaccinated people.""

Well, here we are today with a mass coronavirus vaccine campaign nobody in a previous generation could have imagined, and we have worse spread from the vaccinated than before the vaccination campaign. We are experiencing the exact opposite of the false premise used by pro-mandate politicians; namely, it's the vaccinated endangering others.

Why is nobody asking the two most salient questions: 1) If the vaccine is leaking this much on transmission, why is there no concern that it is also the culprit for making the virus more virulent? 2) If it leaks this much on transmission, who is to say any degree of efficacy against serious illness, which is already waning, won't diminish completely?



As they push booster shots, and in Israel are mandating them, this is the subtle reason for why Big Pharma and the media are now pushing their magical expensive therapeutics. Pfizer is touting a drug in development, and Merck is already requesting emergency use authorization for molnupiravir, a drug with no safety profile.

Pfizer has been advertising a ""need"" for a therapeutic while Twitter promotes it as a paid ad, despite the massive conflict of interest.

Over the weekend, former FDA administrator and chief spokesman for Big Pharma Scott Gottlieb said on CNBC, ""Once we start vaccinating our children, and once we have an anti-viral in hand I think society and psychology around this disease will change."" Notice he added in the anti-viral to the equation? Remember, Gottlieb is on the board of directors of Pfizer, an appalling conflict of interest none of the networks are concerned about. They are clearly signaling the demise of their own idolatry and are ready to move onto the next scam.

But why would we need therapeutics if the vaccines are not only working but are so unassailable that they must be mandated? And if they lied to us about the efficacy and safety of the vaccines and remdesivir, why would we trust them with their new therapeutics over other long-standing effective and safe off-patent drugs? Indeed, science in this era is all about $cience.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-redfield-masks-better-than-vaccine,2021-10-04
Horowitz: The despicable and indefensible approval of Merck’s dangerous COVID drug,"The FDA has refused to even explore approval of cheap, safe, and effective repurposed drugs for 20 months, despite mounds of evidence from studies vouching for their efficacy and safety. So, naturally, now that the agency is on track to issue an emergency use authorization to the first outpatient drug for COVID, this one must be the greatest thing since penicillin, right? Wrong! In fact, the drug is so dangerous and has so many known and unknown side effects that the FDA advisory committee members basically admitted this was a “difficult” decision and that they could rescind the authorization later on. This decision makes their rejection of ivermectin, fluvoxamine, nitazoxanide, and hydroxychloroquine all the more indefensible.

If you liked remdesivir, you will surely like Merck’s molnupiravir, which was developed with the help of the same entities guarding its approval based on flawed data produced by the company itself that is making over $1 billion off the federal government. No conflict of interest whatsoever!

Although the fix was in because no drug produced by Merck or Pfizer – no matter how dangerous – will ever be turned down, the approval was as revealing as it was appalling. The fact that the vote even by these compromised hacks was 13-10 demonstrates just how problematic molnupiravir likely is out of the gate.

Yesterday, the FDA’s Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee voted 13-10 to approve molnupiravir at 800 milligrams twice a day for five days of COVID treatment for people in at-risk categories. It still needs official approval from the FDA and the CDC before it can be used, but the fix has long been in.

As CNBC reports, even those who voted for the drug admitted that it was a difficult decision and asked to revisit the authorization down the road. They conceded, as I have warned, that this drug can be mutagenic and cause birth defects, in addition to the fact that Merck’s own manipulated data show the efficacy is very modest.

“Given the large potential population affected, the risk of widespread effects on potential birth defects, especially delayed effects on the male, has not been adequately studied,” warned Dr. Sankar Swaminathan, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Utah School of Medicine, who voted no.

As CNBC reports:

The FDA and Merck both recommended against using the drug in kids and pregnant women. Molnupiravir was found to be lethal to embryos in pregnant rats, also causing birth defects and reducing fetal body weight. It also caused other defects that interfered with bone growth in young pups, along with other abnormalities, the data shows.

Just like the vaccines and remdesivir, this drug hits the triple crown – fails on efficacy, causes injury, and also induces mutants and viral escape, possibly making the virus worse. In the FDA’s briefing document on the drug for yesterday’s meeting, it states clearly that “there are potential safety concerns pertaining to MOV, including embryofetal toxicity, bone and cartilage toxicity, and mutagenicity.” They also observe that there is evidence molnupiravir “may increase the rate of changes in the viral spike protein, which, in theory, could enhance SARS-CoV-2 spike protein evolution.""

“Of particular interest, in some participants, MOV treatment was associated with amino acid changes at sites/regions of spike that are likely under immune or other evolutionary pressure,"" warns the onetime gatekeeper that has now become a collaborator with Big Pharma. This sounds an awful lot like Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche’s warning about the vaccines placing evolutionary pressure on the virus, which likely resulted in making it more durable this year than in 2020. “Collectively, these analyses indicate MOV treatment may increase the rate of emergence of SARS-CoV-2 populations with amino acid changes in the viral spike protein, consistent with its mutagenic mechanism of action,” warns the FDA.

Nonetheless, Dr. Michael Green, a pediatric transplant specialist at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Division of Infectious Diseases, said the lack of available therapies swayed him and others to vote to approve the drug.

The problem is that after incurring such unknown risk for a drug that has never succeeded and has known safety problems, the efficacy is very modest. Even Merck’s own trial shows barely any efficacy for Delta, and we all know by now how reliable the data can be from the manufacturer itself!





Even more bizarrely, after Merck announced a 50% reduction in hospitalizations from the first phase of its trial announced in October, just last week the company announced that the combined efficacy is down to 30%. As some have pointed out, that raises serious concerns as to what has happened with the drug’s trial, given that the data from just phase 2 would indicate negative efficacy for the drug, with 4.7% hospitalized in the placebo group compared to 6.2% in the molnupiravir group.

Also, remember that it has already bombed out in terms of efficacy for moderate COVID and never had the potential to work in late stages because it is not anti-inflammatory like ivermectin. The FDA concedes up front that there is zero proven benefit after day five of symptoms.

So, we are trading so much risk of injury and making the virus worse for a short window of potentially modest efficacy at a cost of $700 per person. If this is the standard for approval during an emergency, how on earth could the FDA refuse to greenlight drugs that have already established a robust safety profile for decades when independent studies from people who don’t stand to benefit show much greater efficacy and for a broader spectrum of disease at a cheaper price?

The FDA and NIH are willing to give a drug known for birth defects with low efficacy to women of childbearing age outpatient but won’t even allow a Nobel Prize-winning drug safer than Tylenol as a last resort to someone dying.

Just rinsing your nose and mouth with Betadine at the onset of symptoms or preventively works better than this drug, according to Merck’s own data.

Again, why would our government refuse to recommend any of these therapeutics and treatments but continue to support remdesivir and now approve molnupiravir, two dangerous and likely ineffective drugs? And what does that tell us about the process and transparency behind the FDA’s perceived safety and efficacy of the vaccines?

There are no innocuous answers to these questions.

Janet Cragan, a medical officer at the CDC and a panelist on the FDA advisory committee, bizarrely conceded at Tuesday’s meeting that “there are definite concerns about the potential effects of this drug on the embryo and the fetus,” but then said she has problems denying the drug to people! “I don’t think you can ethically say it’s OK to give this drug in pregnancy. [But] I’m not sure you can tell a pregnant women who has Covid-19 that she can’t have the drug if she has decided that’s what she needs.”

Well, how about denying the safest drugs around to everyone with COVID for the past 20 months???!!!

Roy Baynes, the Merck executive at the meeting, even had the nerve to suggest that it’s not for the FDA to tell doctors not to use the drug even in pregnant women! “But I think the idea here is that ultimately the physician is the best position to determine the relative risk-benefit for their patients,” said Baynes.



With its eight mechanisms of action against COVID and award-winning safety profile established for decades, ivermectin trounces molnupiravir in every consideration. As a 2017 article published in Nature’s Journal of Antibiotics observed, “Few, if any, other drugs can rival ivermectin for its beneficial impact on human health and welfare."" The authors noted that ""ivermectin is continuing to surprise and excite scientists, offering more and more promise to help improve global public health by treating a diverse range of diseases, with its unexpected potential as an antibacterial, antiviral and anti-cancer agent being particularly extraordinary.” They fortuitously predicted, “Essentially, a unique, multifaceted ‘wonder’ drug of the past and present may yet become an even more exceptional drug of the future."" Sadly, our government is denying that future and that of several other important safe, off-patent drugs.

Anyone who can’t see the conflict of interest in this powerful juxtaposition is willfully blind to the irremediable corruption in the NIH, the CDC, and the FDA.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-scotus-rules-nevada-churches-can-be-restricted-more-than-casinos,2021-12-01
"Horowitz: To serve the cult of COVID fascism, feds criminally charge chiropractor who marketed lifesaving vitamin D and zinc","The government is not only working with Big Pharma, the media, and Big Tech to censor any lifesaving treatment and medical advice, it is now criminalizing doctors who seek to strengthen the immune systems of their patients. It started with hydroxychloroquine, then continued with ivermectin. Now the government is going after doctors for promoting vitamin D and zinc, two of the most wondrous natural supplements that have proven critical to bolstering one's immune system from serious COVID-19 symptoms.

At a time when the doctors in government and Big Pharma are misleading the public — often with deadly results — about the efficacy of lockdowns, masks, experimental mRNA, and expensive, ineffective treatments like Remdesivir, a Missouri doctor has been charged for marketing a cocktail of vitamin D and zinc as treatment against the virus.

According to KHOU-TV1, Eric Nepute and his company, Quickwork LLC, are facing 10 counts in federal court of violating the ""COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act."" The Federal Trade Commission contends that this act grants it authority to make a determination that the Missouri chiropractor, who owns several Nepute Wellness Center locations in St. Louis County, ""baselessly"" claimed his product works against COVID at least as well as the vaccines.

Nepute's crime? He dared use his First Amendment rights to say zinc and vitamin D were better than the experimental mRNA gene therapy. The FTC is charging him with fraud after he claimed ""COVID-19 patients who get enough vitamin D are 52% less likely to die"" and that his product, Wellness Warriors, is more effective than the vaccines.

""The defendants' claims that their products can stand in for approved COVID-19 vaccines are particularly troubling: we need to be doing everything we can to stop bogus health claims that endanger consumers,"" acting Chairwoman Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said.

Now that we no longer have freedom of speech in this country, when will Fauci get charged for marketing the vaccines as more effective than previous infection and masks as the single most effective tool against transmission, when a new CDC letter that has been exposed online via a FOIA request shows the agency admitting no evidence of any efficacy exists?

In reality, Nepute is correct. Vitamin D is the master key to the immune system and almost seems to be created just for this virus. Most people who get critically ill from this virus suffer from cytokine storm, in which their own immune systems attack the body because there is not enough vitamin D to regulate the immune response. This is why the elderly and dark-skinned people above the 35th parallel, who are most often vitamin D deficient, are at risk.

A massive study of 14,000 people in Israel showed that almost nobody over 60 who had sufficient vitamin D levels wound up being hospitalized from this virus. A recent study from University of Florida Gainesville found that ""patients with vitamin D deficiency were 4.6 times more likely to be positive for COVID-19 than patients with no deficiency."" With something as safe and effective as vitamin D, not to mention the myriad of other benefits from it, why isn't the government spending money advertising supplements the way it does experimental vaccines and masks?

What about zinc? Anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of immunology or anyone who ever suffers from cold-like viruses understands that zinc is one of the most critical elements in fortifying one's immune system against the prevalence and severity of respiratory viruses. Zinc plays a major role in producing cytokines and developing B cells that play such a dominant role in killing RNA-type viruses. As Dr. Vladimir Zelenko discovered when he prescribed zinc and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, zinc blocks the virus from accessing the enzyme needed for viral replication. Thus, much as with vitamin D, most people who have proper levels of zinc in their cells will not have a problem with this virus.

Yet it's estimated that over 20% of people in the world are zinc deficient, particularly the elderly and especially nursing home residents, which is why most people who get seriously ill from this virus are elderly. It's the same people who are vitamin D deficient. This is why a recent study published in Science Direct (Heller, Sun, et al) found that zinc deficiency among patients first admitted to the hospital seemed ""to provide the most valuable information about disease course and prognosis."" They found in their sample that 73.5% of the patients who ultimately died from the virus had zinc levels below 638.7 Ug/l.

For our government to now criminalize proven preventives against this virus as trade fraud while fraudulently marketing their crony fascism as a cure after 14 months of failure is nothing short of genocide.

And where does this authority come from? Evidently, Trump and the GOP Senate passed this bill as part of the massive 2124-page omnibus bill last December. In chilling language that we now know was likely designed by the ultimate fraudsters – Big Pharma – the bill prohibits ""any person, partnership, or corporation to engage in a deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce associated with the treatment, cure, prevention, mitigation, or diagnosis of COVID–19.""



Sadly, last night, Sen. Tim Scott, heralded, ""Last year, under Republican leadership, we passed five bipartisan COVID packages."" Bipartisan, indeed. We cannot imagine the damage to our liberties that will continue to be unearthed as a result of those bills.

Here's the tragic irony. A poll released last month by the American Psychological Association found that 48 percent of adults who have already been vaccinated still feel ""uneasy"" about returning to in-person interactions once the pandemic is over. If only the fraudsters in the government and medical establishment had educated these same people for 14 months about natural supplements to elevate their vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc levels and to have ivermectin on the shelf to be used at the first sign of trouble, most people would no longer fear the virus because almost nobody would die from it.

Sadly, fear is what they want. We've learned this week that Fauci and his ilk never plan to relinquish their control. The only way they can get away with promoting irrational and internally conflicting policies is by keeping the masses in a state of irrational fear. We can only take comfort in the fact that God in his heavenly court is keeping track of these atrocities and one day will punish them for committing the ultimate trade fraud.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-states-should-block-caravan-invaders-if-biden-regime-refuses-to-do-its-job,2021-04-29
Horowitz: Why are Republicans going along with the blank check for Ukraine?,"Over the past two generations of foreign policy blunders, our government has failed to formulate an exit strategy. Now, as it relates to the endless transfer of cash and arms to the capricious Ukrainian government, we don’t even have an entry strategy. Nobody could explain in a few coherent sentences what exactly we hope to accomplish, how our sacrifice will sustain anything in the face of inveterate ethnic conflicts in eastern Ukraine, or why it’s worth exacerbating the worst supply chain crisis in our lifetime. All Republicans know is that they want to trip over themselves to outbid Biden’s virtue-signaling on the dime of American taxpayers and consumers.

We thought Republicans learned their lesson from COVID legislation not to jump on expensive, civilization-changing legislation just to be on the “right side” of the new, ephemeral “current thing,” but we were wrong. When Biden pledged his original cash payments and weapons to Ukraine’s fractured civilization, Republicans demanded that he spend even more money. We got $13.6 billion out of that deal. Then all but 10 Republicans in the House just voted for an unconditional “lend-lease” weapons transfer program. Now Biden is demanding another $33 billion in spending, $20 billion of which will be more arms. Those are Iraq/Afghanistan level numbers.

There are certain basic questions anyone should be asking at this point. Republicans should start demanding answers to the following:

Where are the money and arms going, and how are they not going toward the neo-Nazi Azov brigade that will, in the small chance they defeat the Russians, continue persecuting the ethnic Russians and fuel an intermittent conflict with Russia in perpetuity?

Why has our government, and the Biden family in particular, been so obsessed with Ukraine for years, and how do we know this money is not going to fund the very same grifting elements behind the Russia collusion story?

Don’t we first want to investigate why the same players involved in the Wuhan research have been involved with the bio-labs in Ukraine and how this funding is affecting those endeavors and the corrupt people behind them?

Ukraine is on Russia’s border, and in the eastern part of the country, Ukrainians are Russian kinsmen. Especially after the sacrifice of the past few months, Russia is not budging. There is no way arms and cash will ever deter or dissuade the Russians. All they will accomplish is to continue to fuel the macro-war and more internal ethnic bloodshed with an uncontrolled flow of weapons. Short of a full-scale allied invasion against Russia, this “middle ground” of cash and weapons will actually fuel the worst outcome. How will this not result in more needless bloodshed?

Then again, forgetting about commitment of troops, the other European countries have barely devoted a fraction of the funding that we have. If the Europeans clearly aren’t worried about this being the “Poland and Hitler moment of 1938,” then why are we barreling head-first into the next Sunni vs. Shia-equivalent dumpster fire?

All the while, the more we fuel the war rather than encourage Zelenskyy to give up what is already given up, we will make Americans (and the world) suffer with endless supply shortages. The Western oligarchs have been open about the fact that prolonging the Ukrainian conflict will help transition us away from individual freedom and our abundance of fossil fuels. Diederik Samsom, chief of staff for Frans Timmermans, the European commission’s executive vice president responsible for energy policy, recently said that the “geopolitical imbalances” have made us realize “we have paid way too little” for food and fuel in the past 40 years.

As for the latter point, that might be an added feature to this strategy for the left, but conservative Republicans supposedly care about American taxpayers and consumers. So why are they, including Freedom Caucus members, unquestioningly joining this morass?

There is no greater ally to Ukraine than Israel, with tremendous cultural and economic ties. Israel has taken in a lot of refugees. But at the same time, the Israeli prime minister advised Zelenskyy to give in to Putin’s demands on the ethnic Russian territories and NATO membership. The Israelis understand that this cost is already sunk from years of weak NATO and U.S. policies that on the one hand poked the Russian bear relentlessly, but then weakened their own hard and soft power deterrents both on military power and energy independence – placing them at the mercy of the Kremlin’s demand.

Last Thursday, all but 10 Republicans voted for a bill (S.3522) that will allow the DOD to transfer any weapon of war aside from nuclear weapons to the tenuous Ukrainian government.

Do we even know where these weapons are landing? In a recent expose, CNN quoted a defense official who conceded, “It drops into a big black hole, and you have almost no sense of it at all after a short period of time.""

""I couldn't tell you where they are in Ukraine and whether the Ukrainians are using them at this point,"" a senior defense official told reporters earlier this year regarding Mi-17 helicopters, 155 mm Howitzer cannons, Switchblade drones, and Javelin and Stinger missiles.

This after the Pentagon just admitted to leaving $7 billion in weaponry behind in Afghanistan.

So, after two decades of funding multiple sides of every Middle Eastern conflict, in which our weapons kept trading sides as quickly as Harper’s Ferry changed hands in the U.S. Civil War, we’ve learned nothing from our blunders? It’s no wonder the White House had to enlist the help of “TikTok stars” to propagate support for its Ukrainian escapade. Sadly, Republicans didn’t even need convincing.



And who are we supporting? Is the Ukrainian regime really worse than Putin? The civil rights violations are appalling. Have we even conditioned the aid to democratic reforms? Of course not.

Republicans and conservative media had a good laugh out of Biden’s horrifically incoherent, and essentially insane, statement attempting to articulate who and what we are fighting in Ukraine. However, the laugh is really on them, because their strategic thinking is just as gibberish. At least Biden can blame it on cognitive decline.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-country-with-the-best-data-shows-infection-rates-higher-among-the-vaccinated,2022-05-02
"Horowitz: Yes, state legislatures do indeed have the final say over this election","It's not like the framers of our Constitution or the crafters of federal election law never envisioned the challenge of contested elections and prepared a method for resolution. In fact, they did prepare for this scenario, and they clearly intended for the state legislatures to have the most power to resolve any conflict over the validity of election results.

Last week, I wrote an article reminding Republican-controlled legislative bodies in states with widespread concerns of voter fraud that the Constitution vests in them the ultimate authority to appoint presidential electors. I noted that, because the Constitution allows them to completely bypass a popular vote when selecting those electors, they can certainly decide, if the preponderance of evidence indicates the results are tainted, how they wish to choose those who ultimately cast the ballot for the president.

Several state legislators in key states have reached out to me expressing interest in reclaiming their authority rather than allowing the courts (or worse, the media) to have the final say. However, some have expressed concerns about limitations on their power, given delegated authority that has already passed out of their chambers years ago.

In some states, the legislature cannot convene a special session outside the regular session (typically in January) without the consent of the governor. Lawmakers from these states are concerned that they might not be able to convene without the green light from a Democrat governor who clearly has no interest in further investigating election fraud.

Other legislators have raised questions about whether they can reclaim their constitutional power to select the electors after they have already delegated the authority to the political parties based on the winner of the popular election.

The answer to both of these concerns lies in federal law. 3 U.S.C. §2 states clearly: ""Whenever any State has held an election for the purpose of choosing electors, and has failed to make a choice on the day prescribed by law, the electors may be appointed on a subsequent day in such a manner as the legislature of such State may direct.""

Thus, even if we accept the argument that legislators cannot abolish popular elections and return to the original practice without passing a new statute (which would require the signature of the governor), that is not what they would be doing here. There has already been a popular election. And assuming the results remain contested and unclear, federal law dictates they alone are responsible for resolving it. Given the existing plenary power to select electors, plus the power of Congress to set the time for voting on them (and Congress gave the authority to the legislators to control that process), it's hard to see how any other state law would supersede such power in this case – at least as it relates to the presidential election.

The fact that any state statute would not supersede the legislature's plenary power of selection of the electors seems clear from the language in the landmark Supreme Court case McPherson v. Blacker (1892). In the unanimous opinion, the court cited an 1874 Senate report, which explained the power as follows:

""The appointment of these electors is thus placed absolutely and wholly with the legislatures of the several states. They may be chosen by the legislature, or the legislature may provide that they shall be elected by the people of the state at large, or in districts, as are members of Congress, which was the case formerly in many states; and it is, no doubt, competent for the legislature to authorize the governor, or the supreme court of the state, or any other agent of its will, to appoint these electors. This power is conferred upon the legislatures of the states by the Constitution of the United States, and cannot be taken from them or modified by their state constitutions any more than can their power to elect senators of the United States. Whatever provisions may be made by statute, or by the state constitution, to choose electors by the people, there is no doubt of the right of the legislature to resume the power at any time, for it can neither be taken away nor abdicated.""

Accordingly, we see that even without the federal law, it's clear that such a degree of plenary power cannot be abdicated by state statutes. Therefore, there is never a scenario when they would need the consent of the governor – either to convene or to pass a new statute.

Nobody is saying to rush into this final result. It's the Biden camp that is rushing to short-circuit a count on a style of balloting that necessarily takes several weeks to verify and that he pushed for. What I am suggesting is that the legislatures must convene hearings and investigations to shadow the litigation in court.

Just reading through some of the allegations asserted in a sworn affidavit from GOP poll challenger and former assistant attorney general for Michigan Zachary Larsen, on the alleged fraud he observed in Detroit, is enough to convene a special session in the state of Michigan. Then we have the supposed glitches in numerous states from faulty software. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg in Georgia already agreed last month that the new voting system, which is used in many other states, ""presents serious security vulnerability and operational issues"" caused by ""fundamental deficits and exposure. ... These risks are neither hypothetical nor remote under the current circumstances""



It's the job of the legislatures to investigate all of this information. If they determine that the fraud is sufficient to negate the unofficial results of the election, then they should demand that the governor hold a new election without mail-in ballots. If the governors in those states refuse, then it would be time for the legislatures to exercise their constitutional power. The only people who see no fraud are those who refuse to investigate. Any Republican who is elected to state office in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Georgia who refuse to join such an investigation are clearly unworthy of their office.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-despicable-and-indefensible-approval-of-mercks-dangerous-covid-drug,2020-11-10
What I am thankful for this year: Christ's unimpeachable victory over sin and death,"When dwelling on political ephemera and dealing with the tribulations that crop up in our day-to-day, it can be easy to lose sight of the bigger picture and, with that occasional loss of cosmic focus, perhaps also easy to lose hope.

After all, we have much to concern ourselves with and much that might prompt us time-bound creatures to despair.

There are, for instance, foreign entanglements that may soon embroil us in horrific global conflicts; cultural forces that seek to undermine our relationship with the truth and strike at the pillars of our civilization; and politicians who seek to subordinate the will of the many to bolster the power of a select few. Wars, iconoclasts, and tyranny are nothing new, but in the grand scheme of things, they are newly conquered.

In the Near East just two millennia ago, God became man and dwelt among us. Like many in America and across the world, I hold true that He conquered sin and death and that the gates of hell cannot prevail against His pilgrim church on earth.

The Catholic political scientist Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn — hailed as a ""great teacher and a great man"" by William Buckley Jr. — underscored in ""The Timeless Christian” how “Christ broke the power of Satan so that since Christ’s sacrificial death we live in an eschatological period when evil is fighting only a rear-guard action, even though this can effect quite considerable destruction of the good.”

In the pages of TheBlaze, often we report on the nature of that rear-guard action, whereby evil, marked for annihilation since the crucifixion, does significant damage in the here and now. But upon prayerful reflection every morning, I am refilled with hope and gratitude, recognizing that no matter how seemingly insurmountable our daily battles, the war has ultimately been won on our behalf.

What's more, it wasn’t won by remote decree. It was won in person in the ultimate form of revolution, when the Creator washed the feet of and suffered at the hands of his creations, dying so that we might live.

G.K. Chesterton noted in “Orthodoxy” that ""Christianity alone has felt that God, to be wholly God, must have been a rebel as well as a king.”

Like our rebel God before his ultimate act of rebellion, we can break bread with our friends and families on Thursday knowing that we have the love of the Father and the support of the Holy Spirit — and that we share in the Son’s eternal victory.

I am doubly grateful to God this Thanksgiving, not only that I should have had this time on Earth with my lovely wife, unborn daughter, and wonderful family, but that after our age has passed, we will meet again, having been freed from sin and death.

I pray that you and your families, both created and saved by the perfect source of all love, truth, hope, and wisdom, have a wonderful Thanksgiving in the knowledge that while we continue to fight the good fight together, victory is forever ours.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-to-serve-the-cult-of-covid-fascism-feds-criminally-charge-chiropractor-who-marketed-lifesaving-vitamin-d-and-zinc,2022-11-24
Joe Biden's viral 'fat' comment exposes our culture's toxic belief that brashness equals strength,"Our culture continues to embrace a toxic belief that is infesting our politics, media, and most disturbingly, our hearts and minds: the notion that brashness, bullying, and a “go get 'em"" approach to life, business, and politics is equivalent to strength, courage, and success.

This lie continues to be perpetuated by our leaders, the very people we've chosen to represent us on the national and international stages. Too often, these politicians' behaviors and actions reinforce the very things many of us routinely struggle to keep our own kids from doing.

Nastiness, vindictiveness, anger, unrestrained commentary — the list goes on. Our political dysfunction and the divisiveness it feeds continue to splinter us, threatening to further plunge our culture into an “us vs. them"" oblivion. And it's all tragically needless.

As I watched former Vice President Joe Biden last week verbally demean a retired Iowa farmer, I wish I could say I was shocked or surprised. Sadly, the spectacle, which quickly went viral, was just the latest in a stream of horrifying and embarrassing political rantings.

If you haven't seen the video, I'll spare you with this quick recap: Biden called the man “a damn liar"" over comments the voter made about Biden's son, Hunter Biden. Biden, clearly frustrated, proceeded to challenge the ex-farmer to push-ups before bizarrely proclaiming, “Look, fat, look.""

It was a cringe-worthy and bizarre moment, one that follows a slew of similar — and even more troubling — personal attacks over the past few years from President Donald Trump that have either been spoken aloud or tweeted.

The point here isn't to speak out against Biden or Trump, though. Instead, it's to highlight a dangerous trend we're all enabling. As a culture, we've traded in kindness, goodness, and self-control, replacing them with a toxic terseness that too often masquerades as faux boldness.

Attacking and demeaning people isn't brave, nor is it a mark of true success. It's lazy, unrestrained, and unbefitting of anyone, especially a president or presidential hopeful. Kindness, compassion, self-control, and care — especially for those with whom we disagree — are the true markings of good character. Yet, the examples of those living this out are increasingly rare.

At a time when we have all the resources and tools to be the most connected and cogent, we find ourselves openly relishing in these acts of mudslinging or, at the least, silently cheering.

Biden and Trump aren't the only ones at fault, though. Social media is also a disaster, characterized by endless barrages of attacks over politics, faith, and so many other factors. We're no longer willing to gracefully agree; instead, it's about “winning"" at any cost.

We're sending some insanely conflicting messages to our children about what it means to be successful — and decent. Perhaps too many of us have forgotten the toxic political climate we all survived in 2016; maybe we've simply become immune to the chaos.

Either way, it's time for a wake-up call. With 2020 upon us, we're poised to experience a level of ugliness in the political realm that could very well transcend that of the Trump-Clinton debacle.

Rather than relishing in the chaos and consternation, perhaps we need to take a step back and reflect, not only on what Biden, Trump and other leaders are saying, but on how we, too, are interacting with one another.

I'll leave you with this important reminder from Galatians 5:22-23 (NIV): “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-why-are-republicans-going-along-with-the-blank-check-for-ukraine,2019-12-09
Commentary: Remember Justine Damond? Delayed or absent police accountability transcends race.,"The entire world right now is focused on the Minneapolis Police Department because three of its officers knelt on the back and neck of an unarmed black man named George Floyd, and the other stood nearby and did nothing to stop them. Four days after Floyd's death, former officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, was charged with murder in Floyd's death. Wednesday, nine days after Floyd's death, the other three fired officers were taken into custody and booked on charges of aiding and abetting murder, and aiding and abetting manslaughter.

Meanwhile, in Louisville, Kentucky, the police officers who shot and killed Breonna Taylor in a late night drug raid in March remain at large, having been placed on ""administrative reassignment.""

A significant impetus for the protests around the country has been the feeling of anger, not just at the fact that these incidents happened, but at how long it has taken the police officers involved in these two incidents to face charges for their actions. On that point, I am in strong agreement with the protesters, as I've already stated.

Additionally, it is asserted that the fact that the officers took so long to face charges is evidence of racism. On that point, I am not so sure.

I've been writing about police issues from a conservative/libertarian perspective for a long, long time. I've probably read more data and studies on race and policing than just about anyone in America. I've read the Harvard study which suggests that black and Hispanic citizens are more likely in some jurisdictions to have force used against them by police, but not more likely to be shot. A couple years ago I was sent a review copy of a book that showed evidence that black people were targeted by police in North Carolina in traffic stops, and I read the whole thing. I am also aware of the studies that have tended to show, in examining some locations, that there is little or no bias in the application of police force.

As I get older, I feel more comfortable answering questions that I don't have the data for with ""I'm not sure,"" so if you pressed me for an answer about whether black people or other minorities are systematically targeted by cops, I would say, ""I'm not sure,"" but I think the actual answer is ""it depends."" Or, more fully, ""It depends on where in the country you are and what police department you are dealing with."" That's the best explanation I can come up with for the conflicting mountains of evidence out there, most of which is pulled from disparate locations. It also comports with what I have experienced with studying the practices of individual police departments, which is that there are widely divergent behaviors from city to city and jurisdiction to jurisdiction when it comes to police.

A separate question, which is far less studied, is the extent to which the race of police officers and/or their victims matters in the decision of whether police are held accountable with criminal charges. The reason there is a dearth of scientific study on this issue is probably largely due to small sample size: Officers are so seldom held accountable with criminal charges regardless of the circumstances that the boogeyman of the small sample size likely would make any study that attempted to examine it subject to legitimate criticism. As I've noted before, when New York City cops shoot 180 citizens over a 10-year period and only one of those cops is convicted of a crime of any sort (and only three are even charged), you're likely looking at an issue that is resistant to systemic study.

People do believe that it exists, and believe it strongly, however, and so what occurs tends to largely be an argument over anecdotes.

Several days ago, I listened to the entirety of Rush Limbaugh's appearance on ""The Breakfast Club."" During the course of the interview, Charlamagne tha God and Limbaugh had the following fascinating exchange:

CTG: You know what white privilege is? White privilege is that what happened to George Floyd wouldn't have happened to a white man.



[crosstalk]



Limbaugh: If what happened to George Floyd had happened to a white man, we probably wouldn't have even heard about it.

CTG: You definitely would have heard about it. You definitely would have heard about it. [Crosstalk]



....



DJ Envy: He's right, Charlamagne, he's right. You wouldn't have heard about it, and you know why? Because that cop would have been arrested, he would have been fired, he would have been charged with murder, a long time before all this. Immediately. Before the video had hit the social media, he'd have been charged, fired, arrested, locked up and all that, if George Floyd was white.



CTG: There's a Muslim officer in Minneapolis now doing twelve and a half years because he accidentally killed a white woman on duty. So I don't get it.

From there the conversation moved on to other topics, and the tragic case of Justine Damond (whose name was not mentioned, and who probably 95% of America has never heard of) was not mentioned again.

But it made me think back to that case, which I hadn't thought of in months, and so I went back and looked at the facts of that case. Here is a case where the exact opposite of the George Floyd situation happened. A black cop shot a completely unarmed (literally barefoot) white female in an affluent neighborhood who was only in interaction with the cops because she called them for help to report a possible rape. The officer's defense was that he shot Damond in the chest because she slapped the back of the police cruiser and startled him (of note, fingerprints were taken of the vehicle and none belonged to Damond, calling even this hilariously flimsy excuse into question).

The parallels are eerie and offer the rare opportunity for the one-for-one comparison: the incidents involved the same police department, the same prosecutor who was responsible for making a charging decision, and occurred less than three years apart.

Well, in fact, were the cops fired, arrested, charged, and locked up before the time it would take to upload a video to social media? In fact, they were not. In spite of widespread local outcry, a grand jury was not even convened to consider charges against the police officer, Mohammed Noor, until February 2018, almost seven months later. He was not charged until March 2018, eight months after the shooting. He remained with the police department (albeit on administrative leave) until he was charged.

Outrageously, when investigating the killing, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which was tasked with conducting an independent investigation of the shooting, obtained a warrant of Damond's home and searched it, even though she was shot and killed outside of her home and the undisputed evidence was that she was not armed. Imagine the indignity of the police rifling through your stuff, undoubtedly looking for dirt to smear Damond with in the media, after having killed her. What possible evidence that was actually germane to their killing could they have found?

In December 2017, five months after Damond was killed, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said basically the same crap he said when explaining why no one had been charged three days after Floyd's death: ""While some clamor for swift justice, only careful, detailed work and careful analysis brings us real justice. That is what this case deserves and that is what it will get."" He said this, by the way, in the midst of an apology for having had the temerity to have privately criticized the pace of the BCA's investigation.

It may well be the case (and probably is) that black people, at least in certain locations, are subject to more use of force, and perhaps unjustified use of force by police. But from what I have seen, police and the timid prosecutors who work with them are just as likely to inexcusably drag their feet and victim blame when the victim of a police killing is white as they are when the victim is black.

They certainly did in the case of Justine Damond. And whenever it happens, regardless of the race of the cop or the victim, we have to demand better accountability than what we have been getting.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-yes-state-legislatures-do-indeed-have-the-final-say-over-this-election,2020-06-04
LeBron James' China comments put the NBA's social justice hypocrisy on full display,"On Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 2018, LeBron James tweeted ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter,"" a mashup of a paraphrase and a quote from the civil rights leader.

Monday, LeBron James' life began to end as he rambled his way through an embarrassing, cowardly, tone-deaf answer about the NBA's current conflict with China over a team executive's pro-Hong Kong tweet; an answer that exposed, in the most blatant way possible, that social justice is only important in the NBA when it doesn't cost anything.



James has been publicly silent over the past week regarding Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's tweet, which contained an image with the words, ""Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong."" The Chinese government has taken great offense to the tweet, jeopardizing the NBA's lucrative business relationship with the communist nation, as well as individual players' endorsement deals.

In James' comments about the controversy, he didn't talk about justice or human rights. He talked about how inconsiderate it was for Morey to support democracy in Hong Kong with a tweet that could have cost James and other players money.

""So many people could have been harmed,"" James said — speaking of Morey's tweet, not of the violence being inflicted on protesters by police in Hong Kong, or the heinous human rights violations that occur in mainland China. ""Not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say.""

Later, seemingly trying to justify his answer, James tweeted about how difficult this week has been for him and his colleagues. James and the Los Angeles Lakers, as well as the Brooklyn Nets, were on a preseason tour in China when the Morey controversy began. How could Morey not have waited a week to send his tweet, so as to not make LeBron James uncomfortable?

There are some players (Enes Kanter, for example) who walk the talk when it comes to speaking out for human rights and justice. But, by-and-large, the biggest casualty in the China/NBA spat is the NBA's credibility on social justice.

In 2018, CNN Business published a piece titled, ""The NBA is not afraid to lead on social justice.""

James is prominently highlighted in the article as a social justice leader. He has spoken out against police violence against minorities. He's worn T-shirts to support Black Lives Matter. He called President Donald Trump a ""bum.""

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, one of the few league figures whose cowardice on this issue has exceeded James', is quoted speaking of the ""sense of obligation, social responsibility, a desire to speak up directly about issues that are important"" that is ""part of being an NBA player.""

The NBA has been contrasted with the NFL: While the latter allegedly blackballs former quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem, NBA players are free and willing to ""fully participate as citizens.""

""I think in this day and age, you really have to stand for something,"" Silver said in the CNN article. Silver's great civil rights accomplishment is pulling the 2017 NBA All-Star Game from Charlotte because of the state's transgender bathroom law.

But when it comes to China, when it comes to speaking out against a communist nation that oppresses its people and opposes the values of freedom that we in America view as fundamental rights, the NBA stands for nothing but its own business interests.

The players and executives who make millions of dollars selling shoes and apparel and TV contracts in China, the same players and executives who have no problem insulting the U.S. president, won't dare speak a word that might offend the Chinese. The price is too high. Can't do anything that might slow down sales of the new LeBron James Nike shoe in China.

Expecting professional athletes to be role models and community leaders has always been naive. Being good at sports doesn't necessarily qualify a person for anything except playing sports.

Still, we live in a society that elevates these stars and pushes their words in our faces on a wide range of important issues. And more power to them, if they use their platforms for good. I'm not among those who believes players have to ""shut up and dribble.""

But the next time LeBron James, or anyone else associated with the NBA, tries to lecture the public about justice, remember what they did when faced with an issue that might cost them something. And remember a quote from Dr. King that you won't find on James' Twitter page:

""Freedom has always been an expensive thing. History is fit testimony to the fact that freedom is rarely gained without sacrifice and self-denial.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/i-am-thankful-for-this-year-for-christs-unimpeachable-victory-over-sin-and-death,2019-10-15
"Levin: On Jan. 6, we learn whether our Constitution will hold","January 6 is the day we learn whether our Constitution will hold and whether congressional Republicans care.

The 2020 presidential election was, in several targeted battleground states, an unconstitutional electoral exercise. Even putting aside evidence of significant fraud, virtually none of which received a hearing by our courts, events leading up to and including the November national election constituted a radical and grave departure from the federal electoral system adopted by the framers of the Constitution and the state ratification conventions. Now, let's be clear: None of this matters to the Democrat Party, since it and its surrogates perpetrated these unconstitutional acts, as I shall soon explain. Nor does it matter to the media, which is utterly illiterate on the subject and unequivocally supports the supposed outcome in any event. But it should be of great moment and concern to the people of this country and especially to congressional Republicans in both Houses, for if the latter do not at least confront and challenge this lawlessness on January 6, when Congress meets to count the electors, it will be the GOP's undoing and, simultaneously, the undoing of our presidential electoral system. Ultimately, it will be the people of the United States who love our republic who will be the losers.

Win, lose, or draw, on January 6, the Republicans must not act as if ""the people have spoken"" and be cowered into passivity or worse, such as joining the Democrat Party and media hecklers, by insisting that they are part of a lawless party seeking to ""reverse the results of the election."" Too many Republicans have already buckled, including the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, Sen. John Thune, and Rep. Adam Kinzinger. No doubt others who are unreliable and cowardly when facing the organized mob will follow. But let us not be judged by those who have intentionally and strategically manipulated our politics and the law to undermine our constitutional order. It is they who must be condemned.

Specifically, Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the federal Constitution could not be more explicit. It states, in pertinent part: ""Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress ..."" This language was purposeful. During the Constitutional Convention, there were various proposals suggested for electing a president. Should the president be directly elected by the people? That proposal was rejected out of concern that such a purely democratic process could be hijacked by a temporary majority. Should the president be chosen in the first instance from within the national legislature? That proposal was also rejected on grounds of separation of powers. Should the judiciary play a role in the selection of the president? That idea was dispensed with as being the most objectionable, as judges were to be the least political of all public officials. The framers deliberatively and with much thought created the Electoral College process, in which the people and their elected legislatures — both state and national — would play important roles. But the electoral process rested first and foremost on the state legislatures directing how the electors would be chosen. The reason: While rejecting the direct election of a president, the framers concluded that the state legislatures were closest to the people in their respective states and would be the best representatives of their interests. At no time did the framers even raise the possibility that governors, attorneys general, secretaries of state, election boards, administrators, etc., would play any significant role in the electoral process. Indeed, certain of those offices did not even exist. Moreover, as I said, the courts were rejected out of hand. Thus, such an important power was to be exercised exclusively by the state legislatures.

After the 2016 election, the Democrat Party, its various surrogate groups, and eventually the Biden campaign unleashed hundreds of lawsuits and an unrelenting lobbying campaign in key states that had previously been won by President Trump, taking unconstitutional measures intended to stop President Trump from winning these states in the 2020 election, thereby literally undoing this critical constitutional provision. What had been carefully crafted at the Constitutional Convention and clearly spelled out in the Constitution was the main obstacle to defeating President Trump and winning virtually all future presidential elections. The problem for the Democrats was that in several of these battleground states, the Republicans controlled the legislatures, while the Democrats controlled state executive offices. The Constitution was not on their side. Therefore, they used the two branches of government that were to have no role in directing the appointment of electors to eviscerate the role of the Republican legislatures.

In Pennsylvania, considered the battleground of the battleground states, the Democrat governor, attorney general, and secretary of state made and enforced multiple changes to the state's voting procedures, all of which were intended to assist the Democrats and Biden. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, whose seven justices are elected, has a 5-2 Democrat majority. (In 2018, there was a big push by the Democrat Party to fill three of the seats with Democrats, and it succeeded.) Just months before the general election, that court rewrote the state election laws to eliminate signature requirements or signature matching, eliminate postal markings that were intended to ensure votes were timely, and extended the counting of mail-in ballots to Friday at 5:00 p.m. (state law had a hard date and time — election day on Tuesday, which ended at 8:00 p.m. ET), thereby fundamentally altering Pennsylvania's election laws and nullifying the federal constitutional role of the Republican legislature.

In Michigan, among other things, the Democrat secretary of state unilaterally changed the state's election laws with respect to absentee ballot applications and signature verification. Indeed, she sent unsolicited absentee ballot applications by mail prior to the primary and general elections. State law required would-be voters to request such ballots. She intentionally circumvented the Republican state legislature and violated the federal Constitution by issuing over 7 million unsolicited ballots. Furthermore, a court of claims judge, appointed by a Democrat, ordered clerks to accept ballots postmarked by Nov. 2 and received within 14 days of the election, the deadline for results to be certified. The ballots would be counted as provisional ballots. The state legislature had no role in these changes.

In Wisconsin, the Elections Commission and local Democrat officials in the state's largest cities, including Milwaukee and Madison, changed the state's election laws. Among other things, they placed hundreds of unmanned drop boxes in strategic locations in direct violation of state law. Not surprisingly, the locations were intended to be most convenient to Democrat voters. In addition, they told would-be voters how to avoid security measures like signature verification and photo ID requirements. These bureaucrats and local officials bypassed the Republican legislature in altering state election procedures.

In Georgia, the secretary of state is a Republican. Regardless, as explained in the Texas lawsuit brought against Georgia and the three other states mentioned above, ""on March 6, 2020, in Democratic Party of Georgia v. Raffensperger, Georgia's Secretary of State entered a Compromise Settlement Agreement and Release with the Democratic Party of Georgia to materially change the statutory requirements for reviewing signatures on absentee ballot envelopes to confirm the voter's identity by making it far more difficult to challenge defective signatures beyond the 22 express mandatory procedures set forth at GA. CODE § 21-2-386(a)(1)(B). 71. Among other things, before a ballot could be rejected, the Settlement required a registrar who found a defective signature to now seek a review by two other registrars, and only if a majority of the registrars agreed that the signature was defective could the ballot be rejected but not before all three registrars' names were written on the ballot envelope along with the reason for the rejection. These cumbersome procedures are in direct conflict with Georgia's statutory requirements, as is the Settlement's requirement that notice be provided by telephone (i.e., not in writing) if a telephone number is available. Finally, the Settlement purports to require State election officials to consider issuing guidance and training materials drafted by an expert retained by the Democratic Party of Georgia."" Georgia's Republican legislature had no role in these electoral changes resulting from consent decree.

Consequently, in each of these four battleground states — and there were others — whether through executive fiats or litigation, key, if not core, aspects of state election laws were fundamentally altered in contravention of the explicit power granted to the state legislatures and, therefore, in violation of the federal Constitution and the process set forth for directing the selection of electors. And this is before we even get to the issue of voter fraud. That said, in many instances, ballots that would have been rejected or, if counted, evidence of fraud, were now said to be legal — not by state legislatures but by those who unilaterally changed the election laws.

The United States Supreme Court had an opportunity before the election, and in this general election cycle, to make clear to the states that they must comply with the plain language of Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution. Indeed, when a federal district judge in Michigan altered that state's election laws, a closely divided U.S. Supreme Court overturned his order. Justice Gorsuch pointed out that the state legislature writes election laws. However, when a case was brought to the Court involving the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's interference in state election laws, the U.S. Supreme Court was paralyzed. Chief Justice Roberts attempted to distinguish between federal and state courts, which is irrelevant; in another instance, Justice Alito ordered the Pennsylvania secretary of state, not once but twice, to segregate certain mail-in ballots, but nothing came of it. A court divided against itself cannot stand, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln. Its failure to enforce the Constitution (and by that I don't mean make law or intervene in legitimate state election decisions) has contributed mightily to our current plight.

Despite what has been reported and repeated, the president is not actually or officially chosen on Election Day. The president is not chosen upon the certification of electors by the states. The process ends in Congress. And on Jan. 6, Congress — following both the Constitution and its own procedural law — makes the final decision on who is to be president and vice president of the United States. Of course, in every election in my lifetime, up to now, while there have been some controversies, the process has proceeded without much attention. But this time is different, as it must be. The Democrat Party, its surrogates, and eventually the Biden campaign instituted an unprecedented legal and lobbying campaign, mostly under the radar, as it was not well covered by the usual media outlets, to undermine our Constitution, the Republican state legislatures, and the Trump re-election campaign, in favor of Biden. In other words, the Constitution's electoral process for choosing electors and ultimately the president and vice president was systematically and strategically attacked. It is now left to Congress, or at least the Republicans in Congress, to confront this. The Democrat Party has done severe damage to the nation's electoral system, to the point where the state legislatures are now in the position of having the least input on the manner in which elections are held and federal electors are chosen — the complete opposite of what the Constitution compels and the framers unequivocally intended. And the legislatures in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia have, in a variety of ways, objected to what's occurred, underscoring the seriousness of the problem.

If this outcome is allowed to stand without a fight on Jan. 6, it is difficult to see how this can be fixed. The Democrats will view this as a sure sign that they are free to do more and even worse. It will become extremely difficult for Republicans to win nationwide elections (something the ten or so GOP senators who wish to run for president should keep in mind). It will also become increasingly difficult to win a Republican majority in the Senate. And the 2020 constitutional violations will be used as a baseline for even more unconstitutional manipulations of the electoral system. The Democrat Party's goal is to turn the nation's electoral system into the one-party rule that exists in virtually all blue states, especially California with its supermajorities.

As I said earlier, win, lose, or draw, the congressional Republicans must act. It is the Democrats and their media who seek to undo election results by undoing the election system. Look at what they did in 2016 (need I remind everyone of the relentless assault against candidate and then President Trump?) and now 2020. And they have every intention, as they have boldly proclaimed, to further undermine our constitutional system should they win the Senate majority in a few days — by eliminating the filibuster and any ability to slow their radical legislative agenda; packing the Supreme Court with left-wing ideologues; and packing the Senate with four more Democrats from Puerto Rico and D.C. And that's just for starters. This is the same party that did not care that it had no hope of removing President Trump in the Senate, but impeached him anyway — on the most specious of grounds. They are playing for keeps and destroying our constitutional system, for which they have little regard. I am well aware that it takes a majority of both Houses to send the election of the president to the House of Representatives, where each delegation gets one vote, an extremely difficult hurdle.

Nonetheless, it is not asking too much for the Republicans to uphold the United States Constitution — which they all took an oath to do — and to fight to preserve and protect the plain words set forth in Article II. They must make the case to and on behalf of the American people. And they must make it clear to the Democrats that we, the people, who believe in this Republic, will not roll over! Now, let's see how many statesmen there are among Republican members of Congress.

"Progressives poll Latino voters on 'dog-whistle' GOP talking points, shocked to find approval for 'Trump-style rhetoric'","Former Vice President and Democratic nominee Joe Biden is struggling to reach Latino voters. That statement is not pro-Trump wish-casting about the 2020 election, it's mainstream analysis reported by CNN, the Financial Times, The Atlantic, and even The Daily Beast, hardly Trump-friendly publications.

When it comes to the question of ""why"" Biden is underperforming with Hispanics, two progressive researchers sought to find out and in an op-ed published Friday they characterized the results of their research as ""sobering.""

As it turns out, so-called ""dog-whistle"" messaging based on Republican campaign talking points on immigration as well as other issues resonated with Latino and other minority voters. In fact, Latino voters found such messaging more convincing than even white and black voters. The standard-packaged Democratic talking points condemning President Donald Trump as a bigot and criticizing structural racism were less-effective with these voters.



Writing in the New York Times, researchers Ian Haney López, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and Tory Gavito, founder of the left-wing Texas Future Project, cite recent polling from Quinnipiac and Monmouth that found 38% of registered Hispanic voters in 10 battleground states may be ""ambivalent about even voting,"" arguing that Latinos will be ""a key component of the swing voters in this election.""

Knowing the Latino vote will be crucial for Biden to beat Trump, López and Gavito commissioned liberal pollsters to conduct 15 focus groups with Hispanics, whites, and African Americans from across America. You can find their research here.

They began by asking these focus groups whether a ""dog-whistle message lifted from Republican talking points"" was convincing. The study refers to this message as the ""opposition message"" and part of it condemns ""illegal immigration from places overrun with drugs and criminal gangs"" and calls for ""fully funding the police so our communities are not threatened by people who refuse to follow our laws.""

In full, the ""opposition message"" reads:

Our leaders must prioritize keeping us safe and ensuring that hardworking Americans have the freedom to prosper. Leaders who built a strong economy once can do it again after COVID-19.



Taking a second look at China, or illegal immigration from places overrun with drugs and criminal gangs, is just common sense. And so is fully funding the police, so our communities are not threatened by people who refuse to follow our laws.



We need to make sure we can take care of our own people first, especially the people who politicians have cast aside for too long to cater to whatever special interest groups yell the loudest or riot in the street.

According to López and Gavito, three out of five whites polled found this message convincing. And so did three out of five black voters, and even more Latino voters.

""These numbers do not translate directly into support for the Republican Party,"" the researchers explain. ""Nevertheless, the results tell us something important: a majority across the groups we surveyed did not repudiate Trump-style rhetoric as obviously racist and divisive, but instead agreed with it.""

Translation: Majorities of white, black, and Latino voters responded positively to a pro-market, pro-sovereignty, pro-law and order message about caring for Americans forgotten by politicians and special interest groups and antagonized by rioters. That is, essentially, Trump's re-election message.



Now, for full context, the study characterized this message as code for ""business leaders should run the country,"" people of color are ""dangerous and undeserving,"" and hating ""liberal government"" because ""it coddles criminals and welfare recipients — and thus betrays whites by favoring people of color."" This is what they mean by ""dog-whistle,"" that when supposedly racist and bigoted Trump supporters hear things like ""Taking a second look at China,"" and ""fully funding the police,"" they know that what Republicans are really talking about is using government to protect whites by oppressing minorities.

Naturally, these progressives are distressed that such a supposedly evil message resonates with the voters they need to win the election. And this is where the analysis from López and Gavito becomes fascinating, as they try to understand why this message works with Latinos.

""Hispanics, of course, are no more monolithic than any other group, and internal differences influenced how individuals reacted,"" they write. ""The single biggest factor was how respondents thought about Hispanic racial identity. More than whether the individual was Mexican-American or from Cuba, young or old, male or female, from Texas, Florida or California, how the person perceived the racial identity of Latinos as a group shaped his or her receptivity to a message stoking racial division.""

They continue (bolded for emphasis):

Progressives commonly categorize Latinos as people of color, no doubt partly because

progressive Latinos see the group that way and encourage others to do so as well. Certainly, we both once took that perspective for granted. Yet in our survey, only one in four Hispanics saw the group as people of color.



In contrast, the majority rejected this designation. They preferred to see Hispanics as a group integrating into the American mainstream, one not overly bound by racial constraints but instead able to get ahead through hard work.



The minority of Latinos who saw the group as people of color were more liberal in their views regarding government and the economy, and strongly preferred Democratic messages to the dog-whistle message. For the majority of Latinos, however, the standard Democratic frames tied or lost to the racial fear message. In other words, Mr. Trump's competitiveness among Latinos is real.

In other words, most Hispanic voters do not see themselves as part of an oppressed racial class. They have a Hispanic heritage and are proud of it, but they want to be Americans too. They want to assimilate, and they believe that with hard work they can achieve the American dream.

""Even more than whites and Blacks, Hispanics emphasize the importance of hard work and favor government creating opportunities for advancement,"" the study says.

Most Latinos do not believe there is systematic racism in American institutions standing as an obstacle to their success. And that's why they're receptive to ""Trump-style rhetoric.""

This is a problem for Joe Biden, and López and Gavito offer a simple solution: Change the message.

""The key is to link racism and class conflict,"" they say. And also to stop blaming white people as a group for everything wrong in America.

""Democrats should call for Americans to unite against the strategic racism of powerful elites who stoke division and then run the country for their own benefit. This is not to deny the reality of pervasive societal racism. But it does direct attention away from whites in general and toward the powerful elites who benefit from divide-and-conquer politics.""

This focus-tested ""race-class approach ... fuses issues of racial division and class inequality, and by doing so shifts the basic 'us versus them' story — the staple of most political messaging — away from 'whites versus people of color' to 'us all against the powerful elites pushing division.'""

That message looks like this:

We had come so far, but now Covid-19 threatens our families — for instance with health

risks, record unemployment and losing the businesses we worked hard to build. To

overcome these challenges, we need to pull together no matter our race or ethnicity. But

instead of uniting us, certain politicians make divisions worse, insulting and blaming

different groups. When they divide us, they can more easily rig our government and the

economy for their wealthy campaign donors. When we come together by rejecting racism

against anyone, we can elect new leaders who support proven solutions that help all

working families.

The focus groups polled reacted much more strongly in favor of this message than the ""opposition message"" or traditional Democratic Party talking points accusing Republicans of ""xenophobia, racism, and division"" or taking a ""color-blind"" approach. Messages similarly framed on immigration and criminal justice reform issues also found more support.

López and Gavito advise Biden and Democratic Party strategists to view Hispanics ""not as a monolith but as America in microcosm."" The study they put forward urges Democrats to make cross-racial appeals to voters, uniting Latinos, whites, and blacks in solidarity by framing their issues as a struggle against unresponsive elites ignoring their needs and pushing division.

Ironically, this closely resembles the populist messaging President Trump used in the 2016 election to win the White House. Trump ran a ""drain the swamp"" campaign focused on criticizing establishment politicians. As he promised in his victory speech, ""the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.""

Despite what progressives claim, the ""forgotten"" American does not have one race or creed. Trump's message attempted to appeal to all Americans who felt disenfranchised by politicians who did not keep their promises and a government that over decades grew too large to be in touch with their needs.

The Trump campaign and Republicans have just as much to learn from this study as the left. The lesson is Latino Americans, like all Americans, do not want to be divided. They still believe the elites are out of touch. They want to feel like someone is fighting for their interests, not special interests.

The challenge for President Trump as an incumbent is to argue he hasn't forgotten the Americans who put him in power and to show how he has unified the country. The challenge for Biden is to credibly craft a unifying message while the assorted victim-classes in his base compete against each other to be the most oppressed and publicly declare their contempt for America.

MacIntyre: Cultural neutrality is a dangerous lie — and it never existed,"One of the more encouraging phenomena over the last few years has been the growing awareness around the radical progressive indoctrination of children and young people in the United States. In some ways it was impossible to avoid, as woke propaganda became the default message of every movie, television show, book, and video game. When every corporation and sports team is wrapping its logo in a rainbow flag, the message is not exactly subtle.

Individuals like Chris Rufo or Chaya Raichik, owner of the Libs of Tik Tok Twitter account, have also done the Lord’s work in exposing the obscene, vile, and hateful nature of the material that the left is exposing children to.

The call to end progressive indoctrination is both understandable and justifiable, but many of those who oppose wokeness have made the error of suggesting a return to the era of cultural neutrality and an unbiased public square. This mythical era never existed, and the delusion of cultural neutrality is a dangerous one that leaves a society defenseless against ideologies that seek to destroy it from within.

It has become common practice for LGBTQ advocates to point at church services or videos of children learning to responsibly handle firearms and allege that these activities are more akin to indoctrination than any drag queen performance. I wish that were true. We would be in much better shape if church services did a better job of instilling the doctrines of their faith in children, but there is some truth to the point. Things that seem obviously wholesome and healthy to conservatives are scary and threatening to progressive activists. The difference between moral visions is so radical that what seems only natural to one is completely abhorrent to another.

Conservatives are becoming more comfortable with pushing back against an ideology that is hostile to their values and to their children’s well-being, but they still fail to grasp how that ideology was allowed to take hold in the first place. When conservatives argue against woke cultural indoctrination, they generally appeal to the idea of value-neutral institutions that do their job without advancing any worldview, but this concept is itself a liberal fiction. When I say liberal, I do not mean progressive or woke; I mean classically liberal, a tradition of thought that many conservatives will actively identify with today.

Too many on the right have bought into the notion that many social institutions, like government and corporations, exist in a secular space where decisions are made independent of any moral or ideological framework. Small-government conservatives just want to be left alone, and they were convinced to abandon the representation of their own values in the public square by an argument of mutual disarmament. This notion is also very appealing to disaffected centrists — former progressives who find the current revolution too radical for their own tastes. The centrists still consider conservative values backward and dangerous, but they do seek a return to the liberalism of the 1990s, the sort that still made arguments about free speech. They would balk at reintroduction of Christianity into public life, but they are willing to make common cause with conservatives if they stick to the notion of institutional neutrality. The centrists do not want their kids learning gender theory in third grade, but they would be just as outraged if it were the Ten Commandments.

The ideological disarmament promised to conservatives never came, and they quickly found themselves the target of cultural persecution with no defense other than an appeal to the neutrality by which the left never intended to abide. Former NFL coach Tony Dungy and NHL player Ivan Provorov both became targets of the woke mob due to their Christian faith last week. Dungy attended the March For Life, and Provorov refused to wear the pride jersey mandated by the Philadelphia Flyers. Sports commentators attacked both men as intolerant bigots, and some went so far as to suggest that Provorov should be deported back to his native Russia for heresy against the new state religion. Many Christians quickly responded by asking for tolerance of their beliefs, the same tolerance that they had been commanded to extend to others, but the left is not as foolish.

A political movement that is willing to mutilate children in the name of gender ideology does not care about appeals to cultural neutrality. Progressives understand that their religion is incompatible with Christianity and always has been. Calls for mandatory toleration were always just points of entry into American institutions, never a shared principle to be extended to Christians or any other belief system that would compete with progressivism.

The evidence of this is very clear, as the left has now made it all but impossible for those who hold to orthodox Christian doctrine to interact with public institutions. Holding basic beliefs about the definition of marriage will get you fired from most corporate employment, chased out of a sports league, and disqualified from holding most government positions. For progressives, tolerance means their views reign supreme without question, and they feel no shame in destroying the lives of anyone willing to challenge their dominance.

Liberalism offered Americans a vision of neutral institutions that would allow for a society free of competing moral visions. All the conflict around essential questions about religion or ultimate meaning could be put aside as everyone operated on a minimum acceptable morality that would allow for different groups to work together in the marketplace. Neutral institutions would eschew ideology in favor of objective and expert management that would improve the lives of society as a whole.

This was always a lie. There is no such thing as a neutral institution. Governments, corporations, and media are constantly making decisions of value, and those decisions will be made based on a moral framework. The moral framework on which social institutions make decisions will be transmitted through everything they do. There is no way of avoiding this truth.

A religion that believes drag shows are good for children but church services are bad for them will not share institutions with Christians; it will expel them or it will be expelled. Liberalism cannot mediate this conflict of moral visions; someone wins and someone loses. There is no third option.



This does not mean that America must become some cartoonish liberal notion of a theocracy like ""The Handmaid’s Tale,"" but it does mean that conservatives need to assert a competing vision. Even if the right could strip wokeness out of every American institution, attempting to return to a value-neutral space simply invites the next predatory ideology to take hold. James Burnham called liberalism the ideology of Western suicide, because it made a society incapable of defending its own values and culture.

The question is not: Should your society transmit values through its institutions? The question is: What values will your society transmit through its institutions? A positive vision is the only thing that will protect American institutions from hostile ideology, and conservatives must provide one if they intend to retake their country.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/lebron-james-china-comments-put-the-nbas-social-justice-hypocrisy-on-full-display,2023-01-24
MacIntyre: Mitch McConnell and the iron law of oligarchy,"Last week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell proudly announced that sending billions of dollars to Ukraine was the “number one priority” for Republicans during a press conference in which he celebrated passing a massive $1.7 trillion spending package. The longtime GOP figurehead was one of the central players responsible for engineering the disastrous 2022 midterms after redirecting crucial campaign funds away from promising candidates like Blake Masters in Arizona because he was not content to parrot tired establishment talking points.

The Republican base has understood for a long time that McConnell is a disgrace, but despite Mitch's betrayal of GOP voters at every opportunity, he sits comfortably ensconced in his position of power. The Kentucky senator acts against the wishes and interests of conservatives on a regular basis without any fear of losing his seat or his leadership position. If popular sovereignty allows the people to hold leaders accountable, why is someone so reviled by his own base so confident in the safety of his power?



In his book ""Political Parties,"" Robert Michels explored the behavior of representative governments and why their voters seem to have such a difficult time holding them accountable. The political theorist begins by making some observations that might seem obvious but for some reason are quickly forgotten whenever the pundit class starts debating the motivations of political actors.

According to Michels, no organization is ever ruled by the entire body of that organization. Be it a church, a bowling league, a business, or a political party, an organized minority of members always takes control of the institution. Even when organizations are earnestly constructed on the principle of democratic input and accountability to the body of members, a central group always emerges of leaders who actually guide the actions of the organization.

The natural fact of leadership is not itself an indictment of democracy. The emergence of a leadership class is a universal feature of every human endeavor, and the Founding Fathers were not blind to this fact. They organized the republic around representative and not direct democracy, understanding that in a nation the size of the United States, it was impossible to run the government without set of leaders who, at least for a time, dedicate their attention to operating the state in the interests of the people.

If over time, however, as the franchise expands and the democratic influence over the republic increases, the interests of the leadership class become less, not more, aligned with the interests of the average voter, then the feasibility of popular sovereignty may be called into question. If the democratic process inevitably leads to the installation of a leadership class completely insulated from consequences of that process, is democracy even possible?

As Michels studied socialist worker parties in Europe, the major democratic force of his time, he noticed a consistent pattern emerging. Average laborers with a gift for oration were consistently elevated by their fellow working-class party members to speak and organize on behalf of the collective. These trade-union organizers often had humble backgrounds and genuine interests aligned with those who elevated them. As the organization becomes more complex and its management more demanding, these gifted individuals had to become specialists who devoted their time to the operation of the party and leave their previous lives as daily laborers.

This change in vocation was their first break from the interests of the workers, but would be far from the last. These professional representatives quickly discovered that they could not achieve the ends their constituents demanded with the meager power they had, so the acquisition of additional power became the new goal. The interest of gaining more power was often at odds with the immediate interest of their constituents, but it could be justified because in the long term, the purpose of acquiring power was ultimately to deliver on the promises leadership had made to party members. The more expertise and power the representatives acquired, the more indispensable they seemed to the ends of the party, even as their own interests diverged more radically from those of the people they theoretically served. According to Michels:

The democratic masses are thus compelled to submit to a restriction of their own wills when they are forced to give their leaders an authority which is in the long run destructive to the very principle of democracy. The leader’s principal source of power is found in his indispensability. One who is indispensable has in his power all the lords and masters of the earth. The history of the working-class parties continually furnishes instances in which the leader has been in flagrant contradiction with the fundamental principles of the movement, but in which the rank and file have not been able to make up their minds to draw the logical consequences of this conflict, because they feel that they cannot get along without the leader, and cannot dispense with the qualities he has acquired in virtue of the very position to which they have themselves elevated him, and because they do not see their way to find an adequate substitute. Numerous are the parliamentary orators and the trade-union leaders who are in opposition to the rank and file at once theoretically and practically, and who none the less continue to think and to act tranquilly on behalf of the rank and file.

While it may feel odd for conservatives to relate to a European workers' party in the early 1900s, the description of how a leadership class separates from the interests of its voters should sound strikingly familiar. The situation for the Republican base is even more dire, as most of the base would be willing to replace McConnell, but the skill, power, and connections that he has acquired have made him all but invulnerable to the democratic process.

Instead of making himself indispensable to the GOP base, he has made himself indispensable to his fellow Republican politicians and, more importantly, to the donor class that funds them. Mitch McConnell has insulated himself by prioritizing the needs of the oligarchical class that actually drives the agenda of the GOP over the needs of the voters that legitimate the Republicans through popular sovereignty.

This phenomenon is not unique to Mitch McConnell, the GOP, or American politics but rather an inescapable fact of the human condition. That is why Michels sums up this natural tendancy of social organization as ""The Iron Law of Oligarchy."" Democratic systems, just like all human governments, will ultimately be led by an elite class capable of more complex organization.



The social scientist did not see this as reason to abandon the effort to reduce, as much as possible, the autocratic tendencies of human organization. It is instead a warning about a critical aspect of all societies. Every nation will be run by a set of elites, and forgetting this truth allows the ruling class members to hide the truth of both their power and their motivations. An elite will always emerge to lead in every civilization; the important questions are, ""Do their interests align with the good of those they watch over, and can they be held accountable if the answer is no?""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/levin-on-january-6-we-learn-whether-our-constitution-will-hold,2022-12-29
"MacIntyre: Rachel Dolezal, Kay LeClaire, and the woke spoils system that rewards fraudsters","A white Wisconsin woman named Kay LeClaire was recently exposed as a fraud after portraying herself as a “two-spirit” Native American. After acquiring a tan and dyeing her hair, LeClaire founded a queer indigenous art collective and allegedly purchased American Indian crafts from the website Etsy to resell as her own to unsuspecting customers. In addition, the Madison resident received an artist stipend, made money delivering speeches, and was granted a paid residency by the University of Wisconsin based on the manufactured identity.

LeClaire joins a growing number of figures, like Rachel Dolezal, Shaun King, and Elizabeth Warren who have been publicly exposed for either greatly exaggerating aspects of their racial heritage or manufacturing them out of whole cloth. In America the education system, media, and federal government routinely assure the public that the threat of “white supremacy” is on the rise, but a shocking number of people seem to be willing to go to any lengths to be identified as a racial or sexual minority.



It would be easy to dismiss people like Dolezal and LeClaire as amoral sociopaths or grifters, but they are simply individuals responding to incentives, and increasingly they are not alone. Despite the insistence by mainstream media race hucksters and faux academics that the United States is built to systemically oppress minorities, those operating inside the country’s institutions understand that obtaining status as a protected minority is a critical advantage.

Astute observers like Dolezal and LeClaire understand that minority status allows an individual access to the vast patronage network the left has constructed to reward its supporters. College admission, scholarships, business start-up loans, mortgage assistance, and subsidized medical care are often tied directly to minority status. At least four California cities have joined San Francisco in its program providing a monthly cash payment to pregnant black women based on their race. San Francisco has also launched a similar program exclusively delivering cash payments to low-income individuals who identify as transgender. Simply put, qualifying for minority status pays both in opportunity and in cold hard cash.

The financial benefits for securing a position in the progressive hierarchy may be profitable, but material rewards are not the only driving factor. Much of America’s education system and entertainment industry have been turned into a never-ending fountain of revisionist history and racial animus designed to portray the country and those who founded it as uniquely villainous.

Be it the 1619 Project or critical race theory, the ideologies baked into public education are designed to cast “whiteness” as the nation’s original sin, one that many Americans are born into and can never truly absolve themselves from. College professors craft entire academic departments around the intellectualization of racial grievance, and best-selling authors make millions of dollars delivering speeches to corporate leadership seminars on how unconscious favoritism toward straight white Christian males can be purged from their organizations. The message is very clear: The people responsible for the creation of the United States were uniquely evil, and any connection to their identity or culture should be avoided at all costs.

The wokeness plays many roles in American life, but one of its functions is to mediate internecine conflicts among the progressive elite. The writer Malcom Kyeyune has correctly identified wokeness as the battlefield on which leftists meet to settle possible challenges of leadership. Every aristocracy needs a way to settle disputes over position in the hierarchy, and while the woke probably will not engage in formal duels anytime soon, they do wield cancellation as a very effective weapon.

In this battle, minority status is the ultimate currency, and if you find yourself a white straight Christian, especially if you are male, it becomes very important to acquire some form of woke identity. Faking one’s race is fraught with challenges and can have serious consequences if you are exposed, as both Dolezal and LeClaire could probably attest. Therefore, sexual and gender identities have become the favored strategy for white progressives who still want to climb the ladder.

Transitioning to another gender might allow you to climb to the highest ranks of government, like the assistant secretary for health, Admiral Levine, but that is also a very serious commitment. Hormone therapy and costly surgery cannot be in the cards for every aspiring male progressive. Many progressive climbers looking to escape the death sentence of straight male witness have opted for the non-binary identity. A little androgynous clothing and the occasional make-out session with a member of the same sex can immediately put you back in the game.

In fact, this low-effort hack of the woke hierarchy has created a squabble inside the progressive ecosystem, as people of color quickly recognized that their white counterparts were circumventing the usual stack with minimal effort and were once again allowed to climb without restriction. The question of whether non-binary should even really count as minority status continues to be debated in progressive spheres from academia all the way down to social media.



Despite the relentless propaganda pushed out by our ruling elites about “white supremacy,” which is, rather incoherently, foundational to the nation’s institutions but is now also somehow dangerously on the rise, most people seem desperate to code themselves as anything but a white straight male. In the fantastical leftist narrative, every institution in America is designed to benefit straight white males, but despite the structural advantages, people seem desperate to flee this identity.

The easily observable truth is that the left has created a woke spoils system in which individuals gain financial, moral, and social benefits by crafting a favored identity out of a constellation of preferred minority signifiers. Many, like Kay LeClaire, are willing to take large social risks and warp their personal and sexual identities around these incentives in order to reap the rewards.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/liberal-researchers,2023-01-06
The latest NBA-China fiasco unmasked the true agenda of America's 'woke' population — and it deserves to be mocked,"The goal of the woke is to hate whatever President Trump does because it's naturally the product of a bigoted and unbalanced mind, right?

Time to put that theory to the China test.

Because just last week we had Trump wishing that Communist paradise happy birthday via Twitter. A couple of months after he agreed to not engage the uprisings in Hong Kong against Chinese oppression.

So it stands to reason that woke propagandists would gladly charge into that genuinely buffoonish political opportunity to label the president as a friend of tyrants and celebrator of oppression. Yet they just couldn't bring themselves to do it.

In fact, they actually linked arms with Trump via their craven China fetish. There was Golden State Warriors basketball coach and woke counselor Steve Kerr this week, basically inviting himself to the White House and refusing to take a knee in the name of Hong Kong's freedom fighters. Yes, that Steve Kerr. The one who rarely misses an opportunity to remind you that he is better than you if you don't think exactly like him and stand willing to wallpaper North Carolina in mental illness and creepers.

Somehow, though, he is speechless now as the general manager of the Houston Rockets faces a backlash from China for publicly stating that the protesters in Hong Kong have the better part of the civic argument in that ongoing conflict over liberty. How could a man whose own father was murdered by political zealots so easily be bullied into rhetorical submission based on pushback from a nation with red in its ledger to the tune of millions dead and disappeared?

Especially when this puts him in the same company as Trump?

None of this makes any sense.

And when you've finally arrived at that realization, that's when you know you have a chance at fighting back against progressivism with a plan that actually works. You will understand that the Babylon Bee has it right, and that none of these fools need be reasoned with, only mocked and scorned for their hypocrisy and double-mindedness.

For none of this is really about Trump hatred specifically, or rigid adherence to a Utopian fixation with the future. Instead, it is always about hatred of the past and the current adherents of its most time-tested and honored traditions. This is iconoclasm in its purest form.

Those stained glass windows need to be broken, don't you know? Those walls need to come tumbling down. The church of old needs to be burned to ash because the past is for losers, and that impulse is so urgent in its adherents that it doesn't require identifying with any coherent or sustainable alternative for what can or will replace it. It only means automatically viewing you as lesser for daring to root yourself in truths formulated and fought for in the distant past.

That's the real bottom line. How else can a simple tweet of support from a basketball official almost no one has ever heard of before suddenly make Trump and Kerr bosom buddies on anything?

They hate you so much they will believe or unite with almost anything to deconstruct history. Yes, that's sad, but if you are paying close attention it is often hilarious as well.

So laugh at these fools, and laugh hard.

What Pelosi's Taiwan Visit Means for American Grand Strategy,"At just after 10:40 p.m. local time, on Tuesday night, US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi landed at Taipei’s Songshan Airport.

Pelosi’s touchdown marked the highest level American visit to the Island since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich traveled to Taiwan in 1997. Though many comparisons can certainly be made, much has changed surrounding the geopolitical circumstances in East Asia.

Gingrich’s visit came just over a year after the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, so to say the political environment at the time was tranquil would no doubt be an overstatement. However, when compared to current circumstances one would have to say the stakes of the Pelosi visit are markedly higher.

One notable reason for this is the increased strength of Beijing over the preceding 25 years. In 1997, China’s GDP was $961B, it’s now nearly $15T. Its military spending was $15.7B, today it’s more than $250B. In 1997, China possessed zero aircraft carriers, and today, it fields two combat-ready carriers with a third on the way.

Perhaps more telling of the changing landscape is Chinese rhetoric. In the late 1990s, China was still operating from former Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping’s famous dictum, “Hide one’s capabilities, and bide one’s time” (tao guang yang hui). Deng’s belief essentially advocated for China to hide in the background while it amassed power, and only when the level of power was sufficient should Beijing look to take a leadership role.

Well, under Xi Jinping that time has arrived, at least as far as the current leadership in Beijing is concerned. According to internal documents, China seeks regional and then global domination, and it sees the US as the biggest hurdle in its way. However, it doesn’t take access to classified documents to understand China’s intentions. Its leaders and diplomats are more than comfortable with being publicly aggressive and antagonistic towards the US.

And, on top of the rhetoric, China continues to try to expand its influence abroad via Xi’s keystone policy: the Belt and Road Initiative--which promises infrastructure and economic growth in developing economies, but more often results in high-interest debts that recipient countries can’t pay back. This means that China is able to take over projects and land in these countries, as it did in Sri Lanka when it was granted a 99-year lease on the Port of Hambantota after Colombo defaulted on its payments.

In short, America is dealing with a much stronger, more ambitious, and increasingly more aggressive China than it was in 1997.

Given the circumstances then, what does Pelosi’s visit signal regarding America’s overall strategy? Why would she choose now to go, and what will change now that her trip has concluded?

The skeptic would say that Pelosi’s trip was born out of her own political calculation. Her party is floundering, and her position as Speaker will almost certainly come to an end in November, so it wouldn’t be particularly out of the realm of likelihood that she saw a trip to Taiwan as a chance to lionize herself. In fact, these considerations are almost certainly at the forefront of Pelosi’s motivation.

This becomes even more likely when one considers that President Biden was initially not too fond of the idea. Given his atrocious approval rating, it definitely doesn’t hurt Pelosi to move against his wishes.

Anyway, answering this question would require getting inside Pelosi’s head, and that seems like it might be a confusing place to wind up. But the fact remains, she did make the trip, and regardless of her individual intent, it does signal to both our allies and enemies in the region.

Since the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, Washington has practiced strategic ambiguity. While it refuses to commit to Taiwan’s defense in the event of a Chinese invasion, it also has left that option in play. The goal, of course, is to deter Beijing while also discouraging Taipei from formally declaring independence, which would almost certainly trigger immediate retaliation from China and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

While Biden’s national security spokesman John Kirby insisted that Pelosi’s trip was actually upholding the status quo, you’d be hard pressed to find anyone in Zhongnanhai that agrees. And the evidence in this case, as exemplified by the trip itself, leans in the direction of Beijing’s interpretation.

Pelosi’s trip included meetings with the foreign ministry, leaders in the semiconductor industry, and a press conference with Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen.

The joint press conference was filled with political speak regarding economic exchange and budding relationships, very par-for-the-course type of stuff. But in her opening remarks, Pelosi did, perhaps subconsciously, point out the contradiction in America’s Taiwan policy.

""Let's just put it in perspective. Four decades ago, the Taiwan Relations Act was built–in building a strong bond between our two countries: advancing our shared interests of governance, economy, and security, while respecting the ""One China"" policy. Our solidarity with you is more important than ever, as you defend Taiwan and their freedom.”

Well, which is it? Does America support the ""One China"" policy or Taiwan’s right to self-determination? Because those positions are increasingly mutually exclusive.

When Pelosi notes that American solidarity with Taiwan is more important than ever, she’s absolutely correct. But substantively, what is America doing to address this need?

For all the reasons this article has addressed already, coupled with CCP’s long-held belief that China’s rejuvenation will only be complete after the absorption of Taiwan, it’s imperative that the US change its strategy vis-a-vis Taiwan and East Asia in general.

As Elbridge Colby points out in his newest book, America’s top foreign policy goal should be preventing another state from gaining regional hegemony, most chiefly China in Asia. This is due to a combination of China’s power in comparison to other potential regional threats like Russia, as well as Asia’s overall importance. For instance, when it comes to global GDP, Asia’s share trumps that of Europe’s, and the gap is only growing.

In short, Colby’s well-substantiated claim is that once China achieves hegemony in Asia, it will have the ability to drastically manipulate the American way of life and potentially seek to project its domain across other regions.

While China is busy in a multitude of theaters in its attempt to achieve hegemony, the most important and crucial prize in Beijing’s eyes is Taiwan. A Chinese takeover of Taiwan, while not sufficient, is absolutely necessary to achieve this goal. Therefore, it’s imperative that America prevent this from happening.

While Speaker Pelosi’s trip is undoubtedly symbolic, it does nothing to actually address the systemic problems that are developing in the region.

What is required of Washington to protect Taiwan and deny China’s bid for hegemony goes far beyond official visits and political posturing. It requires concrete change in the way America conducts foreign policy.

Understanding then, that Asia is the most important theater in the world, it would behoove decision makers in Washington to make choices that reflect this reality. However, instead of consolidating more resources in the Pacific, the US is increasing its commitments to Ukraine and Europe.

At a June NATO summit in Madrid, Biden committed to the Ukraine effort for “as long as it takes,” and on Tuesday, John Kirby announced the US would send an additional $550 million in military aid to Kyiv. This brings the figure to more than $8 billion in total aid since Russia launched its invasion. The US has also increased its troop deployment in Europe to 100,000, up from 80,000 pre-invasion.

As admirable as the Ukrainians are and as noble as it might be to want to support their cause indefinitely, the truth is that these moves are counterproductive. They pull resources and focus that should be concentrated in Asia.

By effectively concentrating military resources in Asia, the US will signal to China that it is committed to the region and denying Beijing’s ambitions. In the same breath, Washington should also change its Taiwan policy, and officially discard any adherence to the ""One China"" policy.

Strategic ambiguity served a purpose for much of the Cold War era, and it was even understandable in the 1990s when there was at least a hope that China would reform and Westernize. However, with the Soviet threat long gone and the theory of a liberal China thoroughly dispelled, the ""One China"" policy serves no purpose. It merely handicaps potential cooperation between Taipei and Washington.

A continuing insistence on refusing to commit to the Asian theater, and the perpetuation of word games to appease Beijing will only lead to confusion and uncertainty in the Taiwan Strait and all of East Asia. This confusion will not reduce, but significantly increase the likelihood of conflict with an increasingly emboldened China.

America should take a note from China and develop a grand strategy focused on broad horizons, not merely political considerations of the day. The first step in doing so is realizing that Asia, and not Europe, will dominate the 21st century and China is the main threat to the order America has sacrificed so much to build.

By accepting this premise, one can’t reasonably argue defending Taiwan isn’t of paramount concern to the American people.

While Pelosi’s trip in itself doesn’t solve or even address these issues in a meaningful way, it does provide the opportunity for the US to seriously consider what its relationship with Taiwan should be and what its overall strategy should look like.

China has certainly taken note of the visit and responded in bombastic fashion.

Shortly after Pelosi departed Taipei en route to Seoul, China’s Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, tweeted, “The US is the provocateur, and China is the victim. The US side colluded with Taiwan and made provocations first, whereas China has been compelled to act in self-defense.”

And, the spokesman for the State Council’s Taiwan Affairs Office, Ma Xiaoguang, exclaimed that Tsai and her ruling party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) were “pushing the island into the abyss of disaster.”

The Chinese response hasn’t just been talk, either. According to the South China Morning Post, China announced starting Thursday it would begin live-fire drills in seven locations surrounding Taiwan’s coastline, effectively blockading the island.

Pelosi’s visit provides much-needed momentum and reflection for policymakers in Washington, and it mustn’t be squandered. There are only so many more opportunities for America to come to terms with its geopolitical reality. China already has, and the clock is ticking.

Proponents of the #MeToo movement can't have it both ways,"When a 2017 report surfaced about a statement Vice President Mike Pence made about choosing not to dine alone with women who aren't his wife, Karen, the progressive left scorned him for it.

The Left said this rule Pence abides by creates a disadvantage for women, especially in politics, and they were baffled by it.

The Left accused him of assigning ""ulterior motives to women,"" who they said just wanted to be heard.

The Left then conjured hypothetical scenarios in op-eds in which the roles were reversed, and women were the ones in positions of power refusing to dine with men who aren't their husbands – all to lambast his ""moral rigidity.""

But is Pence's decision to not dine with a woman who isn't his wife really that bad, considering all the complexities men and women face in their interpersonal affairs today, and not just regarding work but dating in general?

Since the #MeToo movement swept the conversation about sexual harassment policies for employers and gender-based discrimination, there's been a certain aspect of the conversation that's been largely overlooked that's worthy of an immediate behavioral overhaul if the group wants to stay true to its fundamental mission which is to protect, end, and support survivors of sexual violence.

Lately, members of the movement who overzealously attacked men on the grounds of #MeToo, have embraced the hypersexualization of preteens and young adults in other spaces.

Take Cosmopolitan magazine and Teen Vogue, for example. Both publications market sex-infused articles to young women and LGBTQ teens that instantaneously draw the ire of conservatives and apolitical Americans who find the content detrimental to teens.

And just last month, Teen Vogue made headlines – again — for instructing young girls on how to obtain an abortion without the knowledge or consent of their parents.

A year prior to that, Teen Vogue ran a ""how-to"" article titled, ""A Guide to Anal Sex,"" which graphically detailed ""anal 101, for teens.""

When the initial article was published, it was absent of any disclaimer that encouraged young people to use protection and received heavy backlash.

Teen Vogue eventually made the decision to add an editor's note about the importance of using protection during anal sex but by then it was too late.

The fallout was swift, and the culture wars endured between conservatives who viewed the story as out of line and the progressives on the left who ran it.

Another headline in Cosmopolitan magazine chronicled a writer's summer of casual sex in her early 20s where she justified cheating on every boyfriend she had had, without regrets.

She also suggested to women in their early 20s who've cheated on their boyfriends to not regret it because it's how they learn about their sexuality.

And as I write this, another article by Teen Vogue was just published advising teens on how to make their orgasms ""magical.""

Another blind spot for those who share the ideological space with the LGBTQ community, the Women's March, and the #MeToo movement is the proliferation of child drag queens.

The groups have had nearly zero mental reservations about how the sexualization of these young boys directly conflicts with their overall goals.

Last week, the mother of preteen drag queen ""Desmond Is Amazing"" spoke out about a convicted pedophile who wrote a blog post about her 11-year-old son who's been prominent in the drag scene.

In the post, the pedophile described Desmond as ""hot"" and added that he [Desmond] ""feels sexy performing.""

Embracing this type of attitude when it comes to drag queens and teen sex presents a consequential challenge for the #MeToo movement as it tries to shake off its loudest critics who view it as harmful to traditional gender roles and the nuclear family.

The Right has been unrelenting in its criticism of the movement. Some of the loudest opponents have accused #MeToo of promoting behaviors that are emasculating for men to the point where even showing the slightest bit of interest in a woman could easily be misconstrued as sexual misconduct.

It has also had unintended consequences that are hurtful for women. According to a Human Resources study, men who are in a position to hire are avoiding hiring women altogether for the sake of avoiding the culture of ""guilty until proven innocent.""

We saw this with Aziz Ansari when a woman accused the comedian of sexual assault after a bad night of sex and the Sacred Heart University football players who were falsely accused of rape by a woman who wanted to get the attention of a love interest.

Let's also not forget when gay icon and anti-Trump, Women's March champion Madonna pulled down a 17-year-old girl's shirt at her concert and exposed her breasts.

And who can forget what took place between Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which divided the nation for months?

The Women's March and the #MeToo movement are ideologically monolithic and inflexible in their beliefs, often viewing conservative ideas as the antithesis of the movement's collective goals.

The groups took on, almost instantaneously, a progressive stance that automatically signed women up for pro-abortion views and far left Democratic platforms instead of adhering to the original intent, which was to put an end to the sexual abuse of women – and not just the abuse of liberal women but conservative women too.

But they can't have it both ways.



This isn't to say that topics about human sexuality should be avoided altogether.

But if the movement wants its message to transcend ideological lines and to be effective in eliminating abusive sex, it's going to have to have an honest conversation about the sexual proclivities it celebrates, encourages, and promotes among preteens and teens.

For these reasons, the movement cannot simultaneously call for society to be sensitive to sexual harassment and abuse while it perpetuates a culture that breeds these abuses.

You say, ""believe all women"" and march so your daughters will never have a #MeToo story of their own but what you continue to endorse diminishes your efforts.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/macintyre-rachel-dolezal-kay-leclaire-and-the-woke-spoils-system-that-rewards-fraudsters,2019-07-10
"Horowitz: JPMorgan Chase bows to environmental activists, will stop financing Arctic drilling and divest from coal","JPMorgan Chase has decided that it's better for the company to join the progressive environmental gods than to continue supporting the great American energy miracle that has brought so much prosperity, stability, and job creation to this country. Has the Left finally won the war for the heart and soul of corporate America?

During the company's annual investor day on Tuesday, the giant bank announced it would no longer be financing loans for oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and would divest from financing coal plants or mines. It also announced it would be divesting from any company that gets the majority of its revenue from coal by 2024.

When the Left can't win at the ballot box or in a democratic debate in legislatures, it seeks recourse through the courts, or even better, the culture and markets. In this case, groups like Rainforest Action Network bullied the bank into submission, publishing a report showing JPMorgan Chase to be the single biggest lender to the oil and gas industry.

At Tuesday's announcement, JPMorgan committed to investing in $200 billion worth of projects in support of the United Nations' sustainable development goals. That is the company's credential in the elite world that will make its profits kosher – sort of an extortion that the progressives make companies pay as the cost of doing business in a political system they control.

However, it is never enough for the leftist anarchists, who are now demanding the bank also pull out of financing drilling in the lower 48 states as well.

It's truly hard to overstate the economic miracle that oil and gas drilling has ushered into our job market. We have now become the global superpower of oil and gas production and exports, to the point that even the conflict with Iran in January did not cause a spike in energy prices at all.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), American crude oil production has hit an all-time record of 13 million barrels per day (bpd). That is an astounding 46 percent increase in production since Trump took office in January 2017. Poor states like New Mexico have benefited enormously with more state revenue and jobs, as oil production has increased 250 percent since 2012.

The more we drill for oil and gas, the more we recover. Far from running out of resources, proven reserves of crude oil have increased by 12 percent since 2017 and have more than doubled over the past 13 years. Likewise, proven reserves of natural gas increased to 9 percent since 2017 and more than doubled since 2005 to 504.5 trillion cubic feet.

Yet the flat-earth progressives are trying to reverse all that progress, which will result in regressive price increases and job losses for the most vulnerable citizens.

The revelation from JPMorgan comes as BP announces it is withdrawing its membership in the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, the Western Energy Alliance, and the Western States Petroleum Association due to concerns about the environmental stances of those trade groups. ""Our priority is to work to influence within trade associations, but we may publicly dissent or resign our membership if there is material misalignment on high-priority issues,"" said BP chief executive Bernard Looney in a February 12 announcement.

The cancel culture and boycott campaigns of the Left, coupled with a very weak Republican Party, have ensured that the cultural inertia is moving in one direction. Whereas the Left always controlled academia, media, and entertainment, its recent conquest of the corporate world is the key to actually moving the needle of anarchist socialist policies. We are seeing this with corporations boycotting ICE as well.

However, the growth in extremism among those on the Left provides conservatives with an opportunity to finally make these companies pick sides.

Until now, Republicans have allowed corporations to promote fiscal and cultural Marxism on the cheap by saving them from high taxes and a few targeted regulatory issues that they care about. Meanwhile, as we bail out the companies, corporate America has become the number-one enforcer – even more effective than the media and academia – of promoting open borders, endless Middle East migration, weak-on-crime laws, anti-religious-liberty policies, mindless multiculturalism, eco-socialism, and the transgender agenda. Even on fiscal issues, they support the welfare state, Obamacare, and all the regulations that help them shut out competition.

The one missing issue from the Democrats' portfolio of corporate bosses is the tax issue. If the corporations empowered Democrats on that issue too, they couldn't survive. Thus they keep the Republican lifeline against Democrats raising taxes and still promote the rest of the progressive agenda. And remember, government-run health care is the single biggest driver of our debt, and that is being fueled by big business.

These businesses also count on traditional establishment Democrats to ease off them when it counts, even as they talk tough to jazz up their activists. Well, now Bernie Sanders is changing all of that. He will actually put them out of business. So now it's time for conservatives to make them pick sides. They either jump off the bandwagon of progressivism, or we will step back and allow the Bernie Democrats to hurt them at their bottom line. They must remember we're all in the same sinking ship that they helped destroy.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/nba-china-fiasco-unmasked-agenda-of-woke-population,2020-02-26
Roth: Values-oriented investing for people who hate 'The Great Reset',"As the World Economic Forum’s ""The Great Reset"" playbook touts the very scary predication of “you will own nothing and be happy,” the best way to combat that is through doing the exact opposite: ownership via investment. However, with so many financial institutions moving from financial metrics to including social and other metrics (like ESG), how can you invest based on your values?

One recent query we received noted, “As a new investor, I don't want to send my money to the people wrecking my future, but I also don't want to not invest at all.” With that in mind, here are some steps to take to align your investing with your values.

Note and disclaimer: This is not meant as financial advice, just as a starting point for your research, and all financial decisions should be made carefully based on your goals, objectives, and risk profile.

Hire a like-minded financial adviser: During times of uncertainty is where financial advisers really earn their keep. A certified adviser who is a fiduciary will keep in mind your needs as a customer. Seek out an adviser who shares your values and understands the types of companies you do and don’t want to support.

Also, consider researching advisers who are independent and see if their firms have mission statements or initiatives that support or conflict with your values to find the best fit.

KISS: There’s a phrase in business and investing called the KISS principle: “Keep it simple, stupid.” The reality is that even the pros who invest day in and day out have a hard time beating the stock market benchmarks over long periods of time.

This means, for the equity (and debt) portions of your portfolio, using low-cost index funds that provide exposure to many companies and even those that mimic market benchmarks is often a good strategy for parts of your portfolio. Your adviser can help you decide which ones are the best for you and perhaps exclude any that may overexpose you to the types of companies you don’t want to be invested in.

Diversify your portfolio: In addition to the diversification an index or mutual fund can give you, you should have a portfolio that is diversified in terms of asset classes more broadly. One thing to consider is exposure to certain commodities. For example, whether gold or silver or another commodity, these commodities don’t have a point of view and aren’t susceptible to social-engineering attempts like “sustainable investing”!

Timing the market isn't your friend: When things are uncertain, it is tempting to get nervous and pull your money out of investments, like those in the stock market. A certified financial adviser will keep you focused on your long-term plan and remind you that studies have shown just how hard it is to time the market. If you don’t get back in and miss just the 10 best market days of each decade, there is a massive swing in your overall portfolio performance. Staying invested in a diverse portfolio over long periods of time works to create value for most investors.

For any individual investments, evaluate the financials first: While you may want to invest in alignment with your values, that should never be a priority over the quality of the investment. To the extent you are going to invest in individual stocks and bonds, for example, evaluate the business model and financial health of the business first. Once you have screened for that, you can then look to see if the business has values aligned with yours.

Consider alternative investments, where appropriate: If you are a more seasoned investor and/or qualify as a sophisticated investor, you will have access to a range of alternative and private investments that make it easier for you to get to know the management teams and assess their values. Also, building your own business or investing in real estate can also give you both control and returns, but as with all other investments, make sure that your investment is commensurate with your appetite for and wherewithal to take on the financial risk.

Also, be wary of some of the latest Wall Street investment “gimmicks” or areas with a spotty track record, like SPACs or Chinese companies doing reverse mergers into public company shell corporations. Unless you have deep knowledge and conviction around these investments, they have proven quite risky. If you don’t understand something, you shouldn’t be investing in it.

Building your wealth is the best path to economic freedom. While there isn’t today an easy source to quickly find all the investments that may align with your values and fit your risk profile, the above steps can help set you in the right direction.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/pelosi-taiwan-means-for-america,2022-02-14
"Sorry Chrissy Teigen, 'f*** you' aren't the two words women should use more","""If there was one word you would help, particularly women, use more frequently, what would that one word be?""

""F*** you.""

This was model-turned activist Chrissy Teigen's answer to a question asked by former MSNBC host and moderator Melissa Harris-Perry during a three-day policy retreat for House Democrats in Washington last week.

Harris-Perry's question to Teigen was predicated on Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) suggestion that women should say the word ""no"" more often.

Teigen's husband, singer and songwriter John Legend, added to the praise his wife received from the crowd following her response, then bragged on stage about how his wife was the first celebrity to begin slighting the president as if it were something to be proud of.

""Chrissy was ahead of the curve on making fun of Donald Trump. She knew before a lot of people did that he was a joke and a conman and a clown,"" Legend said.

Teigien and Legend were at the forum to discuss a variety of topics including handling the social media trolling that comes with newfound fame and President Donald Trump's behavior on Twitter, which is ironic because Teigen disparages the president so regularly on Twitter that he actually blocked her last year.

Teigen later clarified on Twitter that even if women don't use the exact words she suggested — ""f*** you"" — women should adopt that attitude with ""your eyes"" and ""your vote.""

While many modern women take Teigen's suggestion as some sort of nod to women's empowerment, Teigen's suggestion does nothing to empower women.

Adopting that attitude and language does little to advance her cause because it only stifles any potentially meaningful conversations that could have otherwise taken place. She also turns off about half the country who hears it.

If language and attitudes like these actually benefited human relationships, there'd be no need to teach conflict resolution in schools, the workplace, or in the home.

The reality is that flippant anger will get women nowhere; in fact, it's counter-productive. Of all the words available for ""empowering women,"" progressives have for the most part chosen words that are steeped in anger, aggression, and hostility — and ""no"" and ""f*** you"" are just the latest examples.

For instance, at the first annual Women's March in Washington, D.C., following Donald Trump's election, Madonna admitted in a speech to several thousand women that not only was she angry at the the results of the election but also that she thought ""an awful lot about blowing up the White House.""

Her remarks quickly circulated the web, and a few days later, the Material Girl was forced to address her comments in an Instagram post where she claimed she wasn't a violent person and that her words were taken out of context.

""It's important people hear and understand my speech in its entirety rather than one phrase taken wildly out of context,"" she said. ""I shared two ways of looking at things — one was to be hopeful, and one was to feel anger and outrage, which I have personally felt. However, I know that acting out of anger doesn't solve anything. And the only way to change things for the better is to do it with love.""

Comedian Kathy Griffin went even further when she infamously posted a picture of herself holding up a mocked up version of the president's decapitated head, for which she quickly received blowback.

Even though she apologized, she backtracked that apology then blamed Trump supporters for the backlash.

Her conduct, which she claimed was meant to be satirical, became a stain on her career. In later interviews Griffin said she received death threats, was under investigation, and had her comedy tour canceled because of the gruesome photo.

The president, understandably, didn't appreciate the effect her distasteful attempt at comedy had on his youngest son, Barron Trump.

""Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11-year-old son Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!"" the president tweeted.

And then there's comedian Samantha Bee, host of ""Full Frontal,"" who dubbed Ivanka Trump a ""feckless c**t"" during a segment criticizing the administration's immigration policy regarding family separations.

Even by today's standards, the language Bee used was seen as so repulsive that the Emmy-nominated host was forced to issue an apology and was unsure she'd survive the backlash.

However, Bee told the Daily Beast that the only reason she apologized for her conduct was because it took away from the message she wanted to convey.

Many philosophers, moral teachers, and leading thinkers throughout history have given clear warnings about the dangers of allowing anger to guide our behavior.

In James 1:19 (NIV), James, the brother of Jesus, advised fellow believers to be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger.

Aristotle even said, ""Anyone can become angry — that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way — that is not within everybody's power and is not easy.""

While contemporary society perversely praises women for presenting a ""f*** you"" attitude toward those who have different political opinions or the omnipresent patriarchy, it's important to remember that women don't need to be aggressive to get their ideas or agendas across.

Women can be tough, assertive, and persuasive without unnecessary aggression or vulgarity.

Whether feminists or progressives choose to acknowledge the teachings in the Bible, there is something to be said for women who hold themselves to paramount standards instead of society's.

Margaret Thatcher, the first female prime minister of Britain, is a monumental example of the notion that women can be stern and effective leaders in the face of hostility and resistance without vulgarity or anger.

Thatcher, who was often criticized by feminists for not putting the political plight of women at the forefront of her agenda, often faced sexism herself, but she never responded to the prejudice in a manner that would take away from the goals of her party.

In 1 Peter 3:1 (NIV), Peter makes the case that a woman's gentle and quiet spirit has the power to transform even the hardest of hearts:

Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives.

This is a very countercultural idea because today's society teaches women that the only way to advance alongside and above men and to be strong is to be loud, angry, and aggressive. But really that aggression is often just a mask for insecurity.

Contemporary women, especially those who identify as feminists, would reject this Biblical notion of womanhood because they mistakenly believe the Bible calls for women to be fully submissive to and below men but that's not what the Biblical notion of womanhood means.

It means setting an example in the home and community by conducting themselves in such a way that's so admirable and respectable that it's contagious.

Instead of giving the media and young women an unhelpful soundbite, Teigen and those with platforms as large as her own should reiterate that it's possible to be assertive, resilient, and effective without being vulgar.

Washington is a place where powerful women each and every day step out into the halls of Congress and effect change through honest debate, the exchange of ideas, hard work, and respectable conduct.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/proponents-of-the-metoo-movement-cant-have-it-both-ways,2019-04-18
The big social media companies will be harder to regulate than you think,"There's a growing consensus among Americans that something should be done about social media giants like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Executives from all the major tech companies have faced bipartisan hostile grilling from members of Congress in hearings recently, and the growing public rumbling seems to suggest that some sort of governmental action to increase government regulation on social media giants is around the corner.

The people on both sides of the political spectrum who are craving this result should be careful, lest they get what they want.

The legal justification for some form of aggressive regulation and/or breakup of the social media giants probably already exists.

As of March 2019, Facebook had more than 2.3 billion monthly active users, and that number continues to grow. Facebook had over $55 billion in revenue last year. Adjusted for inflation, that is about 35 times as much as the annual revenue of the Standard Oil trust at the height of its power.

The size and scope of the modern tech giants mean that they exercise more control over the dissemination of information than any entity that has ever existed before. The nightly newscasts of the big three television networks at the height of their power reached less than 1 percent of Facebook's audience, combined. Modern-day censors working for the Chinese government influence the flow of information to about 1.4 billion people — a figure slightly over half the size of Facebook's audience. Further, their reach means that countless businesses and content creators depend on companies like Facebook and YouTube to exist.

Additionally, the nature of social media makes the creation of meaningful competitors to companies like Facebook and Twitter virtually impossible. The reason everyone is on Facebook is because ... everyone is on Facebook. No one would be interested in signing up for a new social media platform that would allow them to keep up with their friends, if less than 5 percent of their friends were still on it. That would be like trying to start a cell phone company that sold phones that would only connect to other users of the same cell phone company; there might be a limited demand for such a product but it wouldn't be any meaningful competition to Facebook whatsoever.

The alleged problems with the social media giants are well known, and vary depending on who you talk to. Conservatives claim (with adequate justification) that social media giants are unfairly biased against conservatives when deciding who to ban, suspend, or demonetize. Liberals claim that the social media giants aren't doing enough to combat ""hate speech,"" which often in their minds includes mainstream beliefs like ""people who are born as males should not be allowed to compete in women's sports just because they have decided that they are female.""

Both sides, meanwhile, complain about the spread of ""fake news,"" which usually just means news that conflicts with their point of view. All parties complain that social media companies aren't doing enough to protect the privacy of their users' personal data.

Social media, then, has obvious problems that everyone can see. However, we ought to be careful about invoking governmental action as a cure; often, government cures are worse than the disease.

In the first place, the traditional antitrust remedies available to the government would not really fix any of the problems with the social media companies. Breaking up a company like Facebook into constituent parts would not a) be feasible or b) solve the problems that have been noted with social media companies. Likewise, breaking social media companies up into geographical regions like the government did with the telecoms would be unworkable and also ineffectual. It also wouldn't make sense on any obvious level to force the social media giants to resell access to their product, as the government has periodically done with telecoms and cable companies, because of the nature of social media (as discussed above).

Second, a general consensus does not exist as to what, exactly, needs to be done with the social media companies. As noted above, depending on your political leanings, you're likely to have different opinions about what the government should be forcing social media companies to do, exactly. Should the government be policing fake news? Should it be protecting free speech on Facebook? Should it be making sure social media isn't encouraging suicides?

This lack of consensus means that the regulatory hand of government will likely be arbitrary and whipsaw depending on who is in control of the government. The almost inevitable result will be viewpoint suppression of people who oppose the current presidential administration. Given the incredible power of social media in the dissemination of information in the modern age, this would be perhaps worse than allowing Facebook to make arbitrary and biased decisions on their own.

Sooner or later, after all, a Democrat is going to become president, and when that happens, does anyone want that president's administration involved in decisions on what Facebook can and can't suppress? Are we willing to live with the result when President Bernie Sanders decides that all articles that dispute the stated price tag on his single-payer program are fake news and therefore must be deleted by Facebook?

The alternate solution, requiring social media companies to allow ALL content, would be better from the standpoint of preserving a healthy democracy, but would likely mean the end of social media as we know it. Twenty-plus years of internet experience has taught us that any internet space that is completely unmoderated will immediately be overrun with trolls, racists, and spammers who will promptly drive the normal people who just want to enjoy sharing things with their friends off the platform.

The last time everyone decided that something needed to be done to fix a major failure in the private sector, the TSA came into existence. Now, everyone seems to more or less have regret over that decision. However, everyone seems to forget those lessons and be ready to plunge into another major government intervention.

I admit that something ought to be done about the many systematic failures of the social media industry. However, the American public should be cautious before rushing a government-imposed solution to the problem that might either make the problem worse or subvert democracy entirely.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/ready-horowitz-jpmorgan-chase-bows-to-environmental-activists-will-stop-financing-arctic-drilling-and-divest-from-coal,2019-06-12
The Jordan Peterson war continues,"Back when we were primates, we used to comb each other's hair. We laid hands on one another. We pinched fleas and beheaded parasites and swept off dead skin.

We protected one another. This wasn't strictly about hygiene. It was also a bonding ceremony. We maintained social order without ever saying a word. But eventually our population grew too large for such personal touches, and we had begun to flourish into proper language, so our expectations of community drifted into abstractions, metaphor, art, symbols, and, worst of all, political fanaticism. Imbued with consciousness, we discovered that life is endlessly complicated. Our response was to declare war.

I first met Jordan Peterson at Dave Rubin's house in January 2018, shortly after the release of Peterson's best-selling book, ""12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos."" He was a whir of a man. Radiating chaos. Chattering like the frog from Sesame Street. How exactly is a 54-year-old Canadian professor who just became gaspingly famous supposed to act?

If this is your first encounter with Jordan Peterson, welcome to the internet. May God have mercy on your soul. Because you've stumbled into a particularly volatile corner.



Allow me to be your Virgil.

Over the next four months, I shadowed Peterson sporadically for what would eventually become ""The Long Distance Call,"" titled after a verse from Paul Simon's song ""Boy in the Bubble.""

These are the days of miracle and wonder

This is the long distance call

The way the camera follows us in slo-mo

The way we look to us all

That's how it felt to see Peterson in 2018. He was an enigma. The way he rode into Western consciousness like the squinting anti-hero of a Sergio Leone film: ""Serpents? I bloody hate serpents."" But before we ever fully decided whether he was a hero or a villain he just sort of vanished. Which was odd, because for about two years, he'd been culturally ubiquitous.

Rumors bounced around Reddit and Twitter, among journalists: Cancer, drugs, rehab, psychosis, sirloins. It was all so outrageous and vague.

Then, halfway through 2020, the year that still might end us all, in the middle of a godforsaken pandemic that as of the publishing of this review still continues, Peterson re-emerged. At Babaroga Steakhouse in Belgrade of all places, to celebrate his birthday. If you believe in synchronicity, ""Babaroga"" translates to ""bogeyman.""



There weren't many other celebrations in June 2020. Just lots of fear and death. America was on fire, heartbroken, afraid. Lots of places were. Travel was restricted. Quarantines, lockdowns. People kept dying. Closer and closer. People you knew. So, Peterson plucking at Tomahawks on Instagram was a hell of a plot twist.

Then he got Covid. And Pneumonia. Hospitalized. Abyss. Somehow survived. Not much later, he announced the release of his third book, ""Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life"":

Jordan Peterson's list of rules in Beyond Order Twitter

Slowly, the details of his absence emerged. Basically, he had a lot of bad all at once. The pace and intensity of fame, the constant vitriol and love that engulfed him. He had his anxiety medication, clonazepam, upped when his wife of 30 years contracted terminal cancer. Then a series of moments — sometimes days on end — when he assumed he was going to die. Wanted to, maybe, who could tell. He bounced to various hospitals in the U.S. and Canada throughout 2019, fighting off the crippling anxiety and thoughts of self-destruction, hunted by insomnia, unable to dream, to escape or forget.

Most other reviews delightfully go through the rest of Peterson's collapse, or couch it with boring praise, in the case of conservative media. Either way it's tacky and banal.

Some critics have taken Peterson's collapse as proof that he, a psychology professor and clinician with decades of practice who recently underwent real-world personal experience of everything he'd been studying, should not be writing books about self-improvement.

That's like saying a poet shouldn't write love poems because they've known heartbreak.

Love him or hate him, Peterson deserves an honest examination — for some reason love or hate seem to be the only two options we're given when deciding how to feel about Peterson. Which is ridiculous, and hardly productive.

Peterson often resembles an aggressive goose. He has a history of tantrums that outshine the tantrums he's reacting to. Although the initiating tantrum is often technically an ambush.

These skirmishes of the culture war — perhaps our greatest distraction — flesh out mostly online, mostly Twitter and Reddit, although the more fringe rhetoric circulates 4Chan and Tumblr.

Journalist Jesse Singal breaks this divide into ""normies"" and the ""too-online"":

""You need controversy,"" Peterson said, during one of our 2018 interviews, in the dressing room after one of his shows, under a dead lightbulb.

Fame, he said, relies on public opinion. It's about the constituent individuals choosing which humans rise to the top. Something about how valuation shapes hierarchies — Peterson relates most things hierarchically.

He then described fame as an outcome of an admiration-to-controversy ratio. In order to become famous, a person must cultivate an ever-widening balance of the two. On that particular night, Peterson rated himself at a 60-to-40, but admitted that it fluctuates constantly.

Which, it's a near-satirically Peterson move to conceptualize fame as some unending game that spirals through our species, an array of data points.

""What's the best percentage of controversy?"" he asked. ""It's not zero, I can tell you that much.""

It's never zero with Jordan Peterson.

When Penguin Random House Canada announced the release of ""Beyond Order,"" Penguin employees tried to stop its publication. They consider Peterson ""an icon of hate speech and transphobia"" and despise ""the fact that he's an icon of white supremacy.""

It's a narrative you hear repeated but never proven. And it feeds into Peterson's Fame Ratio: The people who want to attenuate him only give him further strength.

Just last week, Peterson went viral because of a comic book, Captain America, issue #28. In it, the Nazi supervillian Red Skull, ""the New Leader of the Power Elite,"" has brain-washed young white men over the internet with ""his new theory of the world."" Then cut to a screen of Red Skull next to signs that say, ""10 rules for life,"" ""CHAOS AND ORDER,"" ""KARL LUEGER'S GENIUS,"" and ""THE FEMINIST TRAP.""

But this isn't about liberals or moderates or centrists or Democrats or independents or socialists. This isn't a rebuke of racial or social justice causes.

There are two combatants: Jordan Peterson and the Bourgeois Activist Class.

Think of Peterson's previous book, ""12 Rules for Life"" (white cover, white font) and his latest book, ""Beyond Order"" (black cover, white font) as interlocking halves of the same totality. Contrary, yet unified.

Different yet selfsame.

Marxist philosopher Guy Debord closes ""The Society of the Spectacle"" with a choice, an ultimatum. Do you want Truth? Or spectacle? Truth? Or mass media, boredom, celebrity, endless consumption, lonely crowds, atomized people? We used to connect with each other, as a species. Now all we have is a constant flow of bad movies we're never in.

""In a society where no one can any longer be recognized by others,"" writes Debord, ""every individual becomes unable to recognize his own reality.""

Over the course of six months, I wrote 11 drafts of this review, but deleted them all, because they failed to capture something beautiful and unique. I had written the same review as everyone else. And just as shallow. Like theirs, mine lacked a certain practicality. So I tried various styles and gimmicks. I wrote some stunning sentences, a few perfect, gorgeous phrases. Like any person should, I admired my handiwork in the quiet. Grinning at its completeness. Then, every time, it collapsed when I tried embracing it.

It wasn't obvious that I had really considered Peterson's ideas — or the ideas of his enemies — let alone put them to use, if only as part of my job. But this was more important than any job. This was a matter of saving the nation.

'Beyond Order'

Like its predecessor, ""Beyond Order"" can be genred as Philosophical Self-Help. A postmodern version of Viktor Frankl's ""Man's Search for Meaning.""

I did not get the impression that Peterson ever excluded himself from statements like, ""It is much more psychologically appropriate to assume that you are the enemy — that it is your weaknesses and insufficiencies that are damaging the world — than to assume saint-like goodness on the part of you and your party.""

Peterson mentions his own frailty, his obvious imperfection, repeatedly throughout the book. And not through grit teeth. Not every time.

His approach is a more radical version of Carl Rogers' ""Unconditional Positive Regard,"" a ""person-centered"" counseling technique in which the therapist responds to what the patient tells them, however bad, with total acceptance. The goal is for the patient to cultivate a sense of responsibility for themselves.

The goal is meaning.

Meaning: The ultimate pursuit of Peterson's philosophy, ""something far deeper than mere thought — that orients us properly in life, so that we do not become overwhelmed by what is beyond us, or equally dangerously, stultified and stunted by dated, too narrow, or too pridefully paraded systems of value and belief.""

This isn't a philosophy text, it's about 50 years behind the prevailing ideas, and far too approachable. But for a self-help book, it is philosophical. Does that undermine its cultural status? Is it like saying ""I saw an episode of Jerry Springer in which everyone wore tuxedos and recited 'The Aeneid,' so 'The Jerry Springer Show!' can now be considered high brow""? No, not for most people. But it's part of the reason some of Peterson's critics see him as a tradition that is fighting erosion.

""Beyond Order"" averages a captivating line every few pages, a passage that echoes in you after you read it every chapter. Scattered throughout sections about mythology and hierarchies (I never want to hear about hierarchies again) and the mechanisms of storytelling, personal anecdotes, and LSD wisdom, are fitful sentences of creative intensity. And one tremendous idea — I won't ruin it.

In his description of Nietzsche's foreboding eye, Peterson writes, ""The incomprehensible level of prophetic capacity remains a stellar example of how the artist and his institution brings to light the future far before others see it."" This has long been a subject of fascination, perhaps even obsession, for Peterson, the idea that a rare human emerges from each zeitgeist with an honest-to-God vision of the future. Does Peterson consider himself one of these visionaries?

Maybe.

More important, should we?

Anyone asking that question will likely have already said no.

The academic criticism of Peterson's work is more erudite than what you'll get from journalists, but often just as editorial, with an abrupt tone-change in reviews of his first book, 1999's ""Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief,"" a recondite slog through most of Peterson's favorite ideas. Some of the criticism borders on gleeful bullying, like Ben Whitham's histrionic essay, ""A postmodern neo-Marxist's guide to free speech: Jordan Peterson, the alt-right and neo-fascism.""

(While academics and critics have mocked him for using the phrase ""Neo-Marxist Postmodernists,"" it doesn't appear in ""Beyond Order"" a single time.)

But ""Beyond Order"" isn't a book specifically for academics. It is a book for restless no ones, in need of a bucket of cold water. For husbands or wives who want to keep improving. For lost souls. For depressed people who can't answer, ""What next?"" For atheists. For career-minded people who find themselves stuck and dissatisfied with the direction or pace of their advancement. For undergraduates. For drug addicts, alcoholics. For eating disorder patients. For preachers. For congregants. For people who can't catch a f***ing break.

For hobby psychologists and amateur philosophers. For aesthetes. Yes, for young men, especially those in need of guidance. But, yes, for young women, too. Yes, for conservatives. But also for liberals, who ought to see what all the fuss is about. For first-time moms and dads, trying to raise a newborn during a pandemic without losing their minds — although, given the book's length, they'd better go with the audiobook.

Yes and no

Philosopher Jacob Boehme wrote that all things are rooted in a Yes and a No.

For Peterson, Yes is Order — Yin, light, reality, the conscious, the King, Culture, Goodness.

No is Chaos — Yang, dark, potential, the unconscious, the Dragon, Nature, Hell.

He sees this Chaos and Order dualism as undergirding the structure of reality, where Life is the endless collision of opposites, a progression through contraries, dual forces at play, complementary negations, the life-affirming struggle of ""an eternal dichotomy.""

He practices a science of contraries that, in the West, dates back to at least Aristotle's ""Metaphysics,"" and in the East for even longer, so old that nobody knows when it began or who got it started, a philosophy that begins with the pre-dawn silence that contained only nothingness.

Peterson's intellectual father and mother, respectively, are Friedrich Nietzsche and Carl Jung. In many ways, Peterson is a condensation of their largest ideas.

Like Jung, Peterson believes that ""people find meaning in optimally balancing"" any polarities. Peterson is also an Existentialist in his belief that life is bloody awful and ruthlessly absurd, but the point of it is to establish meaning, through individual dignity, personal love, and creative effort. Jean-Paul Sartre: ""Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself.""

But, as an Existentialist, Peterson resembles the Christian Existentialist Paul Tillich more than Sartre. As Tillich writes in ""The Courage to Be"": ""Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.""

Society of the Spectacle

Over a century ago, Nietzsche predicted 200 years of Nihilism. We have about 70 years left.

Of everything that I studied during my research for this review, ""nonbeing"" was the most destructive. Far worse than any political idea. Worse than any tragic stories. It led me into a two-week depressive episode. Surrounded by the negation of all life, or so it seemed. Absence. Nullity. Emptiness. I hated that place. I hated that feeling.

To be clear, my research on Nietzsche is what sent me into the spiral, not Peterson's book.

Reading Nietzsche is like fiddling with a Ouija Board: You've got to be careful. Nietzsche is criminally misunderstood, and I'm no doubt guilty of that myself. He's certainly not a Nihilist. Like Peterson, Nihilism was one of his greatest enemies. It's just that his wild ideas can be so devastatingly transformative and hard to contain.

Peterson incorporates a lot of Nietzsche's ideas. (Tell me this doesn't sound like Peterson: ""When a person wishes to become a hero, the serpent must previ­ously have become a dragon, otherwise he lacks his proper enemy."")

Peterson is fond of Hell as a personification of Bad as a totality, of all the most negative aspects of everything. His characterization of Hell resembles Dante's, where Hell is the privation of humanity, the image of the human soul turned upside down, inside out, the rejection of love.

Dante's Hell is full of victims. Self-pitying souls who choose pride over kindness and cry nonstop. (Performatively.) They whine and complain and blame any number of objects or people for their confinement. They boast about the reputation they left behind or the totally excusable sins they succumbed to.

They belong to the void. The negation. The world cratered into grey muddy emptiness. A loose tooth receding inwards.

This possibility terrifies us. If we went extinct, who would tell the indifferent universe how important we had been?

Anxiety often arises from the fear of nothingness. We're afraid to die; but we're anxious about the possibility that nothing will happen when we do. Just, zip, then Tony Soprano, no music, no light, no color. But, as anyone who's whispered into a canyon knows, even total absence will resound with echo, the rippling arrival of one from zero.

What we say is always so much less encompassing and vast than what we leave unsaid, knowingly or not. What matters is the tumult and rise. As Rilke put it, ""the darkness of each endless fall, / the shimmering light of each ascent.""

So if the Nietzschean chaos nearly destroyed me, the Jungian order led to restoration. Specifically Jung's concept of Synchronicity, the meaningful coincidence of inner and outer events that aren't causally connected, a harmony of parallels. Once I discovered Synchronicity, I was reborn into the world, like the fuzzy afterglow of LSD.

With this newfound clarity, I understood Peterson's chaotic orderliness better. His admixture of spirituality and positivism.

So I emerged in the dark woods. Now I would need to rebuild myself. ""Beyond Order"" was there at that exact moment, with no-nonsense instructions, barks, really, cadet calls. I would have to undergo differentiation, to become an individual. We have no sense of direction without establishing differences.

Carl Jung, in the ""Undiscovered Self"":

The psychology of the individual corresponds to the psychology of the nation. What the nation does is done also by the individual, and so long as the individual does it, the nation also does it. Only the change in the attitude of the individual is the beginning of the change in the psychology of the nation.

But Individualism alone can lead to horrific outcomes. Not as a concept, but as a weaponized ideology that disregards the wellbeing of the collective, often for insidious reasons. There is no individual without the collective. A baby cannot raise itself.



James Davison Hunter writes, ""[T]he key actor in history is not individual genius but rather the network and the new institutions that are created out of those networks.""

Jung achieved this through Mandalas, ""circular patterns he etched into notebooks, and through them he observed his transformation."" He noticed that Madalas are common among people experiencing mental anguish. They signify an attempt at repair, a way to pull it together. Yet mandalas have also been used for centuries in Eastern religions for meditation, as a symbol, a relic, a microcosm of the universe.

It's about the perfection of the all-containing circle. Mandalas always cohere to the harmony of the circle. It's about the synthesis of so many various parts, like the Jungian archetype of the self, the totality of the personality and mind and spirit and soul, both its conscious and unconscious elements, a united totality like the Tao, a circle, a union of opposites, a play of light and shadow, contained in the whole, always there, resting at the center of it all.

Plato called the essence of thought the interior dialogue of the soul with itself. Hans-Georg Gadamer, described this inner world as ""the mirror and the image of the divine Word."" Jung offers the possibility that the relationship between body and soul is a synchronistic one. That matter and mind are one and the same.

Left and right



With his previous book, ""12 Rules for Life,"" Peterson championed ""the merits of a more conservative view of the world."" Chaos.

In ""Beyond Order,"" he ""argues for the merits of a more liberal view."" Order.

Overall, he's looking for ""a balance between reasonable conservatism and revitalizing creativity.""

In Rule 11, he concludes that liberalism and conservatism ""both are 'correct', but each of which tell only half the story."" He adds, ""to develop a properly balanced view of the world of experiences, it is necessary to accept the reality of both elements in culture.""

At one point, he even says that ""there is, of course, some value to Marx's observations.""

The Bourgeois Activist Class obeys then enforces a certain cultural brutalism. French President Emmanuel Macron warned about the effect of ""certain social science theories entirely imported from the United States."" In a 2019 speech, former President Barack Obama rebuked the new movement: ""I get a sense among certain young people on social media that the way of making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people.

They have even earned their own pejorative in Chinese: ""Baizuo.""

The activist class overwhelmingly hates Peterson. We know this because we hear all of the Bourgeois Activist Class's opinions. They're elites masquerading as the proletariat.

Peterson rails against political correctness (q.v. ""Rule 5: Do not do what you hate""), but most Americans don't like political correctness. Only one demographic does. Take a guess. There aren't that many of them, really.

From The Atlantic:



Some 8 percent of Americans are progressive activists, and their views are even less typical. By contrast, the two-thirds of Americans who don't belong to either extreme constitute an ""exhausted majority."" Their members ""share a sense of fatigue with our polarized national conversation, a willingness to be flexible in their political viewpoints, and a lack of voice in the national conversation. Most members of the ""exhausted majority,"" and then some, dislike political correctness. Among the general population, a full 80 percent believe that ""political correctness is a problem in our country."" Even young people are uncomfortable with it, including 74 percent ages 24 to 29, and 79 percent under age 24. On this particular issue, the woke are in a clear minority across all ages.

So they're outnumbered, but they're powerful, and they're loud, because they have parked themselves next to all the cultural megaphones. A 2020 study in Science Advances determined that ""journalists are overwhelmingly liberal — perhaps even more-so than surveys have suggested."" But they are not liberal at all, they are ""far to the left of even the average (Twitter-using) American."" Which is quite a statement, considering Twitter itself leans disproportionately left.

In my experience, most of them are decent people, but they are tough to be around. In part because they're impossible to criticize. They're a cultural annoyance. But they have power because we've all handed it to them.

If the right actually engaged in the culture, they'd have no reason to complain. But at the moment, they aren't contributing. They generally lack fine culture and hate-fear higher education but refuse to do anything about it.

They need to stop complaining about academia and just learn to engage with intellectual pursuits. More reading. More art. More film. More poetry.

Learn the big ideas, they aren't all radical. And, when they are, learn them anyway. Actually learn them. Hans-Georg Gadamer: ""A person who has no horizon is a man who does not see far enough and hence over-values what is nearest to him.""

But this quickly becomes a normative issue: If someone doesn't respect your values, why the hell should you even so much as acknowledge theirs? As a country, we already live in their world. We already adhere to their value system. Part of the problem is that they not only ignore the values and needs of other people, they want a society that contains theirs and theirs alone.

Why should you have any respect for, or pay any attention to, anyone who thinks you are evil and your life is an abomination? Which actually brings us full circle. Because isn't that is how conservatives feel about this situation? About the activist class themselves, not their broader causes. As in, ""Life would just be easier if they weren't such a nag.""

It wouldn't. Their nagging serves an invaluable purpose. They keep us in motion. Humans need to be remodeled, or else life, collectively, can spiral into primitive darkness. After awhile, we begin to lose the fineries that make us so intricate and special.

I've spent a lot of time analyzing the Peterson phenomenon from every angle, and the activist class seems to be the most heated aggressor. They're demanding the most and offering the least. Chronologically, however, Peterson was the initial agitator. Otherwise he would still just be psychologist who's a wacky figure among the Canadian professoriate, and not the most famous public intellectual of an entire generation.

Ultimately, all of us need to calm down with the politics. Politics should not make it into anyone's top five values. It should stay somewhere near, ""This is what my tattoo means.""

Peterson's solution is helpful for all of this. He's an agitator. A social gadfly. We need those people around. More important, they will emerge whether or not we want them to.

If something offends you, shrug and move on. Or laugh, if it's funny. Or probe your unconscious to discover why exactly it offends you, then do something about it. What we have is a devaluation of values.

But also, we need to be cautious about who whispers in our ears. To pay attention to how they frame what they're saying. In this case, it would be:

1. Jordan Peterson, embattled cultural icon and spiritual advisor v. Hateful anarchists devoted to total destruction, or

2. Fearless, righteous activists v. Jordan Peterson, megalomaniac super-villain aiming civilization backwards.

Because that's what they're fighting over: Civilization.

The Bourgeois Activist Class just expresses it with words like ""whiteness"" and ""white supremacy,"" and the right uses ""Western civilization"" and ""traditional values."" One wants to transform it. One wants to preserve. In both cases, the argument concerns abstractions that neither side is willing to fully inspect, and not just the ideas of their enemy, although this is a massive problem: that both sides are OK with a straw man for an enemy, lacking all nuance and destined to fail.

Nietzsche: ""It is not conflict of opinions that has made history so violent but conflict of belief in opinions, conflict of convictions.""

Here's what we should all agree on: The Peterson experience is yours to have, to reject, or embrace. Yours to decide.



Journalism now

Many of my fellow journalists have been nasty to Peterson, and I find it problematic, and I feel morally compelled to call them out on it. Of course, Peterson has been nasty in return. Or maybe it was the other way around, in which case I feel morally compelled to call Peterson out, and so on. But too much has since happened for us to know. Meanwhile, conservative media's eagerness to crown Peterson a conservative hero is equally misguided — at least make the fawning enjoyable to read. As a result, he seems too bored with conservative media to care. There's no game to it. No play.

Because Peterson clearly benefits from the hit-pieces, or else he wouldn't keep agreeing to them. And the activist class gets the satisfaction of having hunted a monster. Nietzsche: ""He who lives for the sake of combating an enemy has an interest in seeing that his enemy stays alive.""

Although at times I wonder if they realize this, that they need Peterson alive in order to further their cause, or, more accurately, to help them achieve what passes for profitable fame in this backwoods of an industry. Why else would they be so excessively vitriolic? And, more important, why so Machiavellian? Lately, their cause precedes the truth. Their personal truths supersede actual Truth.

Like the idea that Peterson is an alt-right goon. When, in reality, it's pushing it to characterize him as conservative. According to Helen Lewis, staff writer at The Atlantic, Peterson's ""conservative principles"" include ""self-reliance and responsibility."" Another of Peterson's conservative principles: Valuing marriage.

He airs a couple gripes about climate change activists. Doesn't like the growing corporatized overreach of human resources. He's one of those anti-academia academics.

But for every supposed conservative idea, he offers as many or more that are inherently liberal. And, even if he didn't, why would it be a problem?

Several journalists have attacked Peterson's daughter, and with such obvious, menacing hatred, such internalized misogyny.

I hope nobody is as evil as she and her father are portrayed. I hope nobody is as bigoted as the depictions of his fans.

One reviewer called Peterson ""a Messiah-cum-Surrogate-Dad for gormless dimwits.""

Gormless dimwits. What a nasty thing to say about anyone. It's an abuse of great intellect, that hatred.

But hypocrisy is probably the most consistent insult he faces, always aimed at his character. Which is a fairly typical move in politics and corporate media. Almost as common as the hypocrisy itself, which, as I mentioned in the intro, is not exclusive to the liberal branch of corporate media.

If you've read only reviews for ""Beyond Order,"" you'd assume that he doesn't address this issue, or else reviewers wouldn't have accused him of hypocrisy. But he does. ""Rule 8: Try to make one room in your house as beautiful as possible."" Specifically, he discusses this meme. Why does the ""Clean your room before you try to change the world"" guy, who has earned fame trying to change the world, have a messy room?

Peterson writes,

There is something directly synchronistic and meaningful about that objection because I am not in proper order at that moment myself, and my condition undoubtedly found its reflection in the state of my office. More piled up every day, as I traveled, and everything collected around me ... and I put many other things in order during the time my office was degenerating, but I still have a moral obligation in to get back in there and put it right. And the problem is not just that I want to clean up the mess. I also want to make it beautiful: my room, my house, and then, perhaps, in whatever way I can manage, the community.

God

Despite all this political talk, ""Beyond Order"" isn't a political text. Peterson devotes maybe 50 of its 400 pages to politics.

On the subject of God, as well as Truth, Peterson is often accused of equivocation, of hiding banal ideas behind superfluous language. They say his opacity is intentional, that Peterson is performing a magic trick in which the audience convinced themselves he's a genius, and that his prolixity is just one more hubristic distraction. His supporters see his ""I contain multitudes"" approach as part of his humanistic maximalism.

When explaining a concept, he doesn't do himself any favors by choosing a literary approach over a straightforward definition. Yet these literary flourishes lead to some of the book's most exciting moments.

Stylistically, Peterson is performing something like Flannery O'Connor's process: ""I write to discover what I know."" Nietzsche actually encouraged this approach: ""Partial knowledge is more triumphant than complete knowledge; it takes things to be simpler than they are, and so makes its theory more popular and convincing."" So much of higher thought is actually transcendental speculation. In the words of Henry David Thoreau: ""The universe is wider than our views of it.""

Personally, I prefer to read thinkers and writers whose ideas are too large for me to ever fully comprehend.

Either way, it's disingenuous to portray Peterson as a smug know-it-all. There's a lot to learn from Peterson. It's a lot of sifting. Sometimes it's a slog, not often, but sometimes. He provides a lot of information, constantly. Some of it may never apply to you. When it does, it has the potential to improve your life.

As always, it's just a matter of being humble enough to listen. To admit that you don't know most of what's knowable, let alone all that just isn't. You don't have to go full hemlock on it like Socrates. But it's actually comforting to admit your own vast inadequacy.

Basically, Peterson's greatest fight is between nothingness and God. He wants to navigate ""the deadly play of opposites,"" an inevitable ""reality of existence that sees us belittled and undone repeatedly, so that you can find your own unique path to The Highest Good.""

The Highest Good means God. Or God as Peterson defines ""God."" Which is the absolute presence of all that is good, anywhere, ever.

Once again, he's borrowing from Jung, who had an equally complicated vision of God, and playing around with creativity and language as he does.

According to Peterson, you arrive at that Highest Good through courage and love.

In this, he accomplishes something remarkable: He characterizes play in all its potential, as a force of creation, far more than as part of any game. It's an idea he's been toying with for years. And he finally lands it. And he does it by embracing the chaos of art.

""Rule 8: Try to make one room in your house as beautiful as possible.""

""Beyond Order"" is worth buying for this chapter alone. It could've easily run as a standalone essay. In it, he borders on the ineffable, the terrain of creation and art. His description of the mysteries of performance and creativity is wonderful, lovely. He examines the justifiable religiosity of art. Art as a spiritual act, an activity of grace.

His overarching metaphor is the journey, as always, but differently this time. The primary tool is the map. And the quest leads us toward meaning. There is no art without relentless, often dehumanizing, pursuit.

It's the same interplay we see on repeat.

He forgoes the assumption within the philosophy of aesthetics that beauty, and taste, is part of a formal process, a matter of education, a hobby for the intellectual elites.

Instead, he tells us that every single person needs to maintain a relationship with art. To experience it regularly.

And he's right. Because art is one form of Truth. There are three: art, history, and language.

In other words: Story.

My wife is a counselor. She's the one who helped me realize what this review needed to be. She told me about acceptance and commitment therapy.

""A, C, T,"" she said. ""Accept your thoughts and emotions. Choose a valued direction. Take action.""

What matters to you? Who are you, as a unique person, but also as part of what Czeklaw Milosz called ""the always childish book of our species""?

Think about recent events. Did you act in accordance with those values?

When you cultivate a life that feeds your values, you grow, you habituate meaning. But when you are disconnected from your values, you wander in anxiety or depression. You lose track of meaning.

How do those same values accord with the values of the community you live in? The state. The nation. And so on, and so on, on up to the collective. That's everything. How do you square against everything in existence?

What about the rest of history? Do your values find complement in previous eras? What about humans as a totality?

Which is older: You? Or love?

Do you see the cruelty and magnificence of the world around you? Do you adore the cinema light of your dreams and the intricacy of each heartbreak and every peaceful moment, too? Can you sense the energy you bring to your life, to life itself? And when you look around, as your existence unfolds, who else is there beside you?

Now the barrier between art and reality is gone. We are thriving in the animate lifeform. We are the reflections of ourselves and what we believe. Our language is the continuation of all of our histories and accidents and error.

In a poem, Jorie Graham describes love as ""the stillest motion gets."" I understand this with my entire being. I laugh when the timing is just right, Michael Scott, and smile with love for my family and friends, and treasure their great multiplicity. I sigh gently when I hear the grace of a piano as my 1-year-old daughter clobbers across the floor, with her wild eyes and perfect as the evening unfolds softly outside.

Rilke believed that by speaking, by saying the names of things, of anything, everything, we allow God to spirit through us.

This suddenly new version of myself fully understands this. Does your suddenly new version of yourself understand this, too? I float motionless like midwinter leaves clinging to a branch. Do you also float like this?

We used to comb each other's hair. Why don't we anymore?

Horowitz: President Trump can use this Supreme Court victory to neutralize ‘resistance’ judges,"In June 2018, following endless litigation against President Trump's ""travel ban,"" the Supreme Court stated the obvious: The president has full authority to regulate and deny entry to foreign nationals at will. Yet the lower courts continue to come back for more and are even demanding that the Trump administration hand over more information to these same litigants who should not have standing to sue, per the Supreme Court decision.

Will Trump's victory Monday at the Supreme Court for his enforcement of public charge laws have any greater success than the travel ban has had in the courts? It's up to the president and Congress to check these rogue judges.

By a vote of 5-4, the Supreme Court agreed to stay the injunction placed on Trump's public charge law by a New York district judge. It's not a surprise that five justices understand the absurdity of a lower court enjoining a modest enforcement of a long-standing law against prospective immigrants accessing welfare and then receiving a green card.

What is more important, however, is the concurrence written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, because it gets to the heart of the judicial insanity grinding our sovereignty to a halt and hampering any effort by President Trump to enforce unambiguous statutes on the books.

No matter how many times these lower courts get slapped down by the Supreme Court, they feel they can still come back for another round, even on the same issue, and halt an entire policy, beyond legitimate litigants with standing before the court. Gorsuch wrote, ""It would be delusional to think that one stay today suffices to remedy the problem."" Clearly observing this illegitimate trend of nationwide injunctions issued by forum-shopped judges in numerous other cases, Gorsuch called on his colleagues to ""at some point, confront these important objections to this increasingly widespread practice.""

Much as in Justice Thomas' concurrence in Trump v. Hawaii, Gorsuch observed that universal injunctions, used as ad hoc judicial vetoes on broad presidential authorities or statutes, clearly violates the limited scope of judicial power.

""When a court goes further than that, ordering the government to take (or not take) some action with respect to those who are strangers to the suit, it is hard to see how the court could still be acting in the judicial role of resolving cases and controversies,"" wrote Gorsuch in his concurrence.

Gorsuch went even further to illustrate some of the political chaos, absurdities, and undemocratic outcomes that are resulting from this unconstitutional practice. ""As the brief and furious history of the regulation before us illustrates, the routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these conflicting decisions.""

Finally, Gorsuch took it to the next step and explained, as I've been warning for two years, that once you legitimize this game of forum-shopping and judicial vetoes, there's nothing stopping the Democrats from coming back for endless rounds of this:

There are currently more than 1,000 active and senior district court judges, sitting across 94 judicial districts, and subject to review in 12 regional courts of appeal. Because plaintiffs generally are not bound by adverse decisions in cases to which they were not a party, there is a nearly boundless opportunity to shop for a friendly forum to secure a win nationwide. The risk of winning conflicting nationwide injunctions is real too.



And the stakes are asymmetric. If a single successful challenge is enough to stay the challenged rule across the country, the government's hope of implementing any new policy could face the long odds of a straight sweep, parlaying a 94-to-0 win in the district courts into a 12-to-0 victory in the courts of appeal. A single loss and the policy goes on ice—possibly for good, or just as possibly for some indeterminate period of time until another court jumps in to grant a stay. And all that can repeat, ad infinitum, until either one side gives up or this Court grants certiorari. What in this gamesmanship and chaos can we be proud of?

This is certainly refreshing. But too many supporters of the president will take this as a win and go home, simply hoping that three other justices join Gorsuch and Thomas in ""overturning"" the concept of universal injunctions. However, not only is that unlikely to happen, we shouldn't have to wait for the Supreme Court to ""allow"" us to function as a constitutional republic. The other branches of government need to put these judges in their place and refuse to give effect to their civil disobedience.

Throughout the day Monday, there were numerous headlines exclaiming how the Supreme Court ""allowed"" the public charge rule to go forward. Such language should give any constitutionalist heartburn. Courts do not stand above the other branches of government, and they do not veto or ratify policies. If that were the case, we would cease to have three co-equal, independent branches of government.

A spokesperson for the Department of Justice hailed the victory in a statement Monday and expressed ""hope"" that ""the Supreme Court is able to address the matter of nationwide injunctions once and for all at the appropriate juncture."" Well, the best way to ensure that this illegal practice doesn't continue is for the other branches to refuse to give it effect.

Congress has plenary power over the Supreme Court's subject-matter jurisdiction and judicial procedures and has full power over the entire existence of lower courts. It's a disgrace that Republicans in Congress have failed to address this with a relentless legislative push.

As for the president and the attorney general, they must heed the principle of President Abraham Lincoln and the words of his attorney general, Edward Bates: ""That is the sum of its [judicial] powers, ample and efficient for all the purposes of distributive justice among individual parties, but powerless to impose rules of action and of judgment upon the other departments.""",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/sorry-chrissy-teigen-f-you-arent-the-two-words-women-should-use-more,2020-01-28
"Who watches the watchmen? Fauci's 'noble lie,' exposed","The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer once wrote that truth goes through three stages:

First, it is ridiculed; second, it is violently opposed; and third, it is accepted as being self-evident.

Guess what's next for us?

*****

Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? — Who watches the watchers?

Six months ago, I began my first article on scientific censorship during COVID-19 by introducing Dr. Anthony Fauci as a surprise character who had emerged unexpectedly while I dug through what were then 83,000 FOIA emails, published by US Right-to-Know over the course of the last year: see files related to Ralph Baric, Linda Saif, Rita Colwell, Colorado State/Rocky Mountain National Laboratory and the NCBI; other FOIA releases from Judicial Watch, BuzzFeed, and the Washington Post include NIH funding of the WIV and Dr. Fauci's emails.

I've been trying for quite some time to get people to understand the full scope of the Dr. Fauci ""situation,"" but it's clear that segments of our national leadership are preventing an honest and open inquiry into his actions because they fear the backlash or collateral damage that will result from the tarnishing of their sacred cow. It's time Americans were told the truth: that the grant money sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is merely a footnote in this narrative. After all, Dr. Fauci controls nearly $4 billion of annual grant funding for the NIAID, the institute within the NIH he has directed since 1984. Over 37 years, more than 50,000 research projects have been supported with more than $50 billion (conservatively) of taxpayer funds that have been doled out to them.

It's reasonable to hold him accountable for the results of his organization's efforts, but the direct funding received by the WIV for gain-of-function (GOF) research represents only a tiny fraction of Fauci's involvement in enabling risky research. The 2017 repeal of the GOF ban was decided without the consultation of the Trump administration, even though news coverage during the pandemic blamed him for the decision. Neither Fauci nor his boss, NIH Director Francis Collins, bothered to clarify the record, which looks especially disgusting in the wake of persistent rejections of Sen. Rand Paul's assertions (with accompanying evidence) that the NIH financially supported such research.

First, do no harm … to Fauci's legacy

It's important to plainly state that I'm aware of the intense politicization of virtually every aspect of the pandemic and the pandemic response. Since many readers may not be aware, I'll point out that my specific motivation for building a COVID-19 website (later moved here to Substack) and speaking to a broader audience about the various facets of the pandemic was to offer unfiltered information to counter the disgusting polarization I observed:

I have chosen to offer this website as a forum for information about the current COVID-19 pandemic, in an effort to provide meaningful, factual and useful content during what will continue to be a destabilizing time. There is no indication that our media will soon get better at filling the knowledge void they've created; as a result, confidence in those who deliver our news has hit rock bottom at the exact moment in recent history when we need responsible media the most.



My past experience and current observations lead me to believe that the big picture of the pandemic is poorly understood, and there has been so much conflicting information floating around that it has been very difficult to see what awaits us beyond the immediate horizon. My goal is simply to provide resources so that each of us can approach the coming months with intention – as perspective widens, willpower to overcome circumstance increases. The opposite is also true, in that fear increases when awareness decreases, and in the aftermath of societal upheaval a vacuum appears that will be filled, by one voice or another.



Just as the Native American parable states, courage and fear are interrelated; now is the time to feed courage and starve fear.



My goal is to learn and prepare, because those who expect “normal"" to return are going to be disappointed. The odds of future waves of infection are high, and a lot of changes will have to be made in order to keep the engine running once flu season arrives in the fall. The statistics paint a clear picture, in that the near-simultaneous global response saved millions of lives; it's also clear that applying the same medicine several times will negate the economic prosperity that fuels innovation in medical technology. Being able to see a storm coming is meaningless if all you can do is watch and wait, and America's economy has been even more critical during the last decade of malaise in a majority of the developed world. In particular, the last few years of higher growth gave a bigger cushion to land on, but after witnessing unemployment go from historically low to historically high in six weeks it would be foolish to expect us to fully recover before the re-emergence of a global peak in cases.

I feel obligated to reiterate my stance, because the nature and importance of the situation can't be ignored any longer: Congress is now actively engaged in investigating the pandemic's origins, and we must confront the truth if we are to gain meaningful insight that can help us prepare for future crises. There is no level of partisanship that justifies ignoring a tragedy of this magnitude.

'Everything rises and falls on leadership' — John Maxwell

It's hard to place a dollar value on the impact of Fauci's leadership decisions upon almost all aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is why it's not difficult to understand the willingness of some to avoid a legitimate inquiry into the issue altogether. After all, he sits at the nexus of:

A) The NIH's role in supporting the research and development of mRNA technology and new antiviral drugs like remdesivir, and the resulting conflicts of interestthat the NIH continues to ignore.

B) His role in pushing those NIH-sponsored inventions; specifically, advocating for remdesivir on the basis of weak evidence while rejecting legitimate investigations into generic alternatives with no less statistical support, as well as …

C) … his role in obfuscating concerning data and censoring public debate over the risk/benefit evidence emerging about COVID-19 vaccines. Had Fauci been bluntly honest about the unknowns involving the new technology throughout the pandemic, Americans would still largely have assumed the risk — at least, assuming that antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) was not a likely outcome ... oops.

D) His evolving stances on masking, lockdowns, school closures, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), largely the result of growing public awareness that those decisions have consistently been based upon reducing the accountability of cowardly officials, not the best interest of their constituents. (Note: This is a conclusion from my research focus last year, which I will return to once the origin issue allows me to do so.)

E) His refusal to address the blatant censorship of vaccine side-effect data — it takes a disturbing level of cynicism to witness the large-scale skepticism and uncertainty that has resulted from such censorship and then vilify those willing to speak up and blaming them for any future vaccine breakout, when one of the most likely causes would be ADE. ADE with SARS-CoV-2 would most likely result from the specific targeting of the mRNA vaccines, not vaccine hesitancy (in the absence of a simultaneous global administration of the shots, which was never feasible under the geopolitical and temporal constraints of the pandemic).

Each of those factors has contributed to the fading perception of Fauci as ""America's Doctor,"" but each has also become a divisive litmus test for which the evidence for and against is hotly debated. My purpose here is not to offer judgment on those (self-evident) issues; rather, I want to highlight the fact that Dr. Fauci's legacy includes elements far beyond the scope of my research — and the context of those debates is directly relevant for the proper framing of the failures illuminated here. The same hubris and gaslighting in defense of ""Science"" has plagued every facet of our government's response to COVID-19.

My disgust doesn't stem from casual reflection and an exaggeration of weak assertions to fan partisan flames. It stems from my analysis of 100,000 pages of FOIA documents, 1,000-plus research articles reviewed, and my own published analysis of the impact of Fauci's censorship, which was the first of its kind.

My approach was external to science — from the perspective of a historian seeking to understand the ""why"" behind the further collapse of trust in our institutions during the pandemic. My conclusions were formed over six months of investigation and focused on the realization that one of the worst developments of the pandemic is the evaporation of public trust in scientists (see ""Edifice Wrecks""). I've never sought to inflame conspiracy theories or ignore evidence in support of zoonosis, but I've personally entered into discussions with a half-dozen of the scientists highlighted below, and none of them ever addressed the emerging evidence that, under normal circumstances, would have been part of the open debate that Fauci pretends already took place.

Every additional moment spent in denial and suppression just adds fuel to the coming backlash, and thus far discussions have ignored what I believe is the largest and most consequential elephant in the room:

F) Fauci quietly but directly ensured that scientific censorship was implemented, in large measure to prevent public awareness of the extent of his role in GOF research and the controversies surrounding it. The evidence proves that, at the start of the pandemic, Dr. Fauci and many leading scientists moved to protect themselves — not us, who weren't yet aware of the potential calamity at our doorstep. Fauci led the efforts to obstruct research into COVID's origins, colluding with the president's science adviser Kelvin Droegemeier and Wellcome Trust head Jeremy Farrar, to proactively undermine consideration of the evidence that directly tied their global research initiatives to the lab at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To date, all of their efforts have been focused on preventing disclosure of embarrassing connections — not preventing another novel pathogen from sparking a global pandemic; to prevent future scrutiny, not future tragedy.

Scientists, if you're struggling to understand the distinction between degrees of commitment to truth, I offer the example of Thích Quảng Đức, pictured here protesting the corrupt South Vietnam regime in a prologue to the Vietnam War:

You see, the message for scientists who believe that a threat is existential is that words gain true meaning when they are supported by the actions and sacrifices of the speaker. What message are we supposed to derive from the COVID-19 pandemic?



I'd recommend pausing for reflection — on the image above, specifically — because what the world is beginning to see is that the scientific establishment made a mockery of the trust it had been given. The world's leading experts in virology and public health called attention to a threat by setting the world on fire, rather than themselves — and then blaming us for being too simple to believe their noble lie.

Priorities

The baseline assumption of the public at large has been that Dr. Fauci has earned the benefit of the doubt thanks to his five decades of public service and consistency in defending establishment science — the admiration of which has risen nearly to cult worship in recent decades. The cognitive dissonance between appearance and reality has created a situation where trust in ""Science"" has reached its sacred peak at the exact moment when such trust is least deserved.

At the center of this incestuous arrogance is Dr. Anthony Fauci, the recipient of unquestioned adulation by those in the political sphere who have spent more than a century arguing that a Platonic ""philosopher-king"" ideal must be forced upon intellectually vacuous masses who, left to their own devices, would inevitably self-immolate.

Scientists reached new heights in the ivory tower when they warned us that man's evil nature had left previous generations protected only by the horrific death equation of Mutually Assured Destruction.Setting aside the obvious complicity of scientists in the creation of nuclear weapons, trusting science over many decades has simply led to a new formulation of that Faustian bargain — Mutually Assured Corruption.

A study in scarlet

Before heading down the long and winding road, it's important to explain what zoonosis is and why Fauci's denial of basic facts simply kicks the accountability can down the road. Should we really be surprised that Dr. Fauci is ""confused"" by the definition of ""gain of function""? After all, not that long ago, he also ridiculed the idea that the virus could have come from a lab before finally admitting that it was a statistical possibility.

Zoonosis in the context of viral emergence doesn't mean a virus originally sprang from nature — all viruses do. It means that the jump from animals to humans happened in the wild, as the result of a fortuitous combination of mutations that allow a virus to survive the switch. If human intervention artificially encouraged the process of adaptation by experimentation, or simply by virtue of bringing a virus to a lab and increasing the odds of such exposure, then the origin of a viral pandemic is a lab.

What's sickening about his tortured twisting of language is that Fauci knows this better than almost anyone; thus his lies aren't born of ignorance. What he's done is use his scientific gravitas to pretend that observers' understanding of literal definitions is flawed because we are too ignorant to appreciate the complexity of the issues. The truth, however, is that our generation's most prominent infectious disease expert is gaslighting the citizens of the country he swore an oath to protect (one could also use the term epistemic injustice).

*****

We begin this story on Jan. 31, 2020, on the eve of a four-day stretch that seemingly made true believers out of serious skeptics:

The brief exchange above was a precursor to a conference call the next day, Feb. 1, 2020, organized by Jeremy Farrar and Dr. Fauci for the explicit purpose of addressing the swirling rumors that had emerged following the publication of an Indian pre-print that alleged the discovery of inserts identical to sequence segments within the HIV genome.



As far as sparking the intense reaction, the proof is in the pudding — between the various collections of FOIA emails, the Indian paper and Zero Hedge commentary are explicitly mentioned. The purpose of this meeting was to address several aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that pointed toward an artificial origin, by means of generating adaptive changes through passaging and/or direct manipulation of the genome. Immediately afterward, Baric's 2015 paper was investigated and shared among Fauci, his assistant Hugh Auchincloss, and others.

There's no reason to discuss the meeting's purpose as a hypothetical — the Indian paper proposed a possible method of tweaking, and the Sirotkins' paper and Adrian Bond's arguments, as later magnified via Zero Hedge, discussed the general outline of how the WIV would have approached it, based on published experiments. The assembled experts on the conference call knew this, and they also knew — by Feb. 1, 2020 anyway — that Baric's chimaera and the methods within that paper needed to be compared and considered to determine what to do next. I took it as quite likely that the reference to ""backbone"" directly stems from that paper.

In retrospect, it makes sense for there to be questions about the love child from that 2015 experiment, because the full sequence wasn't added to the article's supplementary files until May 22, 2020 — three months after that conference call. Given that the experiments immediately triggered renewed debate about gain-of-function research, less than a year after the GOF ban began, pretending that repeated corrections (in this case, relatively minor sequence segments) are acceptable for the world's leading coronavirologist publishing a landmark paper in the world's most prestigious journal is stupid.

Also completely obscured is the fact that at least one, and very likely all, of the people on the conference call were aware of the existence of the FCS (furin cleavage site), since Bill Gallaher had pointed it out on Jan. 29, 2020, and Robert Garry reiterated it (just a day before the conference call): see Analysis of Wuhan Coronavirus: Deja Vu - SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus / nCoV-2019 Evolutionary History - Virological. There is some confusion as to whether or not Garry actually made it onto the call, given a comment just prior, but further emails show that Garry's input nonetheless was received by Feb. 2, 2020.

Feb. 2 was also the day that Marion Koopmans mentioned a ""backbone"" and an ""insert.""

Thus, just like Zheng-Li Shi, the Proximals (the five editors of ""The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2,""plus their running mates in the virological community) already knew about the existence of the FCS, certainly by the end of the conference call. If not, then they lied later about ""nothing emerging to change their mind about the possibility of engineering."" Then, they said nothing for two weeks and let Etienne Decroly and Co. break the news. That's pretty s**tty, since the first notions of asymptomatic spread were also arising, and the implications for many scientific disciplines, diplomatic interactions, and public health interventions are profound.

It's even worse when you consider that 18 months later, they still can't explain it — the Proximals refuse to respond to the fact that the FCS doesn't exist within the sarbecovirus sub-genus that SARS-CoV-2 falls under. This is a problem, because members of the sub-genus are too distinct to recombine with the varieties of SARS-like viruses from other branches that do contain the FCS.

In sum, having gone through now 100,000 pages of FOIA emails and all 600-plus articles on my origin-only reference list, I'd be comfortable testifying that:

The Proximals were gathered by Farrar and Fauci explicitly to compare emerging arguments with what was known of Baric's work, the spectrum of experiments conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Whatever specifics they covered that were pulled from the Indian paper and Zero Hedge included elements from Baric's experiments with SHC014. They were nervous about the claims within the Indian paper (even if not tied to HIV per se), even though it had already been pulled — it struck a nerve. They were concerned that unrestrained interest would lead back to them directly. They were concerned about transgenic mice (header for one discussion), the ZH article, the Indian retraction, a backbone, an insert, Baric/Shi's SHC014 love child, and preventing further inquiries into all of them. They almost certainly also knew about the FCS on Feb. 2, 2020, but Garry might never have made it to the conference call, per the emails, so it's possible that (if no one saw the Virological.com posting) this news had to wait until Feb. 3, 2020, when the Proximals were summoned again. Based on continuing conversations, the decision to censor might not have been formally made until Feb. 3, 2020.

Public alarm? No, that's not the emotion they're afraid of.

Why? Because the part that everyone is mostly missing is the far more important aspect of the Baric emails — one that got lost amid their 83,000 pages. The big news last fall was that Peter Daszak, et al., conspired to shape the narrative. Three months later, I found and pointed out that the biggest nugget had been missed. Sadly, it mostly stayed that way even after the Fauci emails, despite my efforts.

The Proximals' Feb. 4, 2020, collusion efforts were spawned by the Feb. 3 OSTP meeting, of which the stated purpose was to combat ""misinformation."" There were obviously still concerns among the Feb. 4 crowd, but they intentionally suppressed them for the OSTP letter. This wasn't their own secret plan — Kelvin Droegemeier, the recipient of said letter, was a speaker at the meeting on Feb. 3, so they weren't obfuscating for him or Fauci or the NASEM presidents in whose name the letter was being written.

That was a quick turnaround — this letter was emailed the morning of Feb. 3, 2020, and the meeting it called for took place that afternoon:

Note: NIAID Director Dr. Fauci coordinated this meeting with Kelvin Droegemeier, the presidential science adviser, and included WMD/PPP expert Chris Hassell and the National Academies' policy director, Alexander Pope.



The meeting's purpose:

In response to a request from OSTP, the NASEM will examine information and identify data requirements that would help determine the origins of 2019-nCoV, specifically from an evolutionary/structural biology standpoint. NASEM will also consider whether this should include more temporally and geographically diverse clinical isolates, sequences, etc. Although a widely-disputed paper posted on a pre-print server last week has since been withdrawn, the response to that paper highlights the need to determine these information needs as quickly as possible. As part of a broader deliberative process, this review will help prepare for future events by establishing a process for quickly assembling subject matter experts for evaluation of other potentially threatening organisms.

The outcome: This group slapped the table on what the narrative was going to be — not what the science indicated. They hid their conflicts of interest from the NSTC and the president; most still continue to fight tooth and nail to suppress that information. This esteemed group of virologists expended more effort and publications in advancing their cover-up than leading the charge against the exploding pandemic, until at least the summer of 2020.



The 2/1 attendees included:

The world's largest public (Fauci) and private (Farrar) grant money distributors, who organized the call; Farrar is also an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. Seemingly no GOF opponents. Nearly all of the major scientists with conflicts of interest related to the WIV who later published zoonosis materials. Francis Ross but no other HHS, DHS, or other executive branch officials. Ron Fouchier, famous for his Spanish Flu concoction.

The 2/3 meeting that decided to censor included:

The policy head of the NASEM academies that controlled fellowship conferral and published ""Science."" Heads of most of the most prestigious virology labs on the planet. The president's science adviser/OSTP head. The HHS science adviser/PPP authority. A mandate to control the narrative.

Therefore, the signal was sent to all scientists that pursuing the lab origins angle meant career death (no academy membership), no funding (via Fauci or Ross or Farrar), no publication in the big four journals during the historic pandemic (NEJM, Science, The Lancet, and Nature — by virtue of their publishing of the tone-setting pieces), no executive patronage for things like generic drugs, etc.

The disparity between peer-reviewed articles and everything else is stark:

If sorted chronologically, the impact from February to May 2020 is even clearer.



It's disgusting, and the extension of that censorship to all Americans just ices the cake.

Edifice Wrecks

I've pondered the contents of the emails that were redacted before release, but I can't imagine what could possibly be redacted that is worth protecting. The West didn't make COVID-19, even if it taught the Chinese how to do major aspects of it. But, these people did decide to lie from the start, then continued to do so after it exploded from 40 deaths to 4 million. It means that they refuse to call a spade a spade even now, and the prospect of China getting off scot-free as a direct result is horrifying. The protection of Fauci is a midterm election decision only, and that means the goal is to drag this out until the electoral damage can be mitigated. Anything that clarifies this to the public negates being worthy of redaction.

The recent congressional appearances by Fauci, however, have shown that he is willing to drag this fight out forever in defense of his legacy, and many politicians are sympathetic to his plight. Thus, it's clear that better questions are needed to build the proper level of awareness among the public to the full implications of Fauci's concerted effort to prevent that same public discourse he claimed to support in 2012. Below are the questions I would lead with, were I appearing at his future hearings.

10 questions for Fauci

1) Where did the buck stop?In 2014, who served as the final approval authority for Baric's pending research, which ultimately allowed it to be grandfathered under the impending GOF ban? Why did the experiment not get forwarded to Chris Hassell's committee for review?

Why did no one notice that the experiment included the use of humanized mice to increase human pathogenicity, which David Relman had asked Ralph Baric about directly in November 2014, when Baric denied any current research interest in that area?

Coincidentally, it was also the research that Zheng-Li Shi was in North Carolina working with Baric on, then immediately returned to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and continued in 2016.

2) Holding Dr. Fauci to his word — In 2012, Dr. Fauci called for an open, public debate on the GOF issue, saying that scientists should justify their research to the broader public any time the risks of such research carried a non-negligible probability of an accident that could affect them. Why then, in 2017, did the NIH rescind the GOF pause — without first engaging the public or its constitutionally elected president/representatives?

3) Secrecy — What did Peter Daszak tell Erik Stemmy and Alan Embry ""off the record"" on Jan. 8, 2020? When did they pass on the contents of that discussion to Dr. Fauci?

4) Redactions — When did you first learn of the existence of the furin cleavage site within the genome of SARS-CoV-2? What were the insert and backbone referred to by Marion Koopmans? Was the insert the FCS? Why were emails with the topic heading ""humanized mice"" redacted?

Let me ""recombine"" these queries into a single thematic question: Why did the world's leading virologists/microbiologists and top American/U.K. officials refrain from releasing their knowledge of the existence of the FCS when they first learned of it? The FCS is so good at increasing pathogenicity that it's the specific insertion typically added by labs worldwide for such experiments. In fact, much has been made of the omission of that specific segment of the genome in the WIV's landmark paper introducing the likely connection between SARS-CoV-2 and its purported predecessor RaTG13.

What possible justification could there have been to ignore the FCS, other than limit discussion during the early phase of their censorship? And what effect might that have had on our doctors' ability to characterize the virus?

5) Silence — Why did Victor Dzau and the other two academy presidents of NASEM ultimately remove the forceful pro-zoonotic statements inserted by Daszak et al. from the final version of their public letter to the OSTP? What reservations justified that decision, and why did they not speak out when censorship prevented the doubts of others from being published?

6) Selective Inclusion — Why was Robert Kadlec, the HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response, not included in any correspondence with Jeremy Farrar or your gathered audience of world-renowned virologists? His deputy is the chair of the PPP oversight panel and he is an expert on C-WMD and biological weapons. The existence of any doubt in the possibility of a zoonotic source (doubts which you harbored) should've made his inclusion mandatory.

Instead, you shaped the information provided to those outside the scientific community.

7) Why were you and Francis Collins the only U.S. officials involved in the Feb. 1, 2020, conference call?

8) Subversion — Did you, Collins, or Droegemeier alert Matt Pottinger, Robert Redfield, President Donald Trump, or any member of the National Security Council to the substance of the Feb. 1, 2020, conference call, or the decision-making over the next three days that led to an unannounced censorship of non-natural origin hypothesis for the origin of SARS-CoV-2? Why not?

9) Diverging Narratives — Jeremy Farrar's experts decided on natural origins of COVID-19 on March 17, 2020? So, Fauci and the presidential science adviser lied to us and President Trump in the OSTP letter on Feb. 7, 2020? And in ""Proximal,"" on Feb. 16, 2020, written by your future dream team? What was the basis of the Feb. 4, 2020, decision to reject a lab-leak origin and produce ""Proximal Origin"" — if no additional evidence was added to the Feb. 16 version prior to its March 17, 2020, online appearance in Nature?

Both Fauci and Farrar explained the general makeup and purpose of a ""group of experts"":

By this point on Feb. 13, 2020, 10 days had passed since the ""Proximals"" and Fauci had held a second conclave, this time with the OSTP director, that was followed directly by a flurry of peer-reviewed letter, articles, and ""collaboration"" (collusion) to smother the scientific community with pro-zoonotic propaganda.



10) Prove It — Which evidence, specifically, led to the Proximals' reversal from Feb. 1, 2020, to Feb. 4, 2020? The arguments made in the following weeks were pathetically unsubstantiated. If stronger evidence exists, why wouldn't it have been shown?

The answer, of course, is that the driving force behind the shift had nothing to do with the quality or quantity of the supporting evidence.

Paved by good intentions

The only proper action for Dr. Fauci to take at this point is to resign immediately and apologize for prioritizing the suppression of embarrassing and extensive conflicts of interest, double standards, and political decisions masked as sound policy. Ideally, such a statement would include a call for the retraction of ""Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2,"" one of the most-read (and potentially most impactful) pieces of scientific propaganda published in at least a generation. Each of its five authors intentionally framed the COVID origin debate around ""evidence"" and ""facts"" that they couldn't prove and a finality of their conclusions that the known facts couldn't justify.

These actions are independent of the ultimate answer to the origin question, because the failures of leadership I've described are ethically and morally indefensible, regardless of China's guilt or innocence in the sparking of the pandemic. Any remaining shreds of credibility left in the public's perception of scientists must be salvaged by new leaders who are willing to do what needs to be done to clean the Augean Stables.

Sufficient evidence already exists for Congress to do the right thing moving forward. Given the enormity of the failures — and of the efforts to hide, censor, and destroy the credibility of anyone who spoke out against lockdowns, vaccines, masks, generic drugs, mRNA efficacy versus risks, and the curtailment of numerous constitutional/human rights in the last 18 months — it will take historic leadership to honestly converse with a righteously indignant citizenry (in the U.S. and everywhere else). We must accept that our current representatives have proven manifestly unqualified to assume such leadership — in the last six months, censorship has been expanding, not receding.

The COVID-19 pandemic has manifestly proven that there is no lie so ""noble"" that it overrides the rights and wisdom of a free and informed public. That doesn't mean that the public will inherently do better.

It's just acknowledging the inescapable conclusion — that we can't possibly do worse.

"Yes, Virginia: Hitler really was a socialist","Much hay has been made of late regarding a decades-old debate as to whether Adolf Hitler and the Nazis were socialists.

On the face of it, the argument may seem ridiculous. … After all, the name of the party was National Socialist German Workers' Party. For some, it should be as simple as that. They called themselves socialists, so they were socialists.

However, proponents of the idea that Hitler and the Nazis were diametrically opposed to socialism point out numerous reasons that this simple explanation is, by itself, insufficient, and in fact can point out several facts, which clearly demonstrate that the Nazis were socialist in name only, but not in ideology.

As is generally (and gloriously) true, the truth behind this debate is extremely nuanced and takes effort to discover. But it is very clearly there.

For those of you looking for the Cliff's Notes version, here is the answer: Yes, Hitler and the Nazis were socialists, for the simple reasons that they were staunchly anti-capitalist and believed that the means of production in their society should be controlled by a centralized state power. That is very clear from their writings, their words and their actions. Done and done.

Now, for those of you looking for a more complete and nuanced analysis of the topic, please consider the following thoughts:

With a recent article in Vox as case-in-point, those who believe that Hitler and the Nazis were not socialists will generally put forward some version of the following arguments:

1. The Nazis did not preach or practice pure, ""classical"" socialism, so they weren't socialists.

2. The Nazis were not the true Socialist party in Germany — there were already socialist and communist political parties in Germany — when they adopted the term ""socialism.""

3. The Nazis were fascists, not socialists. Everyone knows fascism is right wing, socialism is left wing.

4. The Nazis only adopted the title of ""socialist"" for political reasons, not ideological ones.

5. The Nazis were staunchly anti-communist and anti-Marxist, therefore they couldn't have been socialists.

6. The Nazis were racists and nationalists, so they couldn't have been socialists.

7. The Nazis did not seize all private property and money, so they weren't socialists.

8. Hitler was only interested in power, in being a dictator, not in socialist principals of peace and love and equality…

I'll address each of these in turn, but the above arguments and themes all miss a central and critical reality … and demonstrates a lack of critical thinking as well.

What's missing from the simple question of ""Was Hitler a socialist?"" is this: When do you mean?

It's a vital component of any coherent discussion, for two reasons.

First, because when examined over a timeline it becomes perfectly clear that yes, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party was an extremely, very clearly socialist-aligned organization at the time of their founding. One could argue that over time the specific manifestation of Nazi-socialism did drift away from what is today viewed as ""classical""' or archetypal socialism (also a misnomer, which I'll cover shortly) and toward a nationalistic, ""Germanified"" socialism. During the build-up to war, it then morphed further into economic-statist policies of fascism and eventually a fascist-dictatorship.

Second, it's vital to note the shift and migration ""from"" socialism ""to"" a dictatorship because this is almost always what ends up happening when socialism, communism and/or Marxism implemented in any country (as evidenced by Germany's Hitler, the Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin, China's Mao Zedong, Cuba's Fidel Castro, Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, etc).

Marxist-collectivist systems devolving into brutal dictatorship with some elements of Marxist-philosophy remaining is the norm, not the exception. I'll leave what that says about Marxism to your own judgment.

So, with that said, let's start at the very beginning (a very good place to start), and review the historical record:

1. The Nazis did not preach or practice pure, ""classical"" socialism, so they weren't socialists.

Statements like this one are generally followed with quotes from Hitler or some other Nazi leader saying something negative about socialism, or examples of a policy like leaving most manufacturing in private hands as proof that the Nazi Party wasn't a socialist organization. But generally, those quotes and those policies were from much later in the Nazi-Germany saga.

What is conveniently ignored is the fact that Hitler joined the German Workers' Party in 1919, when he was 30 years old. Six years before he wrote ""Mein Kampf,"" and 14 years before he was appointed chancellor of Germany.

So, at the time the political party was formed, what did it espouse and believe? And what did Hitler espouse and believe?

History is abundantly clear on this. As we know from ""The Coming of the Third Reich""by Richard J. Evans, we know because Hitler joined the German Workers' Party, a party he'd initially been ordered to spy on and join by his Germany Army Intelligence handlers. It's key to note that the original name of the group was the German Socialist Worker's Party (italics mine), but party-supporter and journalist Karl Herrer recommended against including the word ""socialist"" because it might be confused with another local political party (the Social Democratic Party of Germany) and might make it more challenging to gain the support of his middle-class newspaper subscribers. Subsequently, the name was shortened to German Workers' Party. Author F.L. Carlsten makes that clear in his book, ""The Rise of Fascism.""

Hitler joined the party and within a few months had risen to a level of authority. Having spoken publicly for the first time at a party meeting just weeks after joining, by early 1920 he was appointed chief of propaganda, a period of party history covered in excellent detail in ""The Rise and Fall of Nazi Germany"" by T.L. Jarman.

As the party grew in prominence, Hitler believed they needed a public manifesto that clearly articulated the party's political beliefs and platform. He, along with party founders Gottfried Feder, Dietrich Eckart, and Anton Drexler, wrote a manifesto titled, The National Socialist Program. As explained in William Shirer's seminal, ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich""(a work every American should read), on that same day, the German Workers' Party changed its name to the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Hitler arranged a public meeting at a large Beer-Hall and personally read the manifesto aloud to more than 2,000 attendees, receiving ever increasing applause as he continued.

You can review the entire 25-point plan here, and yes, it is a platform that is filled with anti-Semitic and nationalist themes, but a review of several of the key points of the manifesto are important to understand their political beliefs as they orient around socialist and Marxist philosophy.

""…We demand that the state be charged first with providing the opportunity for a livelihood and way of life for the citizens…""

""…The first obligation of every citizen must be to productively work, mentally or physically...""

""…The activity of individuals is not to counteract the interests of the universality [the state], but must have its result within the framework of the whole for the benefit of all..."" [italics mine]

""…We demand the Breaking of debt (interest)-slavery…""

""…In consideration of the monstrous sacrifice in property and blood that each war demands of the people, personal enrichment through a war must be designated as a crime against the people. Therefore, we demand the total confiscation of all war profits…""

""…We demand the nationalisation of all (previous) associated industries..."" [italics mine]

""…We demand a division of profits of all heavy industries…""

""…We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare…""

""…We demand the creation of a healthy middle class and its conservation…""

""…We demand the immediate communalization of the great warehouses and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in contracts with the State, county or municipality…""

""…We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, usurers, profiteers and so forth are to be punished with death…"" [italics mine]

""…We demand substitution of a German common law in place of the [existing] Roman Law serving a materialistic world-order…""

""…The state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national education program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education…""

""…The comprehension of the concept of the state must be striven for by the school as early as the beginning of understanding…""

""…We demand the education at the expense of the state of outstanding intellectually gifted children of poor parents without consideration of position or profession…""

""…The state is to care for the national health by protecting the mother and child, by outlawing child-labor, by the encouragement of physical fitness, by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young…""

""…We demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the press… Publications which are counter to the general good are to be forbidden… We demand legal prosecution of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life and the closure of organizations opposing the above made demands…""

""…a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within on the framework: ""THE GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY BEFORE THE GOOD OF THE INDIVIDUAL."" [All CAPS theirs in the original document]

""…For the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power… Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general…""

""…The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary by sacrificing their own lives, to support by the execution of the points set forth above without consideration…""

I apologize for the length here, but this was their ""Declaration of Independence"", and the length to which they spoke of these beliefs is strong evidence of how important these ideals were to them and their platform. That Hitler would dedicate the bulk of his written manifesto for his party to these indicates they were more than just a convenient political tool.

It's also worth noting that according to the US Holocaust Museum, the National Socialist Program remained the platform of the Nazi Party until Hitler's suicide in 1945, although clearly some of the specific tenets were ignored as the Third Reich matured and entered its ""war"" phase. In fact, we know from Big Business & Hitler, in 1924, party co-founder Gottfried Feder proposed an expanded 39-point plan that would include accommodation for Industrialists and large landowners with the National Socialists, but at the 1925 Bamburg Conference, then party leader Hitler refused to make any changes, stating that the manifesto was ""inviolable"" and would never be changed. Even after coming to power and declaring himself Dictator for Life, Hitler never modified a single word.

The point is that the original German Workers' Party as well as the National Socialist German Workers' Party, from its earliest roots, absolutely believed in and ran on many traditionally ""Socialist"" ideals, such as subordinating the individual to the ""common good"" and ""the State.""

Arguments as to whether the Nazi Party was ""right wing"" or ""left wing"" is what confuses most modern pundits and scholars. They clearly were nationalists, socialists, anti-capitalists and statists. Placing them on modern ""right vs. left"" political spectrum is an entirely different debate, and largely a semantic one. Whether they have more in common with the modern U.S. ""right"" or ""left"" is in the eye of the beholder.

2. The Nazis were not the true socialist party in Germany, there were already socialist and communist political parties in Germany when they adopted the term ""socialism.""

It's completely true that there were already socialist and communist political parties in Germany. Socialist parties had sprung up and gained popularity in Europe both before and during World War I. Russia had collapsed into a communist revolution during World War I, and there were communist political parties and organizations throughout Germany and Austria who had proven, friendly ties to the Russian communist parties responsible for the Russian revolution.

But the presence of other parties does not in any way indicate that Hitler's party wasn't also socialist. Just as today in America there are democratic socialists, socialist, Green Party and Communist parties, does not mean that I couldn't start up a new flavor of socialist political party tomorrow.

What is clear is that the founders of the Nazi Party did want a very different type of political party, one that was highly nationalist and one that sought an ethno-German racial ideal. In fact, as detailed in the already cited ""The Rise and Fall of Fascism,"" the reason that Anton Drexler and others founded the National Socialist German Workers' Party in the first place was their rejection of the existing Social-Democratic Party and Communist Party's lack of nationalism. Hitler's flavor of socialism was staunchly anti-Bolshevik and anti-Semitic and he spoke against ""Jewish-Marxism"" and communism, as did key party leaders Alfred Rosenberg and Rudolph Hess. Existing socialist and Marxist parties were too globalist for them – they were after a purely ethno-German socialism.

3. The Nazis were fascists, not socialists. Everyone knows fascism is right wing, socialism is left wing.

Without turning this into a purely semantic debate, applying the modern ""U.S.-centric"" idea of the right vs. left political spectrum to political, economic and social philosophies such as socialism or fascism is truly an apples vs. Legos idea.

Of course, the origins of ""right"" vs. ""left"" political spectrum likely dates to the French Revolution and had to do with which side of the King's throne courtiers and lords were seated. At that time, those Loyal to the King were on the ""right"" and those who favored the people's independence and Democracy would be on the ""left"" …but clearly today's modern conservatives and libertarians would not support rule by a monarch or dictator, whether his name was Louis, Washington or Trump.

This is a key part of why there is so much cognitive dissonance for today's self-avowed socialists when someone dares to point out that Nazis were socialists and did support many socialist ideals. Nazis were also nationalists, were anti-immigration, often xenophobic and pro-militarism. Those are traits they associate with today's modern far-right.

As Jane Carlson points out in her recent Vox article, trying to put German-Nazis of 1930 on our modern U.S. political spectrum is a troublesome exercise. For our purposes, we'll simply note that the policies and platform of the early Nazi Party clearly aligned to socialist theory of the time, simply modified to fit the Volkish German tastes of the time.

Furthermore, claims that Hitler and the Nazis were fascists, not socialists, is again an inherently anachronistic view of events. It also clouds the issue of fascism and socialism, painting them as polar opposites on the political spectrum, when, in fact, they were close bedfellows in the 1920s.

Fascism didn't come to the Nazi Party and Germany until late in the 1920s or even early 1930s. Certainly there are no contemporary media references to the National Socialist German Workers' Party as ""fascists"" during the era of the party's founding in 1919, at the time Hitler wrote and presented the National Socialist Program in 1920, leading up to the Beer-Hall Putsch in late 1923, during Hitler's incarceration in 1924 and even leading up to the elections of 1928 and 1930.

During that entire era, no paper, across all of Germany, Italy, England or America can be found that refers to Hitler or to the National Socialist party of Germany as a ""fascist"" party. They were referred to as the national socialists or Nazis, a name meant to be a pejorative. It's also noteworthy that in his book, ""Mein Kampf,"" Hitler did not refer to himself as a fascist or even use the word a single time.

It wasn't truly until the elections of 1932 that ""fascism"" could truly be applied to the policies espoused by Hitler and other Nazi politicians who held seats in the German Parliament. By then, it had been nearly a decade since Benito Mussolini, the publisher of a Socialist newspaper for more than six years, founded his own version of a violent nationalist-socialist party within Italy: fascism.

Fascist political ideology was the brainchild of another Marxist, a man named Giovanni Gentile. Gentile was an Italian intellectual and student of Marx, but whose criticism of the standard socialist model was based on the idea that the human mind was insufficiently pure to make communal socialism practical for industrial countries. As such, he advocated for a hybrid of a strong-centralized government with total authority (lead by intellectuals and experts) but leaving direct ownership of industrial production in the hands of the business elite. A Socialist-Corporate state.

Mussolini had seen in World War I, his countrymen were no longer fighting for some grand, socialist utopia as they had been toward the outset of the war. By the end of the war, they were fighting for their country. Under the tutelage of Gentile, he morphed that nationalist passion into fascism, but it was not a far-right movement. Mussolini referred to himself as a socialist in his own diary just 12 days before his capture, and it's worth noting that the party he was head of at the time of his capture was called the Italian Social Republic.

Hitler, seeing the success of Mussolini in Italy in the 1920s and wishing to curry favor with the Italian leader to help reinforce his southern flank, developed a warm and open relationship with him. By the time Hitler had been named chancellor in 1933 and dictator in 1934, it would have been fair to start thinking of Nazis as having fascist ideas. But even as late as 1937, Winston Churchill was still making speeches and writing essays about the ""two"" great ""creeds of the Devil"" in socialism and fascism, as threats faced by Britain.

The real difference between communists, national socialists and fascists is simply this: Communists are the international workers party and fascists are the national workers party.

In the end, it's reasonable to look at Hitler's adoption of some tenets of the fascist political-economic system of an authoritarian-central government but leaving private ownership of some industries as an indication that Hitler was not, in the end, a ""perfect"" socialist. But, as you'll learn below, that notion is itself, nonsense.

4. The Nazis only adopted the title of ""socialist"" for political reasons, not ideological ones.

As we have already cited from Carlsten's ""The Rise of Fascism,"" the opposite is actually true. Anton Drexler had originally wanted to include socialist in the party's title, but its primary ""publicist"" at the time, Karl Herrer, had objected — not because they were opposed to socialist ideas, but because it would make it difficult to stand apart from the already existent Social-Democratic Party, and because it would make it more difficult to appeal to middle class readers of his newspaper.

In fact, as author Robert Spector covers thoroughly in his book, ""A World Without Civilization,"" Drexler and others went out of their way to publish articles clearly delineating between Marxist-socialism and the German-socialism they intended to create, which would be a massive social-welfare state that would provide aid only to true ethno-Aryan Germans.

The ideals of the Nazi leadership were absolutely and significantly focused on German nationalism, anti-Semitism, racial purity, etc. It's also fair to say that Hitler's personal ideology and goals were built around German-idealized delusions of grandeur, and less around the philosophical tenets of socialism.

But a fair assessment of the progression of Nazi Party socialist doctrine cannot start in 1933 when Hitler became chancellor or 1938 when he invaded Poland. A more fair assessment might to be say that Hitler and the Nazis wanted to create a 1,000-year German Reich and a pure ethno-German race, and they were also socialists. More pure socialists when they started in 1919 than when they finished in 1945? Yes, certainly if our goal here is to measure Hitler against some 'perfect socialist' yardstick, then it might be fair to suggest that, by the end, he was less of a socialist than he was at the beginning.

But as I've already pointed out, the same could be said for virtually every socialist leader of all time. They all started with grand socialist ideals, tried them out, found that they didn't seem to work to achieve any practical real-world goals, so instead they became a tyrannical dictator wielding violence, torture and autocratic rule to maintain their vision. Ask Mao, ask Stalin, ask Maduro, Ask Xi, ask Castro, ask Che, ask Minh, ask Lenin…Hitler was just a me-too.

5. The Nazis were staunchly anti-Communist and anti-Marxist, therefore they couldn't have been socialists.

The idea that being anti-communist or anti-Marxist indicates one couldn't be a socialist is an anachronism, especially for post-Great War Germany. Let's not forget that Russia and Germany had fought ferociously during the war, including clashes before and after the communist revolution. Many Germans strongly blamed Germany's surrender at the end of World War I on communist sympathizers and/or spies within Germany, especially Marxist-Jewish political leaders, intellectuals and writers.

Leaders of the early Nazi Party, in particular, viewed the Treaty of Versailles not so much as a surrender to Western powers but as a surrender to international ""Jewry"", both the capitalist-Jews from America and England as well as the communist Jews from Russia. As Shirer points out in ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"" Hitler and other Nazi leaders frequently referred to being ""stabbed in the back"" by communist-Jewish elements in Germany and Austria.

As such, as we learned from Roger Griffin's epic work ""Fascism,"" the anti-Marxism present in the early Nazi Party was strongly anti-Bolshevik, or, said more plainly, it was ""anti-Jewish Russians and Germans who betrayed at the end of World War I and who profited from the war.""

Recall as well that communism is merely one manifestation of Marxist political philosophy … one that could progress out of a Socialist foundation. Even today, communists and socialists can have lively debates on the topic, one rejecting or point out logical flaws in the ""purity"" of the other on the scale of Karl Marx's idea of ""perfect"" socialism. (Marx never really had such an ideal, see below).

The point is, the fact that Hitler was feverishly and passionately anti-Marxist (because he was massively anti-Semitic) and anti-communist doesn't indicate he wasn't some form of socialist.

6. The Nazis were racists and nationalists, so they couldn't have been socialists.

I would have hoped I didn't have to go too deeply into this topic, but many people seem to make some form of this argument.

The disconnect here is that most people today associate left-leaning or socialist-aligned politics to be also ""globalist,"" for open borders and pro-immigration. On the other hand, many people associate right-leaning and even ""conservative"" groups with anti-illegal-immigration and ""America-first"" policies.

Again, let's not start a semantic debate about modern policies of those on the right vs. those on the left and whether one or the other group is more or less racist than the other (let's do that on Twitter instead!); for our purposes here, what is key to point out is that Marx himself was a fairly racist bloke, who wrote an essay in 1844 titled, ""The Jewish Question"" (wonder where Hitler got that?):

""What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money. … Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist. Money degrades all the gods of man—and turns them into commodities. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange…The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant, of the man of money in general."" — Karl Marx, The Jewish Question, 1844

In a letter to co-creator of Socialist doctrine, Friedrich Engels, Marx wrote:

""It is now completely clear to me that he, as is proved by his cranial formation and his hair, descends from the Negroes who had joined Moses' exodus from Egypt, assuming that his mother or grandmother on the paternal side had not interbred with a n—–. Now this union of Judaism and Germanism with a basic Negro substance must produce a peculiar product."" — Karl Marx, Letter to Friedrich Engels, 1856

Many seem to believe that today's democratic socialism is inherently and not racist universally (unless perhaps, you happen to be a Jew … or maybe a white male, at least in some of the more vehement circles), so the fact of Nazi racism demonstrates simply that they could not have been socialists. But the socialism of the Nazi era was generally not-free of the every-day racism that was pervasive throughout that era.

To be sure, the Nazis were perhaps the most racist, anti-Semitic socialists who ever existed, but their racism, just like their nationalism, doesn't erase their socialism.

Furthermore, while socialism is not inherently racist, socialism and racism have been happy bedfellows numerous times.

One of the key and so-often-present-it-seems-to-be-required components of socialist movements is the presence of a bogeyman. An enemy of the people, or, in the case of Germany, the ""volk.""

In today's Americanized version of socialism, the bogeyman is the Gordon Gekko from ""Wall Street,""Oh, wait, we have a more modern caricature of the same profile: Donald Trump. A self-made, unapologetic billionaire capitalist, flaunting both his wealth and ego across every TV screen and Twitter-feed 24/7.

For today's democratic socialist, that is the bogeyman. The rich (generally white) capitalist male who has more than his neighbor and doesn't feel bad about that.

Hitler's bogeyman was also a banker — the Jew. Anti-Semitism and versions of socialism have often gone together because of the anti-capitalist and anti-wealthy-person ethos at the heart of Marxist ideology. Because Jews have tended to be industrious and have accumulated wealth, the Jewish people have been hated by many socialist and fascist groups throughout history. Socialist and totalitarian regimes in the Middle East also hated Jews, long before the founding of Israel after World War II.

In fact, after meeting with Hitler in the 1940s, Muslim regimes in Turkey and Syria planned on building Polish-styled death camps in the Middle East. During the war, Hitler also invited the creation of an entire Muslim division of Waffen-SS, such was the alliance between Islamic-Marxism and the National Socialists, all oriented around the anti-Capitalism and anti-Semitic ideals of Marxism.

As Richard Pipes detailed in ""Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime,"" Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin also implemented anti-Jewish (themed as anti-capitalist) programs in Russia and the USSR after the Communist revolution. Lenin ordered the Jews to be sent to the front lines of combat in battle, and ordered that no Jew should be given high-ranking administrative positions in government, as was detailed in ""Time of Darkness: Moscow""by the great Russian political reformer and historian, Alexander Nikolayevich Yakovlev.

The argument that it is fascism that was the birth of Hitler's anti-Semitism also fails to hold water. Mussolini founded the fascist movement in Italy and had seized control of the Italian government well before Hitler's SS had started harassing Jews, but Mussolini protected Jews in Italy from persecution (as long as they swore political loyalty to him), until much later after his country was under Allied attack and he had to beg Hitler for German troops to fight off the Allied advance.

To this day, even in America, democratic socialists struggle with elements of anti-Semitism in their own ranks, because Jews are still being accused of hypnotizing the world via money by democratic socialist members of the U.S. Congress.

No, socialism is not inherently and always racist. But neither is socialism free from racist ideology, if that racist ideology serves as a bogeyman, any enemy of ""the people"" who is preventing the utopia of equality. Hitler's enemy of the ""volk"" was the capitalist, banker Jew, sucking the life out of his precious Fatherland. For freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), it's the un-woke white male, driving an SUV and drinking single-malt while hunting deer from a tree stand, making the world unsafe for women, children and minorities. Both were self-ascribed socialists. Both racist, too.

Racism isn't always about ""race"" either. The point is about dehumanization as a means to classify the enemies of ""The People."" In addition to murdering six million Jews, the Nazis killed additional millions of gypsies, homosexuals, blacks, Christians and Slovaks. Hitler and the Nazis used dehumanizing language to describe all of them… . Jews just happened to be his favorite target. But the techniques used by socialist were universal. Marx referred to capitalists or the bourgeoisie as ""parasites"" over 120 times in books, essays and speeches.

As recently as this past year, National of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan referred to Jews as ""termites""… although luckily Chelsea Clinton was kind enough to write an article for the online progressive magazine, ""Forward,"" politely correcting him and implying, emphatically, she'd never met a Jewish termite.

Today's democratic socialists are using the same techniques. How many times have Trump supporters been called ""sub-human"" or a ""Basket of Deplorables""? Marxism requires an enemy of the people, but when push comes to shove, people don't like to kill other people. So, the enemies must be made sub-human in order to justify the ""purging"" and ""liquidation"" that must necessarily follow. What will Sen. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez do when wealthy, white males won't go along with their gun and SUV confiscation schemes required under their green-collectivist state? The Weather Underground boldly let us know back in the 1970s, when they issued a news release claiming that in order to bring justice to the U.S., up to 25 million white people would have to die.

Today, the Chinese Communist Party is rounding up Christians, Muslims and Uigars, placing them in concentration camps and re-education camps. More than 35 percent of the current Chinese population has been relegated to digital and travel-restricted ghettos, because their social-trust score is below Communist Party standards. Hitler had to go through the trouble of rounding Jews up and moving them into ghettos. Today, Chinese leader Xi Jinping does it with the help of Facebook and Google.

All part of creating the socialist utopia Marx dreamed would destroy the unfair inequality of capitalism.

Dozens of classical stars of the socialist firmament were ardent racists. Margaret Sanger, socialist and anti-black advocate…sorry, pro-black-abortion advocate. Bernard Shaw, famous socialist, was first to dream up and write about using gas chambers to 'gently, humanely' remove those societies that was determined to no longer have a productive use. ""Sir or madame, please kindly justify your existence."" Both Shaw and Sanger are still widely studied and celebrated by socialists today.

Perhaps a final lesson here can be learned by examining the ideology of Richard Spencer, self-proclaimed racist and white supremacist, and therefore branded by the media and political elite as a right-wing extremist. However, Spencer also rejects the U.S. Constitution, is pro-universal health care and pro-free (segregated) college education, and in favor of government-funded abortions. Most of the National Socialist program themes Hitler wrote about, he'd embrace in total. And he's a right-wing extremist? Take away just his virulent racism, he'd be a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, espousing purely leftist ideologies.

Hopefully you are getting the wider picture. Socialism doesn't guarantee racism, but neither does it offer any sort of protection from it. To claim otherwise is willful blindness to history.

7. The Nazis did not seize all private property and money, so they weren't socialists.

Again, it's vital to review the overall timeline of Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party from the early and perhaps idealistic days of 1919 all the way through the fall of the Third Reich in 1945. For most of the 1920s, Hitler and the Nazis held little by way of political power through which they could have seized anybody's property, but that doesn't mean they didn't advocate for doing so, first in their National Socialists program cited extensively above, but numerous times after that. They did, after all, seize substantial privately owned property in Germany as well as conquered lands, including thousands of businesses, farms and bank accounts.

The fact that they focused first on Jewish businesses is irrelevant to the fact that private property was seized and transferred to the ownership of the state. The fact that Jewish property was at the top of the list of whom to target doesn't make it less Marxist or socialist to do, any more than it would be less socialist to target rich white males, as is currently being proposed by Bernie Sanders and others on the far left. Who you're targeting for confiscation schemes should be a moot point.

It's key to recall who Hitler and the Nazis were. They were socialists by way of economic policies, but staunchly nationalist and staunchly anti-Semitic racists who believed in a German super-race that could only be realized by way of physically purging inferior peoples and blood and by ""reclaiming"" lands stolen from their rightful Aryan-ancestors. Eric Kurlander powerfully and skillfully provided that history in ""Hitler's Monsters,"" another book every American should read to fully understand the Nazi era.

It is true that once the Nazis came to power and started down their twin paths of political dominance within Germany and military conflict with external forces, Hitler's pragmatic side certainly overwhelmed any traditional or ""classic"" socialist ideals he may have once held. Surely after the powerful success he'd seen Mussolini seemingly achieve in Italy under fascism, the idea of communal socialism wouldn't have seemed the most efficient way for him to achieve his vision of a blood-pure and massive German super-state.

Note that the Nazis did nationalize dozens of industries and, by law, did have total centralized-control over the means of production … business owners and manufacturers had ownership of their property and factories in name only once the Waffen-SS and stormtroopers were fully in power. So, in his own way, Hitler did achieve Karl Marx-vision of control over the means of production by an all-powerful state. For Hitler, that state was simply imbued in him, instead of in a democratically elected central committee. Hitler's rejection of the authorities of labor unions or of workers' councils shouldn't, then, be viewed as anti-socialist. … Hitler was not in favor of giving any other person or group any authority over his own. Coincidentally, President Xi of China just recently declared himself dictator for life. History seems to love to recycle these themes, no?

Hitler was a pragmatist. He saw the favor of the German aristocracy and wealthy manufacturers (if they were not Jewish) as key to achieving his vision for the Third Reich. The fact that this meant not being a ""perfect"" socialist may have occurred to some, but certainly not to him.

8. Hitler was only interested in power, in being a dictator, not in socialist principals of peace and love and equality.

Before I dispense with the peace and love and equality BS … look, a study of Marx is a study about inequality! Marx was a racist, class-warfare-monger whom the average democratic socialist in America today would wholly reject from their social circles and political party.

So, I won't argue this last one, it's just beyond discussion. Socialism isn't nice and peaceful and filled with love and equality. Just stop it. Please pick up a history book and get back to me when you're ready to have a real conversation.

Yet, one final point should be made:

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS PERFECT ""MARXIST"" SOCIALISM!!

From the time Marx wrote ""The Communist Manifesto"" in the 1850s until his death in 1883, Marx never once espoused any version of ""perfect"" Socialism. As socialist professor Philip Gasper pointed out quite correctly in his 2005 book, ""The Communist Manifesto: A Roadmap to the World's Most Important Political Document"":

""Marx and Engels never speculated on the detailed organization of a future socialist or communist society. The key task for them was building a movement to overthrow capitalism. If and when that movement was successful, it would be up to the members of the new society to decide democratically how it was to be organized, in the concrete historical circumstances in which they found themselves.""

So, for Karl Marx, the ""father"" of socialism, there is no thing as perfect, idealized, ""do it this way or you're not a socialist"" socialism.

The primary goal was building a movement to overthrow capitalism. In that Hitler and the Nazis viewed Jewry as capitalistic (as did Marx), it's very likely that Marx would have found them to be wonderfully and perfectly socialist. He did exactly what Marx advised: Take what you got and organize your own brand of socialism against the ""concrete historical circumstances"" in which they found themselves.

The very statement that ""Hitler was not a socialist"" by some imaginary perfect socialist checklist is itself a ludicrous notion. Marx never created one, it's only via the magic of a modern veil of anachronistic imagination that one can create such a yardstick by which to make such a claim. And so, we're back where we started, according to Marx himself: The Nazis, including Adolf Hitler, called themselves Socialists. The claimed an all-powerful centralized state power as having authority over the means of production. As such, they were socialists, by Marx' own definition.

In the end, the story follows the Occam's Razor theorem to the ""T""…

A younger and idealistic Hitler returning from the Great War believed in and espoused many socialist ideas and political ideals and got together with a bunch of other young people also espousing socialist ideas. As he grew older and gained more political power, he found that those socialist ideas weren't much use when it was time to actually accomplish anything in the real world, so he did what all socialist rulers eventually do — he claimed power by force and used violence to try to achieve his political ends, killing millions of people along the way, all the while still calling himself a socialist. And Marx slept soundly in his grave.

Socialism is the building block that undergirds all forms of modern totalitarianism. But it should never be confused with a large welfare-state safety net. Charity and safety nets can be and should be created for those who cannot fully take care of themselves. As individuals, we have a responsibility to take care of and protect the weakest among us. If we fail to do this we revert back to the laws of the jungle, that leaves its weakest behind for the good of the ""pride."" Safety nets when done right are uniquely human and humane as still look to help individual.

The human ""pride"" knows that what ennobles man is that we refuse to leave the weakest behind to be eaten and we certainly could not call ourselves a noble species if our stated goal was to not only leave the weak behind, but to set out to purposely kill any group deemed ""inferior"" or slowing the pack down. A true safety net empowers anyone that has been kicked to the ground to stand back up. It gives them a hand up as an individual — while they regain their footing.

Socialism at its root is and always must be about the collective. Collective ""injustice"" in all of its forms. In opposition to a ""safety net"" for individuals, socialism looks for ""groups"" of victims and groups of villains. Socialism is at its heart a system that dismisses rights of the one for the gain of the many. Once those the in-group deems vermin, cockroaches, greedy, privileged or problems — anything is justifiable to provide ""social justice"" to the collective.

In western society, traditional western liberalism stand against the collective mob and as a protector of the individual. Once one understands why socialism is defined as a ""stepping stone,"" you will begin to understand why the story usually ends in mass graves of enemies or starvation. Create a collective at the expense of the individual and it becomes a playground for those who seek power and riches at any cost, justifying every evil they commit in the name of the collective they are supposedly defending.

So yes, Virginia, Hitler really was a socialist. Tragically, a very successful one.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/the-jordan-peterson-war-continues,2019-04-05
Liberals don't think of 'second- and third-order effects': Dan Crenshaw warns against withdrawing troops from Syria,"On ""America with Eric Bolling"" Tuesday, Eric sat down with Congressman Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) to discuss whether we should end U.S. involvement in Syria and bring our military troops home.

Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL, stressed the importance of weighing all the consequences of withdrawing U.S. forces from the region. He also warned against the temptation to just do what ""feels good.""

""Mission success, every single day, is [to] not [have] another 9/11. That's what people need to understand,"" Crenshaw said.

""We're thinking about the consequences of withdrawal,"" he added. ""In any decision that we make, especially with complex ones like this, we have to think of the second- and third-order effects. That's frankly why I'm so conservative, as opposed to a liberal who does not think of second- and third-order effects. They think of what liberal who does not think of second- and third-order effects. They think of what feels goo.""

Ben Shapiro DISMANTLES Supreme Court's LGBTQ decision: 'Cramming down a one-size-fits-all rule' does NOT work,"The Daily Wire's Ben Shapiro joined ""The Glenn Beck Radio Program"" Tuesday to break down everything you need to know about the Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling to extend Title VII of the Civil Rights Act protections to gay, lesbian, and transgender people.

Shapiro argued that the decision was ""nonsensical on the merits"" — from its effect on business owners and its contradictory principles of discrimination to how it conflicts with Title IX and religious protections under the U.S. Constitution.

""The Supreme Court tries to, very often, settle questions that are still unsettled, and that really ought not be settled by the Supreme Court. And that is in this particular case. This is not within the Supreme Court's purview,"" Shapiro said.

""And so, there are a lot of people today who are celebrating, 'Oh, look, it's a new America. We're all unified now because there's a top-down rule.' Here's the thing: America is as politically divided as it has been, certainly in my lifetime and maybe in the lifetime of your listeners, including the '60s. The idea that you're going to have anybody at the top of the federal government cramming down a one-size-fits-all rule, it's really a problem,"" he continued. ""Are you going to keep the country together by cramming down one rule from the top? Whether you like the rule or you don't like the rule, that's a dangerous thing.""



""I think that's what the French Revolution was all about,"" Glenn added. ""The French Revolution really was about, 'We're going to enforce morality. We're going to enforce what we believe is right. And if you don't like it, guillotine.' It doesn't work.""

Ryan: Kanye West and the Great Society,"Donald Trump has been name-dropped by nearly every major rapper of the last 30 years, starting with a reference by Beastie Boys on their iconic album ""Paul's Boutique,"" the Sgt. Pepper of hip-hop.



He's been mentioned by Jay Z. Ludacris. Young Thug. Nelly. Kendrick Lamar. Juicy J. Rick Ross. Eminem. Big Sean. A Tribe Called Quest. Scarface. Lil Wayne. The Coup. Master P. Ice Cube. Mos Def. Raekwon and Ol' Dirty Bastard and various other Wu-Tang Clan affiliates. R. Kelly. Pete Rock. Nas. E-40.

And don't forget this surreal moment in our nation's history.

Then-candidate Trump on SNL ... dancing to a Drake parody. (Image source: YouTube screenshot)

When Bun B referred to Trump on the Chopped-n-Screwed anthem ""Pocket Full of Stones,"" he was keeping with a tradition of rappers admiring Trump. This only changed a few years ago. Now it's like that admiration never happened.



But then there's Kanye West, who proudly donned the red MAGA hat after discovering Candace Owens and being called ""a jackass"" by our nation's first black President. Then Kanye was hugging President Trump in the Oval Office. While wearing a Make America Great Again hat, supposed symbol of white supremacy, Nazism, hate, evil?

Image source: YouTube screenshot

People flipped. Everyone did. Longtime critics suddenly — and bizarrely — embraced Kanye as an ally, while longtime defenders disowned him, abandoned him like nail clippings, often mocking his struggles with mental illness and labeling him, if you can believe it, a white supremacist.



Then, in a moment that changed music history, Kanye released the single "" Ye vs. the People.""

Ye vs. the People (starring TI as the People) www.youtube.com

In it, he challenges what he sees as the unspoken rule that black Americans have to vote Democratic. He had hinted at the idea on his track "" Black Skinhead,"" from the hauntingly gorgeous album ""Yeezus,"" but now he was addressing it head-on, with the passion of a man going to Confession for the first time in a decade.



Why should black folks have to abide by any set of cultural or political or artistic guidelines to begin with? And, he argues, the pressure to adhere to this long-held framework is itself undergirded by a subtle and cleverly masked racism, imposed by a group of people who portray themselves as the champions of race and enemies of white supremacy and destroyers of dumb yokel rednecks with their Rebel flags and monster trucks and fully-automatic AR-15 assault weapons. All of which turns out to be some next-level projection.

Kanye also confronts the presence of these expectations and stereotypes in hip-hop. The idea that rappers must invoke a negative persona in order to succeed. And the moment they deviate from that image they are rebuked or ignored, even though the persona is damaging to the black community as a whole. Which is especially ironic given that the people who voice the most outrage tend to be highly privileged, supposedly progressive white folks who love to rant about white privilege and black oppression but shriek ""Racist!"" when a black person says something they disagree with.

Is it better if I rap about crack? 'Cause it's cultural?

Or how about I'ma shoot you? or f*** your b***h?

Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm f***in' rich?

Best of all, Kanye has answers. And they differ from the erudite solutions offered by, say, A Tribe Called Quest, who, like Kanye, have modeled a healthy, positive image of blackness for the black community, just in a different way.

A central theme within ""Ye vs. The People"" is empathy as power, rebellion, freedom.

Make America Great Again had a negative perception

I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction

Added empathy, care and love and affection

This concept is an extension of the powerful devotion to positive energy that Kanye adopted around that time, a purview he has harnessed into a wild new form of electronic gospel.

But his personal transformation was difficult.

That [MAGA] hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half

Then one day I was like, ""F*** it, I'ma do me""

I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me.

This is a struggle that many Americans undergo. Researchers call it the spiral of silence. The idea that the news media and social media present biased opinions as though they are fact, and when the message conflicts with a person's opinions or values, they feel isolated, alone.

Kanye and T.I. during the making of ""Ye vs. the People"" (Image source: YouTube screenshot)

As Kanye raps in ""Ye vs. the People""



A lot of people agree with me but they're too scared to speak up.

Because we have an incredible ability to sense public opinion. So when we suspect that we hold a belief that rails against acceptable thought, we tend to keep quiet about it. That silence makes the opinion seem even more taboo, resulting in a more widespread silence.

In reality, many of these supposedly taboo opinions are not only popular, they are normal and practical and logical. Healthy, even. And the real danger is in demonizing them. But too many people are afraid they'll be ostracized for expressing their beliefs, so they keep quiet.

Like how — despite what we've been led to believe — most Americans cannot stand political correctness.

But the small minority of people who champion it are powerful and loud. They're like that cardboard city in North Korea, just visible enough from the border to make it seem like a thriving community. They're the Wicked Witch of the West, or Iago from ""Othello,"" or Plankton from ""Spongebob Squarepants.""

So far, they have been successful. Although ""success"" by their metric is anarchic and primal, all destruction and loudness and people nervous to speak their mind. They cancel. And the cost of rebellion can be devastating.

By the time Kanye West wrote ""Ye vs. the People,"" he had gotten sick of this power dynamic. So he broke the spiral of silence.

*

In the words of German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer, ""Whoever has language has the world.""



That's humans, and humans alone.

But in order for us to know freedom in our world, our language has to be public, shared, active. Because each of us thrives constantly with language, a stream of it always in our mind.

Aristotle defined ""thought"" as the infinite dialogue between the soul and itself. Conversation is the exchange of thought between people. So when we converse, we simultaneously release our infinite dialogue and accept the other person's inner life, their soul. By speaking, we shape the world and free ourselves.

*

Another way to say it is that Donald Trump might have inspired the song that could very well signify the end of Hip-Hop, which is not only the most popular genre of our zeitgeist, it's the most popular, and successful, form of music in American history, which is the most important era of musical history.

If the Beatles were bigger than Jesus, and Drake literally outpaces the Beatles, then, well, you get the point, God forgive me. And Kanye is bigger than Drake. So who better to have the final word on the capacities of Hip-Hop than Kanye West?

Nobody.

Every genre must come to a close. There's a reason why people aren't eagerly awaiting the next great disco album, or flocking to arenas to hear the newest bluegrass superstar, or asking to get their hair done like the latest syringe-armed guitarist of Guns N Roses.

Kanye's Sunday Services (Image source: Instagram video screenshot)

The great era of Rock 'N' Roll ended roughly about the time Radiohead traded their guitars and drums for synthesizers and samplers, not long after Kurt Cobain took an insane amount of heroin and cradled a shotgun in his guesthouse, only to be discovered several days later by an electrician. Even worse, Nickelback soiled Cobain's legacy with godawful anthems, and who have their own weird and contradictory and hilarious connection to President Trump.



These days, Rock N' Roll lives mostly via nostalgia, as evinced by the explosion of cover bands. Notice how you don't see any hip-hop cover bands. You will, someday. But, for now, Hip-Hop reigns supreme. And Kanye is the King.

The brilliant Nina Simone once told a reporter that ""An artist's duty, as far as I'm concerned, is to reflect the times.""

Because music accords itself to the gravity and creative truth of the era. And currently we entrust hip-hop with this complicated maneuver.

But the past year, Kanye has been crafting a new sound through his Sunday services, weekly jam sessions with acoustic musicians and a choir and everyone dressed in white, praying through song, herding us into a better place, looking above for guidance. If it's anything like his track "" Ultralight Beam,"" it will bring calm to our divided culture.

Mark my words: The resultant album will usher in an entirely new era, a magical flash in human history.

So far, hip-hop has been the defiant child of R&B and Electronica, the grandchild of Spoken Word and Steve Reich Minimalism, with tinges of Punk. Not for much longer. Kanye will see to that. And, weirdly, President Trump has helped inspire this transformation.

Meaning, Donald Trump will have had a hand in reinventing music as a whole, in spreading a movement of positive reformation. Love him or hate him, it does not matter. What other politician can make that claim?

There's an optimism to this that Dave Chappelle captured in his controversial ""Saturday Night Live"" monologue, just days after Trump was elected, asking Americans to at least give the man a chance. And again in his special ""Equanimity,"" when he said that ""no matter how bad it gets, you're my countrymen, and I know for a fact that I'm determined to work s**t out with y'all.""

In a moment of now-tired irony, the usual suspects heaped a barrage of hate at Chappelle for these remarks. But their outrage does not matter, in the grand scheme of things. Because it is an incredible time to be alive. It's beautiful. We should never forget that, no matter how petty or outrageous daily life gets.



At the moment, we are a country that is — everywhere, secretly — hurting. But we are Americans. Together. This is America. And, every day, God delights in our greatness and our empathy and our endless gift for love. So open your heart and listen. Say what you need to say.

Ryan: Donald Trump’s truthful hyperbole,"Part One. Part Two.

President Trump rallies officially begin with a prayer, spoken by some local clergyman. That day, the pastor seemed giddy and nervous as he strolled down the long, long red-carpeted walkway. By the time he introduced himself, he had found composure.

As the prayer was about to begin, a man on the south side of the arena shouted, ""Don't forget about Jesus.""

He said it with conviction, as if he didn't realize the entire arena was about to join in prayer, an act that signifies the intentional remembrance of Jesus.

NOTE: All pictures are from the Shreveport-Bossier City rally that took place the following week. Jim Dale, the photographer, will run an account of his experience. Photo by Jim Dale

Then, the prayer. So I bowed my head. And in the breathy pauses between words, in each brief, perfect, angelic silence, I could hear journalists clacking at their MacBooks.



Good thing they didn't accept me as one of their own, or else I would sever all ties with those blasphemers.

*



The arena was cozy and drab like a decaying small-town gymnasium. It had that sweat odor buried in the walls. Wrestling tournaments. Basketball. Today would not be its first circus. Conventions. Trade shows. Conferences. The stench of past-due. The kind of place that had clearly held tons of indoor rodeos, so add the smell of dirt and livestock.

NOTE: All pictures are from the Shreveport-Bossier City rally that took place the following week. Jim Dale, the photographer, will run an account of his experience. Photo by Jim Dale

And third-rate sports teams nobody actually cares for, also known as the Bayou Beast indoor football team, since you really have to know. And probably some no-name musicians. And if I had to guess, the odd wedding or high school prom or reunion or mayor's funeral.

Capacity of 7,600, and every seat would soon be taken.

Photo by Jim Dale

Before the Nov. 6 rally, I spoke with a dramatically pregnant Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for Trump's 2020 campaign.



She had a D.C. sharpness. Well used to appearances on network TV.

Consensus was, Louisiana was in the bag. All of it was. All in the bag.

Much noise had been made those past weeks and months about Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and about how he had to go. Louisianans felt conflicted. Same as they have since the end of the Civil War. Bel Edwards supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, but he is the son of a sheriff, and, if you judged by his policies, he'd be a Republican in most other states.

Photo by Jim Dale

Trump had come to Monroe to endorse Bel Edward's opponent, Eddie Rispone, 70 years old, rich as hell, a construction contractor from Baton Rouge, and a Republican, first and foremost. Who, when he's not campaigning, shovels dirt and lays cement and, in hotter months, he'll do some tiling or even fire a nailgun into a roof. That week, he'd been digging up the concrete below a Murphy USA station.

As one Trump supporter told me, off-the-record, because they may or may not have been a member of law enforcement, ""Eddie is loyal to our president and our borders and beholden to God as we know and believe him."" Then the gentleman said something I cannot put in writing and remain baffled by.

An arena full of Trump rallygoers does the ""Y.M.C.A."" Photo by Jim Dale

A month earlier, in October, John Bel Edwards and Eddie Rispone faced off, and nobody's too sure what happened, only that Louisiana sure does live up to its reputation as a never-ending source of corruption. Now it's November, round two of the gubernatorial runoff, and the president of the United States is flying in to straighten the kinks.



It was almost enough to make Louisianans forget about the devilishly high murder rate, number one in the nation. For 30 years in a row. Thirty years with the highest murder rate in the country! No challengers, every single year since 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell.

Second highest incarceration rate in the nation. Barely. With 719 per 100,000 residents locked up. Unemployment is third highest. Earlier, outside, people had nodded to a little-known Lynyrd Skynyrd song titled, ""Heaven or Hell.""

Will it be Hell or Heaven on earth the choice is up to you

Look to the sky, the answer is clear

Are you gonna live life for all it's worth

Choose Hell, or Heaven on earth

If you live it right, there's nothing to fear'

Cause you'll find Heaven right here

*

The ""Duck Dynasty"" crew shuffled to the podium like a biker gang on vacation. Think Hawaiian shirts designed by gun aficionados and ripped jeans from American Eagle circa 2003. Hometown heroes, no doubt. There to endorse Eddie Rispone. And theirs is a hell of an endorsement in the Pelican State.

I'm not being funny, but it was hard to differentiate the ""Duck Dynasty"" lads from much of the crowd, a few of whom had hints of camouflage paint on their faces as CeeLo's ""Crazy"" blared from the massive speakers.

Fellow journalist Jade Byers and I rambled about ""the idea of extinctions."" Told her that I got real big into mass extinctions a few months ago, around the time my wife and I learned we'd be parents. As I yapped about the timeline of snails, ""Live and Let Die"" came on.

Photo by Jim Dale

Yes, it was an animal moment. Full of animal sweetness. And for that instant, blessed by the ghost of Axl Rose, wailing and snakelike, I believed that none of us would ever go extinct.

In anticipation of Trump's arrival, men, women and children in American-flag regalia tossed a MAGA hat around like it was a beach ball. Like in Brazil when the shoeless kids play soccer with balled-up trash bags.

Later, Trump would describe the crowd as ""proud, hard-working, freedom-loving American patriots."" He would nod, say, ""that's what you are.""

Yours truly in the media pen Photo by Jim Dale

Thirty minutes before Trump took stage, people rose to their feet, gasping every time a song ended, and gyrated to Michael Jackson's ""Beat It."" An anxiety intensified with each song that ended and Trump still wasn't there.



Is private ritual possible? For Freud, private ritual meant neurosis. A lot of the time, people don't mean what they're saying.

On the other side of the media pen barricade, a larger man in a heavy-fonted T-shirt that read ""GOD. GUNS. AND TRUMP,"" with ""TRUMP"" in the form of an American flag. In another part of the arena, a woman had the same shirt, tucked into spangled black jeans held up by rhinestone clippies.

A 20-something with a pouched lip strutted the floor, holding a SURGE bottle full of Skoal spit. He was hunting; a predator with no threats.

Section 226 was especially rowdy. They needed Trump. It meant everything. They writhed under a sign for ""Johnny's Pizza House.""

All the other media had planted themselves on the risers, safely inside the media pen. CNN and CSPAN and Fox News and MSNBC and all the other important networks, cameras trained on Trump's podium. And all the camera operators, expressionless. Some of them stared ahead like veterans occasionally do. Others rolled their eyes.

*

""Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 45th President of the United States. President Donald. J. Trump,"" then his entrance track, that Lee Greenwood song.

President Trump emerged like an apparition. The entire crowd thrust their cellphones in the air, all the red blinks of recording. Chants of ""four more years.""

Every person in the place had their eyes trained on him.

Look, it doesn't matter what your politics are, this was the president of the United States of America. Every citizen of any country ought to see their leader in person. Without any interference. Without the pollution of someone else's account.

Photo by Jim Dale

I cannot tell you how captivating it is to feel tens of thousands of people, including yourself, including the media who pretend that Trump is a monster, involuntarily surge forward all at once, darting their heads around like Santa Claus is real again, and there he is, there he is, just down there, there he is, it is actually him.



He gripped the podium, mouthed, ""Thank you,"" tilted his head, then told them, ""Wow, do you have spirit.""

*



It was beastly hot in that arena. Beastly hot, almost tropical. At one point, Trump joked that it had to be 100 degrees, so yes, a little hot. He joked that it was so hot, he'd lost about nine pounds.

But hot as it was, Trump still beamed. ""Is there any place you'd rather be than a Trump rally, on a beautiful, wonderful evening in Louisiana?""

You know darn well how they responded!

Photo by Jim Dale

Then he asked would they rather be here at this Trump rally, or at the upcoming football game between their own Louisiana State University and their loathsome rival, Alabama Crimson Tide?



It was clearly a jocular statement, a softball hypothetical that most people would realize was not an actual question. Yet, as you can hear on the footage of the rally, much of the audience was truly baffled it, almost troubled. Perplexed, stricken, eyes bulging and hands limp and voices yodeling in uncertainty.

They did not know how to answer.

Three days later, Trump would attend the game, to a standing ovation.

Donald Trump given huge ovation at Alabama/LSU www.youtube.com

Both teams entered the game undefeated, with 8 wins and somebody had to lose. And, would you believe it, LSU won. 46-41.



Meaning, the solution to the Trump-LSU dilemma was much like so many other Trump dilemmas. Somehow, Trump wound up the winner either way. Depending on the metrics.

Because Eddie Rispone, the man Trump traveled to Louisiana three times to endorse, would lose.

From the back, section 203, a man screamed, ""We love you Trump."" Followed by a group of women on the second tier shouting, ""We love you Trump.""

He used the ""the status quo isn't working"" approach, and it landed every time.



Without prompt, a lady on the first level yelled, ""Democrats suck!""

Step into his diorama. His world made of gold and tinted glass, where the embattled billionaire fights for a civilization that has fallen. Listen carefully to his dialectic game, gaze at his sideshow of power, his postmodern kingdom. A televised empire, where high culture and low culture fornicate like germs.

Look at the horizon of skyscraping condos, five times the size of the Statue of Liberty. His face superimposed onto Mount Rushmore, which turns out to be a Las Vegas replica. Who cares! A trophy is a trophy!

All flash and capital. And now, the White House. The United States of America. The people of Earth. With Trump at the helm, gripping the steering wheel the way rappers in videos do, still calling people losers like Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.

In his book ""Art of the Deal, he writes,



[W]hen people treat me badly or unfairly or try to take advantage of me, my general attitude, all my life, has been to fight back very hard. The risk is you'll make a bad situation worse, and I certainly don't recommend this approach to everyone. But my experience is that if you're fighting for something you believe in — even if it means alienating some people along the way — things usually work out for the best in the end.

He describes the importance of thinking big.

Most people think small because they are afraid of success, afraid of making decisions, afraid of winning.

Trump speaks the superlative language of competition. Of winning and losers. Of records and embarrassments and pitiful upsets. Of heroes and — what's an ugly word for douchebags? Of a nation in peril, desperate for a savior, but he is here so don't worry.

It's a matter of playing the game, which Trump describes in ""Art of the Deal"" as ""the real excitement."" The game is what he loves. Money, he writes, is only useful because it's a way to keep score.



This might explain how and why he has repeatedly commodified objects, events, and people that we hadn't realized could be price-tagged, let alone sold for a whopping profit.

He shields himself with provocation, flamethrower style. He uses tactical hyperbole to win followers and agitate enemies. And he has weaponized the media in his favor.

Photo by Jim Dale

Combine all of these elements and you have the shoddy blueprint of Trump's strategy for the game.



A man who uses combat and grandiosity and the intoxication of fantasy to succeed. So of course it was only a matter of time before he tackled politics. And, in accordance with his doctrine of going as big as possible, it had to be President.

Which is part of his non-performer performance style, like an unforced cool that took years to choreograph.

Photo by Jim Dale

I did not fully understand this until I saw Trump in person, especially at his rallies. He plays what's most likely a version of himself, same as anyone famous or powerful. The suave, brash New Yorker who-knows-how-rich-llionaire, who has a penchant for the spotlight and a colorful history which is tragic in parts, and often ridiculous, and unbelievably ostentatious, and oh so full of beautiful women, literally the most beautiful women in the universe.

And now he'd made it into the White House, the first President — ever — to be elected to the office without a single day of formal experience. His debut to politics was the Presidency, the most unattainable job in politics. A position that men and women have spent lifetimes vying for, often unable to make it past the local or state levels.

If that's not proof that politics is a game, I don't know what is.

*

Trump's influence on large groups is sociological in complexity. He literally fills arenas. A human tsunami, a comet that could wipe us out, but it could also deepen the oceans and that's a good thing, right?

He says, ""Yes.""

He says a lot of things.

In ""Art of the Deal,"" he wrote

The final key to the way I promote is bravado. I play to people's fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That's why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It's an innocent form of exaggeration, and a very effective form of promotion.

I can think of no single quote that better explains Donald Trump. It's the best quote, maybe of all time. Maybe Ever.

This is why his followers hear themselves in much of what he says. Maybe because that's what he believes, or maybe because he uses an innocent form of exaggeration to say what they want to hear, or just the way they want to hear it.

Same as every Trump rally, people waited for hours to get into the Shreveport rally. Photo by Jim Dale

Same goes for the people who hate him. Do they hate him for who he is, or because they see hating him as their only option? But, in their hatred, are they actually promoting him?



Is this love or hatred a measurement of Donald Trump, as president or person? Or a reflection of ourselves in relation to Trump's ability to harness power, insight into what we admire or despise about ourselves? And does anyone care about this distinction anymore?

*

At rallies, one of Trump's routines is to pull a sheet of paper from his inside blazer pocket, then wiggle it in the air like a mystical artifact. Then confide in his audience. This was important stuff he had, did they want to hear about it?

Extend that offer to anyone, all mysterious like that, and their ears will perk. But entice a group of people who love the man with great pride and have waited all day to see him? He wins them over every time.

Photo by Jim Dale

And when Trump waved the paper around, I automatically needed to follow it, like a cat trained on the red dot of a laser. This was the work of a magician. Didn't matter what was on the paper.



But if you looked close enough, Trump resembled the ""yellow cake"" routine on Dave Chappelle's Show.

To get to the White House, he needed to play the game with more intensity than ever before. This meant building an army.

*

Humans can't live in a wasteland for long, even if it's only the perception of a wasteland. And the cleverest person will spark the revolution and off we go in the opposite direction.

In Monroe, Trump thrived with the drama of this maneuver.

""And here's the story,"" he told the penitent crowd, ""we're winning.""

Photo by Jim Dale

That. I think I understood. It wasn't just about winning, not for the people in the audience. It was about not losing any more. They latched onto Trump's each word and superimposed their own values. Facilitated their willingness to help him however they could.



When Trump talked about guns and abortion and fake news and Democrats and Antifa and climate change and socialism, it stirred the crowd. A nifty provocation. But maybe what they really heard were incantations of meaning. Words of affirmation. Phrases that validated them and their beliefs and their hopes and futures, acknowledged their existence in a place that most of the country has forgotten, or never even cared about to begin with.

Maybe that's why many of Trump's followers don't mind his contradictions. His tactical hyperbole.

In ""Political Tribes,"" Amy Chua writes



What elites don't see is that Trump, in terms of taste, sensibilities, and values, actually is similar to the white working class. The tribal instinct is all about identification, and Trump's base identifies with him at a gut level: with the way he talks (locker-room), dresses, shoots from the hip, gets caught making mistakes, and gets attacked over and over by the liberal media for not being politically correct, for not being feminist enough, for not reading enough books. His enemies, they feel, are their enemies.

There in Monroe, I could consider theories about them all day and it wouldn't change the world that they called their own. Like how, in real life, in person, kids see a hundred different Santa Clauses — outside WalMarts, at malls, on TV, in books — yet they still believe in Santa. It doesn't occur to them that there can only be one. And, clearly, there are a lot of them, so maybe it's mom who buys the bike and dad who eats the cookies.

On the other side of the media pen barricade, a man in tattered clothes was fanning a young girl in tattered clothes as she hacked a loose cough and snugged into his neck. She looked feverish and anxious and miserable, deathly ill. Noosed confetti glued to her sweat-damp face. Night over. Last laugh had. You're the punchline, kid.

Or, worse, the discarded set-up.

Somebody wins, but not you.

Air Force One, just up the street. Ten times the size of your house and it's not even where the MAGA Guy lives. Existence itself conspired against you and now, here in northern Louisiana, the audience is clapping and all you want is home.

Why had this father brought his sick child to a Trump rally? Why take her anywhere that wasn't a doctor's office, maybe even a hospital? We all know that the only place to take a sick child is somewhere with a cure. Was that how the father saw this? Not as an elaborate game, but a cure? Was that how the whole arena felt?

Everyone deserves the terror and joy of knowing that you matter.

Ryan: Elizabeth Warren does the Wing Ding,"Two thousand people yipped and howled as Elizabeth Warren bounced onto the stage like it was a stairmaster and she was a gym rat.

Sold out. Maximum capacity. Whole place writhing, all 30,000 square feet, with tight rows of folding chairs like checkers on the dancefloor big as a Walgreens.

Photo by Sean Ryan

Under the disco ball that hung from the dark blue ceiling, the crowd screamed like Warren was Led Zeppelin and the year was 1970, when really she was a 70-year-old senator and this was a fundraiser called Wing Ding, in Clear Lake, Iowa, at the Surf Ballroom, where Buddy Holly spent the last few cold hours of his life.



Photo by Sean Ryan

Warren did not stand behind the podium like Biden or Bernie Sanders.



She was a yoga grandma! A rapping pastor! A beat-boxing cop! An energetic manager! A cat who thinks it's a puppy!

It was like she needed to move around the stage and wave her arms and fire up the congregation or else the floor would belch into lava.

Photo by Sean Ryan

Iowa would work its magic on Warren. By the end of the weekend, she emerged as a top contender, a position she'd maintain with alacrity, then build on.



In her turquoise blazer and her shoes-that-meant-business, she strolled out to the edge of the stage and gave her speech like a natural-born specialist of hootenanny.

Only thing missing was The Who's ""Teenage Wasteland,"" or, better yet, that ""Sail away, sail away, sail away"" song by Enya.



Warren was a car commercial, the kind directed at Millennials, with plastic indie rock and a phony ""who gives a s**t"" vibe. She was expensive cheese from right around the corner. She was Nancy Sinatra, but without Lee Hazelwood.

Voice like a stack of hay catching fire, she made promises. She riled the crowd. And it was an odd sight, the way these meek folks attempted to get rowdy. The way they grimaced and writhed, it was like seeing the reclusive kid volunteer to be the mascot.



It was like they were trying to match the intensity of Trump rallies. No politician has been able to do that so far. The man fills arenas, for God's sake. And his supporters wait for hours outside hoping to get inside. Then he makes them wait. Lets the place get feverish.

Photo by Sean Ryan

Until people are so psyched that they literally cannot remain seated, and they stand there eagerly for 30 minutes, gasping every time a song ends with the hope it means he has arrived.



The Wing Dingers — God bless them — just didn't have that dragon energy, that ravenous devotion. Have you ever seen that show ""Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job""? The people in the ballroom were hyperventilating and spazzing like characters from ""Tim & Eric."" The whole occasion would have been a pickpocket's dream.

Variously, they bulged and shuffled and freestyled to themselves. Who gave the kids sugar cookies at the Baptist youth sleepover? You know they can't handle it, you know they get twitchy, so manic it's almost violent.

And that fed Warren, revved her manic engines.

Full speech: Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding youtu.be

If this had been the 1980s, I would have suspected everyone there had spent all day railing cocaine. And Warren would be the Sly Stone of the event, guarding the vault full of drugs.



If only she could have pulled out a guitar and played AC/DC's ""Thunderstruck"" or performed a duet with a cat on a keyboard.

My dad and I had arrived late, and both of us struggled to relax our eyebrows because this scene was unbelievable. It must have been especially odd for my father, who emigrated from Ireland at 33.

And right now he was frowning because it was so loud in there.

As Warren shouted into a handheld mic, my dad turned to me, almost upset, ""Who is she?"" he asked, but before I could answer, he said, ""I do not like that woman.""

*

When Warren was 12 years old, her father suffered a debilitating heart attack.

He didn't die, but he wouldn't be able to work for years.

The medical bills got so bad that Warren's family nearly lost their home. The car was repossessed. Those were gritty, emaciating days.

Her older brothers joined the military. Her mother got a minimum wage job at Sears. And, at 13, Warren started waiting tables.

She grew up in Oklahoma, where I myself was raised, so I can tell you that it is the Cinderella of States. My personal favorite. At night, the stars croon down over you like they are checking on their infant in its crib and you are that infant. Much like Iowans, people from Oklahoma tend to be kind, and patient, and wild like Americans ought to be.

*

When Warren was growing up, Oklahoma was a Blue State. Her family wasn't Republican. And, these days, Warren is considered a progressive.

But her worldview has evolved over the past few decades.

Photo by Sean Ryan

As a girl, she had seen the effects of bankruptcy firsthand. But her early conclusions led her to personal responsibility. After all, she had taken a job at 13 to help pay her dad's medical bills.



One of Warren's former students told reporters, ""What changed [Warren's ideology] was the stories of ordinary people filing for bankruptcy. That speaks really well of her that she was presented with information contrary to her worldview and adopted it.""

Before that, she leaned right, politically. Or, in the words of one of her best friends growing up, ""Liz was a diehard conservative in those days.""

Another friend called her an ""ice-cold Republican.""

A colleague at the University of Texas in Austin, where she worked in the early 1980s, said, ""Liz was sometimes surprisingly anti-consumer in her attitude.""

Another colleague said, ""I remember the first time I became aware of her as a political person and heard her speak, I almost fell off my chair. She's definitely changed. It's absolutely clear that something happened.""

Until 1996, when she was 47 years old, Warren was a registered Republican.

And I do not mean this in a snarky way. Opposite. It's admirable when people undergo personal change. We have to. It's a matter of survival. A person who never evolves is blinded by hubris and destined to fail.

Longtime Warren collaborator Jay Westbrook has told reporters, ""It drives me crazy when she's described as a radical left-winger. She moved from being moderately conservative to being moderately liberal. When you look at consumer debt and what happens to consumers in America, you begin to think the capitalist machine is out of line.""

At some point she got pregnant for the first time, setting in motion a series of events that may have involved discrimination, or may have been a fabrication she has since used in stump speeches as a heart-tugging anecdote.

As far as controversies go, it's as goofy and PG-rated as her onstage persona.

Who cares if she lied for the sake of a story and the benefit of victimhood? Trump lies constantly. Politicians lie constantly. It's part of the reason public trust in government has sunk lower than ever before.

No, it's not morally acceptable that politicians are habitually dishonest. But the outrage aimed at Warren isn't actually about that, is it?

*

Warren won state debate champion in high school. Shortly after graduating, at 19, she married Jim Warren, a mathematician who worked for IBM, then NASA.

The two dated when Elizabeth was 13 and Jim was 17. Warren chose marriage over a full-ride to the prestigious George Washington University.

Three years later, she gave birth to her first daughter. You can find the picture of her in the hospital bed, surrounded by white sheets, her eyes an oceanic blue, glowing as she holds her baby for the first time, a technicolor sash around her left shoulder.

She focused on being a mom for two years, then put herself through law school at Rutgers. At her graduation, she was eight months pregnant. Most airlines won't allow women so close to their due date.

After 10 years of marriage and two children, her husband divorced her.

Photo by Kevin Ryan

Warren hadn't expected it. One night, she asked her husband, ""Do you want a divorce"" and he said yes, even though she'd been asking in that, ""Something's wrong but surely things aren't so bad"" kind of way.



Imagine the enormity and disbelief she must have felt as her husband said he'd be leaving her. The kind of moment that gives a person vertigo.

Warren tried to revive the marriage, but her husband had given up. Before long he moved out, quit smoking, got super into dancing, then remarried.

*

Politicians tend to mention tragedies only as evidence for a policy stance. Or occasionally these stories will appear in a candidate profile. Or you can read the ice-cold Encyclopedia version.

I always wonder about the desperation people suffered in those moments that must have seemed so long, the quiet after bitter words or desperate outbursts. The enormity they must have felt.

In moments of trauma, we become intensely aware of the noises and smells and colors and mementos around us. What was the first object Warren noticed after hearing her husband say, ""Yes""?

She has since said that she and Jim never really fought. That she didn't blame him for leaving. But that they just didn't work out.

""I can't imagine anybody putting up with me over long periods. It's why I can never be cranky about Jim. I get it.""

Still, a marriage has to be fairly bad for a couple with young children to divorce. But even an amicable divorce is devastating. It marks the death of a love that had once been good enough and deep enough for two people to bind themselves together, if only by law.

Now, Warren was a single mother. Surely, at times, that was lonesome. She must have felt moments of intense waywardness.

There must have been anxious nights, lonely mornings, swarming with memories about life as it was, all those plans for the future that must feel so naive in hindsight.

Warren's quirkiness has made her an easy piñata for her rivals.

But I just think about her, alone in a room, folding clothes or staring off, blinking and slouching there alone, and I feel disgust for politics as a bloodsport.

What do rancor or invective get us in the end? A winner who trounced a loser? What is the human cost? Not just for the people being targeted, but for the world as we'd like it.

Photo by Sean Ryan

Why isn't it enough to disagree with an opponent? Why does there have to be humiliation?



And if it's wrong from one politician, it's wrong from them all.

A person can't decry the abuse that President Trump faces — which is daunting in intensity and volume — then cheer him on when he's doing the same exact thing.

Somebody is going to have to take a slap or two to the face and not react, but it would accomplish far more than a vitriolic comeback.

At this point, three years into Trump's presidency, there was no way to tell who started it and who was just reacting, so everyone involved in the fight was guilty.

In other words, people could no longer blame Trump for how the selfsame persona they had taken in response.

To quote Morrisey, ""It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate. It takes strength to be gentle and kind.""

When the ram charges straight for you, all you have to do is take a step to the left or the right and off the angry bastard goes, headfirst into the ground. Do that a few times and you'll get more support than you might expect.

Which, I'm not saying to never fight. Conflict is healthy. Passivism can be worse than violence. To fight is to live honorably. But only if justice is the reason for fighting.

If the ram is coming at you because it wants to silence or control you, grit your teeth, chalk up your horns, lower your head, and go to battle. Courage and morality are vastly different than bravado and self-righteousness.

As Tolstoy wrote in his novel ""War and Peace"": ""If everyone fought for their own convictions, there would be no war.""

*

Two years later, Warren married Bruce Mann, a law professor. They've been married ever since.

For nearly three decades, she taught law, mostly at Harvard.



Then, she shifted to politics. In 2008, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) appointed her to a congressional panel. Two years later, she became a special adviser to Barack Obama, who had selected her as special adviser to the Treasury secretary, but stopped short of nominating her as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Shortly after, she resigned. A month later, she announced her congressional bid, which gained momentum after her speech at that year's Democratic National Convention.

In 2013, she was elected senator of Massachusetts after beating Republican incumbent Scott Brown with 53 percent of the vote. She would go on to win a second term in 2018, this time with 60 percent.

Every candidate has a stain. Warren's happens to have led to mockery. For years, she claimed Native American heritage. For many of the right, it was yet another example of the left's allegiance to identity politics.

The left was more concerned with the way the issue came to attention to begin with, after remarks President Trump made during an event honoring Navajo code talkers. As has become the norm, many of the country's leading news outlets ran scathing anti-Trump op-eds that they labeled as hard news.

Opinion was being packaged as fact. In other words, propaganda. Like the passive-aggressive tone of this Washington Post article.

Photo by Sean Ryan

Which is certainly not the right way to handle injustice. And is certainly not journalistically sound.



Once again, the media's blatant disdain of Trump only served to further empower him. Gave him more proof of fake news. And allowed him to justify, in the eyes of his followers, the repeated use of Warren's nickname.

Worst of all, it widened the distance between the news media and the portion of the American public they'd long ago lost access to.

Likewise, conservative news outlets pounced with an air of ""See? I knew it all along."" And responded with a different version of the same aggression used by the media. Outlets like Fox News played up their masterful victim narrative, the idea that the mainstream media have a stranglehold on America, despite the fact that Fox News has long been the dominant news source of the mainstream media they claim to be a victim of.

This feedback loop played out until Elizabeth Warren's genetics became a national conversation.

Last year, Warren released a DNA test that revealed her to be only between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native America. Fellow Democratic candidate Corey Booker — a senator from New Jersey — has more Native American DNA than Warren. And unfortunately for Warren, the nickname that President Trump gave her gained more power.

During an interview on MSNBC, Warren said, ""It is deeply unfortunate that the president of the United States cannot even make it through a ceremony honoring these heroes without having to throw out a racial slur. Donald Trump does this over and over thinking somehow he is going to shut me up with it. It hasn't worked in the past, it isn't going to work out in the future.""

In a bizarre twist, Warren's ex-husband was a pioneer in the field of genetics and helped make the technology accessible to the public when he co-founded FamilyTreeDNA, which sells genetic testing kits.

*

Across the street from the Surf Ballroom, 300 yards from the entrance, a Trump 2020 sign the size of a front door glared out, impossible to avoid.

It's a power play in line with Trump's own combat style — which, again, there's nothing wrong with a good fight, even if there is some dirty fighting, but why did it have to be all of the time? And why had everyone joined in on it?



*

Warren began her presidential campaign on Feb. 8 with a rally in Lawrence, Massachusetts, at the site of the 1912 Bread and Roses textile strike, a two-month-long standoff that led to 296 arrests.

Three people died, an Italian immigrant, who was shot in the chest. A Lithuanian immigrant who was beaten to death for wearing a pro-labor lapel pin. And a Syrian boy who was bayoneted in the spine.

The strike takes its name from a James Oppenheim poem.

""As we come marching, marching, we battle too for men, For they are women's children, and we mother them again.""

*

As Warren drove her speech to a close, Kamala Harris paced down the long ramp by the side of the stage, then walked through a curtain that divided the hallway from backstage, then into the crowded ballroom, immediately surrounded by cameras, lights, hands, selfies.

Ten feet behind the curtain, Joe Biden shifted at the side of the stage, chatting with several people in brand-new Biden 2020 shirts, and waiting to go on.

Each candidate had 10 minutes or so, which Biden, like most of the other candidates, would use to insult Trump and fumbled through his ""President's words matter"" speech, two days after his ""poor kids are just as talented as white kids"" comment, and I wondered if everyone else found the irony as hilarious as I did.

Now Warren was pounding her fist.

The already hysterical crowd became even more incensed with each of her words. It was the first moment I realized that Warren actually had a shot at winning the nomination.

*

Of all the towns we visited while in Iowa, Clear Lake was the most puzzling. It didn't feel like the rest of what we'd seen. It didn't resemble any other town in the country, far as I can say. Just a general ideal for ""lovely American town.""

Maybe Clint Eastwood's Carmel, California, or the wealthy part of Charlotte, North Carolina, or the gorgeous shaded Rice Village neighborhood of Houston, Texas.

Warren shuffled offstage and shook hands with Biden.

Photo by Sean Ryan

Then cue the Bruce Springsteen song. And somebody hurry up and push the button that activates Biden's facelift.



""The words that presidents speak matter,"" Biden said. And some of the crowd were hearing him say it for the first time.

Warren gabbed with a lady in a floral dress backstage. They held hands like sisters. After a minute or so, she vanished backstage.

Then the whole gig was finished. Closing time had come.

Andrew Yang hung out in the lobby after all the other candidates left. He took selfies. Talked policy. Behind him, young people in Yang 2020 shirts and hats that said ""MATH"" handed out Yang money.

He hugged. He laughed.

People puttered out of the Surf Ballroom in no sort of hurry, giddy in their candidate T-shirts, ready to effect change, to dethrone Trump.

The air had a gentle sway, tilted by a northern cold that felt winter-like, especially for August.

Right as the last big group of Wing Dingers walked out of the Surf Ballroom, a small car drove by, windows down, packed with young men who kept shouting, ""Vote for Trump, baby!""

Then, stalled at a stop sign, the driver revved the engine and spun the tires, and as it sped off, one of the guys in the back seat shouted, ""Trump 2020, bitches.""

Former Levi's exec reveals 'CULTISH' woke corporations,"Within two years, former Levi Strauss & Co. brand president and lifelong liberal Jennifer Sey went from voting for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to calling out the Left for its woke hypocrisy.

Jennifer was told she had a good chance at becoming CEO of Levi’s, but when the COVID-19 pandemic led to school shutdowns, she spoke her mind as a frustrated mom — without mentioning her company at all — and the backlash was beyond anything she could have expected.

""There are people who just don't like what you're saying or where you said it. It's in conflict with the good-bad world we're living in, where Fox is bad and MSNBC is good. [...] Are you one of us or one of them?"" Levi's asked Jennifer after she committed the ultimate woke sin of appearing on Fox News.

Jennifer joined ""The Glenn Beck Podcast"" to share her story — which is summed up in her new memoir, “Levi’s Unbuttoned: The Woke Mob Took My Job but Gave Me My Voice"" — and what she discovered about the cultish behavior of “woke capitalism.""

Nikki Haley: Here's the ONE Trump victory Biden CAN'T erase,"President Joe Biden spent his first 100 days in office reversing and erasing as many of former President Donald Trump's policies as he could, and Trump's former ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, believes that was a ""terrible mistake.""

On the ""Glenn Beck Podcast"" this week, Haley joined Glenn to discuss President Biden's ""Trump reversals"" and pointed out the one Trump victory that Biden can't erase — and the proof is playing out right now.

""He just reversed everything,"" Haley said of Biden. ""But the part that he can't erase, and it's really a point of pride, I think, is the Abraham Accords, because this was an amazing thing. Many presidents before Trump had said that the only way to get peace in the Middle East was through the Palestinians. The president went to his first foreign policy speech, it was to the Arab Summit, and he said, 'I want us to unite against terrorism,"" meaning, translation, I want us to unite against Iran. He got the attention of the Arab countries. Then he started to acknowledge truths: Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. We're going to have Israel's back. This is what Israel can do for you,"" she continued.

""I had a meeting, I and the British ambassador had a meeting with the Saudi and the Emirati ambassador, and they were complaining, you know, 'Why doesn't anybody call out the Houthis for the terrorist organization that they are? Why are they always hitting us?' And I stopped them and I said, 'You know, I could make the same case for Hamas and Israel.' We went on with the meeting, and they pulled me aside afterwards, and they said, 'We know you're right.' So I asked, 'Why do you hit Israel the way you do?' The Emirati said, 'We do it because we have to for our constituencies,' and I said, 'At some point you're going to have to have the courage to tell your constituencies the truth.' You fast-forward to the Abraham Accords, and that was the Emiratis having the courage to tell their constituencies the truth,"" Haley explained.

Biden family corruption EXPOSED,"The Hunter Biden laptop scandal just got worse. But don’t be distracted by the salacious photos — we’re dealing with a national security threat.

America has seen plenty of bad scandals and corruption involving presidents and vice presidents before, but at least there were consequences and some measure of justice. People were forced to resign and several went to prison. Joe Biden, on the other hand, is at the center of what may be the biggest corruption scandal in presidential family history. And yet so far, he’s been given a free pass despite the mountain of clear evidence that he abused his position as vice president to enrich his family. He knew exactly what his son and brother were up to yet continues to lie to the American people about his knowledge.

There are so many questions, red flags, and conflicts of interest surrounding the Biden family’s business activities that it’s hard to keep track. And it all raises legitimate questions about Joe Biden’s actions now as president. The Justice Department has been investigating Hunter Biden’s financial activity for over two years and still nothing has happened. Why not?

On his Wednesday night special, Glenn Beck argues Attorney General Merrick Garland owes Americans a status update on this investigation. The mainstream media wants you to think that any discussion of the Bidens’ corruption is just a right-wing witch hunt or cruel harassment of Joe Biden’s troubled son. Wrong. Glenn explains why this scandal can no longer be ignored and why every American, Republican or Democrat, should care about this corrupt abuse of power.

Glenn Beck: How to prep for global food shortage crisis,"The things Glenn has warned about are coming true. Elites at the “World Government Summit” asked if we were ready for a ""new world order,"" and Biden recently told CEOs, “There’s going to be a new world order… and we’ve got to lead it.”

Fact-checkers seized on the story to make sure we all understood the president was just describing “international changes from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, not confirming a world domination conspiracy theory.” But Glenn Beck argues it can be both.

We need to know what to look for as things begin to spiral out of control AND how to prepare. Inflation continues to spike at record numbers, not only here at home, but in other economic powers like Germany. A recession is all but guaranteed to happen, and we’ve always found a way through it. But we’ve never been faced with what we’re now seeing. The labor market and supply chain are still rocked by the pandemic, while war rages in an area that supplies a vast amount of fossil fuels, precious metals, and food.

A recession can easily become a DEPRESSION. But the Biden administration is trying to propagandize us into accepting lower living standards. Officials want us to rely on them rather than on ourselves, but self-sufficiency is the way out of this. Our grandparents dealt with this during the Great Depression, and we must now learn from their example. Glenn shows Americans what every household must do before it is too late. Nobody will be laughing at preppers any more.

Mark Levin: Here's why Biden is the 'MOST LAWLESS president in modern American history',"Talk about Nixon all you want, but BlazeTV host Mark Levin says Joe Biden is our nation's ""most lawless"" president.

In this clip, Mark outlined the many ways Biden violates the U.S. Constitution and federal statutory law. From immigration to critical race theory to vaccine and mask mandates, President Biden ignores both federal and state laws ""day in and day out."" And now he's going after the Supreme Court, massively expanding the welfare state, and changing the healthcare system.

""Joe Biden is the most lawless president in modern American history. You can talk about Nixon, you can talk about whomever you want, Joe Biden day in and day out violates the Constitution and federal statutory law,"" Mark said.

""He's supposed to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the nation, even if his personal and administration's policies conflict with the statutes. Joe Biden is violating the Constitution,"" he added.

Watch the video clip below to hear Mark break down the many laws and statutes that the Biden administration has violated or failed to uphold:

Mark Levin warns: Here's why we can't let Democrats cut off US aid to Israel,"As Hamas ruthlessly targets Israel's major population centers with a hailstorm of rockets, the world is witnessing a military miracle: Israel's anti-missile system known as the Iron Dome.

On ""LevinTV"" this week, Mark Levin shared a little-known story of the Iron Dome's development, from Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative to the Patriot Missile System.

Co-developed by Israel and the U.S., Israel has created a defensive masterpiece, but as Levin warned, there are those within the Democrat Party that seek to cut off the aid to Israel necessary to continue development of these defensive systems.

Mark Levin: Putin is taking plays from Stalin's playbook,"In this episode of ""LevinTV,"" Mark takes a few moments to remind us of the history of Stalin, Russia, the old Soviet Union, and Ukraine. He explains the evil that occurred 90 years ago when Stalin surrounded Ukraine and starved millions of people, leaving them to die in horrific ways. Mark compares the actions Putin is currently executing against Ukrainians to Stalin's. Putin is surrounding Ukrainian cities and bombarding them to cut off routes for food, medicine, and other necessities.

Mark Levin: Here's why Bill Maher was right to say 'silly' Americans have 'lost to China',"On ""LevinTV"" this week, BlazeTV host Mark Levin pointed to Bill Maher (yes, Bill Maher) to help illustrate that America is fighting with itself and completely ignoring the real threat: China.

Levin played a video clip from HBO's ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" in which Maher called Americans ""a silly people"" who have already ""lost to China.""

""You're not going to win the battle for the 21st century if you are a silly people, and Americans are a silly people. That's the classic phrase from 'Lawrence of Arabia' when Lawrence tells his Bedouin allies that as long as they stay a bunch of squabbling tribes, they will remain a silly people. Well, we're the silly people now,"" Maher said.

""You know who doesn't care that there's a stereotype of a Chinese man in a Dr. Seuss book? China. All 1.4 billion of them could give a crouching-tiger, flying-f***. Because they're not a silly people,"" he added.

Levin agreed with Maher on the point that while Americans squabble over political correctness, China is beating us at pretty much everything.

""We're really facing two wars at the same time,"" Levin said, meaning both domestic and international conflict. ""The internal war domestically ... that's what the 1619 Project is all about. That's what Black Lives Matter and Antifa are all about. That's what Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are all about. That's what our media are all about. One hundred and twenty years of progressivism — progressivism is really neo-Marxism — and this is where we are today.""

WATCH: Mark Levin OBLITERATES New York Times writer who accused Israel of 'war crimes',"As Hamas relentlessly attacked Israel with a barrage of rockets, practically no one in the mainstream media came to the Israelis' defense and their right to strike back against their attackers. Instead, the media openly lectured the American public (and Israel) on the ""proper"" response to Hamas' aggression. Meet Exhibit A: Nicholas Kristof, foreign policy columnist for the New York Times.

Appearing on ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" Kristof suggested that Israel may have committed ""war crimes"" for simply trying to defend their nation against unwarranted aggression.



On ""LevinTV"" this week, BlazeTV host Mark Levin obliterated Kristof's insane arguments, while exposing Hamas as the real perpetrators of crimes against humanity.

Mark Levin: Congress not supporting NATO allies,"Under Joe Biden's inept foreign policy, the world has become a powder keg of conflict, with Ukraine and Taiwan serving as the latest fuses.

According to reports, ""Nearly 64,000 troops stationed in Europe could be deployed to the continent's eastern flank if President Biden makes such a call to counter growing Russian aggression at the border with Ukraine...40 warships, 175 aircraft and 90 tanks situated throughout Europe could also be readied for conflict.""

""I remember when we had 1,500-2,000 tanks in Europe. I am quite concerned that we don't have that many [up to 2,000] tanks in Europe, quite frankly, "" Levin said.

""Here's what they [the Biden administration] are concerned about,"" Mark began. ""Ukraine is a huge deal. But Ukraine borders on four NATO allies. The concern is that once Russia gets ahead of steam, will they stop?""

Levin's primary concern is not going to war with Russia over Ukraine, as Biden has already said the U.S. is not be sending troops into Ukraine to fight the Russians. ""Biden seeks to strengthen NATO allies, hoping to keep the fighting from bleeding over,"" Levin explained.

Levin emphasized that a much more significant concern is communist China going after Taiwan and other areas where China can gain control. If China is not bad enough, Iran is months away from having nuclear capabilities.

Congress could band together to support our NATO allies, but Mark reminds us that Congress is too busy trying to chase former President Donald Trump and pass massive inflation bills to be concerned with standing unified with our allies who are currently staring in the face of war.

Russia's Ukraine Mark Levin,"The conflict between Russia and Ukraine provides a timely opportunity for a critical thinking exercise.

Suppose you are the leader of Russia, China, Iran, etc. Consider Biden's tragic exit from Afghanistan in August 2021, and the strained relationship that disaster created with our NATO allies. Wouldn't you see the present as a golden window of opportunity to carry out your war-filled dreams? After all, what America has in President Joe Biden is a commander in chief who Mark Levin, host of ""LevinTV"" noted, is incapable of defending The United States of America.

In this clip, Mark addressed a video from NBC Today that covered the developing situation of Russia and Ukraine. If you follow politics, you are well aware that what we see on the surface usually does not reflect reality. Mark highlighted the general principle, pointing out the implications of what a Russian invasion of Ukraine means.

""The fear is, the Russians will cut through Ukraine and then start gobbling up little pieces of other countries,"" Mark assessed, meaning the fear is that Russia will gain control of new territory. Mark added that the United States is not in the best position. Watch the clip for a clear breakdown of what is unfolding between Russia, Ukraine, and potentially NATO.

"Steven Crowder says what everyone is thinking about the FBI, but mainstream media focus on a tweet","After Steven Crowder's heartfelt and carefully worded cold open on Monday's show, the mainstream media decided Crowder needed to be silenced again.

Crowder felt conflicted between his feelings of anger at the FBI raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago home and making the FBI's actions his hill to die on. ""Not literally,"" Crowder clarified, ""but it is time to fight fire with fire.""

Crowder made it very clear his belief that it is time to stop playing the losing game of passively allowing agencies like the IRS and the FBI to violate and betray the American people for job security. ""There is a reason you feel scared,"" Crowder explained. ""These agencies are coming for you.""

""It is okay to be scared. It is okay to be mad. I am,"" Crowder said.

The mainstream media are ruled by jacked-up priorities, aka lies, and lost their minds over a tweet Crowder posted the night before. The tweet read: ""Tomorrow is war. Sleep well."" The progressive media pounced and accused Crowder of calling for an actual war because that is what they do when they feel scared: attempt to destroy their opponents with lies.

Russian Priest ecstatic to be cut off from mustached women of the West,"A Russian priest thanked the West for cutting off the gross exports of ""women with mustaches"" and ""men with breasts"" — Pornhub — and ending the horrible pain of watching Eurovision. Steven Crowder discussed this story on Tuesday's episode of Louder with Crowder.

Steven explained that while porn is a shameful export of the West, Russia is not exactly a saint in this clip. Steven pointed out how Russia doesn't have a leg to stand on, considering it is ranked the seventh-largest market for human trafficking. Steven went on to say that the Russian people are being essentially fed propaganda to make them believe they are morally superior to the West.

'We're doomed.' Watch Crowder react to TikTok dance videos,"A group of Army soldiers decided to showcase their dance skills in a TikTok video.

On Tuesday's show, Steven Crowder expressed concern after watching a group of female Army soldiers dance in a less than coordinated fashion on TikTok. ""We're doomed,"" he began, adding that the women in the video ""are not even good at dancing, which is concerning.""

According to Crowder, dancing can indicate the group's overall coordination and teamwork.

""If they [the women in the video] get into a conflict with a potential threat like China and a dance-off settles it, we are still screwed,"" Crowder said.

Pro-Palestine LGBTQ+ Americans SHOCKED to hear what Palestinians think about THEM,"It's amazing to see just how strongly many LGBT+ Americans are allied with Palestine in the Israel-Palestine conflict because the Palestinians aren't exactly pro-LGBTQ.

Documentary filmmaker Ami Horowitz decided to go into the West Bank to ask people on the streets of the Palestinian territories to explain their views firsthand. What he discovered was a shocking and even violent intolerance for the LGBT+ community.

Ami joined Glenn Beck on the radio program to share a sample of his eye-opening footage and the stunning reactions he received from pro-Palestinian (and vehemently anti-Isreal) LGBT+ Americans.

VACATION or INTERNMENT? What's really going on in Australia’s COVID camps?,"The government of the Northern Territory of Australia is now running ""mandatory supervised"" COVID-19 quarantine facilities, and there are a lot of conflicting reports going around about what's really happening in these ""camps."" Are they internment camps, summer vacation spots, or something in between?

On ""The Glenn Beck Program"" Monday, Glenn and Producer Stu Burguiere discussed the case of 26-year-old Australian resident Hayley Hodgson, who detailed her experience at the Center of National Resilience in Howard Springs during a recent interview with UnHerd. They compared Hodgson's description of the Howard Springs facility to images of bikini-clad Australians in quarantine who appear to be on holiday at the same facility.

So, what's really going on with Australia's COVID quarantine facilities? Watch the video clip below to hear Glenn and Stu break down what we know so far:

Glenn Beck: Taiwan is preparing for potential WAR with China — but will Biden do ANYTHING?,"Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu is now warning that his nation is preparing for war with China after Beijing flew a record number of warplanes over Taiwanese territory. Wu reached out to another country for help, but it wasn't the United States.

In a video, Wu urged Australia to help prepare for a possible invasion, but gave the U.S. no mention.



""The defense of Taiwan is in our own hands, and we are absolutely committed to that. And if China is going to launch a war against Taiwan, we will fight until the end. And that is our commitment. And, of course, during this period of time, we would like to exchange with other countries for security cooperation,"" Wu said on ABC News In-depth's China Tonight program. ""We would like to engage in security or intelligence exchanges with other like-minded partners, Australia included, so that Taiwan is better prepared to deal with the war situation. And so far, our relations with Australia is very good. And that is what we appreciate it for.""

On ""The Glenn Beck Program,"" Glenn, Pat Gray, and Stu Burguiere discussed whether or not America would do anything during such a conflict — because it sure seems like President Joe Biden is more focused on working with China to fight climate change. Plus, why did China just cut off all cryptocurrency?

Glenn Beck: Does the government still work for us? The latest headlines show the answer,"There is no transparency when it comes to the Biden administration, and Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz's recent exchange with the FBI’s Jill Sanborn is just another example. When questioned about alleged involvement the FBI had on January 6, 2021, Sanborn refused to answer almost every single time.

Do our government officials still work for us? Take a look at the latest headlines: The DOJ and U.S. Army are preparing for possible conflicts with ""domestic terrorists,"" Biden's education secretary allegedly requested the NSBA letter that suggested treating upset parents like domestic terrorists, and President Biden said if you're not with him on the Democrats' voting bills, then you're with the Confederacy. Meanwhile, the FBI won't tell Congress whether it was involved in the the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and the corporate media insists that there's nothing to see here, especially concerning Ray Epps.

The American people are concerned, and it’s ""extraordinarily disturbing"" how far the federal government goes to avoid answering our questions, Glenn Beck said on the radio program. There's a very odd growing trend here: Our leaders, including the unelected ones, no longer answer to the people. This must stop now.

""The question that I have is, where is the transparency? And is anyone going to be held accountable? They are not afraid of our senators. They are not afraid of Congress,"" he stated. ""This has got to stop. They have got to answer to the law. This is an oversight committee. Who is in charge, the FBI or the people? Once the people are not in charge and are not allowed to see the secret documents, we are toast. Toast!""

'Everything is very carefully stage managed': Veteran war reporter Lara Logan on why you're NOT getting the truth about Iran,"Award-winning investigative journalist and former CBS News war correspondent Lara Logan joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Wednesday to share what it's really like to report ""from the ground"" in Iran.

Logan explained why the mainstream media is failing in its current coverage of the conflict between the United States and Iran following the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani last week.

She stressed that ""everything is very carefully stage managed"" when it comes to media coverage in Iran.

""Things do not happen on the ground in countries like that without being orchestrated,"" Logan stated.

""When Iranian government says, 'Yes, you're approved and you can come in,' you've got a 'minder' with you all the time. This person is monitoring every single thing you say and do,"" she explained. ""We call them minders, but let's be honest, they are intelligence agents. They're spies. And they're recording everything you say and everything you do. And every person you speak to, every Iranian you interview, knows that that person is standing right there.""

By omitting this crucial context, reporters are failing in their duties, Logan said.

""As reporters, we have to be right in that moment, and emotional, and live it. And bring it to life for the viewer, and bring you right there,"" she noted. ""But we also have another job. Our other responsibility is to take a little step away from it and say, 'Okay, what's the broader context?'

""What I feel is happening with some of the reporting that I've seen from the ground is it's all about one perspective,"" Logan added. ""Nobody's putting it in context. I mean, they were chanting 'Death to America' long before Qassem Soleimani was killed.

""There are a lot of questions,"" she continued. ""The Iranian regime frequently puts out whatever it wants to. I mean, they're masters of propaganda.""

Glenn Beck: Is Trump's twitchy eye preventing a war with Iran?,"According to a New York Times report Monday, the Trump administration is considering sending up to 120,000 troops to the Middle East in case Iran attacks American forces and to keep tabs on any development of nuclear weapons.

Although President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday that the Times story was ""fake news,"" he added that he would ""absolutely"" consider such a plan.

""Now would I do that? Absolutely. But we have not planned for that,"" Trump said. ""Hopefully, we're not going to have to plan for that, and if we did that, we'd send a hell of a lot more troops than that.""



On Tuesday's radio program, Glenn Beck speculated about the strategy behind Trump's ambiguous messaging when it comes to the possibility of military conflict with Iran.

""I think Donald Trump is the president, when it comes to foreign affairs, he's the president that I've always wanted to have. I've always said the president needs to have like a twitchy eye — not with our allies and not with us ... but the bad actors in the world should look at our president and say, 'You know, he's just crazy enough he just might do that.' I think that works to our favor.""

'I think the president agrees with me': Sen. Mike Lee doubles down on fiery rant over 'unconstitutional' Iran briefing,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Thursday to discuss what he called ""probably the worst briefing I've seen"" in regard to Wednesday's congressional briefing on the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Iran's retaliatory missile attack.

""What I found so distressing about that briefing was that one of the messages we received from the briefers was 'do not debate, do not discuss the issue of the appropriateness of further military intervention against Iran. And if you do, you'll be emboldening Iran,'"" Lee told reporters on Wednesday.

""It is not acceptable for officials within the executive branch of government — I don't care whether they're with the CIA, with the Department of Defense or otherwise — to come in and tell us that we can't debate and discuss the appropriateness of military intervention against Iran. It's un-American. It's unconstitutional. And it's wrong,"" he added.

In this clip, Lee made it clear that he is not speaking out against President Donald Trump's decision to order the airstrike that killed Soleimani or his handling of the ongoing conflict with Iran.

""I commend the president. I support the president. This president has actually been the most respectful and the most restrained in his use of military power as commander in chief. More so than any other president in my lifetime. And I respect him for that,"" Lee said to Glenn on the phone.

""What I'm concerned about is where we go from here,"" he continued. ""I want to make sure that any subsequent military action against Iran is carried out only through the constitutional formula, which is through a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force. And I actually think the president wants the same. I think the president wants to follow the Constitution.""

According to Article 2 of the Constitution, the president has the power to order a strike that is ""discreet and necessary"" in order to repel an actual or imminent attack, Lee said.

""But further actions, a sustained military effort, something that would qualify as an act of war, does, in fact, require congressional authorization. And that's what they need to obtain,"" he added. ""I think the president agrees with me on that. I just think some of those surrounding him, advising him, and advising Congress on behalf of the executive branch yesterday are not adequately taking that into account.""

Glenn Beck: Why is Pelosi REFUSING to release Jan. 6 Capitol Police information?,"Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) recently sent a fiery letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demanding she stop obstructing GOP efforts to investigate security measures taken before and on January 6, 2021.

On ""The Glenn Beck Program,"" Rep. Davis said the Capitol Police should release all communications concerning security from that day, but the police chief can’t do so without an ""okay"" from the House sergeant at arms — a Pelosi appointee. Americans deserve to know why the Capitol’s security posture was so bad that day, so we can be sure it won’t happen again, but unfortunately, Rep. Davis told Glenn, that may not occur until Republicans take the House majority back.

""Republicans condemn the violence that took place a year ago. That was unanimous,"" Davis said. ""But here we are today still left wondering, what did the sergeant at arms of the House — the lead law enforcement official appointed directly by the speaker — what did he do in preparation leading up to January 6? There's been conflicting testimony, and all I've ever asked for, as the lead Republican on the respective oversight committee, is just to get the communications. We want to know what preparations were made, and the only person standing in the way of us getting the communications from her own appointee, who controls the House security operations, is Speaker Pelosi,"" he added.

""Unfortunately, the House is a very majority-driven institution. And remember, the Capitol Police chief cannot make a single security decision without going to Speaker Pelosi's appointed sergeant at arms. That's her own political appointee,"" Davis continued. ""So, you know when I'm going to get this information? It's when I'm the chairman of the House Administration Committee when Republicans take over Congress in November of 2022.""

Rand Paul: President Trump did NOT give Turkey the 'green light' to invade Syria,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Tuesday to discuss the recent conflict in the Middle East, and to explain why he stands by President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Northern Syria.

President Trump has faced intense criticism from both Republicans and Democrats after announcing earlier this month that the United States would pull American troops out of Syria ahead of a Turkish offensive against U.S.-aligned Kurdish forces. Critics claim the the president gave Turkey the ""green light"" to launch an attack against the Kurds in Syria. But Paul says we need to look back at the region's history before we make assumptions about present day events.

""People need to remember the beginning of the Syrian war,"" Paul said. ""For years and years, it was Lindsey Graham and Hillary Clinton, both on the same side, both supporting Sunni extremists against Assad. Now, Assad is no angel but most of the Christians in the country actually sided with Assad and had been a minority religion protected by Assad's government for decades. The Sunni extremists that we supported, or our government supported ... if those people had taken over, my fear is that their ideology would have been closer to the ISIS caliphate, than it would have been anything that the West is known. It's a very complicated situation.""

Paul noted the important difference between Syrian and Iraqi Kurds. ""The Syrian Kurds, their political ideology is socialism. In fact, the Kurdish Workers' Party is socialist and terrorist within Turkey. Interestingly, the Iraqi Kurds, who have been our friends and have some autonomy in Iraq, don't like the Syrian Kurds, and actually have an arrangement in Turkey where they've turned over Kurdish Worker Party terrorists back to Turkey,"" he added.

""The Iraqi Kurds have a good relationship with Turkey currently,"" continued Paul. ""I think the irony of this is, if you care about the Kurds, it actually may turn out that in the last 24 hours there is an alliance between Assad and the Kurds developing. And that maybe the Syrians can convince the Turks that they will patrol their country. There will be no Kurdish incursions into Turkey, but there need be no Turkish incursions into Syria. And maybe there could be a development of a semi-autonomous region ... maybe there could be some peace. ""

Paul argued that President Trump did not give Turkey the ""green light"" to invade. Rather, Turkey's President Erdoğan likely told the president he was planning to invade one way or the other, and President Trump had to decide whether or not it was wise to leave our 50 or so U.S soldiers in the way of a military invasion.

Coming War? President Trump hints at military action against Iran after Saudi oil attacks,"Saturday's attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities has crippled Saudi oil production and dramatically decreased oil supplies around the world -- and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo didn't hesitate to blame Iran for the ""unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply.""

A United States official confirmed on Tuesday that more than 20 cruise missiles and drones were launched from an Iranian base, according to CBS News.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Saudi Arabia is ""willing and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression,"" and President Donald Trump hinted at military action after hearing from the royal family in Riyadh.

Is a war between Iran and Saudi Arabia to come? And what does this mean for America? On Tuesday's radio program, Glenn Beck and his chief researcher, Jason Buttrill, discuss the latest Iran updates, whether President Trump will retaliate with force, and how this shows the Iranian mullahs are out for global bloodshed.

"'If we fall for this, we are FOOLS': Glenn Loury warns Dems are 'buying black votes by waving a bloody shirt of racism'","On ""The Rubin Report,"" Glenn Loury, professor of economics at Brown University, joined BlazeTV host Dave Rubin to talk about why it's controversial for a black man to be against diversity and inclusion training, affirmative action, and reparations.

Glenn also shared his thoughts on the narrative of systemic racism and racial disparities, why it's wrong, and how the Democratic Party pushes lies to get the support of black voters.

In this clip, Glenn shares his thoughts on how Democrats have fanned the flames of the racism bogeyman in a cynical attempt to get more of the black vote.

""They're buying black votes by waving a bloody shirt of racism, that's what they're doing,"" Glenn said of the Democratic Party. ""If we fall for this, we are fools. We're being led around with a ring through our noses. They show nothing but contempt for black people.""

Glenn argued that if black people in this country want to start eliminating disparities, they need to stop using the issue of slavery to play the victim as that mentality only encourages society to lower the bar for black America.

""The racial conflict coming out of [the issue of] slavery threatens the existence of the republic,"" Glenn said. ""Three hundred thousand people in a country of 3 million were slaughtered on the battlefields of the civil war. The consequence of which was the emancipation of the African slaves. Here we are now, 150 years later and the descendants of those slaves are citizens of the freest, richest and most powerful republic in the history of the world.""

Glenn also explained why he believes former President Barack Obama missed many opportunities to engage the country in an honest conversation about race, and called out former first lady Michelle Obama for saying that she fears for the safety of her daughters.

'This is the BIG LIE': Michael Knowles explains how 'woke' liberal politics actually cause​ systemic racism,"On ""The Rubin Report,"" BlazeTV host Dave Rubin sat down with The Daily Wire's Michael Knowles to discuss progressive politics, woke college campuses, and the collapse of our liberal institutions.

Knowles talked about what he called ""the big lie,"" or the idea that college students indoctrinated with progressive propaganda on campus would suddenly change once they entered the ""real world."" Instead, they are taking down institutions and destroying cities across the country.

""This is the big lie,"" he said. ""I'm looking around the real world and I'm seeing the consequences of those college campuses as the buildings are burning down all around the country.""

Knowles pointed out the flaws in the left's systemic racism arguments, since most powerful institutions are dominated by liberals.

""We've been told for the past few weeks that all of these protests are about institutional racism. But then it occurred to me, the left controls every major institution in America. They control the media, controls higher education and lower, controls Hollywood, controls Big Tech, controls administrative government. Basically, other than talk radio and some little parts of the internet, the left controls every institution. So, if there's institutional racism, whose fault is that?"" he asked.

Well, not only whose fault is it, but they are the ones putting it [racism] into the institutions,"" Rubin added. ""They are the ones making it systemic.""

Knowles and Rubin shared their thoughts on the conflicting interests of inter-sectional politics with the Black Lives Matter and the LGBTQ communities, and how even liberals seemed to be worried about the turn that ""woke politics"" are taking.

Chris rufo leaves marc lamont hill speechless with response to racist question,"On “The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin sat down for a ""roundtable"" discussion with Manhattan Institute senior fellow Christopher Rufo, Claremont Institute associate editor Spencer Klavan, and Newsweek opinion editor Josh Hammer about how the left tries to reduce people to racial or other ""metaphysical"" categories in order to pit them against each other and fuel ""eternal conflict.""

Dave brought up Rufo's interview with former CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill last year, in which the black TV host repeatedly tried to bait his white guest into making racist generalizations. Rufo argued against categorizing people based on racial identity, saying we should judge each other as individuals regardless of race. Obviously unsatisfied with his guest's refusal to take the bait, Hill repeatedly asked Rufo to ""name something you like about being white.""

A video clip from the interview began with Hill demanding, ""Name something positive that you like about being white.""

""There [are] a lot of documents that are floating around public schools that say things like timeliness, showing up on time, is a white supremacist value or a white-dominant value. Things like rationality, things like the enlightenment, things like objectivity — these are very strange things to be ascribed to a racial identity. My view is that these actually should be ascribed to every individual human being, every individual human being regardless of whatever racial category we impose on them,"" Rufo answered.

""That doesn't answer the question though,"" Hill interrupted. ""You're making strawmen about things that are ascribed to whiteness, that you think are wrongfully ascribed to whiteness. I'm saying if whiteness isn't a negative thing and there's something that you actually, and that whiteness actually shouldn't be constructed as all negative, name something ... that you believe is positive about being white.""

""Again, I don't buy into the framework that the world can be reduced into these metaphysical categories of whiteness and blackness. I think that's wrong. I think we should look at people as individuals. I think we should celebrate different people's accomplishments ... I think of myself as an individual human being with my own capabilities, and I would hope that we could both judge each other as individuals and come to common values on that basis,"" said Rufo.

After a moment of stunned silence, Hill conceded, ""Fair enough.""

Rufo told Dave that reducing people into categories and pitting them against one another is ""how the world has worked for most of its history"" and that ""it's actually a magical thing that we've been able to transcend it as much as we have.""

""I think we still have a way to go,"" he added. ""We need to kind of depolarize and rise above some of these divisions in this country. But I think we can do it, and I think that we have done it and we shouldn't let people like Mark Lamont Hill drag us back down. Whoever you are, if you are black, white, Asian, Latino, straight, or gay, let's treat each other equally and respectfully and give each other a sense of dignity as individuals. Because what we learned in the 20th century, just like the centuries before, is that when you provide people with totalizing identity categories, things can get very ugly and very destructive in a very quick manner.""

Mark Levin warns 'we have to start using the Left's tactics AGAINST the Left' — here's why,"On the most recent episode of ""The Rubin Report,"" Dave Rubin spoke with fellow BlazeTV host Mark Levin about the lesser-known origins of Karl Marx and why liberal Democrats need to join conservatives to save the U.S. from the radical Left.

Mark highlighted the importance of the U.S. Constitution and what people misunderstand when interpreting its meaning. He said he fears that critical race theory and the ideas of cultural Marxism may be leading us to a constitutional crisis. Then he shared the true history of Karl Marx: a man who was a supporter of classical liberalism before he became an angry man suffering from social alienation, living off of subsidies from his wealthy friend Friedrich Engels who turned his attention to class conflict.

Dave and Mark discussed how progressives have fundamentally altered public schools and higher education in America, attacking ""Americanism"" and erasing history to change the way people look at our country.

Dave asked what we can do to push back against the ""slow march"" of Marxist ideology in our institutions in an age of social media and culture war.

""We have to start using the Left's tactics against the Left,"" Mark answered. ""I never used to believe that. I used to preach free market capitalism, and I still believe that ... but tactically, we're going to have to get active. We're going to have to do things we've never done before because Marxism is a constant revolution. Conservatism or constitutional conservatism is a stand-in-place. And so they are always on the move, and we are always on defense — if we're doing anything at all.""

""The Democrat Party is always [figuratively] breaking windows. The Republican Party is always sitting in rocking chairs, you know, and just watching,"" he continued. ""This has to change ... I think that's why a lot of people like Trump, wittingly or not, because he would break windows when they break windows.

""More and more of us in our everyday lives are going to have to become activists — I don't mean violent activist, I mean activists in the everyday things we do, where we choose to buy things, when we talk to neighbors to form groups to go to school boards and these sorts of things, start pressuring our legislatures so we have friendly legislatures to pass laws like they have in Florida to address Big Tech,"" Levin said.

""We need to be on offense. We need to bring litigation. We need to throw as much against them as they throw against us, and do everything we possible can ... we're up against street Marxists or mobs or whatever you want to call them, that want to destroy our society,"" he added, noting how many of history's communist revolutions had the same goal.

'This is a symptom of much deeper issues': Tulsi Gabbard reacts to Capitol breach,"Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) joined Dave Rubin on the ""The Rubin Report,"" to talk about the storming of the U.S. Capitol, how we could have prevented the political turmoil we find ourselves in now, and what we can do to de-escalate the political-polarization of our country in the future.

""It's heartbreaking to see this happening at our nation's Capitol,"" Tulsi said of Wednesday's breach of the U.S. Capitol building. ""But it is also indicative — this is a symptom of much deeper issues and challenges that have been stewing for a long time.""

Tulsi pointed to growing ""conflict culture,"" which she believes started online and has now become ""embodied"" offline, and suggested politicians, media, and Big Tech have all played a part in fueling divisiveness for their own benefit.

""So you see what is happening ... at the United States Capitol before our very eyes is the manifestation of the symptoms of these deeper problems,"" she said.

Tulsi also discussed her proposed ""Securing America's Elections Act"" she proposed and how it could have prevented the uncertainty many voters now feel toward the integrity of the electoral process, and shares the reason she decided to step down from the House of Representatives.

Joy Reid Ukraine racism,"MSNBC's Joy Reid argued on “The ReidOut” Monday that the only reason ""the world"" cares about the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is because it's happening to a ""white and largely Christian"" nation.

""As the world watches the devastation unfold in Ukraine, nearly 4,000 miles away, another crisis is deepening that we don’t hear much about in the U.S., and that is the war in Yemen,"" Reid began the segment.

""The coverage of Ukraine has revealed a pretty radical disparity in how human Ukrainians look and feel to western media compared to their browner and blacker counterparts, with some reporters using very telling comparisons in their analyses of the war,"" she continued.



Reid then played a short video montage of 3 reporters, 2 from European networks, describing Ukraine as a “European” nation and the Ukrainian people as ""European.""

""Let’s face it. The world is paying attention because this is happening in Europe. If this was happening anywhere else, would we be seeing the same outpour of support and compassion? We don’t need to ask ourselves if our response would be the same if Russia unleashed their horror on a country that wasn’t white and largely Christian.”

Putin pretaped declaration of war on Ukraine,"According to reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""live"" broadcast declaring war against Ukraine was pre-taped on Monday, sparking concerns that the large-scale invasion was already planned but ""postponed for reasons unknown.""

Putin announced a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine and issued a chilling warning for President Joe Biden and NATO not to intervene during what appeared to be a live broadcast on state TV Thursday. But according to several reports, the announcement was actually filmed three days earlier.

""Putin's speech about the declaration of war was recorded on the evening of February 21, on Monday. You can verify this by downloading the video from the Kremlin website and checking its properties,"" read a translated tweet from Russia's Novaya Gazeta.





Additionally, Russian-based Conflict Intelligence Team noted on Twitter that ""Putin's clothes [during Thursday's broadcast] match his clothes at the meeting of the Russian Security Council on February 21 ….""





""This suggests that a large-scale invasion of Ukraine was planned for February 22, but was postponed for reasons unknown to us,"" CIT added.",https://www.theblaze.com/shows/the-rubin-report/rubin-levin-stop-marxism,2022-02-24
