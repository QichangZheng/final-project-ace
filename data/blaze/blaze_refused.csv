Chip Roy Maxine Waters,"Congressman Chip Roy (R-Texas) is known for dropping truth bombs on Capitol Hill, and earlier this week, he dropped a doozie on one of his colleagues from across the aisle.

During debate over a congressional resolution to formally condemn ""the horrors of socialism,"" Roy confronted Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) about past statements that she had made threatening to nationalize the oil industry.

The exchange appeared to be quite uncomfortable for the California Democrat, as she tried to deflect by changing the topic to Social Security and Medicare. Roy refused to let up, continually asking whether she will renounce her previous statements in support of socializing segments of the economy.

Watch the full exchange in the video below:

"Georgia school board passes plan to arm more personnel, despite attempts from vocal opponents to shut down meeting: 'Delay the vote!'","The Cobb County School Board, representing the second-largest school district in Georgia, has just passed a plan that will permit some non-law-enforcement staff members to carry guns. However, some objected so strongly to the idea that they attempted to shut down the meeting through shouts and other non-violent disruptions.

On Thursday night, the school board passed a measure that will allow staff members who are not certified police officers to volunteer to carry a concealed firearm on campus. To qualify, they must first complete the proper training and pass an annual criminal background check. The measure explicitly prohibits teachers from carrying guns.

""I am not in favor of arming teachers. However, I am in favor of investigating all options so we could hire retired military, retired law enforcement,"" Superintendent Chris Ragsdale said at the school board meeting.

“This policy gives us other opportunities to enhance and increase the number of school resource officers in our district.""

According to Ragsdale, the district currently has only 67 officers to protect more than 107,000 students in 112 schools.

However, many opponents are concerned that the measure will jeopardize the safety of schoolchildren and perhaps even the stability of race relations between students, teachers, and parents.

“This is not the solution,"" said one woman who claimed to have a daughter in the district. ""The goal is to be more safe. Guns simply do not belong in schools unless they are operated by trained law enforcement professionals.”

""How are our children who are already traumatized by other elementary schools supposed to know that someone in school who is armed is safe if they are not a school resource officer?"" asked another woman.

One man told the board: ""And now we put out there something that I think will accelerate the division between this school board and black parents.""

A sizeable number of meeting attendees who were opposed to the measure attempted to shut down the meeting. ""Delay the vote!"" they shouted, hoping to force members to hold the vote at the August meeting instead.

The shouters managed to disrupt the meeting but not to thwart the vote. The measure passed, although it's unclear whether the final vote was 4-2 or 4-3. There are reportedly four Republicans and three Democrats on the board.

Following the heated meeting, the chairwoman of the Cobb County Republican Party, Salleigh Grubbs, released a statement that reads in part, ""The attempt of a few far-left members of an anti-gun group to hijack our school board meeting last night is incredibly naïve. We live in a dangerous world and our children must be protected. More highly trained public safety professionals who can protect our students from intruders is good for our schools. Period.""

The state of Georgia passed a law in 2014 that gives school districts the option to allow teachers to carry guns on campus. State law also protects school employees from punishment if they refuse to carry.",https://www.theblaze.com/blaze-news/georgia-school-district-guns,2022-07-15
"Whitlock: Blame Bill de Blasio, not Kyrie Irving or Kevin Durant, for Brooklyn’s epic failure","At some point this week, possibly tonight at the Barclay Center, the Boston Celtics will eliminate Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, Ben Simmons, Steve Nash, and the Brooklyn Nets from the NBA playoffs.



The Nets, who started the season with former MVP James Harden on the roster, were a preseason favorite to win it all. Pundits thought Harden, Irving, and Durant could, at least for one season, duplicate the mini-dynasty of Durant, Steph Curry, and Klay Thompson achieved at Golden State.

Instead, these Nets will go down as the biggest flop in NBA history. They finished the regular season just six games above .500, backed into the playoffs with a play-in victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers, and are down 0-3 to the Celtics in a first-round playoff series.

Yes, I believe these Nets are more disappointing than the LeBron James-Russell Westbrook-Anthony Davis Los Angeles Lakers team that couldn’t even qualify for the play-in tournament. The Lakers team was overhyped, a victim of foolish expectations. The addition of Westbrook and his cancerous attitude to any roster kills any legitimate shot at contending at a high level. I didn’t find this year’s Lakers team disappointing. Their failure was inevitable.

The Nets could have been great. One man ruined the Brooklyn Nets: Bill de Blasio. The former lunatic mayor of New York City destroyed the Nets with his insane vaccine mandate for New Yorkers.

The autopsies on the Brooklyn Nets are already being filed. The causes of death center on Irving’s refusal to get vaccinated, Durant’s poor performance against the Celtics, Nash’s inexperienced coaching, and Simmons’ refusal to even suit up.

Bill de Blasio is being allowed to escape blame.

The Nets are dying because of their lack of continuity. Throughout the entire season, the team was in a constant state of flux. Irving couldn’t play in home games because of de Blasio’s stupid mandate. Meanwhile, unvaccinated players on opposing teams could visit New York and play. The rule never made an ounce of sense. It was authoritarian, illogical, and grossly unfair. It harmed people. It hurt Irving and the Nets.

Irving’s status played a role in Harden demanding a trade. Brooklyn’s Big Three of Harden, Irving, and Durant – conceived in January 2021 – played 16 games together before dissolving in February 2022. The Nets acquired Simmons in exchange for Harden. Nearly three months later, Simmons has yet to take the court for Brooklyn.

It’s difficult for me to blame Steve Nash for Brooklyn’s failure. He’s never had a chance to coach his full team. Durant and Irving are still learning to play with each other. Simmons is afraid of failure, a deadly sin for a professional athlete. He would never have been a member of the Nets if de Blasio had acted appropriately.

Establishment media will not make this point, because it no longer speaks truth to power. It protects power.

In the wake of the Nets' failure, there’s a major obvious takeaway for professional athletes: Avoid New York and other cities/states controlled by politicians who believe government is more important than the individual.

Irving and Durant need to escape from New York. They should watch the 1981 movie “Escape from New York” for some inspiration.

The United States is at war with China and the Soviet Union and decides to turn crime-ridden New York City into a maximum-security prison. It’s quite similar to modern America. We’re in a cold war with China and Russia, and New York is crime-ridden and run by prison wardens masquerading as politicians.

Back to the movie. Kurt Russell’s character, “Snake,” is hired to extract the president from Manhattan. It’s a thrilling movie. It ends with the president half-heartedly acknowledging the people who sacrificed their lives to save him and Snake embarrassing the president. The point is smart people should avoid placing their faith in the government.

Kyrie had every right to decline taking the vaccine. He’s young and in ideal health. Only an authoritarian would pass a law punishing citizens for their individual medical decisions.

The way New York City and the state of New York handled COVID should alarm its citizens, especially when you compare it to Florida. Had Durant, Harden, and Irving joined forces on the Miami Heat or Orlando Magic, they would have avoided New York’s vaccine insanity and high taxes. They would be a title contender.

Creative people and innovators are fleeing New York and California for Texas and Florida. Elon Musk and Tesla abandoned California for Texas. Joe Rogan escaped California. Led by New York City, the state of New York has suffered record population loss since the start of the COVID pandemic. In a 12-month period, 3.5 percent of NYC’s population migrated elsewhere.



With the uncertainty of COVID and other viruses, why would any elite athlete choose to play in New York? The city’s leaders have learned nothing from the pandemic. Eric Adams, the new mayor, is capable of repeating every mistake de Blasio made. Why wouldn’t he? He won’t be held accountable by corporate media.

Bill de Blasio enacted a nonsensical policy, and all season we listened to sports pundits berate Irving for refusing to follow it. Irving stood on moral principle and sacrificed a season. He’s the closet thing we’ve ever seen to Muhammad Ali. Too bad the media didn’t rally to support him.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/brooklyn-nets-failure-de-blasio,2022-04-25
"Squires: Americans need truth, logic, and courage to free our institutions from 'pregnant men' and 'female penises'","The recent exchange between Professor Khiara Bridges and Senator Josh Hawley provides an important lesson about the state of America’s most important institutions. Bridges, who teaches at the University of California's Berkeley School of Law, was invited to testify at hearing on abortion access. Hawley asked her whether her repeated use of the phrase “person with the capacity for pregnancy” was her way of saying “woman.”

Over the next minute, she claimed “trans men” and “non-binary” people are also capable of pregnancy, stated Hawley’s line of questioning was “transphobic,” and claimed his refusal to affirm the idea of male pregnancy was tied to the suicide rates among trans people. The media outlets that hailed Bridges for “owning” Senator Hawley make our current state of affairs even clearer.

America’s most important institutions have lost public trust because of the corruption, incompetence, and political ideology of the people leading them.

We live at a point in human history when the most wealthy, educated, and powerful people in the country will not acknowledge the most basic truths about men and women. Their attempts to redefine reality cannot build or preserve anything. Destruction, both literally and figuratively, follows them like a shadow.

Attempts to rationalize the sudden acceptance of “pregnant men” and “women with penises” have two certain outcomes: brain rot from the inability to think logically and spiritual demoralization from the unwillingness to speak truthfully. Neither one is healthy for the future of the republic.

Smugness and self-importance aside, the power the ruling class exerts over our lives makes these changes even harder to accept.

In 2021, Americans were told that COVID vaccines would prevent infection and transmission. This claim was repeated by Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, as well as Bill Gates and President Biden. They were obviously wrong.

Leaders with humility and wisdom would admit their error and chart a new course. The people who run our institutions did the opposite. Over the next year, Merriam-Webster changed the definition of “vaccine,” people were fired for disobeying mandates, and the media attempted to silence dissenters.

My trust in our national COVID response was shaken much earlier. On June 5, 2020, more than 1,000 public health professionals signed an open letter arguing that large protests against racial injustice should be allowed, even as some people still couldn’t leave home to work.

The letter stated, “White supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to COVID-19.” The signatories clearly understood COVID’s political leanings, because they later clarified that their letter should not be taken as an approval of all protests, particularly ones against stay-home orders.

Their message was clear: Visiting your family may prove deadly, but having 10,000 people crammed cheek by jowl into the town square is fine if they have the right political views.

If the public health establishment was COVID’s biggest loser in public trust, the public education system took the silver medal. One year of unions fighting to keep schools closed and parents seeing what their children were being taught did more to advance school choice than decades of conservative political rhetoric.

Likewise, police abolitionists wish they could be as effective at undermining conservative confidence in law enforcement as images of an Ohio mom being tased and handcuffed at an outdoor football game and a New York City man being assaulted by police officers for violating social distancing rules. The videos of police inaction in Uvalde have only compounded the damage COVID did to the public image of police.

The leaders of our institutions have a vested interest in slowing – and reversing – their decline. In the near future, saying that you graduated from Harvard or Stanford won’t confer any prestige. It will be an indication that you’re a sucker who could have paid half the price to a state university if your goal was to “learn” that men can get pregnant.

Professor Bridges has an impressive set of credentials, but her attempts at linguistic and emotional manipulation during her congressional testimony were a lesson in trans activism 101. Any institution that lends its reputation, whether through credentialing or employment, is implicated in her attempts to frame biological truth as an existential harm to trans people.

The truth is that higher rates of suicide, anxiety, and depression should be expected among people whose minds are in conflict with their bodies. Civil wars – whether within the body politic or the human body – always have casualties. The mental health concerns associated with transgenderism are caused by a denial of reality, not insufficient affirmation. It is neither loving nor kind to encourage a person to live by lies.

External attacks often strengthen institutional resolve. Internal arguments are rendered insignificant in the face of an advancing enemy. Survival always trumps unanimity. Conversely, no amount of external whitewashing and advocacy can prop up an institution that is dead on the inside. No amount of browbeating can convince people that up is down or 2+2 = 5. They may mimic the right words, but that does not mean they believe the lies.



College professors, elected officials, CEOs, journalists, and activists assume their advanced degrees, hefty salaries, and political power are enough to justify the trust we place in their words. They are clearly mistaken. They blame the public for being insufficiently compliant, but their criticism is being aimed in the wrong direction. This problem won’t be solved by putting us under a microscope. If correction is what they seek, it is time they look in the mirror.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-america-needs-truth-courage,2022-07-15
Squires: Our ancestors didn't fight for freedom so that black leaders could attack the family and promote abortion,"“This is not what our ancestors wanted for you.”

I saw this message in response to something I said last week about the relative silence of corporate media outlets when the deaths of black men don’t advance the left’s political interests.

I am used to people not actually engaging the arguments I make in my writing. This response, however, prompted me to consider a very important question: What would the generations of black men and women who contributed so richly to this country’s history and culture think about the social condition of black people in America today?

My initial thought is that they would be grateful for the progress we have made as a nation since our founding. Despite the horrors of slavery and legal segregation, black people in America today are more prosperous and enjoy a higher standard of living than any other people of African descent at any point in history.

I also think the black people who built families, churches, homes, businesses, institutions, and communities in the face of overt racism would be extremely disappointed with the path their descendants are on today.

One of the main reasons is that the politicians, pundits, performers, professors, and preachers who compose the “Afristocracy” (i.e. the black leadership class) today have become the single greatest impediment to large-scale progress in the black community.

The explanation is quite simple: They abandoned the values that were passed down to them and they have no vision to pass on to subsequent generations.

Black leadership in previous generations was powered by the church and the belief that the Bible is a model for earthly liberation, a source of eternal hope, and the basis for moral instruction. The civil rights movement was powered by people, most notably Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who made their appeals using biblical language.

The post-Christian black leadership embodied in the founders of Black Lives Matter has been a failure. Its practitioners use the same language of liberation as the previous generations, but they believe freedom will be achieved through the equitable redistribution of resources. Gone are the days in which black leaders spoke the language of transcendent moral truths. That framework has been replaced by an obsession with power and transactional politics.

The leaders of the BLM movement identify as radical feminists, lesbians, and Marxists. Their ideological foundation rests on the belief that men and marriage oppress women. It should come as no surprise that they listed the destruction of the nuclear family as one of their guiding principles. Dead black men helped Alicia Garza and Patrisse Cullors strike book deals and purchase expensive homes. Men who advocate biblical sexual ethics and believe the natural family (i.e. husband, wife, and children) is the foundation of civilization are not nearly as valuable to them.

Many black churches preach a false gospel of “social justice” that is indistinguishable from that of the BLM atheists. They too are consumed with acquiring political power. Men like Rev. William Barber stand in churches and promote abortion as a human right. These churches are ready for Souls to the Polls but don’t preach repentance from sin. They have their ballots ready and their Bibles closed.

The abandonment of the biblical worldview has had a downstream effect on the pursuit of knowledge as well. At one point in American history, it was a crime to teach slaves how to read and write. The landmark Brown v. Board of Education case was the most prominent example of black leaders fighting for full citizenship through education. Now college is where black students go to unlearn eternal truths and forsake timeless wisdom.

Marc Lamont Hill, professor at Temple University, is the first academic I heard argue that men can get pregnant.

Michael Eric Dyson, professor at Georgetown University, is the man who diminished the importance of fathers on MSNBC, then went on Fox to encourage white people to create individual reparations accounts to atone for their privilege and address racial inequality.

Brittney Cooper, professor at Rutgers University, is the person who said the black community does not need nuclear families to thrive.

Carl Hart, professor at Columbia University, is the man who writes approvingly of his own heroin use and said he would rather his children interact with drugs than with the police.

Greg Carr, professor at Howard University, is the person who said that women leaving Texas to seek abortions were channeling the spirit of Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad.

I have a difficult time believing that the black students attending historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the late 1800s or integrating into predominantly white schools in the 1900s ever thought this would be the fate of their intellectual progeny.

The corruption of these black intellectuals reflects the inevitable result of disconnecting knowledge from morality. The Afristocracy has also become a barrier to progress because it has no affirmative vision for the people its members claim to represent.

When you love someone, you do everything you can to help them. Sometimes that looks like a word of encouragement as they struggle with a difficult situation. At other times, love is expressed through hard truths spoken with care and compassion. The Bible says a father disciplines a son he loves but ignores an illegitimate child. This is why families have interventions for relatives struggling with substance abuse.

A desire to help people live healthy and productive lives is also why people go into the field of medicine. If one thinks about America today like a hospital, it is clear that the most educated black cultural physicians today focus exclusively on the patients with the most resources and privilege, while leaving the disenfranchised and destitute waiting in the hospital waiting room.

Dr. Ibram X. Kendi speaks the language of equity, but his surgical center says “Whites Only.” He spends his days treating NPR listeners for their metastatic racism. He thinks he can help black people by healing white people.

He and his colleagues tell their privileged patients what books to buy and offer to help reshape every aspect of society in their image – for a modest fee. Like Ta-Nehisi Coates, the Afristocracy believes the main problem black people have is white supremacy.

What he and his peers will never do is say anything to black people that requires us to change anything that we do. The most common messages from black leaders today to the black masses are reminders to vote and encouragement to protest.

It would be a pleasant surprise to hear a black politician, social commentator, or intellectual on MSNBC say anything close to, “Black lives won’t matter until we stop killing each other in the streets.” Any attempts to honestly discuss violent crime in big cities are typically met with deflections about “white-on-white violence” or claims that redlining and gentrification are the real culprits forcing black men to murder one another.

This is the Afristocracy’s dirty little secret: Black leaders put all their time, talent, and treasure into fixing white people. It is easier to get the NAACP to do a campaign with B-list white actors to “take responsibility” for racism than it is to get famous black men to promote the beauty and benefits of marriage and fatherhood.

One of the biggest steps the people in the black leadership class could take to correct their ways is to simply preach what they practice. These people brunch on Sundays, vacation in Martha’s Vineyard, put their children in private schools, attend exclusive wine tastings, hire nannies, have monthly appointments with cleaning ladies, collect art, and invest in real estate.

Their lives are a testament to hard work, focus, and dedication, but they are so committed to painting themselves as oppressed that they don’t say anything about what they did to get where they are. For them, it’s always about what other people must do to rescue black people. These are people with bulging waistlines who refuse to tell beggars where they found bread.

I have a hard time believing this is what our ancestors would have wanted. Black men and women didn’t marry in secret during slavery or put their families back together after emancipation so that over 70% of their descendants would be born to unwed couples.



Black men didn’t resist the hangman’s noose to have their great-grandsons gunning down fellow image-bearers in the streets.

Ruby Bridges didn’t withstand racist taunts and threats to desegregate an elementary school in New Orleans so that black students today could be taught that math is racist or some kids have no gender.

None of these things are what the ancestors wanted for us. And they are definitely not what we should pass on to our descendants.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-ancestors-fought-for-freedom,2022-08-26
Squires: Better to be an Uncle Tom than a Sambo,"The most important fight going on in the black community today is not between Democrats and Republicans, progressives and conservatives, or even the Bloods and the Crips.



No, the future of the black community will be determined by the intensifying conflict between the “Uncle Toms” and the “Sambos.”

This may seem like a strange declaration for the start of Black History Month, but the prospects are grim for any community in which men who advocate for personal responsibility are derided and women who promote loose sexual morals are extolled.

The term “Uncle Tom” has long been used as an insult against black people who are seen as subservient, passive participants in the oppression of black people. In practice, the epithet has basically become synonymous with black conservatives in general and other black people who are insufficiently critical of systemic racism and white supremacy.

The term comes from the titular character in Harriet Beecher Stowe’s 1852 novel, ""Uncle Tom’s Cabin."" Stowe drew inspiration for Uncle Tom from the life of an author, abolitionist, and minister named Josiah Henson. In the book, Tom is a man whose faith in God sustains him through enslavement to multiple masters. He is eventually sold to Simon Legree, a cruel man who uses two black overseers – Sambo and Quimbo – to keep the slaves in line.

Legree is the antithesis of Tom. He is willing to use human beings to advance his own interests – whether picking cotton or his sexual desires – and has abandoned the faith his mother tried to impart to him.

Tom is a Christian who refuses to let the condition of his physical body destroy his soul. He refuses to whip a fellow slave he helps in the cotton field, even though it means he receives a brutal beating from the overseers. His final act of sacrifice is accepting death at the hands of Sambo and Quimbo rather than provide the whereabouts of his friends Cassy and Emmeline.

I don’t typically use slavery metaphors in my writing. I have a healthy respect for history and don’t believe an athlete making $40 million per year is “in chains” because he doesn’t get to engage in political protests on his team’s time and dime. I also understand the power of language and know how to distinguish an inconvenience from an atrocity.

But if the left is going to use “Uncle Tom” as an insult against black conservatives, it is worth exploring whether dynamics between characters in the novel can actually be mapped onto contemporary discourse on race. Larry Elder did something very similar in his documentary ""Uncle Tom"" that reflects on the history of black conservatism in America.

None of these efforts have cracked the thick layer of ignorance for the people who see themselves as the gatekeepers of black culture.

Florida Rep. Byron Donalds (R) recently received a copy of ""Uncle Tom’s Cabin"" at his D.C. office, a gesture he believes was meant as an insult because of his conservative views.

He is far from alone.

Former MSNBC host Tiffany Cross called Justice Clarence Thomas “Tom” and “Justice Clayton Bigsby” one month before she was fired. Samuel L. Jackson called Thomas “Uncle Clarence” after the Dobbs ruling that struck down Roe v. Wade. The phrase “Uncle Tim” trended on Twitter after Senator Tim Scott gave a rebuttal to President Biden’s first address to Congress in 2021.

Only someone with an inverted moral compass would suggest that a black man willing to give his life so that others could escape slavery is a sellout. The black progressives who have abandoned the faith of their ancestors fit the bill. Their forebears fought to build and sustain families in the face of discrimination, but “black liberation” activists today claim the nuclear family upholds white supremacy while abortion is freedom.

A black feminist professor called black men considering a vote for Trump in 2020 “traitorous MFers,” but told a white liberal man he wasn’t being “helpful” when he said black women are smarter and more fit to lead than their male counterparts.

This is the life of a Sambo: whip Tom and appease Simon Legree.

Many people would sneer at this suggestion, but the average writer for the Root spends a lot more time focused on the beliefs and behaviors of white people than on the steps black people can take to improve our own communities. These writers claim to be proud of their blackness, but their entire world rests on receiving attention and affirmation from white people. They need white people to read their books, post black squares, and say “black lives matter.”

Like Sambo and Quimbo, the people who have turned race into an industry depend on their “oppressors” for food, shelter, and employment. The creators of Race 2 Dinner and the countless DEI consultants that have popped up in the last few years would go bankrupt if white liberals were ever delivered from the spirit of ethnic guilt brought on by the sins of the Simon Legrees in America’s past.

Uncle Tom, by contrast, had dignity, self-respect, and a set of principles he was willing to die for. The people who use his name as a punch line twerk in front of Planned Parenthood, use sex to get black men to vote, and make millions from murder music. They endorse values that lead to more death and dysfunction in the black community, all on behalf of white liberal masters who profit from the chaos.

Subconsciously, they hate Uncle Tom for the same reason Simon Legree did: His moral standards feel like judgment on their lifestyle. Tom never allowed his circumstances or the behavior of other people to rob him of his dignity or change his character. His willingness to forgive Sambo, Quimbo, and Simon Legree highlights the power of the Christian message. The freest man in any room is the one whose capacity to forgive is grounded in the knowledge that he is forgiven.



Black people see the vicious attacks from black progressives and white liberals aimed at anyone who holds biblical views on sex and marriage, fights for the sanctity of life, opposes self-destructive culture, and wants every child to grow up in a loving, stable two-parent home.

Many approve. The ones who don’t get this message: Don’t get out of line or we’ll whip you publicly too. The vitriol aimed at Clarence Thomas and Tony Dungy is meant to demean them and silence other black people who want to speak up in defense of faith and family.

I have a message for anyone tempted to succumb to that fear: Choose to be an Uncle Tom in a world full of Sambos.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-better-to-be-an-uncle-tom-than-a-sambo,2023-02-03
Squires: David French shows Christians that anti-Trumpism can become an idol just as easily as Trump worship,"David French is at it again. The conservative commentator whose screeds against white evangelical voters have become as commonplace on Sundays as hymns and communion has been busy lately doing what he does best: chastising Christians and blaming Donald Trump for America’s woes.

Within the past five days, French, the father of what I call “drag queen conservatism,” came out in favor of the deceptively titled “Respect for Marriage Act,” urged the pro-life movement to break from “Trumpism,” and characterized the evangelical “far right” on Twitter as being a “broken” mishmash of insurrectionists and sex abuse apologists.

As is often the case, his critics – many of whom I know and respect – pushed back on his new policy positions and old cultural critiques. I agree with many of their core arguments, but the trajectory of David French’s public profile provides a much more important lesson for Christians.

French is probably the only person who thinks about Donald Trump more than the former president himself. The result is that he has made an idol – adorned in a cloak of self-righteousness – out of anti-Trumpism. This obsession has transformed his distinct “salt and light” Christian commentary in the public square into a dim, bland version of cultural engagement marginally distinguishable from the secular writers in corporate media.

His belief that drag queens in public libraries are a “blessing of liberty” is the most infamous example of his tendency to defend the indefensible in the name of morally neutral constitutional protections. I have yet to hear him offer a hypothetical defense of “blackface story hour” on similar First Amendment grounds and highly doubt he would ever make such an argument.

French sees differing opinions on drag queens in libraries and schools, the redefinition of marriage, and the castration of confused children as normal in a functioning democracy. But somehow he believes refusing the COVID shot and believing there was a “shadow campaign” to influence the 2020 election – the official position of Time magazine – each constitutes a mortal threat to our neighbors and an attack on our democracy.

Like many conservatives who are preoccupied with being respected by the left, French focuses on secondary legal issues as opposed to first-order fights about defining reality when it comes to our most contentious political battles.

Is religious freedom a concern for Christians who don’t want to codify Obergefell? Absolutely. But the bigger issue for these believers is Congress' attempt to redefine an institution that predates civil government.

The same principle holds in other areas as well. The main issue with making ""gender identity"" synonymous with sex is not the threat to girls' sports or the violation of parental rights in schools. It’s understanding that a country that can’t define the words “man” and “woman” won’t be a country for long.

It is impossible to communicate, reason, and create laws without clearly defined terms. Christians who cede ground on “Genesis issues” related to sex, sexuality, life, and marriage for the sake of political convenience or reputation management delude themselves into thinking they are more just, loving, and kind than God.

French is a virtuoso when it comes to the conservative slander two-step. He starts by tying mainstream conservatives to fringe elements on the right who actually have made an idol out of Trump. Then he deftly sidesteps legitimate criticism by ignoring people who challenge the substance of his arguments and amplifying the personal attacks he receives online. This allows him to simultaneously paint himself as a victim and avoid defending his ideas.

He has also become quite skilled in the art of triangulation. He articulates the types of views on sexual ethics and abortion that grant him legitimacy as a conservative commentator while using his access to regime liberal platforms like the New York Times and the Atlantic to flog conservatives for their ignorance and incivility. French’s default position is always the same: tickle to the left and throw haymakers to the right, all while lecturing the hoi polloi about their tone.

Donald Trump (aka “the Orange Menace”) had the same effect on David French as he did on Ta-Nehisi Coates. Both men used to be insightful social commentators who challenged convention and made readers think. Now both are shells of their former selves.

For Coates, the election of Trump was a “whitelash” from “deplorables” in direct response to eight years of black power embodied by Barack Obama. Now he has a far less prominent place in public discourse, evidenced by attempts to equate Jordan Peterson’s appeals to young men about ordering their lives with Nazis.



For French, evangelicals who voted for Trump betrayed their religious convictions and discredited the faith in front of a watching world. It appears he sees his ministry as putting those people in their place for as long as it takes for them to repent of that sin.

Everyone can see what is going on now, and many believers are tired of being attacked in public. They realize that a man who accuses Christians with different political beliefs of sowing seeds of political violence is the last person who should be giving lectures on winsomeness and gentle speech.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-david-french-anti-trumpism-idol-trump-worship,2022-11-22
Squires: Democrats silenced the lambs so they can eat the sheep,"Americans have a curious fascination with serial killers, evidenced by the popularity of television dramas like ""Criminal Minds"" and intense interest in the real-life stories of Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, and David Berkowitz.



So it should come as no surprise that Jeffrey Dahmer, one of the most infamous serial killers of the last half-century, is being profiled in a new Netflix series. Dahmer murdered and dismembered a total of seventeen men and boys between 1978 and 1991. He also admitted to devouring the flesh of some of his victims and performing sex acts on their corpses.

Netflix has become embroiled in controversy over this project, not for potentially romanticizing a cannibalistic, necrophilic serial killer, but for highlighting the fact that Dahmer was gay. The media giant is so concerned about not getting on the wrong side of the culture wars that it removed the “LGBTQ” tag on the series.

I’m surprised by the initial decision to put the tag on the series. But the response, both on social media and from Netflix, reveals an ugly truth about where the political left has driven American culture in the past 30 years.

It would be virtually impossible to remake ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" the Oscar-winning psychological thriller that also involved a serial killer, sexual dysfunction, and cannibalism.

When the film debuted in 1991, Democrats were the party of Clarice Starling, the glass-ceiling-shattering FBI agent. Starling formed an alliance with Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a cannibalistic forensic psychiatrist, to track down a woman-skinning serial killer named Buffalo Bill.

In the last decade, by normalizing transgenderism, sympathizing with depraved criminals, and eradicating obvious distinctions between men and women, Democrats abandoned Clarice to champion Bill and Lecter.

The left’s new world order prioritizes violent criminals and transitioning men above our wives, daughters, and mothers.

Buffalo Bill’s gender dysphoria would actually make him a sympathetic figure if the film was remade today. Born Jame Gumb, his penchant for killing overweight women to make a “suit” from their skin would be blamed on non-affirming parents who refused to let him transition to “Jamie” as a child. Viewers would be left wondering how many lives could have been saved if Bill received “gender-affirming care” as a teen.

Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a prolific serial killer in his own right, would also benefit from society’s new rules. He would probably be recast as an actor “of color,” a strategic move that would explain why prosecutors fight to have him released early from prison. As is the left’s tendency, his crimes would also be explained in systemic terms. In Dr. Lecter’s case, a sternly worded email from a white colleague during his medical residency caused him to “snap” and develop a taste for human flesh.

True to the values of our day, the elevation of gender-confused men and sadistic criminals would be matched by the demotion of the original film’s female protagonist.

Given today’s political climate, Clarice Starling would begin the film winning over the audience with her intelligence, wit, and bravery. Her fortunes would take a turn for the worse, however, when she misgendered Buffalo Bill by not using his preferred pronouns during an intense interrogation.

The questioning would stop immediately as several diversity, inclusion, and equity staffers in the FBI burst into the room. Starling would be chastised and removed from the case until she completed mandatory gender identity training.

In a plot twist, her FBI superiors would replace her with a colleague who happens to identify as non-binary and use “they/them” pronouns.

Anyone who thinks I am overexaggerating how much our society has changed is living in a fantasy world of their own creation.

Democrats in the United States and liberals across the globe have completely reshaped cultural norms and public policy to cater to the needs of individuals with serious psychological problems. Instead of adhering to reality and traditional definitions of male and female, activists and ideologues used the delusions of a tiny minority to unleash confusion on the masses.

A transgender teacher in Canada named Kayla Lemieux recently went viral for sporting gigantic prosthetic breasts in front of his students. Lemieux is using his classroom to sport his “woman suit,” and students are his unconsenting audience. The school wrote in support of the teacher and let parents know it is working to create an “equitable” environment without discrimination based on gender expression.

Other darlings of the left include Dylan Mulvaney, a man who thinks he is a teenage girl, as well as Jeffrey Marsh, a husky-voiced social media influencer who identifies as non-binary.

Their video together on TikTok has over 275,000 likes.

This doesn’t even take into account the people within the current Biden administration whose delusions, kinks, and fetishes make them more employable in a Democratic administration than someone who publicly affirms a traditional view of marriage.

This is the modern left. The women who spent years fighting for female representation in business, media, politics, and athletics have given way to men who fantasize about being women. Every woman who wants to remain in good standing must affirm ideas she knows are contrary to science and nature.

The same people who embrace radical gender ideology also tend to think that career criminals are another victim group in need of public advocacy.

A man named Waheed Foster viciously attacked a woman in a New York City subway station last week, leaving her physically bruised and psychologically scarred. Foster, 41, has a lengthy rap sheet, including an arrest for beating his own grandmother to death in 1995 and stabbing a 50-year-old woman in the cheek and shoulder in 2010.

The remake of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" would have a very different ending from the original.

Buffalo Bill would be released from prison after one year to complete his transition to “Jamie” through taxpayer-funded “bottom surgery” at the nation’s premier gender clinic.



Dr. Lecter would be named to a high-level position in the federal government working on issues of equity within the criminal justice system.

Clarice Starling would end the film alone in the woods, scrolling through hateful comments in her Twitter mentions and trying to remember when to use “ze/zir/zem” pronouns. Her replacement would be shown receiving a promotion to chief of behavioral disorders, the first non-binary individual in FBI history to hold that post.

This remake would be a very different type of horror film, mainly because its plot reflects our new reality.

It should be called ""The Eating of the Sheep.""",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-democrats-silenced-the-lambs-so-they-can-eat-the-sheep,2022-09-28
Squires: How Americans are 'tenderized' to abandon truth and swallow destructive ideas,"Some people believe applying the term “groomer” liberally to teachers and Disney executives who believe it is their right to introduce queer sexuality and gender ideology to children does a disservice to children who are targeted by sex predators and physically harmed by child molesters.

It’s hard to take these criticisms seriously when the people most likely to make them dismissed legitimate questions about Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s pattern of leniency toward child sex criminals. Most Democrats spun questions about her record during her recent nomination hearings as an unfair attack on a historic nominee. Even prominent conservative commentators like Andrew McCarthy and David French took Senate Republicans to task for daring to ask a judge to explain her sentencing philosophy.

The left loves to police language. This is why they are trying to make the use of “groomer” a greater offense than the people and behaviors it describes. Thankfully, there is another way of thinking about how the ruling class forces conformity to unpopular and unnatural beliefs.

What we are seeing in changing norms around sexuality and gender identity is an attempt to “tenderize” a culture to get people to see tectonic shifts as the positive signs of cultural evolution.

Tenderizing meat refers to the use of a process or substance to break down connective tissue and make it easier to chew and, ultimately, digest. Each of the three major methods of tenderizing meat – pounding, braising, and marinating – has an analogous strategy in the cultural sphere.

Pounding a steak with a hammer or mallet uses the highest degree of force to soften tough muscle fibers. In the culture war, pounding is the use of law and policy to force people to comply with social change. A recent example is the Biden administration warning Alabama and other states that they may be violating federal civil rights law if they don’t allow doctors to treat gender-confused minors with hormones or genital mutilation.

Pounding is also what Jack Phillips has endured for years. Craven activists in Colorado have been trying to drive the Christian baker and his Masterpiece Cakeshop out of business using frivolous lawsuits because the owner refuses to use his creative gifts to bake cakes for same-sex weddings or transgender affirmation parties. His case was ultimately brought before the Supreme Court, which issued a 7-2 ruling stating the Colorado Civil Rights Commission violated his right to freely exercise his religion.

Braising is a form of cooking that uses heat and moisture over an extended period of time to soften a tough cut of meat such as a pot roast. The introduction and normalization of using personal pronouns, including “they/them,” is what braising looks like in the culture war. So is the insistence that sex is assigned at birth by doctors. Slow-cooking ideas that are a tough sell for the average person requires constant reinforcement and correction over a long period of time.

Marinating is the tenderizing method most familiar to the average cook and the preferred cultural method for anyone trying to reach children. Disney executive producer Latoya Raveneau admitting she intentionally adds “queerness” to content and is advancing a “not-at-all-secret gay agenda” is the equivalent of using pineapple juice to marinate chicken breast.

Marinades smell good during the tenderizing process and impart flavor to the meal. This is why they are such a powerful tool for shaping the minds of the next generation. Nickelodeon used ""Blue’s Clues"" to introduce toddlers to non-binary fathers and trans mothers in a Pride Parade video. ""Good Morning America"" promoted an 11-year-old “drag kid” called “Desmond is Amazing” to millions of viewers in 2018.

The reactions to Florida’s parental rights law, inaccurately called the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, simultaneously revealed the depths of tenderization children have been getting for years and the fact that parents are starting to wake up.

But it is important to know that adults are also being tenderized. Malik Yoba played Detective J.C. Williams on the '90s police drama ""New York Undercover."" His embodiment of black masculinity, especially as a father, was an effective counterbalance to the gangster rappers who promoted violence and degraded women with their lyrics.

Yoba was playing a different role when he appeared on ""The Breakfast Club"" in 2019 to discuss his LGBTQIA+ allyship with two trans activists and David Johns, the former executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans under President Obama.

At one point Yoba referred to “naturally born” women. That was a big mistake on his part. What followed was the clearest example of re-education in real time I have ever seen. His fellow guests stopped him mid-sentence and made him repeat phrases like “assigned female at birth” and “for whom that is consistent with how they identify” in a cadence similar to someone learning a foreign language. At one point he noted the difficulty of remembering the wording. His guests reminded him that he chose to be an ally and told him to “do the work!”

Yoba’s journey from hero cop to activist parrot is what awaits all who allow themselves or their children to be tenderized. This is part of the reason my wife and I decided to homeschool our children in a manner that acknowledges God as the center of all knowledge. This model is the perfect antidote to an education system steeped in secular humanism and moral relativism. It also is in stark contrast to the students today who are being taught that the common meanings of well-defined terms are constantly changing, arguments are justified by feelings and experience rather than facts and evidence, and minds are changed by coercion rather than persuasion.

At the crux of our culture wars is the battle for truth. The attacks on the truth look exactly like what is recounted in Genesis. God creates and says His creation is good. Satan’s subversion starts by introducing doubt (“Did God actually say ...?""), moves on to denying the consequences for rejecting God’s truth, and culminates in convincing rebellious hearts that God wants humans to enjoy what He has already forbidden.



The first family was given the tree of life, attempted to gain the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and lost both. We are following the same catastrophic path. We think we know what will lead to a fulfilled life and have evolved in our knowledge of science, but we are being tenderized with ideas that only lead to death and destruction.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-how-americans-are-tenderized-to-abandon-truth-and-swallow-destructive-ideas,2022-04-12
Squires: The president is right: I ain't 'Biden black',"Sunny Hostin had a Biden moment last week on ""The View"" when she said that she feels like the concept of a black Republican is an “oxymoron.” Her dismissal of black people who don’t vote Democrat is an even less sophisticated version of President Joe Biden’s infamous line: ""If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.”

Biden received immediate backlash for his comment during the 2020 campaign, but one tweet from Nikole Hannah-Jones brought his point into even clearer focus. According to the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist from the New York Times, “There is a difference between being politically black and being racially black. I am not defending anyone but we all know this and should stop pretending that we don't.""

Jones was right: Political blackness is itself an identity, and based on the frequency with which black women have been cited as the main victims in the event Roe is overturned, the president is also correct: I ain't black.

I reject the racial worldview shared by Biden and Jones because political blackness – what I’ll call “Biden blackness” – is marked by subconscious self-loathing, the inability to assess barriers to progress, an unwillingness to speak difficult truths, and an unhealthy preoccupation with the thoughts, words, and actions of white people.

Practitioners of Biden blackness blame white people for all their problems, yet deride black people who preach a message of self-sufficiency. Biden blacks believe white allies are more important than black fathers. They can’t agree on a coherent definition of “white supremacy,” but they're sure destroying it is more important than rebuilding the black family.

Biden blackness in 2022 often has nothing to do with improving social outcomes for black citizens. It is more frequently used as a thin veneer to cover the left’s actual priorities. The gay rights movement of the past 60 years largely revolved around the priorities of middle-class, educated white men who wanted to openly enjoy the same spoils of bourgeoisie normalcy as their heterosexual counterparts.

Now every statement President Biden makes about transgender issues includes a reference to “violence against black trans women and girls of color,” and the most prominent LGBTQIA+ activist organization of the past ten years is Black Lives Matter.

The same dynamic is at play with abortion. What used to be seen as a third-wave feminist priority of middle-class white women has now been framed as a top political priority for black women. Democrats argue that any restrictions on abortion in a post-Roe world are tantamount to attacks on the “reproductive rights” of low-income black women.

White liberals and their politically black co-conspirators have joined forces to convince the country that black lives matter – unless the life in question is growing in his mother’s womb.

The fatal flaw of Biden blackness is the same thing that plagues our broader culture – the complete abandonment of a biblical worldview as the primary foundation for public policy, social customs, and cultural norms.

The most obvious examples of this can be found in the words of “pro-life pastors” like Senator Raphael Warnock or the Black Lives Matter campaign declaring that “black women are divine.” The more dangerous manifestation of the secular nature of political blackness is the refusal to engage any discussion of morality in comprehensive assessments of black communities across the country.

Politicians, pundits, academics, and entertainers who adhere to Biden blackness all subscribe to the same materialist worldview that blames a lack of resources and the unequal distribution of wealth for all negative social outcomes among black people in America.

They see white people as possessing moral agency and decision-making ability, including the power to use their “privilege” on behalf of “people of color.” These same elites treat black people like melanated vessels of disorder driven by historical oppression and contemporary marginalization – unable to manage our behaviors, relationships, or homes without targeted interventions from the state.

I have even noticed this type of thinking among a certain subset of black Christians who are typically vocal about “social justice” issues but were conspicuously silent after a Supreme Court draft overturning Roe was made public.

Their responses ranged from arguments that conservative anti-abortion activism is rooted in the racism of the Religious Right movement of the 1970s to lectures about why true pro-life Christians must fight for more government spending on health care and child care, not just the end of legalized abortion. The latter argument ignores the extensive work pro-life believers, churches, and Christian ministries already do to support mothers and their children through crisis pregnancy centers, supply drives, and adoption services.

The reason for hiding these contributions is simple: Nothing makes practitioners of Biden blackness more nervous than being associated with conservatism, especially in the Trump era. The stench of MAGA politics is powerful enough to make Christians who have been vocal opponents of abortion for decades go silent or adopt liberal talking points about the structural forces that make women seek abortions.

Biden blackness is a cancer in the body politic. It is a destructive race card pulled from the bottom of the deck that works against the interests of the black masses who embrace it. It requires placing the responsibility for improving the condition of black people onto external third parties – generally benevolent whites, black elites advancing their own agendas, and paternalistic government bureaucrats.

Biden blackness is a contrived identity steeped in weakness, insecurity, and confusion. This is why the NAACP sees more value in partnering with white B-list who “take responsibility” for racism than in working with black A-list entertainers to encourage responsibility in the formation of our families.

Its flaws are also evident by listening to the people who yell “protect black women” but see black men who attempt to do so as exhibiting “toxic masculinity.”

The same goes for public intellectuals who argue that the only hope for black students to succeed academically is proximity to white classmates.

Any group that uses the terms “personal responsibility” and “respectability” as pejoratives while celebrating violence, debauchery, and drug abuse is headed for cultural extinction. Biden blackness sees invented race hatred as a worse problem than actual self-hatred.



One of the benefits of forsaking Biden blackness has been the discovery of fellow Christians from different ethnic backgrounds united in the knowledge that mankind’s main problem is not the color of our skin, but the nature of our sin.

In that sense, I have much more in common with a white Christian woman and Asian man who share my views on the importance of marriage, family, and faith than with the co-founders of BLM. All three of us know that a party that gets more energized about losing the “right” to kill the unborn than encouraging marriage and intact families is morally deficient and politically unsustainable.

Squires: Kanye West is a direct threat to the people who profit from black death and destruction,"Kanye West’s interview with Tucker Carlson on Thursday night provided a window into the mind of one of the most unique personalities in pop culture.



West said he tries not to use explicit language around his children. Family was a recurring theme during his conversation with Carlson. Kanye spoke very highly of his father, whom he described as “brilliant,” and boldly stated that he is pro-life.

West is clearly a complicated figure, but one thing is for sure: The one-dimensional stereotypes of him as a “coon” looking for white approval are completely misplaced.

West mentioned Dr. Claud Anderson, author of ""PowerNomics: The National Plan to Empower Black America,"" and promoted black economic independence and ownership on several occasions.

He openly supported Donald Trump, claimed wearing a “White Lives Matter” shirt was him simply stating the obvious, said the media has a godless agenda, and admitted people wanted him to hide his political beliefs.

Kanye West seems like a serious man who supports independent thought, not a mentally disturbed unwitting vessel for white supremacy. In short, he is the complete opposite of the people who claim to care about black lives.

Some of the very same people who publicly lambasted West for wearing the “White Lives Matter” shirt had no issue with the message being pushed out into “the culture” in the new “No Voting, No Vucking” ad from the BLK dating app. The video featured a cross-dressing rapper named Saucy Santana along with Miami hip-hop veteran Trina.

The video encouraged young black voters – particularly men – to participate in the electoral process if they want to have sex. The ad ends with the line, “If the coochie is the goal, go hit the polls” while the site weall.vote/blk appears on the screen.

The organization called When We All Vote was created by Michelle Obama and touts itself as a “nonpartisan initiative on a mission to change the culture around voting and to increase participation in each and every election by helping to close the race and age gap.” Two years ago, an Atlanta-based duo tried a similar strategy with an ad called, “Get Your Booty to the Poll” for the Georgia senate runoff election.

The left would freak out over a “No Wedding, No Womb” video that promoted marriage before children. When it comes to voting, however, they’re fine with strategic abstinence.

Every black voter in America should feel insulted by politicians, media companies, pollsters, and artists who refuse to appeal to our intellect, sensibilities, or values. They use sex to coerce black people into voting because that is what they think controls us.

The irony is that the same people who promote this type of ethnic advertising are the ones most likely to accuse black conservatives of “cooning,” promoting racial stereotypes, and selling out the black community. Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee chairman, was harshly criticized by liberals for joking about fried chicken and potato salad during a response to diversity outreach efforts within the GOP.

But if the person behind the microphone or camera has a “D” beside his party affiliation, he is free to produce nuclear-grade propaganda meant to demoralize and humiliate black people. The Klan would gladly sell their daughters to O.J. Simpson for the degrading messages liberals sell the black community. The last 30 years prove black death is profitable if the killing instrument is a Glock instead of a noose.

There was a period of time in which black public figures took the preservation of the black public image very seriously. They understood that civil rights were necessary for full citizenship, but dignity and self-respect are prerequisites for full humanity.

Black liberals today call efforts to encourage modesty in dress and speech “respectability politics” and assume the black people telling young men to pull their pants up are doing so to impress white people. This is because they project their deep desire for white approval and validation onto everyone else.

This is one reason they hate Kanye West. His staunch opposition to abortion – and willingness to frame it as an act of black genocide – is a direct threat to the regime they have built on black death and destruction.

The black community has a choice to make. The most popular genre ever created by black artists is powered in large part by artists who talk about killing black men and disrespecting black women. Any criticism of those messages is met with a Ph.D.-level defense from a member of the Afristocaracy. Kanye donning a MAGA hat or WLM shirt, by contrast, is treated like a level five emergency within black culture.



This isn’t to say Kanye is a perfect leader. His involvement in Lil Nas X’s song “Industry Baby” – and the video’s celebration of gay sex in prison – was a disappointment to people who heard him lay down the gauntlet against cultural rot on his album ""Jesus Is King.""

Ultimately, looking to any entertainer for leadership is a bad strategy. Our value as human beings, regardless of our ethnicity, comes from God our Creator. But if “the culture” has to choose a slogan, “If you wanna have this baby, say 'forever you’re my lady'” is far superior to “If you wanna hit this booty, gotta do your civic duty.”",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-kanye-west-threat-profit-black-destruction,2022-10-07
Squires: Kyrie Irving's 'overseers' wanted him punished because the revolution has been corporatized,"The Brooklyn Nets suspended Kyrie Irving for at least five games for what the organization characterized as a repeated failure to “unequivocally say he has no antisemitic beliefs.” It is a stunning turn of events for a league that promotes itself as a supporter of free speech and social justice.

But it is an unsurprising outcome if you understand the social dynamics at play with respect to professional sports, big business, social media, and social justice.

William Rhoden, an award-winning journalist, wrote a book in 2006 called ""40 Million Dollar Slaves,"" in which he argued that black athletes had as little power in their respective sports as their enslaved ancestors had on plantations. Rhoden acknowledged the rich history of black athletes fighting for civil rights and admonished the athletes at the time to rekindle the revolutionary spirit to continue agitating for social change.

I have a strong aversion to the comparison of black athletes and entertainers to slaves because they make millions working for white people who make billions. American chattel slavery was brutal and dehumanizing, while professional athletes are paid like kings and treated like mini-gods by adoring fans across the globe. Every basketball player wants to “be like Mike.” No one wants to work like Kunta Kinte.

Using slavery in this way is an emotional manipulation tactic designed by the speaker to elicit sympathy for whatever personal cause he is trying to advance. Former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores used plantation rhetoric to bolster his lawsuit against the NFL.

That said, understanding Rhoden’s worldview goes a long way to explaining Kyrie’s present predicament.

If you believe that black athletes are $40 million slaves, then the black journalists and athletes turned broadcasters who have pushed the league to discipline Kyrie Irving since he refused to take the COVID shot are his million-dollar overseers.

This long list of influential voices includes Stephen A. Smith, Michael Wilbon, Jemele Hill, and Charles Barkley. At various times, each one has taken to the airwaves and social media to chastise Irving – and his teammates – for not wanting to take the jab.

For these overseers, COVID was just the warm-up. It allowed them to practice their lines about Irving’s selfishness, idiocy, and promotion of “harmful misinformation.”

The real game got kicked off when Irving shared a tweet linking to a documentary streaming on Amazon called ""Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America."" The film, which I doubt most of Irving’s critics have seen, is over three hours long. It revolves around the notion that black people in America are the “true” Israelites who have had their identity stolen over centuries. It also includes a graphic that calls the Holocaust a “falsehood,” so I understand why Jewish people would be offended.

I believe people who engage in Holocaust denial or blame Jewish people for all of the world’s problems are ignorant. But ignorance is not a crime in this country. If it were, the politicians, pundits, and professors who think men can have babies would be in jail and those arguing for teen genital mutilation in the name of “gender-affirming care” would be facing a life sentence.

The issue for Kyrie’s overseers, including less famous ones like Jesse Washington and Mike Freeman, isn’t anti-Semitism. No, Kyrie’s sin is the expression of unapproved thoughts, which is why their public humiliation ritual started over his refusal to take experimental drugs to play basketball in New York City.

They shill for pharmaceutical companies and violate the “my body, my choice” ethos of the modern left because, in a sad twist of fate, William Rhoden’s arguments had their intended effect.

Colin Kaepernick’s decision to kneel during the national anthem as an act of protest inspired a new generation of athletes to wear their activism on their jersey sleeves. Other NFL players joined Kaepernick in his protest, and eventually the league offered over $100 million to several initiatives under its “Inspire Change” campaign.

The players complained and the league relented. Corporate support of “racial justice” work from athletes went to a completely different level after George Floyd was killed in 2020. As William Rhoden noted in a 2021 retrospective column, “Throughout corporate America, in the wake of police shootings, capped by the public execution of Floyd, Black Lives Matter initiatives emerged like pop-up stores.”

In other words, the revolution was corporatized.

The NBA’s willingness to paint “Black Lives Matter” on the court or allow players to wear jerseys with such hard-hitting slogans as “Education Reform” and “Love Us” would seem to be a dream come true for older black journalists like Rhoden and Wilbon.

What these men, and their younger colleagues, fail to realize is that support comes at a price: complete obedience.

Corporate America now owns the revolutionaries.

There was near-universal condemnation from black journalists and sports commentators toward Kyrie for his refusal to take the COVID shot. Some saw his stance as a betrayal of his community, especially when the media reported on racial inequities in COVID cases and deaths. In addition, Pfizer paid too much money in media sponsorships during 2021 to allow a renegade like Kyrie Irving to influence regular Joes who had a similar feeling about the mandates they were facing.

To be clear, Kyrie would face the same punishment if he chose not to bow down to the left’s favorite idol: radical gender ideology. He would be dealing with even more intense pressure if he said he stands for girls' sports and doesn’t think men who “identify” as women should be allowed to compete against female athletes. Retired NBA player Matt Barnes said something similar last week, but it would receive a lot more coverage from a current player of Irving’s stature.

Ultimately, this is about the use of corporate power, backed by the government and aided by the media, to police the thoughts of Americans.

Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr is the league’s foremost authority on social justice. During the NFL anthem protests, he stated, “I'm proud to be in a league that understands patriotism in America is about free speech.” Now he is saying that “in modern society, with social media, the way things can fan across the globe exponentially and get 5 million hits immediately, every comment matters.”



Kerr, the Nets, and the people who have dutifully tried to keep Kyrie in check for two years all believe “words matter” when it comes to content in a documentary very few people have seen. But somehow, these same people will partner with and defend hip-hop artists who have made millions over the past 30 years pushing death, degradation, and self-destruction in the black community. These are the same communities in which homicide is the leading cause of death for young black men, but for some strange reason the overseers in sports media consider that connection unworthy of their attention.

The people who lionize Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, John Carlos, and Tommie Smith now do the bidding of drug companies and tell athletes what movies they can watch. In this new era, compliance is mandatory and questions aren’t allowed. The professional overseers are shedding their revolutionary skin before our eyes. They ditched “power to the people” for a new slogan that tested off the charts in focus groups: “Just shut up and dribble.”",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-kyrie-irving-overseers-wanted-him-punished,2022-11-04
"Squires: Lia, Laverne, and 'The Lion King': How trans activists use the legacy of lynchings to silence the culture","The ubiquity of rainbow flags and pandering corporations at the beginning of June can only mean one thing: LGBT “Pride” Month has officially begun.



It is hard to overstate how quickly the country has changed on matters of sex and gender identity in the seven years since Bruce Jenner announced he was a transgender woman named ""Caitlyn.""

A recent campaign video from Charles Booker explains one major reason.

Booker is a Kentucky Democrat running to unseat Senator Rand Paul in the upcoming election. He released a video that showed him with a noose around his neck as he spoke about the ugly history of lynchings in the South. He also claimed Senator Paul voted against anti-lynching legislation and compared health care expansion to slavery. The message was clear: Rand Paul’s ideas are part of Kentucky’s racist past and Charles Booker is its tolerant future.

Booker’s use of stark racial imagery explains why Lia Thomas received a sympathetic profile on ESPN this week from a writer with “they/them” pronouns and Laverne Cox announced that Mattel is making a first-of-its-kind transgender Barbie doll in his image.

The overwhelming majority of Americans know that there are only two sexes, but they have been largely silent in the face of trans ideology capturing every inch of our culture, from public policy and big business to corporate media and K-12 education.

Why?

Democrats now accuse anyone who does not agree with their new definitions of “man” and “woman” of transphobia and bigotry. In an instant, millions of loyal Democratic voters who hold traditional views of sex – from suburban soccer moms to inner-city teachers – have become enemies of what President Biden calls the “civil rights issue of our time.”

When it comes to gender ideology, we’re all Klansmen now.

Academics, politicians, pundits, and corporations act as if keeping men out of the women’s swimming pool at the Olympics is the same as wanting separate water fountains for blacks and whites. People who refuse to date someone who identifies as transgender will soon be shunned and shamed like racial purists who oppose interracial relationships. They have been told criticizing men in women’s bathrooms or mastectomies for teenage girls makes them bigots who wish death on transgender children. Democrats have likened every American who believes in human biology to a Grand Wizard holding a hangman’s noose.

No one wants to be associated with the people who carried out heinous acts of bigotry and racial violence. LGBT activists know this and have linked the gay rights movement to the Civil Rights movement for decades. The phrase “gay is the new black” is not just a rallying cry for them; it’s also their view on the natural progression of America’s long march toward equality and freedom.

The problem for the LGBT movement is that homosexuality rests on the belief that biological sex is real. The “Ts” completely disagree. They believe gender is a social construct, sex is “assigned” at birth by doctors, and gender identity is a matter of personal choice.

Like many self-professed feminists, black progressives, and white liberals, the “Ls” and “Gs” would rather nod along in silent submission than risk being placed in the same basket of deplorables as racist Trump voters. There is no worse fate for people who see themselves as oppressed than being cast in the role of oppressor. The masses have gotten the message, which is why so many would rather be silent than be linked to the new crop of multi-racial white supremacists. This is yet another reminder that shame is a powerful tool for social control.

Transgender activists used the looming legacy of battered black Americans marching for civil rights to catapult themselves to first place in the oppression Olympics. They went from John Lewis on the Edmund Pettus Bridge to Caitlyn Jenner at the ESPYs in the blink of an eye.

Disney, the parent company of ESPN, is one of the most influential companies in this movement, and anyone who has ever watched ""The Lion King"" understands exactly what is happening in America today.

Scar, the jealous younger brother of King Mufasa, kills the patriarch and sends young Simba into hiding. Now king, Scar takes over the Pride Lands, allows hyenas to move in, and oversees the rapid deterioration of the land. His rule over the Pride Lands and his lie about Mufasa’s death remain unchallenged until Simba grows enough in stature and courage to defeat his evil uncle.

The lesson is clear: The removal of a strong male always leaves females and the young vulnerable to outside attacks. In nature, weakness is always met with aggression. The decades-long effort to demonize masculinity and patriarchy has not eliminated male leadership; it just changed the dominant males from providers to predators who prey on those they should protect.

As is often the case, Charles Booker’s use of racial imagery for personal and political gain is built on a lie. He accused Rand Paul of opposing anti-lynching legislation but failed to mention the current Kentucky senator opposed the original bill in 2020 because he wanted to make it stronger. Paul eventually co-sponsored the Emmett Till Antilynching Act along with Senators Cory Booker, Raphael Warnock, and Tim Scott.

Lies and emotional manipulation are at the heart of every subversive movement. The left has shown over the past twenty years that tolerance and acceptance are not the goals. Leftists want total submission and unquestioning affirmation. They want you to take a picture of your child in the lap of a burly, bearded drag queen and think “what a blessing of liberty.” They want you to see men with three percent body fat and deep voices smashing records in women’s sports as the next frontier of equality. They want you to believe that anything less than your total support and allyship makes you a vile, hateful person.

The truth is that they don’t even believe what they say, as evidenced by how quickly abortion went back to being a women’s issue once Democrats learned Roe might be overturned. Every “birthing person” and “chest feeder” was forced to the back of the bus for the sake of political expediency.



Affirming the reality of sex, whether you base your position on Genesis or genetics, is the most important act of personal humility and cultural resistance you can engage in today. It is the antidote to pride because it acknowledges a power greater than the human mind. Doing so will require clear vision, an honest tongue, nerves of steel, and a multigenerational mindset. The other option is continued silence and cowardice.

Squires: Men's mission in 2023: 'Protect this house',"The Overton window has been moved right in front of your child’s bedroom, and the year 2023 will be marked by your willingness to kick down the ladder full of people attempting to enter your home.

That is why my personal theme for 2023 and message to fearless men across the country is simple and straightforward: “Protect this house.”

This was the tagline from a series of commercials in 2010 from Under Armour, the disruptive sports apparel company based in Baltimore.

Conservatives are frequently accused of fearmongering and inciting moral outrage about culture war issues. We’re told that drag queens aren’t really in schools and hospitals aren’t really mutilating children. The truth is that there is a war being waged on multiple fronts by a variety of enemies who share the same goal: to infiltrate our homes and capture our most prized possessions.

Radical ideologues want to control our minds because they know that the most efficient way to impact what people do is to control what they think. Corporate media outlets write headlines like “Transgender man gives birth to non-binary partner's baby with female sperm donor” to confuse readers and force a new reality on them. They know that if you can get a man to accept absurdities, you can also get him to commit – or defend – atrocities.

Our enemies don’t just work in the press. The Centers for Disease Control recently released a self-assessment tool to help schools gauge how “inclusive” they are to LGBTQ students. The public health agency that is afraid to affirm the fact that only women can get pregnant wants schools to introduce students to the “Gender Unicorn” so that they leave school more confused about their identities than when they started. The CDC’s guide demonstrates how our governing institutions and schools are working in tandem to corrupt our children.

The people who will suffer are the kids being told that new names, hormones, and surgeries will transform them into the opposite sex. A culture that is confused about the basics of human biology will have a hard time forming stable families. Unfortunately, the decline in morals and values in that area predates the transgender movement by decades.

A hip-hop artist and producer named Akon recently offered his approval of Nick Cannon’s serial impregnation campaign. Akon dismissed the idea that Cannon, who recently welcomed his 12th child, is doing damage to his kids by refusing to marry one of their mothers and raise children together under one roof. Akon also said that attending recitals for your children is a “white man’s thing” during a conversation with British media personality Zeze Millz.

Sleeping with dozens of women and creating children for sport does not make an adult male a man. Celebrities like Cannon and manosphere personalities like Andrew Tate are just as antagonistic toward the natural family as your garden-variety blue-haired radical feminist.

Young men in the West need to hear that a wife and children will give them something to both live and die for. They need to learn about duty and obligation, a stark contrast to the language of personal therapy they encounter at every turn. They need to be encouraged to think multi-generationally in a world that tells them that the god of self is the highest power in their lives.

The forces of media, government, and pop culture are easy enemies to identify. One thing that is certain in 2023 is that the mission to protect our homes and families will also periodically involve fighting back against people who claim to be friends.

Donald Trump remains a popular figure among conservatives. The former president released a statement on Truth Social claiming that missteps by pro-life voters and politicians were behind the 2022 midterm losses. It is true that Democrats used the fall of Roe v. Wade and abortion restrictions on the state level to galvanize their voters. It's also true that pro-life voters, especially evangelical Christians, are some of Trump’s most loyal supporters. They believe that human life has inherent value regardless of age, location (e.g., inside the womb), circumstances of birth, or whether the birth mother wants the child.

If being pro-MAGA means abandoning those convictions for the sake of political pragmatism, conservative Christians will have to decide what they truly hold dear. The battle is raging, and millions of Americans feel like they are being attacked on all sides. How should we respond to these attacks?



Under Armour made the “Protect this house” campaign. As a Christian, I know that protecting my house will require putting on the full armor of God.

The Apostle Paul lays out everything the believer needs to do battle in the book of Ephesians,

13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.

Christians should be leading the culture into battle because we have the weapons that are required for spiritual warfare. We are called to stand firm in the face of evil, gird ourselves with the truth, pursue righteousness, and use both a sword and shield when we’re engaged in combat. Unfortunately, many have defected to the other side even though they claim to fight for Jesus.

They refuse to stand firm on any issue that would earn them scorn from the culture. They run from biblical truth related to issues of sex, sexuality, marriage, and family to avoid being lumped in with all the “hateful” Christians who refuse to use personal pronouns or celebrate drag shows in public libraries. That type of cowardice must stay in 2022. The year is 2023, and every man is going to have to decide whether he will protect his house. The only acceptable answer is “I will!”",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-mens-mission-2023-protect-this-house,2023-01-04
Squires: MLK’s successors foolishly turned the political tactic of victimhood into a cultural identity,"One of the enduring legacies of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is the “white flight” of a black leadership class that is more concerned with changing hearts and minds in Silicon Valley than in Compton.



King’s imitators are in bed with white knights in politics, big tech, big business, and corporate media. The NAACP’s “I take responsibility” campaign was a clear example of how easy it is for a civil rights organization to become more concerned with getting white liberals to repent of their sins than improving the conditions of black communities.

A similar dynamic exists for elected officials. The mayor of Washington, D.C., had the words “BLACK LIVES MATTER” painted in the middle of the street leading up to the White House. Trolling Donald Trump did nothing to preserve black life in a city where the vast majority of homicide victims are young black men.

BLM signs and flags were displayed prominently in yards and store windows so that white liberals could escape accusations of racism.

But one simple fact remains: No amount of white guilt, shame, or extortion will improve the overall condition of the black community. Black leaders who see themselves continuing the work of Dr. King but refuse to ask anything of black people are doing the entire country a disservice.

You can’t lead people if you have no expectations for them. You can’t claim to love a person if you have no standards for them. Every single demand the black leadership class articulates in public points in one of two directions — bigger government or better white people. That’s because black leaders see the two main issues facing black America as income inequality and systemic racism.

This worldview, shared by some of the most politically active black pastors, explains why men who should be advocating for the sanctity of life end up sounding like paid spokesmen for Planned Parenthood. They have no issue telling white people what words to say, where to spend their money, where they should send their kids to school, or what books to read. The incentive structure explains it all. Publicly rebuking rap icons at the BET Awards will cost a black journalist significant cultural capital, but publicly rebuking “latte liberals” can turn into a potential payday.

The black and South Asian women who started Race 2 Dinner understand this dynamic. They charge white women money to come to their homes and berate them for their racial blindness and contributions to upholding “systemic racism.”

King’s appeals to the collective consciences of white Americans in the 1960s made sense. Images of civil rights protesters being beaten by the police or the high-profile murder of Emmett Till required a national response. It is hard for people who have only seen a “Whites Only” sign in a museum to understand the social, legal, and psychological impact of ascribing second-class citizenship to a group based on immutable characteristics. King needed to win the hearts and minds of a white majority in this country for the laws to change.

Unfortunately, the black leadership class turned a tactic into an identity.

Instead of periodically surveying the social landscape and adjusting their leadership priorities based on the current circumstances, the people who see themselves as King’s activist heirs have abandoned their leadership responsibilities altogether. They have destroyed one of the fundamental principles of leadership: You can’t influence people you aren’t willing to engage, encourage, coach, mentor, disciple, or criticize.

Dr. King also differs from today’s activists because of his willingness to apply the same moral standards and loving critiques to African-Americans as to white people. He said the following in a 1957 speech in Birmingham:

“And another thing, my friends, we kill each other too much. We cut up each other too much. There is something that we can do. We’ve got to go down in the quiet hour and think about this thing. We’ve got to lift our moral standards at every hand, at every point. You may not have a Ph.D. degree; you may not have an M.A. degree; you may not have an A.B. degree. But the great thing about life is that any man can be good, and honest, and ethical, and moral, and can have character.”

Members of the Afristocracy today would say this type of rhetoric promotes “respectability politics.” They would rather tell white voters in Wisconsin to advocate for a federal “assault weapons” ban than tell young black men in Chicago to stop using handguns to kill each other in broad daylight.

Like Ben Crump, the prominent civil rights attorney, they would rather take to Twitter to announce the state of Minnesota was phasing out the use of the term “master bedroom” in its real estate listings. The fact he felt this was a noteworthy win for racial justice was a sign he needs to have his leadership compass recalibrated.



If silence truly is violence, then the Afristocracy should be brought up on felony abuse and neglect charges. There is no reason African-American politicians and pundits should spend more time promoting the concept of white fragility than strategies to strengthen the black family.

Part of what it means to be a good leader is the willingness to speak the truth in love, especially when the intended audience is resistant to the message. Dr. King did that by challenging the nation to have its creeds match its deeds. His imitators demonstrate their affections lie with the white liberals seeking absolution for the sins of their forefathers rather than the black people they claim to represent.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-mlks-successors-foolishly-turned-the-political-tactic-of-victimhood-into-a-cultural-identity,2023-01-18
Squires: Monkeypox shows the left's fetish for saying 'gay' to kids in the schoolhouse but never to men in the bathhouse,"Governor Ron DeSantis was accused of marginalizing LGBT teachers and students when he signed the Parental Rights in Education bill earlier this year. The media, as it is often wont to do, lied about the bill and branded it the “Don’t Say Gay” bill.

The response was a useful window into the mind of the American left. Politicians, entertainers, and corporations made a point to say “Gay!” every moment they could prior to the bill being signed into law.

Fast-forward a few months to the current monkeypox public health emergency – an actual threat to the LGBT community – and suddenly the keepers of culture have a bad case of laryngitis.

Yes, they grudgingly acknowledge that gay men – “men who have sex with men” in public health parlance – make up virtually all monkeypox cases.

Their overriding concern, however, in the public response to the outbreak is to avoid “stigmatizing” gay men. The writers of a recent Washington Post article acknowledge that public health authorities are weighing whether to recommend that gay men limit their sexual partners to help control the spread of the virus. The Post linked to a resource from San Francisco that tried to provide practical prevention tips for men attending a popular kink festival.

“We’re gearing up for an exciting return of our favorite street festival in San Francisco: Up Your Alley (aka Dore Alley), where you’ll get your fill of hot hairy daddies, hungry pigs, BDSM babes and kinks of all kinds. Douchie’s got some hot tips for a fun and filthy weekend — free of anxiety.”

Romans 1 is clear that a society that sows kink and celebrates filth will reap destruction both physically and spiritually.

“Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.”

“Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.”

Promiscuous sex is one aspect of gay culture the left is loath to discuss publicly. Journalists bend over backward not to offend men who lack the discipline to stop bending over forward for random men at sex parties.

The shame mechanism for the people engaged in this behavior is completely broken. Only a mind enslaved to sin would think that being told not to engage in anonymous sex acts at orgies, at bathhouses, and in public bathrooms is more stigmatizing than the acts themselves.

Thankfully, the same book that details the ultimate end of all who are in bondage to sin also describes the freedom found in repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. The Gospel has the same power to save the gay man who has spent decades degrading himself through the unnatural use of his body as it does the church girl who thinks her good works are what make her righteous in God’s sight.

What makes the left’s “don’t say gay” monkeypox response so galling is the stark contrast of how this public health emergency is being handled compared to our last one.

During COVID, the media, academics, politicians, and public health officials had no problem using their platforms to chastise and criticize anyone who disobeyed their COVID orders. They ordered churches to close and demanded that people not see their families for the holidays.

People who refused COVID shots and complained about mask mandates were blamed for killing children and senior citizens. They were threatened with job loss, isolated in churches, and chastised for prolonging the “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” Conservatives who died after expressing concern about the public health response to COVID were mocked online and in major media outlets.

Now monkeypox is here, and the politicians, public health authorities, and media outlets who spoke with moral force as they shamed disobedient voters have become much more circumspect with their public guidance. We are being led by people who felt emboldened to tell Americans not to celebrate Thanksgiving with family but tremble at the thought of having to tell gay men not to attend kink festivals.



Enabling self-destruction is neither loving nor kind. Immunity from criticism creates a breeding ground for cultural dysfunction and communicable diseases.

We need more leaders willing to discuss abstinence with adults and fewer teachers trying to talk about gender identity and sexuality with toddlers. The people who need to hear “gay” most right now are the men in the batthouse, not the children in the schoolhouse.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-monkeypox-left-wont-say-gay,2022-08-05
"Squires: 'Till' shows why history should be explored for timeless truths, not exploited for political gain","I did not plan on seeing the film ""Till"" when I first heard a movie was being made about the gruesome murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till. I felt no need to subject myself to yet another exercise in “racial trauma porn” dressed up as a history lesson. Some of these films, including ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Selma,"" achieved critical acclaim, racking up multiple honors at film festivals and awards shows.

My skepticism was rooted in the belief that the film would be used to advance the “Selma syndrome” that is so prevalent in today’s political culture. I fully expected this movie to be used as an October surprise right before the midterms to make black voters feel like the ghosts of the Jim Crow South will rise again if they allow Republicans to win key races state and congressional races.

But I was wrong. The film focused on a dark moment in American history without overtly pushing a political agenda.

""Till"" was about Emmett Till (nicknamed “Bo” by his family) as told through the eyes of his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley. The film captures their close relationship and the balance she struck as a mom trying to protect her son from a world in which the word “nigger” was used as casually as a person’s first name while allowing him to be the playful child his family knew and loved.

Without giving away too many details, the movie dealt with Emmett Till’s abduction and lynching without gratuitous violence. Much of the film was about his mother’s decision to both pursue justice for her son and allow his brutal death – and the acquittal of the men who killed him – to serve as an important national call to action in the civil rights movement.

The film was a stark reminder of what American social life was like for black Americans 70 years ago and how much progress we have made as a nation since then. Given the political battles over critical race theory and how American history is taught in schools, ""Till"" confirms and challenges ideas about race that have become entrenched on both sides of the political spectrum.

Race was obviously a major theme throughout the film, but the caste system common in the South went far beyond segregated water fountains. Perhaps one of the most gripping examples of how the shackles of racism handcuffed black Americans in the South was the fact that Emmett's uncle, known as “Preacher,” felt powerless to stop the men who abducted his nephew. When I saw that scene, my first thought was “Where is his gun?”

It wasn’t until later in the film that we learn Preacher kept a long gun by the front door but refused to use it. Mamie Till asked him why he didn’t use it. His answer was gut-wrenching: “If I had shot them, they would have killed all of mine.”

Preacher believed that using his gun to defend his nephew would have put his own wife and children in serious danger, so he let the men take Emmett.

Few things are as demoralizing as the inability to protect your family from physical harm. One of the reasons I’m so passionate about fatherhood is because for many years, the legal system and social custom stripped black men of their natural right to protect their families. The sad irony is now black preachers are often the ones creating theological justifications for the organizations and people who want to kill children.

Black clergymen like William Barber II and Jamal Bryant and gospel singer William Murphy are just as emasculated as Preacher was in the film. That is the only word to describe a man who won’t raise a hand – or his voice – to protect his family.



They are a far cry from the black preachers of the past who fought for civil rights because they believed that all people are created in God’s image. The black church of that era served as a moral compass for a country struggling to reconcile its professed Christian ideals with the mistreatment of fellow image-bearers based on skin color.

Ultimately, ""Till"" struck the right balance between history and dignity. I hope the gravity of Emmett Till’s murder will discourage self-serving politicians from using his name to draw a comparison between their critics and the lynch mob that kidnapped and killed a teenage boy. History should be explored to learn about the past, not exploited in the present for personal or political gain.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-till-shows-why-history-should-be-explored-for-timeless-truths-not-exploited-for-political-gain,2022-11-02
Squires: Tony Dungy marches for life while his detractors demonize the Gospel,"If you believe Tony Dungy’s critics, the Hall of Fame NFL coach is really a closeted Exalted Cyclops who dreams of burning rainbow crosses in front of Planned Parenthood in order to keep trans kids from their puberty blockers and women barefoot and pregnant.



The treatment Dungy has received for publicly affirming the right to life is proof that corporate media likes prayers to unspecified gods, Christians with closed Bibles, black men who promote death, and activist athletes endorsing causes they support.

The reactions to the respected coach and NBC broadcaster’s March for Life appearance have been attempts to paint pro-life advocacy and biblical sexual ethics as forms of intolerant extremism. Dungy delivered a speech at last Friday’s March for Life rally in Washington, D.C., the first since the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned Roe v. Wade.

Dungy took a bold stand for the sanctity of life and the rights of the unborn. At one point he even stated that the lives of babies in the womb matter just as much as the life of Damar Hamlin, the Buffalo Bills player who suffered cardiac arrest during a game in early January.

In doing so, the trailblazing coach morphed from a model of dignity, strength, and winsomeness into a right-wing bigot, spreading hatred of LGBT people and promoting white supremacy.

This was the argument put forth by several sportswriters and social commentators. Dave Zirin of the Nation penned an emotionally charged screed that described the March for Life as a “madhouse of right-wing gadflies, disinformation addicts, Qanon adherents, and, most disturbingly, class after class of teenage and tween-age children dragged there by teachers who abuse their authority in ways that would make Ron DeSantis smirk.”

I attended the march. Zirin’s vision is as deficient as his worldview. Zirin also tried to connect Dungy, and a now-deleted tweet about litter boxes, to threats against children’s hospitals and assaults against LGBT kids.

Nancy Armour of USA Today sang a similar tune. She claimed that Dungy’s advocacy for black coaches doesn’t excuse his “bigotry against the LGBTQ community.” Armour, who attended Catholic school, claimed Jesus never addressed homosexuality or gay marriage in the Gospels. Perhaps she was out sick the day Jesus said the following in response to a question about divorce: “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”

Armour might respond that this doesn’t address same-sex marriage directly. But that would be like saying a vegan restaurant doesn’t explicitly say it doesn’t sell ribeye steaks in its menu. The Bible, from Genesis to Revelation and every book in between, is crystal clear on the number of sexes and the definition of marriage.

Not to be outdone by the initial responses to Dungy’s “sin” of promoting life, Kevin Blackistone of the Washington Post tied Dungy's appearance at the March for Life to anti-abortion extremists, racist politicians, and Donald Trump. Blackistone, a supporter of Colin Kaepernick’s on-field protests, wondered how the NFL reacted to Dungy’s decision to “stand before anti-abortionists on a podium frequented by white supremacists and zealots.”

Even Dr. Harry Edwards, the sociologist who has made a career studying and advising black athletes, joined the fray. He tweeted that as someone with “friends, colleagues, neighbors, former students, contacts in every walk of life who are proudly 'out', active parts of their LGBTQ communities and who I treasure, I find Tony’s insipidly right wing bigotry disturbing or dangerous.”

In Harry Edwards’ world, living “out, loud, and proud” is for puppy play enthusiasts and leather daddies in San Francisco. Christians who believe in a biblical definition of marriage can practice their faith in the “closet” in their own homes.

Millions of Americans share Tony Dungy’s views on abortion and homosexuality. Many of those people are professing Christians. They see the Dobbs decision as a net good for society. Unlike Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton, they did not tweet in somber reflection on what would have been the 50th anniversary of Roe.

Chris Broussard, a veteran sports journalist and professing Christian, contrasted the backlash Tony Dungy received with the praise lavished on black men who use their platforms to promote violence and destruction. His cultural analysis was spot-on.

The NFL featured Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and 50 Cent during last year’s Super Bowl halftime show. In 2021, the league also promoted rapper Meek Mill’s work for “social equity” and congratulated him on his album ""Expensive Pain."" There wasn’t much interest in the album cover, which depicted the bare breasts, behinds, and private parts of black women. Good thing he didn’t say his money was “kosher” or compliment Jewish record executives on their business acumen. The NFL would never stand beside anyone using harmful language that perpetuates stereotypes.

Attempts to get Tony Dungy fired and cast out of polite society are not about tolerance. They are acts of punishment that should serve as a wake-up call to faithful believers everywhere.

The issue isn’t Tony Dungy’s tone or demeanor. It’s his message.

People who worship at the altar of abortion and pray to the gods of sexual preference and gender identity cannot allow heretics like Dungy to spread his view in the public square. They know the false gospel of sexual liberation is no match for the good news of Jesus Christ.

To the people who think men can “become” women, biology is bigotry. When the government attempts to change the definition of “marriage,” people who believe it remains the union of one man and one woman for one lifetime will be seen as regressive. And those who believe life has inherent value regardless of gestational stage or location will be cast as theocrats who want to take women back to the 1950s.



Black Christians have even more pressure to conform. Biblical teaching on issues of sex, sexuality, and life are now framed as (white) Christian nationalism. No amount of goodwill or cultural capital amassed fighting racism can make up for refusal to support killing babies in the womb or affirm drag queens in libraries and schools.

People whose identities are built on the foundation of skin color will not survive the coming storm. Neither will believers who are willing to compromise biblical truth for cultural acceptance. Christians need to accept the fact that publicly affirming what the scriptures say about sex, sexuality, marriage, and life – foundational Genesis issues – will get us labeled as “hateful” by people who believe they are more loving to other image-bearers than our Creator is. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trust in God and continue to speak the truth in love. That is our only option.

Squires: 'Wakanda Forever' shows that you can sell any worldview to fans who think 'representation' is life's highest virtue,"I am not a film critic, so my take on ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" won’t include a detailed exposition on cinematography or the musical score.

What I am is someone who understands that movies are built on stories and that those stories are framed in specific ways to deliver a message. Some of those messages touch on universal themes like love, loss, and overcoming adversity. Others reflect the cultural zeitgeist, especially today when art and culture are explicitly used to groom unsuspecting children by normalizing gender confusion, drag queens, and pregnant “men.”

The Black Panther franchise is significant because the films are much more than movies. They are cultural events. Black moviegoers come adorned in dashikis, sporting more kente cloth than Democrats in Congress kneeling for George Floyd. They post images to social media of themselves with their arms crossed in the familiar “Wakanda forever” pose.

To many Black Panther fans, Wakanda is a futuristic black utopia — technologically advanced, rich in resources, and protected from the rapacious greed of white colonizers. The films are a vehicle to express what life would look like in a world free from anti-black racism.

The world created in ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is a Black Lives Matter paradise pulled straight from the mind of Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza.

To its credit, the film opens and closes by giving honor to the late Chadwick Boseman, who played T’Challa in the original ""Black Panther."" Boseman died in 2020 of complications from colon cancer. His death was a major part of the storyline in ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.""

Unfortunately, he was the only man treated with any reverence in the film. Every other man in the film was made to submit. CIA agent Everett Ross was eventually arrested by his ex-wife, who is now the CIA director.

M’Baku, the leader of the Jabari tribe, eventually yielded to Shuri, T’Challa’s younger sister and the new Black Panther, when she demanded his support in a potential battle against the kingdom of Talokan.

Even Namor, the king of Talokan, yielded to Shuri in battle.

The image of dominant females and submissive males is quite an inversion of the social norms you would expect in the most powerful and prosperous African nation. I assume that choice was deliberate. To paraphrase a theme in the film, the relevant question is not how that decision was made, but why it was made.

The men in Wakanda don’t even have love interests on screen. The only expression of romantic affection was between two women – the new general of the Dora Milaje and one of her underlings. When sexual norms are at stake, the typical issues around power dynamics and consent suddenly become much less relevant.

This disconnect between the film’s plot and subtext is not new.

The original ""Black Panther"" film was full of vibrant colors, pageantry, and talk of black liberation.

But W'Kabi, one of T’Challa’s closest friends, responded to the king’s musings on potential pro-immigration policies with an unashamed “Wakanda First” rejoinder – “You let the refugees in … they bring their problems with them, and then Wakanda is like everywhere else.”

The militancy levels shot up significantly when Killmonger, an American-born trained assassin and cousin of T’Challa, comes to Wakanda to challenge the king for his throne.

Killmonger’s decisive victory against T’Challa – which he completed by tossing him off a cliff – was reminiscent of Bane’s back-breaking fight against Batman in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" In that film, the audience got to see what life in Gotham City was like under supervillain rule. Wealthy Gothamites were attacked by people who thought their wealth should be forcibly redistributed.

Bane instituted show trials and public executions. He trapped the police underground and freed all the prisoners. He killed the mayor and blew up a football stadium. He executed cops and federal agents. He armed a nuclear bomb that would have destroyed the city if not for Batman’s heroic return to defend Gotham.

Like Bane, Killmonger was an ideologue bent on imposing his vision of justice on those who were never held to account for oppressing the weak and vulnerable. He waxed poetic about using Wakanda’s resources and advanced weaponry to “liberate” black people across the globe.

But he couldn’t get a single plane, missile, or spear out of Wakandan airspace.

In fact, one of the people who prevented him from exacting revenge on the oppressors across the globe was a white CIA agent who was brought to Wakanda for emergency medical treatment. Even after T’Challa regained his throne by the end of ""Black Panther,"" he still didn’t invite kids from America’s inner cities to travel to Wakanda for a cultural exchange program. For all of the film’s Afrocentric rhetoric and visuals, the only person to be brought into Wakanda from the outside world in that movie was a man referred to as a “colonizer.”

I guess fans should think of that as Wakandan white privilege.

""Wakanda Forever"" is no different. Queen Ramonda and Namor were both very critical of the industrialized countries they believed would destroy their lands – and people – for access to vibranium. But ultimately, it was all talk, because the only war in the film was fought between the two “kingdoms of color,” largely because Shuri, the new Black Panther, refused to join Namor in waging war against the imperial West.

The Black Panther franchise gives audiences just enough revolutionary dialogue to make them think they are watching actual Black Panthers, but ultimately the real product being promoted is something far different.

""Wakanda Forever"" spends more time tearing down the patriarchy and traditional gender norms than it does uprooting the forces of settler colonialism.

The film will likely do great at the box office and lead to additional calls for representation by ethnic and sexual minorities. But when the people who control the culture know that “representation” is a specific group’s highest priority, they also know they can sell any worldview if the packaging has the right color. For instance, ""The Woman King"" lied about the Dahomey kingdom’s insistence on participating in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, but the “we need to teach true history” crowd didn’t care because they got to see a middle-aged black woman kick butt and rule over a nation.



In a post-credits scene for ""Wakanda Forever,"" the audience learns that T’Challa fathered a son with his girlfriend before his death. Given Marvel’s trajectory and the heavy-handedness of cultural messaging, I wouldn’t be surprised if the child came out as non-binary in a future film, used personal pronouns, and legalized “gender-affirming” surgeries for Wakandan teens.

That would be completely on brand. The Black Panther franchise enjoys an exalted status among black Marvel fans. This makes it the perfect vehicle to subtly shape the worldview of its most vocal supporters, especially the men who either miss or dismiss the cultural programming.

I wonder if any would object if the final installment was entitled ""Black Panther: The Man Queen.""",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/squires-wakanda-forever-worldview,2022-11-15
"Whitlock: Ben Shapiro and ultra-BLM black elites united in animus toward Kyrie Irving, Muhammad Ali, and Malcolm X","The ultra-Black Lives Matter revolutionaries piling on suspended basketball star Kyrie Irving have something in common with Ben Shapiro.



They would all hate Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali.

Shannon Sharpe. Stephen A. Smith. Jemele Hill. LeBron James. Charlamagne tha Fraud. James Brown. The people justifying the persecution of Irving over a harmless and boring documentary would all want to silence and deplatform X and Ali in the 1960s.

X and Ali, the highest-profile members of Elijah Muhammad’s Nation of Islam religious sect, boldly and clearly complained about an unhealthy relationship and power dynamic between black communities and people Malcolm X explicitly described as “Jewish business owners.” Here’s just one of many examples of it.

In 1964, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper ran a transcript of a speech the NOI spokesperson delivered while in the Middle East. X coined the phrase “Zionist dollarism.”

“The modern 20th-century weapon of neo-imperialism is dollarism,” Malcolm X said. “The zionists have mastered the science of dollarism: the ability to come posing as a friend and benefactor, bearing gifts and all other forms of economic aid and offers of technical assistance.”

Any distaste Ben Shapiro, an orthodox Jew and establishment conservative, might have for X and Ali would make perfect sense and would not be driven by bigotry. Shapiro could very well value Israel above free speech, and the wildly popular podcaster seems to carefully avoid taking any risk that could get him and the Daily Wire permanently crossways with global corporations. Shapiro isn’t nearly as bold as his high-profile counterparts Candace Owens and Matt Walsh. Owens relentlessly attacks the pathologies destroying black culture. Walsh unapologetically goes after the intellectual justifiers of childhood gender mutilation.

Over the weekend, Shapiro scolded Owens for retweeting the thoughts of Max Blumenthal, a journalist and critic of Zionism. Blumenthal is a white Jew. On Friday, he tweeted:

“We White American Jews are living in a golden age of power, affluence and safety. Acceptance of this reality threatens the entire Zionist enterprise, from lobby fronts like the ADL to the State of Israel, because Zionism relies on Jewish insecurity to justify itself.”

On Sunday, Shapiro quote-tweeted Owens and publicly admonished her, writing:

“I think the ADL is a partisan hack organization, too. But RTing Max Blumenthal, who spends his life covering for Jew-haters and stumping for Israel’s destruction, makes the conversation significantly worse. It’s garbage.”

Shapiro models the same grievance political strategy used by the ultra-BLM crowd. The criticism he leveled at Owens and Blumenthal mirrors the critiques I’ve faced throughout my journalism career. Because I defend America by arguing that black Americans enjoy the highest level of safety, affluence, and freedom of any black people on the planet, the ultra-BLM activists label me, Thomas Sowell, Clarence Thomas, Larry Elder, and Candace Owens as traitors unworthy of platforms. Shapiro seems to be doing the same thing to Blumenthal, defining the journalist’s work as garbage and unworthy of consideration because of ethnic disloyalty.

It’s a familiar deplatforming strategy that’s inconsistent with Shapiro’s “facts don’t care about your feelings” mantra.

So what could unite deplatformers on the left and the right?

Power and money, the best friends of idolatry. Idolatry is at the root of all sin. American culture promotes the worship of commerce and power. Idolatry is most pervasive among the people who stand as cultural idols, the publicly celebrated arbiters of truth, the people who falsely believe they’ve ascended to a place of enlightenment above sin. The idolatry of power and money easily and pervasively afflicts ministers, pundits, and social justice warriors regardless of political affiliation. Self-righteousness breeds the kind of arrogance that makes a man or woman think he or she knows who should and should not be allowed to speak freely and be heard.

Self-righteousness fuels cancel culture. Fear guides it.

Faith in God alleviates fear. When American culture more closely adhered to Judeo-Christian values, the media acted more courageously. Journalists probed controversial thinkers and speakers. We aired their thoughts, refuted their misguided beliefs, and pondered their harsh truths.

Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali were in constant demand at radio and TV stations, college campuses, and wherever truth was explored.

Fear rules secular societies and undermines the convictions of believers. Fear caused Shapiro to support the experimental vaccines and to instinctively disavow Donald Trump. True journalists should prioritize understanding well ahead of support and disavowment.

Fear is at the root of the reaction to Kyrie Irving, Kanye West, and Max Blumenthal.

The ultra-BLM revolutionaries and ex-jocks turned broadcasters such as Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, and Reggie Miller fear losing their status and high-paying jobs at ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, CBS, and NBC.

Black Lives Matter is a for-profit shtick. We know that now because we’ve learned how the movement’s founders spent the $100 million raised in the name of the group’s only begotten son, George Floyd.

The reaction to West and Irving demonstrates how members of the black media and celebrity elite line their bank accounts by pretending to be friends of the “revolution.” What West and Irving said about Jewish people pales in comparison to the rhetoric of X and Ali. It’s not in the same galaxy.

Irving retweeted a graphic of an image of a documentary that was released in 2018 based on a book that was published in 2014. It took eight years before anyone realized that “Hebrews to Negroes” posed an existential threat to the Jewish community? Irving’s retweet of the doc is more harmful than Amazon hosting it?

The overreaction is illogical.

The black elites' rush to condemn Kyrie unmasks their real revolutionary mission. They speak for the corporate elite. They speak for Pfizer and other Big Pharma corporations, the primary advertisers on television, the makers of the experimental vaccines Irving refused to take. They speak for Amazon, the hosting and commerce platform that is now buying sports television rights.

No different from Ben Shapiro, LeBron James, Stephen A. Smith, Shannon Sharpe, Charlamagne tha Fraud, and roughly 90% of all Americans don’t want to get crossways with global corporations. They don’t want to jeopardize their power and the money that comes along with it.

The ultra-BLM revolutionaries are paid to make you believe real racism is BYU students shouting at a black Duke volleyball player or that 10 questionable police shootings involving career criminals are a bigger problem than thousands of black men and boys killed by gang violence.

It’s a very profitable scam. But the deception should be obvious now in the aftermath of the Brooklyn Nets suspending Irving for a tweet.

The revolutionaries spit on Kyrie’s free speech and freedom of religion. They co-signed his canceling. They would do the exact same thing to Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X.

LeBron, Smith, Sharpe, and Charlamagne are cowards acting at the behest of corporate overlords. They’re bought and paid for, controlled opposition. I don’t have a problem with it. Just admit it.

I want LeBron to admit that money is his god. He’s not alone. Hip-hop culture is a materialistic, secular culture. It preaches that the pursuit of money justifies all behavior.

Many of the black people disappointed that James and other NBA players haven’t spoken out in support of Kyrie are members of the hip-hop church that breeds love of money.

Many black Christians share the philosophy.

I’m a fan of James Brown, the classy CBS broadcaster. We share the same faith. Our convictions are not the same.

On Sunday, on a CBS NFL pregame show, Brown performed a two-minute monologue that demonized Irving. He insinuated that Irving’s retweet was “anti-Semitic.” Brown never uttered a word about Amazon.

James Brown would hate Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X.

Years ago, before secularism and fear took over American culture, we used to want to understand and debate Ali, X, Kyrie, and Kanye.



Ben Shapiro is a very bright man. He has no reason to fear Kyrie, Kanye, Blumenthal, or anyone who disagrees with him. Armed with the truth, he should engage with any critic and let his light push out darkness.

That’s been the history of America until those of us who believe in God and Judeo-Christian culture chose to deprioritize our faith to live more comfortably in a secular world. Our detachment from God has ratcheted up our fear and caused us to be less tolerant of speech we find disagreeable and uncomfortable. The silenced, the demonized, and the unheard become conspiratorial, unpredictable, and dangerous.

The division destroying America can be directly traced to our lack of resolve to protect the free speech of our adversaries.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-ben-shapiro-ultra-blm-malcolm-x,2022-11-09
Whitlock: The ‘bread’ showered on Kyler Murray and Deshaun Watson fuels NFL ‘circus’,"The same billionaires willing to pay Kyler Murray and Deshaun Watson $46 million a year in salary are too racist to pay black men $5 million to coach Murray and Watson.



The argument that the NFL is a bastion of white supremacy hasn’t made much sense for nearly 50 years. You’d think this past off-season would be the final nail in the outdated narrative. But it’s unlikely to die. It will be kept alive by a constant retelling of the league’s flawed history and a simple-minded explanation of the league’s hiring practices related to head coaches.

Welcome to NFL season 2022. Pardon me for my lack of enthusiasm.

Training camps have opened. We’re XX days from the start of the regular season. I’ve never been less excited for the start of professional football. The game feels disconnected from reality. It’s used as a prop to make specious arguments denigrating the league and America as systemically racist. I don’t have the stomach for it.

The American economy is in free fall. Inflation has shrunk the middle class. Times are hard for most Americans. Except for those with some rare athletic skill and/or a willingness to ignore the absurdity of elite influencers getting rich for promoting games and narratives intended to distract from our descent into Babylon.

Murray and Watson have rare athletic skills and little else. This off-season, the Arizona Cardinals and the Cleveland Browns rained record contracts on the pair of quarterbacks.

Despite two dozen sexual assault allegations and a likely suspension hovering, the Browns traded for Watson and gave him a guaranteed contract worth $230 million. It’s the most guaranteed money in NFL history. Imagine that. The man with a league-shattering number of sexual assault allegations received the most guaranteed money in NFL history. That’s quite the combination. And it’s rather surprising, given the fact that the NFL allegedly suffers from systemic racism. Watson is black.

So is Kyler Murray. Murray has no off-field issues. His issues are on the field. He’s now the second-highest-paid player in the league, trailing only Aaron Rodgers, but he’s not one of the NFL’s 10 best quarterbacks or 50 best players.

The wear and tear of the regular season causes the pint-sized QB to melt in December. In three seasons and 13 games in the month of December, the 5-foot-9, 190-pound passer has thrown 17 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. The Cardinals are 5-8 in those games.

In 46 NFL starts, Murray is 22-23-1. He’s never thrown for more than 26 TDs in a season. In this era, elite QBs routinely toss 35+ TDs. In his first three years, Murray has thrown 70 touchdowns and 34 interceptions. In comparison, in his first 46 starts, Patrick Mahomes tossed 114 TDs and 24 INTs. In 49 starts, Lamar Jackson has thrown 84 TDs and 31 INTs.

Let’s don’t even compare win-loss records. Mahomes and Jackson led winning teams. Kyler Murray makes more money than Mahomes and Jackson.

That’s likely going to change as it relates to Jackson. The Ravens and Jackson have spent much of the off-season trying to work out a deal. The contracts awarded to Watson and Murray have complicated those negotiations.

Given Murray’s deal, what do you pay Jackson? Jackson won the league’s MVP award in 2019.

But I digress. The point of this missive is to call out America’s absurd culture, priorities, and debates. The NFL, America’s national pastime, is America’s primary supplier of bread and circuses. It’s entertainment designed to keep the masses happy while the masses are robbed of God-given rights and freedoms.

That’s why the NFL refuses to defend itself from allegations of racism. That’s why Colin Kaepernick remains in the league’s conversation. The Raiders granted him a tryout this off-season. It’s why the Pittsburgh Steelers hired Brian Flores, the former Dolphins coach who is suing the NFL for racial discrimination. The Dolphins fired Flores. He claims he was fired because he’s black.

The NFL is a willing participant in the overthrow of American values.

For years, I wondered why a league and industry that produces more black male millionaires than any other industry is so reluctant to defend itself from allegations of systemic racism. Commissioner Roger Goodell and and the league’s top black executive, Troy Vincent, know the league’s positive impact on black boys and men.

Why won’t they tell it? Why do they constantly bend to the woke mob?

They know racial bias and animus do not explain the racial disparity between black and white head coaches. The owners don’t care who they pay to lead their teams. The Browns just gave an alleged black serial predator $230 million to play quarterback.

The truth is the tattered and shredded black family structure has undermined American black people’s ability to produce male leaders. We’re a matriarchal culture. Because of the psychological damage caused by having no father in the home, black athletes do not respond well to black male authority figures, especially in a sport with a leadership model similar to the military.



Here’s another inconvenient and uncomfortable truth: The rise of the black quarterback is directly tied to technological advances that allow coaches to puppet-master QBs from the sidelines.

In the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, quarterbacks used to routinely call their own plays. That’s no longer the case. Football games, now more than ever, are orchestrated from the sideline and the press box. The players are less valuable as leaders. They’re paid for their raw talent. That’s why the Browns do not care about Watson’s character flaws. He’s not being paid to lead. He’s being paid to follow the instructions communicated in his helmet.

He’d rather those instructions be delivered by a white man. That’s part of the reason he was so comfortable last season skipping the opportunity to play for David Culley in Houston.

Black players don’t care about black coaches. The whole simple-minded conversation about black NFL coaches is manufactured bread and circuses for talk show hosts and lazy journalists.

Whitlock: Brittney Griner’s Russian ‘Brokedown Palace’ less disappointing than America’s January 6 ‘Midnight Express’,"I grew up believing America’s imperfect criminal justice system was the fairest in the world. My schoolteachers taught me that as a child.



They warned that America’s primary rival, the Soviet Union/Russia, practiced a cleverly disguised system of oppression and corruption, in which citizens were powerless against government forces. They said American citizenship was a privilege, that people in other countries would do virtually anything to enjoy our rights and freedom.

Popular culture reinforced the narratives I learned in school. I’ll never forget the first time I watched the 1978 movie ""Midnight Express."" It was an adaptation of the life of Billy Hayes, an American vacationing in Turkey. Turkish police captured him at the airport in possession of two kilograms of hash. He was sentenced to four years in prison for possession. Shortly before his release, the prosecutor changed Billy’s conviction to smuggling, and he was resentenced to 30 years. Billy was beaten and raped in prison. The food was terrible.

I remember making a mental note that I did not ever want to break the law in a foreign country.

Years later, I watched the 1999 movie ""Brokedown Palace."" It was a fictional movie about two American girls vacationing in Thailand. A slick Australian man tricked them into smuggling heroin. Thai police captured them at the airport. They were sentenced to 33 years. A corrupt prosecutor later added 15 years to their sentence.

""Brokedown Palace"" reinforced my commitment never to break the law while traveling abroad.

I bring all this up to make a point about Brittney Griner, the WNBA player jailed in Russia for possessing a small amount of hashish at a Russian airport. She’s suffering in a ""Wokedown Palace."" I don’t make the reference to vilify Griner. Who knows whether she really broke the law? I certainly don’t.

Brittney Griner got arrested in the absolute wrong place at the absolute wrong time.

It baffles me that the American media are attempting to make what’s happening to Griner an example of American racism. The Los Angeles Times recently published a piece by the great Bill Plaschke that vilified America for what’s happening to Brittney Griner in Russia. The piece argues that American racism is the reason Griner isn’t at home safe, sound, and spending the millions she earned playing basketball in Russia.

Plaschke wrote: “She’s black. She’s covered in tattoos. She has dreadlocks. She’s gay. She doesn’t fit America’s image of the ideal female athlete, so America is pretty much shrugging. If this had been Brady, we’d be going to war right now.”

Plaschke quoted Griner’s WNBA coach Vanessa Nygaard making this allegation: “If it was LeBron James, he’d be home, right? It’s a statement about the value of women, it’s a statement about the value of a black person. It’s a statement about the value of a gay person – all those things. We know it and so that’s what hurts a little more.”

Russia locks up a 6-foot-8 black woman for a tiny amount of hash, and it’s America’s fault. Really? What’s the matter with us? Are we really filled with this much self-hate?

I have experience in dealing with a foreign country that wrongly incarcerated a black American citizen. In 2016, Chinese police arrested a former Ball State University linebacker, Wendell Brown, for a minor bar altercation. Wendell spent three years locked up inside a Chinese prison. For his release, China’s corrupt criminal justice system required that the alleged “victim” needed to be paid $40,000. I paid it. Wendell came home in September 2019. He’s a great young man.

Chinese culture is hostile toward black people – unless you’re tall and play basketball. LeBron James won’t tell you that. No one associated with the NBA will state this obvious fact. Money is their ruler, not truth.

Like LeBron James, Brittney Griner is a globalist. She’ll go anywhere and say anything for the paycheck. Dissatisfied with her WNBA salary, Griner traveled to Russia to earn her millions. There’s a cost to the global agenda – a loss of American rights, customs, and freedom.

Griner earns approximately $221,000 a season in the WNBA. That’s a more than fair salary for a league that loses millions of dollars each year and is basically a charity financed by the NBA. WNBA players and their supporters disagree. American sexism is why WNBA players don’t earn millions playing a game virtually no one in America will pay to watch. According to the globalists, America is always the bad guy. America is always evil.

Griner is getting a taste of Russian oppression. It tastes like 1800s America, a time Griner knows nothing about. We can only hope that when she does return to America, she’ll muster the courage to sing this country’s praises.

This week, she wrote President Joe Biden a letter begging him to secure her release. WNBA and NBA players have spent the last five years demonizing America. Griner refused to stand for the national anthem. LeBron James and the NBA swallowed the entire Black Lives Matter agenda. Sitting in a Russian jail, Griner has rediscovered her patriotism.

“On the Fourth of July, our family normally honors the service of those who fought for our freedom, including my father who is a Vietnam War veteran,” Griner wrote. “It hurts thinking about how I usually celebrate this day because freedom means something completely different to me this year.”



Bottom line: I have more sympathy for Ashli Babbitt and the incarcerated January 6 protesters than I do for Brittney Griner. I say that because I’m not shocked or surprised that Russia would make an American citizen a political prisoner. It’s exactly what my schoolteachers told me Russia did.

I naively expected more from our criminal justice system.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-brittney-griner-brokedown-palace,2022-07-06
Whitlock: Cam Newton is a ‘bad b***h’ who doesn’t know when to be quiet or how to lead,"The coroner’s report on Cam Newton’s NFL career should list “lack of self-awareness” as the cause of death, not misogyny.

Newton returned to the news cycle yesterday after media outlets circulated comments about women he made during a recent podcast interview. On the Sunday edition of the “Million Dollaz Worth of Game” podcast, Newton discussed his upbringing, his parents’ long marriage, and his philosophy on women.

The latter comments provoked the ire of feminists, the matriarchy, Twitter, and beta males and cast Newton as the love child of Archie Bunker and Cardi B.

Newton said: “It’s a lot of women who are bad bit***s, and and I say ‘bit***s' in a way not to degrade a woman but just to go off the aesthetic of what they deem as a ‘boss chick.’ A woman for me is handling your own but knowing how to cater to man’s needs. I think a lot of times when you get that aesthetic of like ‘I’m a boss bit**, I’m a this, I’m a that,’ no baby. But you can’t cook. You don’t know when to be quiet. You don’t know how to allow a man to lead.”

ProFootballTalk’s Mike Florio wrote that Newton’s “outdated views regarding gender roles and obligations” will make it more difficult for Newton to land a job this off-season.

I disagree. Sans the profane language, Newton’s views on gender roles and obligations are commonplace in the NFL or among high-net-worth men. His views are standard among people, regardless of income, with a biblical worldview. Genesis 2:18 says that God created Eve as a suitable helper (helpmeet) for Adam.

Newton’s views are not problematic or outside the mainstream, especially within his peer group.

It’s his lack of self-awareness that’s the problem. The content of his podcast interview is a reflection of the lack of self-awareness that has undermined the success of his NFL career.

Newton never fully delivered on his seemingly endless potential because of his distorted view of himself. Talent and the coddling produced by immense athletic gifts blinded the quarterback prodigy to the harsh realities and inevitabilities of playing the most challenging position in all of sports.

Talent isn’t enough at quarterback. The intangibles of leadership, film study, technique, and persona matter as much as physical skill. Cam Newton was a rock star playing the one position in football that requires an actor. Newton was Rick James, b***h! He needed to be Denzel Washington.

Had Newton played tight end or outside linebacker, he’d likely be seen as a sure-fire Hall of Famer and a missing piece for some team’s Super Bowl dream. Instead, at age 32, the former MVP is jobless, quite possibly finished as an NFL player, and too many miles from Canton, Ohio, to hitchhike to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Rich Gannon, a journeyman, played in more Pro Bowls, won more games, and had a better career than Cam Newton. Why?

Because Newton has no idea how to be a leader. You can see the shortcoming in his attitude toward women.

“You don’t know how to allow a man to lead.”

Newton doesn’t know how to lead. He fathered four kids with a woman, Kim Proctor, he refuses to marry. His relationship with Proctor ended because he fathered a fifth child with an Instagram model.

Why would a woman follow a man with five illegitimate kids? Why would a woman cater to the needs of a man who refuses to cater to her desire for monogamy, matrimony, and spiritual salvation? Why would a woman agree to be a suitable helper to a man who eschews being obedient to God’s will?

You can’t lead without sacrifice. You can’t lead without following first. In order to follow God, man must sacrifice the desires of the world.

This is at the heart of Newton’s professional underachievement. His talents convinced him he didn’t need to do all the little things that make great quarterbacks and great leaders. When it comes to relationships, wealthy men suffer the same delusion. They think finances allow them to bend the rules in their personal relationships with women.

I’ve made this mistake too many times to count.

In the podcast interview, Newton praised his dad and mom for sustaining their 38-year marriage. His parents are devout Christians. Newton said his father set a tremendous example of what a man is supposed to be.

Did Cam follow his father’s blueprint? Is Cam obedient to God’s will?

Cam’s lack of self-awareness is the reason he doesn’t know when to be quiet, when to be humble, when to be reflective, and when to evaluate his own behavior rather than analyze the actions of “bad bit***s” and boss chicks.

Newton’s intentions on and off the field are positive. He wants to be a great football player. He wants to build a great family, similar to his parents. Talent and money have prevented him from taking the necessary steps to make those goals a reality.



Virtually every NFL owner, executive, and coach desires a woman who can cook, caters to his needs, knows when to be quiet, and will allow him to lead. They want the exact same thing from their players.

As a football player, Cam Newton is a lot like the “bad bit***s” he describes. Everybody eventually tires of “bad bit***s.” The NFL is tired of Cam.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-cam-newton-is-a-bad-b-h-who-doesnt-know-when-to-be-quiet-or-how-to-lead,2022-04-12
Whitlock: Dave Chappelle attacker a symptom of the BLM-LGBTQ ‘replacement theory’ undermining the American family,"Will Smith did not beget Isaiah Lee, the 23-year-old wannabe rapper who attacked comedian Dave Chappelle.

Black Lives Matter bred Lee.

On the surface, it makes sense to assume that the Will Smith “slap heard ‘round the world” inspired Lee to run on stage at the Hollywood Bowl and tackle Chappelle Tuesday night.

A month ago, Smith struck Chris Rock on the Oscars stage, calmly sauntered back to his front-row seat, berated Rock from the audience, and 20 minutes later returned to the stage to deliver an acceptance speech for the night’s biggest award. Smith and the Academy Awards set an ugly precedent. The wildly popular actor assaulted an extremely popular comedian for a harmless joke and suffered no real consequences for his lawless behavior.

Like the rest of America, I’m sure Lee took note of Smith’s brazen act. But I’m equally sure Isaiah Lee did not fashion himself as the second coming of Will Smith, a billionaire celebrity.

No, Lee’s role models are the entitled, angry, and identity-confused victims who fashion themselves as social justice warriors under the names Black Lives Matter and Antifa, the enforcement arms of the Democratic Party and the LGBTQIA+ Alphabet Mafia.

Like the rest of America, for nearly a decade, Lee has watched BLM and Antifa rioters burn and loot cities and physically intimidate and harass their opponents without suffering legitimate consequences for their lawless behavior. If a BLM or Antifa supporter sees or hears something they don’t like, they’ve been encouraged to take swift, violent action in response. Kamala Harris, LeBron James, and social media influencers will defend their actions and raise money for their legal defense.

That is the fate Isaiah Lee envisions for himself. He sees himself as a mercenary in the BLM-LGBTQIA+ replacement theory culture war. He expects to be treated as a hero among the confederation of revolutionaries replacing “Western Civilization-prescribed, nuclear family structure with extended families and villages that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.”

That’s the goal of Black Lives Matter. It was one of the organization’s original public policy positions. BLM didn’t say “replace” nuclear family structure. It said “disrupt” the nuclear family structure. It’s the same thing. The Alphabet Mafia wants to replace God’s natural order for family. That’s the replacement theory destroying America.

Dave Chappelle is a dues-paying member of a nuclear family. He lives in small-town Ohio with his wife and kids. That family structure informs his humor and point of view. It’s why he’s had such a hard time in Hollywood. He struggles to get completely on board with the Hollywood agenda. He complained about and subsequently refused to wear a dress for a role in a movie. He mocks transgenderism. The LGBTQIA+ wing of the Alphabet Mafia despises Chappelle. They want him silenced.

Shortly after being attacked, Chappelle jokingly described Lee as transgender. There’s no evidence that’s true. There is evidence that Lee fits the profile of a disaffected BLM and Antifa mercenary.

Lee grew up a ward of the state and was eventually raised by an activist grandmother who died unexpectedly when Lee was 14. In recent years, he lived with his brother and his brother’s girlfriend. Neighbors told reporters that Lee was volatile and easily frustrated. He posted social media pictures of himself wearing devil horns. He painted his fingernails black.

Lee is not a Will Smith wannabe. Lee looks like the kind of guy leftist billionaires fly all over the country to promote mayhem whenever a white police officer harms a resisting black criminal suspect.

Black Lives Matter created Isaiah Lee. America’s rotting family structure created Isaiah Lee. The rot is far more than our rapidly rising divorce and illegitimacy rates. It’s not just single-parent and divorced-parent kids running wild in major cities. Pampered, delusional, ungrateful, and bitter two-parent kids are running wild on college campuses.

Too many American parents have prioritized money, flat-screen TVs, smartphones, laptops, video games, lavish vacations, designer clothes, and multiple cars well ahead of faith, authentic engagement, patriotism, discipling, and fostering a culture of forgiveness and gratitude.

America has raised a generation of bitter and narcissistic radicals. Our young people are obsessed with recording their own personal history. They’re stars of their own ""Truman Shows.""



Isaiah Lee jumped on stage because he needed the content for his YouTube page and Instagram feed. It’s the same reason thousands of idiots swarmed Kenosha to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake or Minneapolis to protest George Floyd’s assisted suicide/murder. The “protesters” are content creators. In hopes of building a profitable following, they record everything on their smartphones. If they’re lucky, they could be the next Shaun King or DeRay Mckesson.

Isaiah Lee wants to be a rapper. That’s about all he has in common with Will Smith.

Everything else about Lee screams Jussie Smollett and Black Lives Matter, a bitter opportunist looking to elevate his profile, and a sad victim of the decay of the American family.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-dave-chappelle-attacker-a-symptom-of-the-blm-lgbtq-replacement-theory-undermining-the-american-family,2022-05-05
Whitlock: Does Dawn Staley realize her South Carolina players face a greater threat in Memphis than at BYU?,"I wonder if Dawn Staley, the queen of women’s college basketball, has heard the story of Eliza Fletcher.



Cleotha Abston, a career criminal, allegedly stalked, kidnapped, and murdered the 34-year-old schoolteacher on Friday. Fletcher, a mother and wife, was out on an early-morning jog in her hometown of Memphis, one of the most dangerous cities in America. According to statistics, you have a 1-in-12 chance of being a victim of violent or property crime while living in Memphis.

I wonder if Dawn Staley knows any of this. The South Carolina women’s coach recently canceled the Gamecocks’ home-and-home series against Brigham Young University because a Duke volleyball player, Rachel Richardson, claimed BYU fans taunted her with racial slurs.

“I just wanted to make sure our players didn’t have to endure that,” Staley told reporters this weekend. “Because if something happened of that manner, I don’t have the words to comfort them.”

Hmm. BYU was scheduled to play at South Carolina on Nov. 7. Next year, the Gamecocks were supposed to play at BYU.

There’s been no definitive evidence presented that the BYU crowd taunted Richardson or her teammates. The allegations first surfaced when Richardson’s godmother, Lesa Pamplin, a political candidate in Texas, tweeted that Richardson was racially harassed throughout the entirety of a televised volleyball match. Pamplin has a documented history of making anti-white racial remarks and promoting racial hoaxes.

BYU has a long history of hosting sporting events on its campus. The school’s basketball teams have a long history of employing black players and assistant coaches. BYU is known for its homogeneous white campus. It doesn’t have a reputation for using racial slurs at sporting events.

Today, a group of state politicians in South Carolina – the South Carolina Freedom Caucus – wrote a letter to Staley and athletics director Ray Tanner demanding that the school explain its hasty decision-making.

“Why did the University of South Carolina cancel the series against BYU when no supporting evidence existed to warrant such action? Will the University of South Carolina reschedule with BYU and issue a public apology if the allegations continue to be shown as false? Is it now the policy of the University to forgo, or more concerning, ignore any fact-finding missions into allegations of wrongdoing? Will the University be canceling all sporting events whenever any fan of any university against which the Gamecocks have an upcoming game is accused of acting inappropriately? Is the University of South Carolina now taking responsibility for all of its fans, regardless of any relationship with the University? What is the policy of the University of South Carolina for canceling games in which allegations of wrongdoing by a future opposing school’s fans are made? And finally, will the University of South Carolina decline any games with Duke University given the verifiable racially insensitive tweets by a member of Duke’s fan base, Mrs. Pamplin?”

The Freedom Caucus then made a series of freedom of information requests, seeking a paper trail to back up the decision to cancel the games.

South Carolina is the first school to cancel a home game out of fear that the visiting team’s fans would racially taunt their opponent. I guess Staley canceled the series out of fear of what might happen next year. Her players could be taunted.

The truth is Staley canceled South Carolina’s series with BYU to embarrass the Mormon institution and elevate her own profile. It was not a well-thought-out decision. It was emotional and manipulative.

Staley should do the same to Memphis. There’s actual proof that the city of Memphis is unsafe for young black people and people in general. The city’s murder rate rivals Chicago’s and St. Louis’. Last year, the mid-sized city recorded 346 murders.

For the first time in three decades, on Dec. 3, South Carolina will play Memphis. It’s a home-and-home series. Next year, the Gamecocks will travel to Memphis.

Where will Staley’s Gamecocks face more danger: Provo, Utah, or Memphis, Tennessee?

Based on the stats and reputation, Staley and the Gamecocks should bring extra security to Memphis. There’s plenty of evidence that Memphis is quite dangerous.

The tragedy that befell Eliza Fletcher is just the latest example. A year ago, the rap world and corporate media celebrated the murder of Young Dolph, the Nipsey Hussle of the South. The rappers say M.E.M.P.H.I.S. stands for making easy money pimping hoes in style.

That’s Memphis’ reputation.

Dawn Staley is comfortable taking a group of young women to Memphis, but not Provo. Staley is a hypocrite. Her hypocrisy is supported by corporate media.

In 2018, the Missouri Tigers played at South Carolina. There was an on-court fight that appeared to be instigated by Staley’s players. Sierra Michaelis, a former Mizzou basketball player, attended the game. She tweeted that South Carolina fans spit on Missouri players after the game. Here’s a link to the story.

Missouri’s athletics director, Jim Sterk, complained that Tigers players were called the N-word and spit on. He blamed Dawn Staley.

“We had players spit on and called the N-word and things like that,” Sterk said in 2018. “I mean it was not a good environment, and unfortunately and I think Coach Staley promoted that kind of atmosphere. And it’s unfortunate that she felt she had to do that.”

Staley dismissed the allegations as “serious and false.”

No one refused to play South Carolina. Stephen A. Smith never discussed the alleged racism bubbling within Staley’s program and fan base.

No one that I’m aware of has called out Staley for this blatant hypocrisy. When her fan base was accused of being out of control, she claimed her fans are the greatest in the world.

“Our fans are great. They’re loyal, they’re passionate, they understand basketball, they understand how to act in the stands,” she said.

“I stand by our fans. I stand by what they represent, I stand by how they cheer, I stand by every single thing they bring to the building, because it’s appropriate and well within the rules of the game.”

That’s black, elite privilege. Staley gets to defend her fan base. The BYU athletics director, Tom Holmoe, apologized before anyone even had a chance to investigate the legitimacy of Rachel Richardson’s claims.

This is idolatry. Based on skin color, Staley and her fans are above sin and BYU is covered in sin. Provo, Utah, is a place too dangerous for black women basketball players. Meanwhile, Memphis is heaven on earth.



Dawn Staley is committed to cleaning up Utah and ignoring Memphis. One percent of Utah is black. Sixty-four percent of Memphis is black.

Dawn Staley cares about Dawn Staley. She uses race to benefit her bank account.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-dawn-staley-byu-memphis,2022-09-07
Whitlock: The DNC and the Black KKK shocked that I would photoshop LeBron James in outfit they designed for him,"The DNC, the governing body of the Democratic Party, has been dressing black voters in Ku Klux Klan hoods and robes for 60 years.



Yesterday, I ran a photoshopped image with my column of LeBron James in a hood and robe to hammer a point I made in the column about the NBA player and leftist's bigoted attitude toward black people and indifference to the murder of a white teenager, Ethan Liming.

It’s not the first time – nor will it be the last time – I have made reference to a Black KKK. My first reference was in late 2007 after the murder of NFL star Sean Taylor, who was murdered inside his home. Prosecutors charged five men – Venjah Hunte, Eric Rivera, Jason Mitchell, Charles Wardlow, and Timothy Brown – with burglarizing and murdering Taylor. Before police identified and arrested the assailants, I wrote a piece predicting that Taylor died at the hands of the Black KKK, a term I created to describe the criminal gangs of young people who terrorize black communities.

My column and use of the term “Black KKK” shocked and angered leftists. Fifteen years later, leftists are still feigning shock, anger, and disbelief that I would argue that a KKK-like pathology afflicts black people who swallow leftist ideology.

The left-wing website Mediaite acted like the LeBron photoshop was a whodunit, publishing a piece titled “For Some Reason, The Blaze Published a Photoshopped Image of LeBron as a Klansman on a Jason Whitlock Article.” John Whitehouse, a reporter for the alt-left media platform Media Matters, complained over Twitter: “The Blaze – a far-right website of Glenn Beck, Steven Crowder, Mark Levin and more – photoshopped @kingjames into a KKK hood for a column by Jason Whitlock; archived version here:”

This isn’t a whodunit. I did it. I’ve been doing it. I’ve been arguing for years that white political leftists have forced black culture and people to adopt the mindset of the KKK. The Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1865 and served as the enforcement arm of the Democratic Party. It terrorized black and white people who refused to support the racist policies of the Democratic Party.

That’s not an opinion. It’s a historical fact.

There’s a myth promoted by Democrats that the party abandoned its racist policies and attitudes in the 1960s after losing the civil rights war. They did not shift their attitudes and policies. They seduced black people into adopting their anti-black attitudes and policies.

The Democratic National Committee, the governing body of the Democratic Party, massaged its name without telling black people or the media. In the late 1960s, the DNC switched to standing for Dead Negroes Confederacy. The Dead Negroes Confederacy loves dead negroes. Its policies and attitude promote the deaths of negroes.

LeBron James, most celebrity influencers, John Whitehouse, the writers at Media Matters and Mediaite, Joy Reid, Anderson Cooper, Rachel Maddow, Al Sharpton, and on and on are rewarded for advocating the policies of the Dead Negroes Confederacy.

Let’s take a quick glance at some of the DNC’s best work:

The DNC has convinced black voters that the annual slaughter of thousands of black babies through abortion is a fundamental freedom and right.

The DNC has convinced black voters that George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Eric Garner are more heroic and worthy of celebration than Clarence Thomas, Ben Carson, and Thomas Sowell.

The DNC, through its promotion of Black Lives Matter, has convinced black voters that the disruption of the nuclear family serves our interests.

The DNC has convinced black voters that a government check can replace a black father and husband.

The DNC has convinced black voters that all educational and behavioral standards must be lowered or removed because it believes black Americans can’t meet them.

The policies and cultural norms supported by the DNC lead to death, violence, chaos, dysfunction, and hostility toward religious faith and objective truth.

As a means of paying homage to old-school Klansmen, supporters of the Dead Negroes Confederacy fight for the right of black people and black entertainers to commodify, commercialize, and cling to calling each other “n***er.”

Worse, the work of the DNC has caused black people to be totally indifferent to black violence, carnage, and dysfunction.

Three black men allegedly murdered a white teenager and honor roll student, Ethan Liming, in the parking lot of LeBron’s I Promise School. LeBron doesn’t care. The outspoken NBA star who can seemingly never hold his tongue or Twitter fingers when anyone black is harmed by a white perpetrator has failed to say or do anything of substance about the death of Ethan Liming.

James is quiet because he’s a member of the DNC’s Black KKK. The Black KKK expects young black men to act violently and criminally. The Black KKK holds black people to no standard of moral behavior. The Black KKK believes in the superiority of whiteness and white people.

That’s why the DNC and the Black KKK are outraged whenever white people fail. Expectations are a sign of respect. The Dead Negroes Confederacy and the Black KKK have no expectations for black people.



That’s why Media Matters and Mediaite want to credit TheBlaze, Glenn Beck, Steven Crowder, and Mark Levin for my work, creativity, and excellence.

Media Matters, Mediaite, John Whitehouse, and the rest of the DNC don’t believe in black excellence. I do.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-dnc-black-kkk-lebron-james,2022-06-17
"Whitlock: Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey are a ‘poison pill’ for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google’s ‘Alphabet Mafia’","Based on the reaction to his bid to buy Twitter, Elon Musk is 100 times more dangerous to the establishment’s vision of a new world order than Donald Trump.



The response to Musk has been measured and strategic as opposed to emotional and impulsive. The establishment unleashed its gaggle of celebrity pit bulls on the former president. A pack of rabid actors, athletes, broadcasters, comedians, and print journalists gnawed at Trump’s ankles for four years, eventually crippling him and turning the 2020 election into a contest of what well-intentioned Americans would do to stop Adolf Hitler 2.0.

There’s not enough time to reimagine Musk as Hitler 3.0, especially since corporate media prematurely gave that title to Russia’s Vladimir Putin. The attack on Musk will be led by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and a team of lawyers, all hired by Twitter’s board of directors to thwart his proposed $43 billion takeover of the social media app. Stopping Musk’s existential threat to globalism will be a game of chess, not checkers.

In the technology-driven world we now live in – a matrix designed by Silicon Valley – controlling Twitter is more important than controlling the White House. That’s why Twitter’s board would rather kill itself than turn the app over to an individual who believes in freedom, free speech, and the U.S. Constitution.

The “poison pill” enacted to stop Musk could easily double as a suicide pill for the board that authorized it. By denying shareholders the right to vote on Musk’s proposal, Twitter’s board has abdicated its fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. Rather than act in the best interest of shareholders, the board served the interest of political and activist stakeholders.

Musk forced Twitter completely out of the closet. The app is hostile to free speech and a partisan tool reserved exclusively for Democrats. Worse, the reaction to Musk’s takeover puts an impossible-to-ignore spotlight on Silicon Valley’s control of public discourse and American culture.

The Twitter-Musk controversy brings into focus the power, importance, and influence of the five families governing the BLM-LGBTQIA+ Alphabet Mafia. The Alphabet Mafia reports to FAANG, the acronym CNBC host Jim Cramer gave to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google.

Musk’s bid to buy Twitter is an attempt to de-FAANG America. Twitter is the hit man for the Alphabet Mafia. Twitter assassinates reputations with false narratives and unfair allegations of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia. It censors, silences, and diminishes opponents of the Democratic Party.

If Musk acquires Twitter, he’ll have access to the algorithms, tactics, schemes, and correspondence that led to, among other things, Twitter disappearing the Hunter Biden laptop story and the banning of this nation’s 45th president from the app.

The richest man in the world owning Twitter is far more dangerous than even Donald Trump seated in the Oval Office. Trump could only complain about “fake news” and its origins. Musk could expose one of the co-conspirators in the alleged shadow government headquartered in Silicon Valley and the Pacific Northwest.

The members of FAANG do not want one of their soldiers (Twitter) captured and interrogated by Elon Musk. That’s way too dangerous a proposition for a man like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who already faces questions about the more than $400 million he spent fortifying the 2020 election. Musk’s involvement with Twitter could disrupt the warm and fuzzy narrative painted in Time Magazine about “The Secret Bipartisan Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election.”

Someone could snitch. In order to save the establishment, Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s zealot CEO, might be willing to off himself, climb into a bathtub and slit his wrists like Frank Pentangeli in “Godfather 2.”

But Jack Dorsey, one of Twitter’s founders and a member of the board, sounds like a man looking for witness protection. Dorsey spent the weekend working on his Salvatore Bonpensiero impersonation. Sal was an infamous character on the TV show “The Sopranos.” Everyone called him “Big Pussy.” He was one of Tony Soprano’s best friends from childhood. He was a rat and a snitch.

Dorsey might be Twitter’s Big Pussy. In a response to a Twitter user complaining about Twitter’s board, Dorsey tweeted: “It’s consistently been the dysfunction of the company.”

When another user tweeted that “good boards don’t create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time,” Dorsey responded with “big facts.”

When a user asked if Dorsey is allowed to talk in such a transparent manner, Dorsey stated flatly, “No.”

Dorsey is off the Twitter reservation. He resigned as CEO in November. His term on the board ends sometime this year. He’s friends with Elon Musk. Dorsey has joined the Musk Twitter Great Again movement. Dorsey is an insurrectionist.

In my view, he’s really a traitor with remorse.

Three years ago, during a three-hour podcast interview with Joe Rogan, Dorsey and one of his top underlings, Vijaya Gadde, acknowledged that Twitter’s algorithms were designed to amplify the voices and impact of groups Twitter deemed marginalized.

FAANG and its Alphabet Mafia are located in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest (Amazon). Those areas believe the most marginalized people on the planet are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and the silent P (pedophiles). Their voices have been amplified in corporate media to the point that no other voices can be heard as clearly.

Twitter was the primary tool used to normalize lesbian, gay, and bisexual behavior. It is now in the process of normalizing transgenderism. Estimates are that 1.4 million Americans identify as transgender. That’s .4 percent of America’s population. We are dramatically changing American cultural norms and socially outlawing biblical, Christian worldviews to please .4 percent of the American population.

We’ve normalized gluttony in this country, but you can still speak against it and remain in solid standing on your job. That is not true for many Americans about sins of sexuality and gender. There is immense pressure to change your values or risk punishment from the Alphabet Mafia.

The Twitter Elon Musk says he wants to create values free speech above hurt feelings and culture-policing lynch mobs. Musk’s version of Twitter would adhere to the principles spelled out in the U.S. Constitution, not the principles written and rewritten in Silicon Valley.



If Musk is successful, FAANG may soon regret siccing its dogs on Donald Trump. The silencing of Trump and the sabotage of Parler awakened the masses to the corruption and true agenda of the Alphabet Mafia. They’re not promoting fairness, equality, and a higher form of democracy.

They’re making offers people can’t refuse in pursuit of authoritarian rulership and a new world order.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-elon-musk-and-jack-dorsey-are-a-poison-pill-for-facebook-amazon-apple-netflix-and-googles-alphabet-mafia,2022-04-18
Whitlock: ESPN broadcaster Sarah Spain’s childish behavior epitomizes the contagion undermining Matt Walsh’s documentary,"Historians will lament social media’s spread of the ""blocked and charged"" contagion. Its unprecedented negative impact on human engagement threatens democracies, freedom, and truth.



Blocked and charged is at the root of most of the alleged social contagions, existential threats, and pandemics the corporate medias rely on for ratings and relevance.

Blocked and charged has been around since the beginning of time. Its origins date back to the first time a young child stuck index fingers in his ears, closed his eyes, and shouted at the top of his lungs to avoid acknowledging an upsetting idea, opinion, or piece of information. Social media developers normalized the behavior for adults. Twitter and other social media apps trained influencers to block dissenting views and then charge their dissenters with racism, homophobia, misogyny, and/or transphobia.

Yesterday, ESPN opinionist Sarah Spain executed the blocked and charged concept to perfection. Troubled by a handful of Tampa Rays baseball players refusing to wear gay pride patches on their uniforms on religious grounds, Spain took to the ""Around the Horn"" airwaves to charge the players with bigotry.

“This is what tends to happen when frivolous class isn’t affected by things,” Spain said. “That religious exemption BS is used in sports and otherwise also allows for people to be denied health care, jobs, apartments, children, prescriptions, all sorts of rights. We have to stop tiptoeing around it because we’re trying to protect people who are trying to be bigoted from asking for them to be exempt from it, when the very people that they are bigoted against are suffering the consequences you say trying to be bigoted.”

That’s quite the word salad, but I believe Spain is saying that Tampa pitchers Jason Adam, Jalen Beeks, Brooks Raley, Jeffrey Springs and Ryan Thompson are using their religious faith to express bigotry.

After charging the players the players with bigotry on TV, Spain took to Twitter to clarify her position:

“Using your religion as a shield for ignorance and bigotry is antiquated – and it’s a choice. It’s a choice made of privilege. You’re not affected by the policies and laws that discriminate. You’re not endangered by the hatred that bubbles.”

She then, based on the replies of several of her dissenters, began the process of blocking people who disagreed with her anti-religion screeds.

Blocked. Charged.

It’s the preferred tactic of corporate media. It’s the nuclear option for ""mute and dispute.""

The negative impact on American culture cannot be denied. Social media has trained us to avoid engagement with people we disagree with and to never settle an argument. Block, charge, and move on.

The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh produced a provocative, thoughtful, and entertaining documentary on the transgender issue. Most of the legacy media are refusing to review the doc or interview Walsh. The Daily Wire published a story about the vitriolic rejection emails it received from movie critics.

“Hard f–ing pass. I won’t give that transphobic bigot a platform on my site. Never email me again” one respondent told the Wire’s PR team.

Blocked. Charged.









This is a social media contagion that has polluted our entire society. For years, I didn’t have one friend who cared that I was politically agnostic and that my worldview was biblically conservative. I’ve never voted. No one cared.

I’ve lost numerous friends because I don’t hate Trump or his supporters. I don’t hate Obama or his supporters. I don’t like policies and customs that contradict my biblically conservative worldview. I don’t hate Joe Biden. I don’t like the policies, the high gas prices, the inflation, the demonization of working-class Trump supporters, the condescending attitude toward black people, or the persecution of January 6 protestors.

Years ago, before social media trained adults to act like children, I was a frequent guest on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News. My biblical worldview wasn’t controversial and dangerous. I was friends and co-workers with atheists. Blocked and charged interrupted lifelong friendships. CNN and MSNBC view me as problematic and will never have me on air again.

I don’t even vote. The politician I criticized the most and most viciously was Sarah Palin, a Republican, the right-wing AOC.

I’ve been blocked and charged by the left. This isn’t a personal whine. I’ve never sought the approval of the mainstream establishment. I’m whining because the blocked and charged contagion is destroying America. It’s dividing us. We no longer exchange ideas. We’re locked in silos constructed by the social media matrix. As long as that’s the case, our destruction is inevitable.

Whitlock: Fair to discuss whether 'vaccine' mania contributed to Damar Hamlin's collapse?,"Monday night, as I watched ESPN’s coverage of Damar Hamlin’s on-field collapse, I refused to entertain the possibility that the tragedy could be related to the NFL’s experimental medical trial (“vaccine”) coercion.



Other people were far less reluctant. Opponents of the experiment immediately connected Hamlin’s cardiac arrest to his vaccination status, a status that I did not know Monday and still don’t today.

Anti-vaxxers – of which I am one – argued, mostly with anecdotal evidence, that there has been a rise in sudden death syndrome among young athletes since governments and corporations across the globe started force-feeding Donald Trump’s Operation Warp Speed medical trial.

I remain undecided on whether speculating about Hamlin’s vaccination status is appropriate at this time. The 24-year-old remains in a Cincinnati hospital fighting for his life.

What I do know is that many people within the pro-vaxx group seem determined to pin Hamlin’s health crisis on the sport of football. Football is the proverbial bad guy. Speaking ill of the game is celebrated in modern America, where anything as uniquely American as tackle football is despised.

What I also know is that for members of corporate media, questioning the methods and products of the pharmaceutical industry is rife with as much danger as questioning the influence of secular Jewish people in Hollywood. It’s a topic best avoided.

Big Pharma is the most influential advertiser in all of television. Sports television now depends on pharmaceutical companies the way it once depended on Miller Lite, Bud Lite, and Old Milwaukee. The dope dealer replaced the bartender as the biggest bully in TV.

Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna are the puppet masters of the pontificators on television. The vaccine manufacturers demand that their puppets blame football for whatever happened to Damar Hamlin on Monday.

Yesterday, CNN.com contracted sports writer Jeff Pearlman to spin a yarn about how Hamlin’s collapse mirrors the 1971 death of Chuck Hughes, a Detroit Lions receiver, and illustrates the inherent dangers in football.

“Is a game that results in so much pain and suffering a reasonable pursuit in an enlightened society?” Pearlman asked. “Should we talk more about the 2017 Boston University study that found Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) in 99% of brains obtained from NFL players, as well as 91% of college football player? Can we question the wisdom of grown men slamming into grown men? Can we debate whether youth tackle leagues are life-affirming, or insane?”

Chuck Hughes died because of undiagnosed blood clots. He collapsed walking back to the huddle. Had he been walking to the team bus, would CNN blame football? Hughes’ death speaks to the dangers of blood clots, the side effect researchers say the experimental medical trials cause.

And what does CTE have to do with Hamlin? Why bring up CTE? CTE is the convenient mystery disease that can only be diagnosed in a corpse. In my opinion, CTE is a distraction, another tool to demonize football and deflect from the drugs athletes ingest to compete.

On the CNN morning show, ESPN’s Bomani Jones talked with Don Lemon about Hamlin. And, of course, Jones blamed football too.



“It’s like trying to make a safe cigarette,” Jones said, comparing the game that produces millionaire athletes to the cancer-causing tobacco industry.

My reluctance to ponder the possibility that the “vaccines” the NFL promoted contributed to Hamlin’s cardiac arrest is starting to dissipate. If it’s fair to blame football, why not ponder the impact of the so-called clot shot?

I’m willing to pay the penalty for discussing the vaccine. We’ve seen from Elon Musk’s “Twitter Files” that social media platforms banned and shadow-banned people who questioned the efficacy of the shots. YouTube discourages its users from negatively discussing the shot.

Big Pharma greatly influences what we can and cannot discuss on all platforms. Its commercials finance the NFL and all the sports leagues. Roger Goodell would rather have football blamed for Hamlin’s collapse than have football viewers second-guess their fifth booster.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-fair-to-discuss-whether-vaccine-mania-contributed-to-damar-hamlin-s-collapse,2023-01-04
Whitlock: How Georgia’s blowout victory proves corporate media are the enemy of the people,"Corporate media consensus prophesies doom.



That’s my takeaway from last night’s embarrassing college football national championship game. The Georgia Bulldogs curb-stomped Texas Christian University 65-7 in college football’s showcase event.

For more than 30 years, I’ve argued that a playoff format would not improve major college football. The overwhelming majority of my peers completely disagreed with my take. They argued the lack of a postseason format diminished the game and denied participants and fans the all-important knowledge of which is the best team in Division I football.

I lost the argument 30 years ago, when the NCAA adopted the Bowl Coalition. A few years later, the coalition became the Bowl Championship Series, pitting the two top-ranked teams in a national championship game. In 2014, major college football moved to a four-game playoff system. In 2024, the playoffs will expand to 12 teams.

Has college football improved in the last 25 years? Has the game’s stature been elevated by a playoff format?

No. Not one bit.

Schools, coaches, executives, and now even the players have all made more money. But the product, experience, and stature have not been elevated. Greed, corruption, disloyalty, and irresponsibility have been elevated across college sports.

As I argued from the outset, college football’s regular season has been diminished by its postseason. When there was no postseason, college football uniquely hosted the most important regular season in all of team sports. Every single game absolutely mattered. When Alabama played a mid-major cupcake, the inevitable outcome was important. Bama needed to win big and impressively. Style points mattered. In securing a national title, Georgia Tech’s 35-point victory over Chattanooga in 1990 was every bit as important as its bowl victory over Nebraska.

Last night’s national title game generated no real buzz. The playoff format ended the importance and prestige of New Year’s Day bowl games. The Sunday end of the NFL regular season overshadows Monday’s end to the college football season.

Many of college football’s best players skip the postseason unless their team qualified for the playoffs. The bowl season has been rendered irrelevant.

College football is worse than it was 30 years ago. The focus on generating more and more money for a handful of elites has justified a selfishness among all participants. Players transfer at a whim. Coaches are afraid to promote any values inconsistent with the whims of social media. Schools bolt conferences and abandon rivalries at the whiff of an additional dollar.

No one in corporate media will acknowledge their mistake or the fact that their arguments served establishment greed rather than the needs of young men.

The whole scenario reminds me of corporate media’s role in the experimental medical trials forced on the public during the so-called COVID pandemic.

No one in the media will admit his or her complicity in paving the road to vaccine insanity. Journalists and broadcasters did the bidding of Big Pharma corporations and the government. The media did not serve the public.

Watch this clip of MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow pleading with viewers to take the experimental medical trial.

“If you’re unvaccinated, you have a much higher chance of this newly transmissible variant we have never seen before,” she said. “And it’s the unvaccinated people who it’s going to make sick.”

This really isn’t a partisan issue. Donald Trump still pushes the experimental medical trials. Establishment conservatives such as Ben Shapiro irresponsibly promoted the experiment vaccines. Here’s a tweet from Ben chastising Elijah Schaffer for arguing that man’s natural immune system was superior to the COVID experiments.

“The vaccine is 95% effective in preventing you from getting the virus, and also mitigates the severity of the disease,” Shapiro stated. To his credit, Shapiro has walked back his vaccine support. He’s one of the very few.

ESPN personalities Stephen A. Smith and Michael Wilbon routinely blasted Kyrie Irving for refusing the experimental medical trial. Now that it’s obvious the “vaccines” do little to prevent transmission of the virus and have several potential serious side effects, Smith and Wilbon have yet to apologize to Irving or football star Aaron Rodgers.

The purpose of mainstream media seems to be to mislead us. Cynics argue that this has always been true. I don’t believe that. I worked in mainstream journalism during the 1990s and 2000s. There was a bias against conservative perspectives. But the open hostility to truth and coordinated intention to mislead are new. They’re a byproduct of media consolidation and subsequent lack of competition.

Mainstream media was most healthy in the 1950s and 1960s when there were two and three newspapers in most major and midsize cities. Competition kept the media honest. My favorite journalist of all time – Chicago columnist Mike Royko – excelled because all the Chicago newspapers would pay him to write for them. The competition allowed him to write uncomfortable truths about the politicians and business leaders who ran Chicago.

By the time I became a sports columnist in Kansas City in the mid-1990s, there was only one newspaper, the KC Star. But there were newspapers around the country that desired my services. The local radio and TV stations competed for my services. The competition afforded me the freedom to challenge the corporations, politicians, coaches, executives, and millionaire athletes.



Now, there’s a media coalition, similar to the coalition that ruined college football. College football is meant to be a regional sport, not a national tournament. The game is healthiest when Alabama and Georgia focus on winning the SEC rather than a national championship. It’s better when Ohio State and Michigan covet Big Ten supremacy rather than national supremacy.

National and global societies do not function as fairly as local societies. America’s founders knew this. That’s why they intended for states to reign supreme. The founders of college football intended for conferences to reign supreme. Now powerful conferences such as the PAC-12 and Big 12 may vanish in the next decade.

Corporate media consensus convinced us to blow up a system that was working as intended and serving football fans quite well. The mainstream media have been transformed into the enemy of the people, the promoters of a Utopian global society that empowers and enriches the elite and their billion-dollar corporations.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-how-georgias-blowout-victory-proves-corporate-media-are-the-enemy-of-the-people,2023-01-10
Whitlock: Jerrod Carmichael and Golden Globes use race to hide ‘Silent P’ agenda,"Jerrod Carmichael opened Tuesday’s Golden Globe Awards by telling a half-truth or half of a lie, depending on your perspective.



“Welcome to the 80th annual Golden Globe Awards,” the little-known comedian said, “I am your host, Jerrod Carmichael. Sure. Sure, sure, sure. And I’ll tell you why I’m here. I’m here because I’m black.”

In my opinion, that’s a lie. Carmichael hosted the celebration of movies and television because he’s gay. His skin color was the approved justification for handing the hosting gig to a 35-year-old “celebrity” most people do not know. But the real purpose was to reinforce Hollywood’s preference for the feminization of American culture and to blunt criticism of its agenda by preemptively framing any pushback as racist.

So Carmichael took the stage and blasted the theme of race, racism, and white supremacy. He’s a malleable tool. No masculine, hetrosexual man would voluntarily emasculate himself in front of millions of TV viewers. A half-million-dollar check wouldn’t compel me to do what Carmichael did Tuesday night.

He told the world he was unqualified for the job the corrupt Hollywood Foreign Press Association gave him. The HFPA puts on the Golden Globes.

“This show, the Golden Globe Awards, did not air last year,” Carmichael continued, “because the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which I don’t say they were a racist organization, but they didn’t have a single black member until George Floyd died, so do with that information what you will. I’ll tell you how I got here. Why am I here on the stage with you guys tonight?

“One minute you’re making mint tea at home. The next you’re being asked to be the black face of an embattled white organization. Life really comes at you fast, you know?”

Nope. Carmichael is not the black face of a white organization. He’s a soldier in the Alphabet Mafia takeover of American culture.

That’s the whole truth, the real uncomfortable truth that all of America is afraid to address. The LGBTQ+ Silent P movement controls popular culture, our schools, religious institutions, social media, the sports world, and politics.

The Silent P, which stands for both perversion and pedophilia, is the Alphabet Mafia’s superpower. The Silent P powers the drag queen groomers at our elementary schools. The Silent P is the reason Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell can be jailed for running a child sex trafficking organization without being forced to publicly name their clients. The Silent P is why no one in the mainstream media is interested in the fact President Biden’s daughter claims her dad showered with her when she was a child.

The Silent P is all-powerful. The Silent P is the glue to the shadow government ruling America.

Let’s get really uncomfortable. Why is the LGBTQ+ Silent P movement partnered with BLM? Why have LGBTQ and Black Lives Matter become the new peanut butter and jelly?

Because pedophilia and perversion run amok in deconstructed families and communities. A lack of proper, two-parent, mama-and-daddy adult supervision fertilizes sexual misconduct.

Just-home-from-jail uncles and cousins wreak havoc among unsupervised children. Unmarried, lonely, directionless women wreak havoc among unsupervised young boys.

The destruction of traditional marital roles has turned America into a sexual petri dish. While both parents pursue careers, we’ve turned raising and developing kids into a side hustle, a second job, a task left to schoolteachers.

Rather than correct our error, the Alphabet Mafia is normalizing the dysfunction. A heterosexual, God-fearing black man in Hollywood is a dinosaur 10 years from extinction. The heterosexual God-fearing white man has 15 years left.

The Alphabet Mafia is winning in a landslide. Black elites are its co-conspirators. The black media hailed Carmichael’s monologue and selection as host as historic. We’re so filled with racial idolatry we can’t see our role in a satanic plot.

The Hollywood Foreign Press Association has a long history of corruption. Twenty-five years ago, the Washington Post exposed the organization’s unethical policies that included financial payoffs, payola, and expensive gifts to its 87 members.

In 2021, riding the George Floyd racial grifting wave, the Los Angeles Times repeated much of the Washington Post’s old reporting and added in the fact the HFPA had no black members at the time. Is that fact really all that surprising? How many black people cover American movies and television for foreign countries? Are we shocked Leroy Washington doesn’t work for the Hong Kong Gazette?

The solution? Add black members to the HFPA. Six black people joined the HFPA mob. One of the new members is Kelley Carter, a writer for ESPN’s “Andscape,” a ridiculously named website that covers sports and culture. ESPN is based in Bristol, Connecticut. ESPN is not the foreign press.

Stephen Hill, a black man, was named producer of the Golden Globes. And Carmichael was named the show’s host.

Black elites have no interest in correcting corruption. They only seek inclusion in it. Congrats to Carter, Hill, and Carmichael for joining the Klan. The celebration of this historic racial progress fits with the same mentality that revels in black people calling each other the N-word. We don’t want to end anti-black racism. We want to profit from it.

Late in his monologue, Carmichael talked about a meeting the HFPA wanted him to attend. He refused.



“They’re gonna fire me?” he cracked. “They haven’t had a black host in 79 years. They’re gonna fire the first one? I’m unfireable.”

Nope. They’re not going to fire an Alphabet soldier. Carmichael’s skin color is part of their deception. His real value is derived from his sexual preference. His sexual preference guarantees he will go along with the Silent P agenda.

He’s not alone. Every last one of us who have diminished the importance of family, deemphasized the priority of raising kids, and compromised our biblical values for popularity has made the same mistake as Carmichael.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-jerrod-carmichael-and-golden-globes-use-race-to-hide-silent-p-agenda,2023-01-12
Whitlock: Joe Burrow may be suffering from Colin Kaepernick disease,"I hope I’m wrong about Joe Burrow, the Cincinnati Bengals' quarterback.



I’m rooting for him. No different from how I rooted for Josh Rosen, Robert Griffin III, Cam Newton, and Colin Kaepernick. I root for pretty much every young quarterback. I want them all to be the next John Elway or Tom Brady or Peyton Manning.

Great quarterbacks make sports fun and interesting.

So Cincinnati Bengals fans, back off. We’re on the same team. My tweets analogizing Burrow to Rosen and Griffin were not written with malicious intent. They reflect my gut instincts at the moment.

They reflect the reality that sometimes young quarterbacks trip over their own egos and sabotage their careers.

I pride myself on having a highly sensitive QB-ego radar that allows me to detect potential problems before others see them. It starts with a gut feeling and then grows.

Monday afternoon, during a discussion with T.J. Moe and Steve Kim on my podcast, I had a tingling in my gut when we started talking about Joe Burrow. Initially I attributed the tingling to the thought of eating Skyline chili while visiting Kings Island theme park last Saturday. The chili is considered a delicacy in Cincinnati. A humane person wouldn’t feed that garbage to a dog.

Upon review, it wasn’t the chili that set off my radar. It was the realization that Burrow has some of the same personality quirks and characteristics as Rosen, Griffin, Newton, and Kaepernick.

Burrow is off to a horrible start in the 2022 NFL season. Fresh off a Super Bowl appearance, the Bengals are 0-2, having lost to the Mitchell Trubisky-quarterbacked Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cooper Rush-led Dallas Cowboys.

Joe Burrow is supposed to be the next big thing in football. In his first complete, injury-free season, he led the Bengals on an improbable run to the Super Bowl. Prognosticators saw Burrow as the second coming of Dan Marino.

But now Burrow can’t outscore Trubisky and Rush, two quarterbacks who will be holding clipboards around Halloween. What’s the problem?

Burrow has tossed four interceptions in two games. Despite a dynamic receiving corps, his yards per attempt hover around the bottom of the league. Cincy has scored a total of 37 points this season. Burrow has been sacked 13 times.

You can blame the sacks on Cincy’s rebuilt offensive line, but there’s more to the story. Burrow doesn’t look comfortable in the pocket. He’s leaving the pocket too soon, and he’s not climbing up in the pocket and helping his offensive tackles. The sacks are a combination of bad O-line play and a skittish quarterback who was sacked 70 times last season.

There’s more.

Does Burrow have the right attitude? Is Burrow too cocky for his own good? Has he prioritized social justice virtue-signaling above football greatness?

Is Burrow suffering from Colin Kaepernick disease?

The disease killed Josh Rosen in the football womb. The UCLA quarterback entered the NFL with the stated goal of being a social justice champion and complaining about the nine teams that didn’t draft him in the first round. He lasted one season as a starter in Arizona.

Kaepernick disease is a deadly form of arrogance, shallowness, narcissism, and wokeness. The disease is triggered when agents, handlers, and media influencers convince young athletes that their mission is to be more than athletes.

The disease has been around for a little more than a decade. Scientists believe the virus leaked from a laboratory in Portland, Oregon, years ago when Nike executives, at the behest of China, developed a formula to make LeBron James the next Muhammad Ali.

The leak sparked a pandemic across football and basketball. An early symptom of the disease was the desire to kneel during the national anthem. New variants of Kaepernick disease cause athletes to speak out on political issues they know very little about.

Burrow recently posted on Instagram about abortion and the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. In June, he urged politicians to “get those crazy guns.” Back in 2020, during the summer of George Floyd, Burrow and his Bengals teammates made a joint statement standing in front of the National Underground Railroad Museum.

There’s no doubt Burrow has at least a mild form of Kap disease. It’s not just the wokeness. The arrogance and flamboyance are other telltale signs of Kap. Arrogance and flamboyance destroyed Cam Newton and RG3.

Like Newton and Griffin, Burrow had a singular, spectacular season in college football, won the Heisman Trophy, and entered the NFL draft amid high expectations.

Early in Newton’s and Griffin’s pro careers, my QB-ego radar started sending me signals that they would not sustain their success. Once Newton committed to dressing like the Queen of England, I jumped ship. When Griffin refused to come out of a playoff game against Seattle, even though it was obvious that his injured knee rendered him useless, I jumped off the Griffin bandwagon.

I was ridiculed and reviled for arguing that their egos and off-field ambitions would undermine their success.

That’s what I see potentially happening with Joe Burrow. He wants to be more than an athlete. He wants to be a fashionista. He wants to engage in political discussions. He’s distracted and cocky.



He’s headed down the same path as Rosen, Griffin, Newton, and Kaepernick. Those guys all ignored my warning and continued down the path of destruction.

Joe Burrow should focus solely on football right now. He can be a runway model and uninformed political pundit in his 40s. Now’s the time to be a great quarterback.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-joe-burrow-colin-kaepernick-disease,2022-09-21
Whitlock: Kanye West provokes Oscar performances across social media,"A platform is a stage. Stages compel performance, acting. Big Tech and its social media apps constructed platforms for everyone with access to wifi and a smartphone.



Big Tech turned us into actors, inauthentic performers.

When news happens, we rush to our platforms and channel Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, and Denzel Washington. We act out the roles that we hope will garner the loudest applause in the form of likes, retweets, and follows.

Over the last two weeks or so, we’ve all been playing roles in a movie about Kanye West, the rapper, fashion designer, and provocateur. He wore a White Lives Matter T-shirt in Paris. He threatened to go “deathcon 3” on the Jewish people he blames for undermining him. He insinuated that George Floyd died from fentanyl, not Derek Chauvin’s knee.

Social media actors took to their stages and pretended West hijacked planes carrying nuclear bombs.

They claimed his T-shirt stunt denigrated black people, his Jewish comment fomented a second Holocaust, and his opinion about Floyd’s death damaged the legacy of a heroic martyr.

Meta kicked him off Instagram. Twitter suspended his account. Revolt TV deleted his ""Drink Champs"" interview. George Floyd’s family threatened a lawsuit.

For his refusal to follow the script, the social media matrix is using its actors to justify the deplatforming and canceling of Kanye West. We’ve seen it before. It happened to Louis Farrakhan, Alex Jones, and Donald Trump. The social media matrix programmed us to view Farrakhan, Jones, and Trump as existential threats.

The same thing is being done to Kanye, a mercurial rapper.

At what point do we reject the programming and realize it’s an outlawing of free speech and freedom of thought and an assault on truth?

You can’t find the truth without free speech. The rigorous exchange of ideas and opinions unearths the truth. The platforms Big Tech constructed for us compel dishonesty. Athletes, celebrities, influencers, and Joe Blow social media users – many of them unwittingly – are using “their platforms” to lie.

Let’s use George Floyd as an example.

No one outside Floyd’s immediate family and circle of close friends authentically cares about him or his memory. Floyd is a prop, a costume or wig for social media actors. They feign an affinity for a man they did not know, a man they would flee if he approached them on the streets.

Pretending to be offended by Kanye’s insinuation that fentanyl killed Floyd enhances a social media actor’s brand.

Here’s what Kanye actually said: “I watched the George Floyd documentary that Candace Owens put out. One of the things that his two roommates said was they want a tall guy like me, and the day that he died, he said a prayer for eight minutes. They hit him with the fentanyl. If you look, the guy’s knee wasn’t even on his neck like that.”

It’s not offensive.

How do I know? Because in May 2012, two Indianapolis sheriffs tasered and killed my cousin, Anton Butler, in the pouring rain. I loved my cousin. I helped raise him. He spent summers with me in Kansas City. Several years, I bought his school clothes and Christmas gifts. His mother was my first cousin. We grew up like siblings. Anton was the smartest kid my family ever produced.

As an adult, he was a lot like George Floyd. He did time in prison. He sold and used drugs. He had an incredible heart. Circumstance undermined the direction of his life.

Police claim sudden cardiac arrest due to cocaine intoxication killed my cousin. As a family, we dispute that explanation. Eyewitnesses I personally talked to told a far different story from the police.

I’ve written and talked about my cousin in the past. People have said to me via social media that my cousin was a criminal and died because of cocaine abuse.

None of it matters. People can hold whatever opinion they want. They are not required to adopt my beliefs. I’m not so arrogant that I believe people should be punished for disagreeing with me, even on an issue this personal and painful.



If Floyd’s family sues Kanye West, it will speak to their arrogance and greed.

The people claiming that West’s opinion on Floyd’s death is an example of anti-black racism are clueless and dishonest. The chief medical examiner testified during Chauvin’s trial that the fentanyl in Floyd’s system contributed to his death.

Anyone who denies that drugs played a role in Floyd’s decision to resist arrest and that his resistance contributed to his death is willfully ignorant. Or maybe they’re a social media actor campaigning for an Academy Award.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-kanye-west-provokes-oscar-performances-across-social-media,2022-10-18
Whitlock: Killing ‘Black Twitter’ would be Elon Musk’s greatest accomplishment,"If, as CNN fears, Elon Musk kills “Black Twitter,” I’m going to start calling the world’s richest man Pale Rider.



“Pale Rider” is my all-time favorite Western movie. It stars Clint Eastwood as a reluctant hero named the Preacher. He’s a retired gunman who has turned to the Lord. He settles in a California gold mining town and befriends a group of desperate speculators who are being bullied off their land by the evil Coy LaHood.

In the film’s climax, Eastwood saddles a pale horse, rides into town, and guns down LaHood and his band of hired guns.

Based on the story CNN published this weekend, Musk might be social media’s Pale Rider, the reluctant hero forced to confront the bullies limiting free speech and manipulating truth.

“Black Twitter is mourning the possible end of the influential community they found on Twitter more than a decade ago, but users are split between finding a new app or staying put,” the CNN story began.

How does Black Twitter mourn? A mass release of crying emojis?

That’s never explained.

The CNN story continued: “While users are still deciding what to do after recent changes on Twitter – like the restoration of previously banned accounts and the upcoming roll out of a new verification system – civil rights organizations like the NAACP have called on companies to pause all advertising on the social media platform.”

What’s so important about Black Twitter?

It’s the primary tool used to impose the progressive agenda. It’s how George Soros, Barack Obama, and corporate media silence dissent. Black Twitter is a gang of mercenaries hired by the uniparty establishment to smear dissenters with allegations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.

Black Twitter is an algorithm created by engineers and monitored by Northern California Millennials. Musk’s elimination of more than half of Twitter’s workforce severely curtails the efficiency and effectiveness of Black Twitter.

That’s the truth that CNN won’t tell you.

Black Twitter has always been a Silicon Valley psyop. Cultivating and maintaining uniform and monolithic thinking among black social media users is Twitter’s greatest crime. It’s everything the uniparty accuses Donald Trump of doing to his political supporters.

It’s mind control used to inspire and justify lawlessness and destruction in the name of honoring Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd.

Black Twitter legitimized the obvious lie that American law enforcement randomly kills unarmed black men. Out of fear of being labeled racist via social media, corporate media refused to dispute the falsehood of the Black Lives Matter movement with easily accessible data. Out of the same fear, corporate media still refuses to point out that BLM’s goal of disrupting the natural family would further destabilize American society.

Black Twitter is a fountain of misinformation. Nothing on the internet is more worthy of death. It’s a cult. Everything it has supported leads to cultural decay.

If Elon kills Black Twitter, I hope he invites me to give the eulogy. I came up with a list of Black Twitter’s five greatest accomplishments.

5) “What about Brett Favre?”

It’s the favorite question Black Twitter asks every time a black athlete gets in trouble. This really became popular when the Boston Celtics suspended head coach Ime Udoka for sexual misconduct. Favre’s malfeasance related to Mississippi welfare fraud is an underreported story, according to Black Twitter.

4) Buying lesbians mansions

Would the Marxist-trained lesbians who founded Black Lives Matter be living their best lives without the help of Black Twitter?

3) Colin “Mute-hammad Ali” Kaepernick

Black Twitter made Kaepernick an icon equivalent to Muhammad Ali, aka the Louisville Lip. Kaepernick rarely utters a word.

2) Hands up, don’t shoot



According to Black Twitter, a Ferguson police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, even though Brown had his arms raised in surrender and begged for his life.

1) Turning Shaun King black

Black Twitter made it possible for King to disavow his white father and live out his fantasy of being a black civil rights activist. On Twitter, blackness is a state of mind, not a skin color.

Like gender, blackness is a feeling defined by liberals.

"Whitlock: Kyrie Irving, not Colin Kaepernick, threatens the establishment","Bill Maher, the agnostic comedian, wrote and starred in a documentary that painted Christianity and other forms of faith as a mash-up of the words religion and ridiculous.



Released in 2008, “Religulous” spawned a tiny protest at a Canadian university and muted grumbling in the United States. Back then, in the infancy of social media, before Twitter turned performative outrage into the preferred method of seizing power, no one called for HBO or corporations to discipline Maher.

Fourteen years ago, you could write and star in a documentary with the expressed intention to offend, mock, and challenge conventional wisdom without people demanding that you lose your job.

I’m a Christian. I watched ""Religulous"" years ago because I’ve been a fan of the Jewish comedian for two decades. I find him funny, smart, sincere, and relatively honest. In 2010, after Maher argued that religious people were “deluded,” I wrote a column for the Kansas City Star that chastised him for, among other things, belittling the faith that inspired my mother, grandmother, Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and the men who sacrificed their lives in the Civil War.

Let’s compare the way I responded to Maher to what’s happening to Kyrie Irving, the NBA star, in the aftermath of a sentence-less tweet that listed a religious documentary – “Hebrews to Negroes” – that many Jewish people say is offensive.

A handful of Nets season ticket-holders sat courtside at Brooklyn’s last home game wearing T-shirts that stated “fight anti-Semitism.” The fans told an ESPN reporter that the Nets should suspend Irving. Many pundits in corporate media have vilified and demonized Irving. Last night on TNT’s NBA broadcast, Shaquille O’Neal called Irving an “idiot.” Charles Barkley said the NBA should suspend Irving for the tweet. Barkley insinuated the league should have disciplined Irving for tweeting out something Alex Jones said.

A sentence-less tweet about a documentary no one is watching sparked this much outrage. Why? I tried to watch it. It’s a bad documentary. It’s boring. It’s impossible to follow. It’s three hours, 30 minutes. I made it through the first 75 minutes only because I’m a glutton for punishment.

The documentarian, Ronald Dalton, is a member of the Black Hebrew Israelites, a group of mostly black men who believe they are the true Jewish people. I don’t buy their argument. I’ve had it explained to me two or three times over the past 10 years. I don’t get it. Mostly I don’t care. It’s America. People are free to believe whatever they want.

Bill Maher thinks I’m delusional because of my Christian faith. So what? I still like him. I’ll still pray that he will be saved and come into enlightenment. There’s a long, never-ending history of Christians being persecuted across the globe. Maher’s documentary doesn’t make me feel vulnerable. It makes me want to explain and testify. That’s what I did in 2010 in my Kansas City Star column.

The only thing interesting about Ronald Dalton’s documentary is the insane overreaction to it. The overreaction makes me want to rewatch it and try to discern why a Kyrie tweet has this kind of importance.

We want to suspend Kyrie from playing basketball over a tweet that doesn’t contain one word he wrote? Really? This makes no sense.

It can’t be the doc. The doc is too easy to ignore.

My tin-foil hat tells me Kyrie is loathed by globalists and their corporate media puppets because the system is doing everything in its power to prevent Irving from inspiring other athletes to think for themselves. The system prefers LeBron James and Colin Kaepernick, athletes who do exactly what their handlers tell them to do.

Kyrie refused to take the jab. That’s his real offense. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell bullied basketball and football players into taking the experimental medical trials that were advertised as vaccines.

Pro athletes have every right to be outraged. The experimental medical trials were at best useless and at worst harmful. Irving refused to be bullied.

Judging by his retweet of Alex Jones, Irving likely heeded Jones’ warnings about the “vaccines.” Alex Jones is a threat to the globalist propaganda machine.

Kyrie is seeking information from outside the approved sources. He’s being punished for that. I like Charles Barkley. I respect Charles. I consider him a friend and a well-intentioned American.

I’m highly suspicious of any broadcaster on television who earns more than $3 or $4 million a year whose first name isn’t Tucker. Anyone making more than $10 million a year – not named Tucker – has been let into the cult. Everybody else in corporate media is basically on the waiting list to join the cult.



They all took the jab. And it’s their job to punish any high-profile person who didn’t take the jab. If Kyrie goes unpunished, the narrative gatekeepers worry that Kevin Durant or Patrick Mahomes or some other black athlete might start questioning the wisdom of his handlers.

I’ve yet to see one gatekeeper argue that Amazon should be held responsible for selling “Hebrews to Negroes.” Amazon, not Kyrie, owns the platform profiting from the documentary.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-kyrie-irving-not-colin-kaepernick-threatens-the-establishment,2022-11-02
Whitlock: Kyrie Irving’s freedom exposes the enslaved,"Kyrie Irving did not betray Kevin Durant. Joseph Tsai, the owner of the Brooklyn Nets, did that.

Irving ended his partnership with Durant because Tsai left the mercurial point guard no choice when he suspended Irving in November over a harmless tweet. Tsai’s eight-game suspension legitimized the anti-Semitic smears leveled against Irving for retweeting a movie poster promoting “Hebrews 2 Negroes,” a long-winded documentary focused on the origins of American black men.

Late last week, Irving informed the Nets that he wanted to be traded before Thursday’s trade deadline. On Monday, Brooklyn acquiesced, sending Irving to the Dallas Mavericks for players and draft picks. Irving’s critics have argued that Irving’s trade demand was selfish and unfair to Durant.

I completely disagree. Kyrie had to exit Brooklyn for his own sanity. No way should he have continued to work for an owner who unfairly smeared him as anti-Semitic. If I’m Kevin Durant, as a friend to Irving, I would be supportive of his trade demand.

I’m anti-divorce. But if a friend were being physically abused in her marriage, I would be supportive of her seeking separation and/or divorce.

The damage Tsai and others inflicted on Irving’s reputation justified Irving’s exit. Durant has to be pragmatic enough to realize that. Also, let’s not forget that a year ago, Durant briefly asked to be traded.

The Irving-Durant partnership has been rocky since it started in 2019. Durant sat out the first season while recovering from an Achilles tear. Irving’s ankle injury in the playoffs contributed to the Nets losing a seven-game series to the Bucks in their second season. Year three of the duo was hampered by Irving’s justifiable decision to refuse the experimental COVID vaccination medical trials and an illogical New York stipulation that forbade Irving to play home games. This season, year four, ended with Kyrie’s trade to Dallas.

The bad guy here is Tsai. He mismanaged his relationship with Irving. Tsai should have forcefully spoken out against New York’s ridiculous COVID policies that allowed unvaccinated opponents to play at the Barclays Center. Irving could attend home games as a fan but couldn’t step on the court to play.

Tsai was unwilling to fight for Irving’s “my body, my choice” medical freedom. Tsai willingly participated in the NBA’s bullying of its perfectly healthy young athletes, forcing most of them to bow to the COVID gods.

Irving’s anti-vaxx stance, in my opinion, led to the anti-Semitic smear.

You’ll never convince me that any rational person was upset by Irving’s retweet of “Hebrews 2 Negroes.” No one watched the three-hour documentary. No one sincerely thought the documentary would harm the Jewish community. If they thought that, there would have been a legitimate effort to pressure Jeff Bezos to remove the doc from Amazon Prime. It’s still available for rental or purchase.

“Hebrews 2 Negroes” was a convenient excuse to punish Irving for refusing to take the experimental medical trials.

Big Pharma, the television networks, and sports leagues have worked in conjunction to intimidate and bully high-profile influencers into promoting the so-called vaccines that don’t stop transmission.

Irving is a hero. He withstood personal attacks from virtually all the sports broadcasters who are overpaid because of the money pharmaceutical companies dump into television. Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal, Stephen A. Smith, Michael Wilbon, Shannon Sharpe, and a laundry list of others ridiculed Irving at the behest of Big Pharma. They did so under the guise of standing against anti-Semitism.

Pro-vaccine belief really fueled the public scorn. Jealousy was also mixed in.

Kyrie Irving is truly free. Most men – black, white, or brown – are not free in modern America. They live in fear of political correctness, social media lynch mobs, secular elite Hollywood puppet masters, feminists, and globalist corporations.

I’m not saying Irving is immune to fear. I’m not saying I’m immune to fear. No man is free from fear.

I’m saying Irving has a line. Fear is only going to drive him so far. Most men today do not have a line. They’re going to do whatever money requires them to do. Those men can’t stand Kyrie Irving. They’re jealous of Irving. They’re bitter that Irving’s courage exposes their lack of courage.

That’s why ESPN’s Jay Williams was justified in asking Stephen A. Smith if his problem with Kyrie is personal. It is personal.

Smith is paid by ESPN to act like he’s free and fearless. Irving exposed that fallacy. The same thing happened to Charles Barkley.



No real man should have had a problem with Irving’s decision to refuse the vaccine. If we’re not supposed to count another man’s pockets, why would we monitor what another man is willing to inject into his body?

No real man should have had a problem with Irving’s retweet of a movie poster distributed on Amazon Prime. Irving is free to think he’s a Jew. He’s free to explore his heritage and reach right and wrong conclusions.

Irving’s freedom scares the mentally enslaved, the people who know their popularity, privilege, and paychecks depend on doing what they’re told. Irving represents exactly what Nike wants you to believe LeBron James represents. That’s why Nike dumped Kyrie. His vaccine stance and Israelite beliefs exposed LeBron as a fraudulent successor to Muhammad Ali.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-kyrie-irvings-freedom-exposes-the-enslaved,2023-02-07
"Whitlock: LeBron James is Jethro Bodine, basketball’s Beverly Hillbilly","Maybe LeBron James is right about Brittney Griner, the WNBA player currently detained inside a Russian jail cell.



Maybe the 6-foot-8 female basketball player feels every bit as entitled as her NBA peers. Maybe Griner is just as delusional and stupid as King James.

Athletic prowess undermines self-awareness and intellectual evolution. American culture baits the physically gifted to develop their bodies and ignore their minds.

James’ rewards have all been tied to his ability to shoot a basketball. That ability made him rich beyond his wildest dreams and provided him with an audience for his “intellectual” pontifications. If LeBron couldn’t shoot and dribble, he would have 50 to 75 social media followers and work the overnight shift at McDonald’s.

He did not earn his public platforms in the intellectual Olympics. They’re the spoils of America’s athletic idolatry. Those spoils foment entitlement and delusion.

That’s why James suggested Griner should question returning to America when she’s released from a Russian prison.

“How can she feel like America has her back?” James said on his TV show, ""The Shop."" “I would be feeling like, ‘Do I even want to go back to America?’”

James assumes Griner shares his delusion and entitlement. She’s tall, athletic, and famous. At age 31, she apparently attempted to enter a foreign country with a small amount of an illegal drug. Russian authorities arrested her approximately 150 days ago. She’s in the midst of a Russian show trial that could incarcerate her for the next 10 years.

LeBron James blames America for her predicament.

Of course he does. Griner is black. Anything bad that happens to black people anywhere on the planet is the fault of America and Trump supporters. Anything good that happens to black people is credited to the grace, mercy, sacrifice, and blood of white liberals and their only begotten son, Barack Obama.

In King James’ mind, Brittney Griner is a victim of America’s white supremacy, affinity for black oppression, and misogyny. What other plausible explanation is there for Russian authorities to arrest and detain a high-profile black women’s basketball player?

Vladamir Putin’s regime handcuffed Griner at the behest of Donald Trump. That’s it.

OK, what explains the more than 40 other American citizens wrongfully detained by foreign governments across the globe? What explains the six months Danny Fenster, an American journalist, spent locked inside a prison in Burma? Fenster is white. “60 Minutes” did a segment on Fenster’s imprisonment in February. The CBS news magazine explained that China wrongfully incarcerates more Americans than any other country.

LeBron James won’t touch that fact. Or maybe he blames America for China detaining Americans. That’s it. It’s George Washington’s fault.

Paul Whelan, a white former Marine, has been incarcerated in Russia for four years. He was sentenced to a 16-year sentence for espionage. Unlike Griner, Whelan refused to plead guilty. It is believed that Russia is holding him as a means to negotiate a prisoner swap with the United States.

Should the U.S. government prioritize Brittney Griner’s release ahead of Whelan’s? And, if so, why? Because she’s tall and black and can play basketball? Should America immediately cut a deal to bring Griner home?

That could potentially jeopardize the safety of all Americans traveling abroad in countries hostile to the American government.

James’ lack of sophistication is embarrassing. China disappears and re-educates its own celebrities who stray from the government-approved narrative. James and other NBA players love to visit China to hawk athletic apparel and gym shoes. If the U.S. bends over to bring home Brittney, one of James’ NBA peers or a low-level male player who plays overseas might be the next U.S. citizen wrongfully detained.

But the entitled can’t see beyond themselves. They’re narcissists. They never assess their own culpability or responsibility. Mix narcissism and entitlement with a Marxist and victimhood mentality, and James’ comments about Griner make perfect sense.

America did it. America mistreated Brittney Griner in Russia. Why would she want to return to the freest country on the planet? She should relocate to Saudi Arabia or some country that knows how to treat black women. Maybe she should move to West Africa, where the people once sold each other into slavery. I’m sure China would treat Brittney like a queen.

Tuesday, after TMZ brought attention to James’ comments about Griner and America, the NBA superstar clarified his comments on Twitter.

“My comments on ‘The Shop’ regarding Brittney Griner wasn’t knocking our beautiful country. I was simply saying how she’s probably feeling emotionally along with so many other emotions, thoughts, etc inside that cage she’s been in for over 100+ days! Long story short #BringHerHome”

Any chance LeBron could just limit his conversation to basketball? He knows basketball. He’s an expert on athletics. He has no understanding of how the world works for ordinary people.

After he claimed a vandal spray-painted a racial slur on his California mansion, he analogized himself to Emmett Till’s mother. Till was a 14-year-old black boy murdered in Mississippi in 1955. His mother held an open-casket funeral so people could see how badly beaten her son was.

LeBron James never saw the alleged spray paint on his second home. He lived in Cleveland at the time and was in the Bay area for the NBA Finals when he claimed vandals put graffiti on his home. He said his servants removed the graffiti before police could investigate.



LeBron James is the modern-day Jethro Bodine. Years ago Nike discovered an unlimited supply of athleticism buried in the womb of a single mother in Akron, Ohio. LeBron is the Beverly Hillbilly.

Come and listen to my story about a man named LeBron, a big dumb jock, barely kept his panties on. And then one day he was shootin' at a hoop, and up through the court come a China-loving dude.

Whitlock: We should focus on Salvador Ramos’ motivation rather than his mechanism for destruction,"I would rather live with guns than with unchallenged wickedness. I would rather fight the demons that provoked Salvador Ramos’ killing spree than disarm our citizenry.



The right to bear arms is the primary protector of American freedom. I don’t love guns. I love what they guarantee. They’re the lone defense against a government’s natural instinct to seize power and exercise control.

In the immediate aftermath of Salvador Ramos’ horrific rampage at a Texas elementary school, America’s seekers of power and control focused on the teenage mass murderer’s mechanism and ignored his motivation. The gun is the bad guy, not the demonic forces that radicalized an 18-year-old to gun down second-, third-, and fourth-graders.

Our current leadership elite prescribed a secular solution for an obvious spiritual problem. They believe the mechanism (gun) trumps the motivation (evil). They would rather live with unchallenged wickedness than with guns.

President Joe Biden said he reflected on the Texas tragedy during his 17-hour flight back from Asia. He compared America to the rest of the world.

“These kinds of mass shootings rarely happen anywhere else in the world. Why?” the president asked. “They have mental health problems. They have domestic disputes in other countries. They have people who are lost, but these kind of mass shootings never happen with the kind of frequency they happen in America. Why? Why are we willing to live with this carnage?”

Part of it might be that American citizens enjoy a form and level of freedom the rest of the world does not. That freedom is a byproduct of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The price of freedom is extremely high. No one wants to see 18 schoolchildren slaughtered. Many of us believe there are measures that can be taken to reduce mass shootings that don’t infringe upon the country’s founding principles.

Before Biden spoke, Vice President Kamala Harris cajoled her political peers to take action.

“Enough is enough,” she said. “As a nation, we have to have the courage to take action and understand the nexus between what makes for reasonable and sensible public policy to ensure something like this never happens again.”

The trade she is suggesting is one politicians have asked Americans repeatedly to make in the last 25 years. Trade your constitutionally guaranteed freedom for safety and surveillance. We made that trade after 9/11. It was a really bad trade. Political elites on both sides of the political spectrum think we’re dumb enough to do it again.

Freedom is the mechanism. The seekers of power and control, the self-appointed gods of the universe and new world order, view freedom as the root of all evil. Freedom must be stamped out, and that means guns must be controlled.

Just ask Steve Kerr, the famous basketball coach for the Golden State Warriors. Before Tuesday night’s Western Conference finals playoff game, Kerr threw a tantrum and claimed that politicians who oppose limits on the Second Amendment do so to retain political power.

“So I ask you, Mitch McConnell, I ask all of you senators who refuse to do anything about the violence and school shootings and supermarket shootings,” Kerr ranted. “I ask you: Are you going to put your own desire for power ahead of the lives of our children and our elderly and our churchgoers? Because that’s what it looks like. It’s what we do every week.”

The Mechanism vs. the Motivation.

That explains the divide. I used to demonize the mechanism. Seven or eight years ago, I was staunchly anti-gun. I argued the Second Amendment had outlived its usefulness. I did not believe American politicians were capable of forcefully stripping citizens of freedoms I took for granted.

I thought all Americans agreed on the essentialness of free speech and free thought and the importance of objective truth. Big Tech, Silicon Valley, and social media apps awakened me from that fantasy. By the time corporations started mandating experimental vaccines, I fully understood why the founders wrote the Second Amendment. Governments seek and abuse power when they have no fear of the governed.

No guns, no fear.

“As a nation, we have to ask, when in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?” Biden asked Tuesday night. “When in God’s name will we do what we all know in our gut needs to be done?”

My gut says we need to boldly challenge the wickedness running wild in America. Salvador Ramos is a manifestation of our unchecked wickedness. He’s a neglected and abused child. He lived with the grandmother he tried to kill. At the moment, we don’t know much about his parents.

His former school friends said his personality turned dark, “emo,” and “alternative” about two years ago, about the time we decided kids needed to isolate themselves to protect unhealthy people from COVID. Ramos spent the last two years of his life in the masked, isolated world we constructed out of fear. We sacrificed the mental and emotional wellness of young people for the benefit of old people controlled by fear and a lack of religious faith. According to his friends, Ramos loved playing the violent video game ""Call of Duty"" on Xbox. His friendships were no longer intimate and real. He communicated and connected via Instagram direct message. He hinted about his rampage in a direct message string with a girl in California, a girl he would never meet or talk to.

Ramos existed inside Big Tech’s lonely, wicked, and divisive matrix.

We’re comfortable with computers, video games, televisions, and smartphones seducing and babysitting young people because America has reduced children to a choice. They’re no longer our greatest responsibility, our greatest gift from God. They’re a choice made by a woman while she carries him or her in the womb. After birth, they’re a burden that stands in the way of our search for our true selves, our goal of groundbreaking career success, and financial reward.

We don’t value family, the nurturing, connective, and healthy bonds developed and shared between man, woman, and child. We want to disrupt the nuclear family, God’s natural order. We think a village can raise a child.



A village motivates monsters. Monsters turn to drugs, sex, and violence for relief. Far more kids will die of a drug overdose this year than from gun violence. The seekers of power and control support the drug mechanism. A drug haze makes the loss of freedom palatable.

I’d rather live with guns than with wickedness.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-motivation-not-mechanism,2022-05-25
Whitlock: NFL owner Daniel Snyder crumbling beneath Washington’s house of cards,"Daniel Snyder bought the wrong NFL team in the wrong city. He practices the wrong politics for the political football he purchased 23 years ago.



The midterm elections won’t save Dan Snyder. That’s my prediction.

There’s a false hope among political conservatives that a Republican landslide in the November elections will halt the persecution of American citizens who refuse to disavow the populist movement powered by Donald Trump.

The midterms will slow the persecution in some areas of the country, but nothing will change in our nation’s capital. Washington, D.C., is a leftist stronghold filled with government-dependent citizens and devout progressives. The political winds blow one direction in the District. It’s a headwind for Snyder.

The city’s newspaper of record, the Washington Post, had been tearing into Snyder long before Jeff Bezos gutted it of any semblance of objectivity and fairness. Snyder spent the first two decades of his ownership fighting the newspaper over his football team’s former nickname (Redskins). With that battle won, the Post has moved on to casting Snyder as the Harvey Weinstein of professional sports.

According to corporate media, Snyder is racist and sexist. Snyder keeps trying to make peace with enemies who have no interest in a negotiated settlement. He changed the team’s name to the Commanders, installed his wife as CEO, hired a black team president, a black general manager, and a Latino head coach and filled the organization’s senior leadership with four women.

Snyder is the poster boy of the left’s diversity, inclusion, and equity agenda.

It’s not enough. It never is.

The House of Representatives launched an investigation into Washington’s toxic work environment. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, no friend of Snyder’s, testified before the House yesterday.

Rashida Tlaib, the representative from Detroit, bashed Goodell for not removing Snyder from NFL ownership.

Snyder bought the wrong football team in the wrong city. He can’t win. He’s playing a never-ending road game. He’s surrounded by political people using him to make a point to Jerry Jones and every other pro sports owner.

You want to know why the NFL climbed into bed with the BLM-LGBTQ+ Alphabet Mafia? Look at what’s happening to Daniel Snyder.

That’s not written to suggest that Snyder is innocent of the allegations brought against him. Snyder is a rich and powerful man. Wealth and power corrupt. But Snyder is no more or less rich, powerful, and corrupt than Patriots owner Robert Kraft, the old man who likes rub-and-tugs.

Rich and powerful people, which includes our politicians, would rather virtue-signal about integrity than attempt to clean up and control their immoral behavior.

You follow? NFL owners, coaches, top executives, and high-profile players are all rich and powerful. They’re mostly men. They’re weak and live in a society that baits weakness. From the boardroom to the playing field, it’s a league filled with Deshaun Watsons and the 2010 version of Ben Roethlisberger.

Weak men with excess cash and free time. An idle mind is the devil’s playpen. For athletes and the people running athletic leagues, it’s wiser to buy Alphabet Mafia life insurance than run around uninsured.

Snyder had no insurance. He’s a hard-core conservative with a franchise attached to an area completely controlled by progressives. It was just a matter of time before he had a major accident and his wrongthink politics put him in the crosshairs.

When they’re done with Snyder, Jerry Jones will be next. Jones will be more difficult to take down. He’s based in Texas. He has allies throughout the state. He’s not playing an away game.

What’s going on with Snyder reminds me of one of my favorite TV shows, “House of Cards.”

The Kevin Spacey-fronted political drama was Netflix’s version of HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” Both shows depicted the evil men and women do in pursuit of political power. ""Thrones"" camouflaged its intent, weaving its narrative in fantasy with fire-breathing dragons, ice creatures, and a fictional world. ""Cards"" was more direct and relatable. Spacey’s character, Frank Underwood, was a South Carolina senator willing to do anything to acquire the presidency. In season 1, Underwood murdered his mistress, a female reporter with too much ambition and too little street smarts.

Public allegations of Spacey’s predatory sexual nature ruined the final season and legacy of “House of Cards.” Netflix wrote Frank Underwood out of the script. And now it’s sort of taboo to discuss the greatness of ""Cards."" The show isn’t treated like the “Cosby Show.” You can still watch ""Cards"" on Netflix, though.

I might rewatch it again.



Frank Underwood would be impressed with the way Democrat and Republican politicians are using Daniel Snyder to distract from true evil and corruption. Prosecutors are seeking a 30-to-55-year prison sentence for Ghislaine Maxwell, the sex trafficker who set up rich and powerful men with underage girls.

Politicians and corporate media have no interest in seeing or disclosing her client list. This is information that could show the public which of our politicians are compromised, susceptible to blackmail, and secret supporters of legalizing pedophilia. Maxwell’s client list could reveal the power source of the BLM-LGBTQ+ Alphabet Mafia.

Meanwhile, our politicians are pressuring the NFL to remove Daniel Snyder as an owner. It’s just another meaningless virtue signal.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-nfl-dan-snyder-washington,2022-06-23
Whitlock: Pro sports leagues riding the gay and black ‘Pride’ paths to hell,"The Bible stakes a clear position on pride. It is regarded as Satan’s aphrodisiac of choice, more powerful than wine, drugs, money, or brute force. A series of verses in the book of Proverbs spell out God’s position on pride.



Proverbs 11:2: “When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom.”

Proverbs 16:18: “One’s pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor.”

Proverbs 8:13: “The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.”

Proverbs 16:18: “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”

Roman Catholics believe pride is one of seven deadly sins – lust, greed, envy, sloth, gluttony, and envy are the others – and the root of all sin.

Ivan Provorov, a defenseman for the Philadelphia Flyers, belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, an offshoot of Roman Catholicism. No one should be surprised that he declined to participate in his team’s “Pride Night” activities. In fact, no serious Christian should involve himself with any celebration of pride, whether it’s gay pride, black pride, trans pride, American pride, Egg McMuffin pride, or even pride pride.

Pride is rooted in idolatry, the prioritization of a symbol, a thing, or an activity above worship of God.

Tuesday night, during pregame warm-ups, Provorov refused to wear an LGBTQ+ jersey and use a stick with rainbow tape. He told reporters he wanted to stay true to himself and his religion. His decision spurred derision and pushback from inside and outside the hockey world. NHL Network broadcaster Ethan Hradek suggested that Provorov should go fight in the Ukraine-Russian war.

“Ivan Provorov can get on a plane any day he wants and go back to a place where he feels more comfortable, take less money, and get on with his life that way if that’s problematic for him. If this is that much of a problem for him, to maybe assimilate into his group of teammates and in the community here in this country, that’s OK. Listen, you can feel any way you want. But the beauty is, if it bothers you that much, there’s always a chance to leave, go back to where you feel more comfortable – I understand there’s a conflict of sorts going on over there, maybe get involved.”

Tim Micallef, host of a popular sports talk show in Canada, ripped Provorov with the popular wrong-side-of-history argument.

“I will always be on the side of equality,” he said. “People will hide behind ideologies, like amazingly enough, religion. But I’m strong on this one and quite comfortable. Either you are for equality or you’re on the wrong side of history. Period.”

Some men pursue God, not history. Man is the God of recorded history. Micallef and others worship man. Provorov worships God.

Man believes pride is a virtue. The Bible says pride is Satan’s best tool for destruction. Who am I to believe?

I see the destructive power of pride on a daily basis. Even man’s written history reflects pride’s destructiveness. White supremacy is rooted in racial pride/racial idolatry. Black pride works just the same way as white pride. That’s why proponents of Black Lives Matter delight in having white people kneel and beg forgiveness.

The prioritization of skin color as a primary identity has led black people to embrace and defend a culture that denigrates and dehumanizes black people. We ignore the slaughter of our children based on the race of the killer. That’s black pride. It forbids black people to hate their sin. God commands us to hate sin, not people. Hating sin is good.

“The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil.”

America’s embrace of pride has reversed God’s directive. We hate people and celebrate sin.

Ivan Provorov is hated now because his faith compels him to avoid celebrating a lifestyle the Bible says is unhealthy. He disagrees with feigning pride in an activity he believes is wrong. He does not hate gay people. He’s not advocating that we deny gay people fundamental freedoms, rights, and respect. He’s rejecting pride, a deadly sin in his mind.

What would lead to a better society: hating people or rejecting pride?

The answer is easy. We should reject pride. It spawns wickedness and division. People’s sexual preference does not qualify them for a special night of celebration. Neither does a skin color.

Man’s nature is evil. Ivan Provorov and many other believers embrace the teachings in the Bible because it’s the best way to combat our destructive nature. Provorov wants to be on the right side of God because he knows man is incapable of producing a righteous world without biblical instruction.

Man uses hatred of man to produce justice. God tells us hatred of sin produces justice.

Let me make it simple. I have a weight problem. Man advises me to hate Ronald McDonald. God tells me to hate gluttony.



This sounds like a joke. It’s not. The woke have crafted arguments that obesity is a byproduct of white supremacy. Here’s one example. In a few years, the NHL and other sports leagues will be hosting Obesity Pride Nights. They’ll smother the hockey puck in gravy and demand that players eat fried chicken and cheeseburgers while on the ice.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-pro-sports-leagues-riding-the-gay-and-black-pride-paths-to-hell,2023-01-19
Whitlock: Respect for Marriage Act outlaws your religious beliefs,"The Silicon Valley-generated social media apps elevated the importance of feelings and diminished the value of beliefs.



The engineers of Twitter and Facebook laughed off Ben Shapiro’s facts-don’t-care-about-your-feelings declaration and retorted with “our feelings don’t care about your religious beliefs.”

Shapiro’s slogan burnished his brand as the voice of establishment conservatives. Social media’s retort empowered a movement that legalized same-sex marriage, justified Black Lives Matter, and normalized kid-friendly drag queen shows, children choosing genders, and doctors prescribing puberty blockers and surgical mutilation.

The engineers of social media won in a landslide. They’re in the process of taking another victory lap.

Chuck Schumer, the majority leader of the Senate, has gathered enough votes to federally codify same-sex marriage into the law of the land. Twelve Republicans joined 50 Democrats in pledging to federalize marriage and make gay people a protected class of American citizens.

They’re calling it the Respect for Marriage Act.

After the overturn of the left’s abortion golden calf, Roe v. Wade, the uniparty (the undercover alliance of Republicans and Democrats) wants to take steps to protect its same-sex golden calf, Obergefell v. Hodges. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas insinuated that the 2015 decision is unconstitutional.

The truth is, the uniparty believes religious beliefs are unconstitutional and immoral. The establishment has partnered with northern California’s tech companies to outlaw beliefs and set up a system that protects feelings.

You follow me?

I’ve argued from the outset of social media that Twitter and Facebook prioritize thoughts and feelings above beliefs. There’s a major difference between what a human being thinks or feels and what he believes.

I wake up most days thinking I’m as handsome as Idris Elba. The truth is, I believe I more closely resemble Cedric the Entertainer.

Our thoughts aren’t nearly as important as social media makes us believe. Humans think and feel all sorts of stupid and inaccurate things. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are great places to test what we think and sharpen what we believe. They’re practice facilities.

The devil resides in our thoughts. Our beliefs should reflect God’s wisdom. The founders understood this and designed a system that granted us the freedom to think and say whatever we want while respecting the self-evident truths of the equality of man and unalienable rights granted by our Creator.

Social media is the devil’s pulpit. We’re building a culture that protects thoughts and feelings and criminalizes beliefs.

The Respect for Marriage Act criminalizes biblical scripture. The concept of marriage is taken directly from the Bible. Marriage is explicitly explained in the Bible. It’s a covenant between man and woman.

I get that two men or two women think and/or feel they should be allowed to marry. That’s their American right to think, feel, and express whatever they want. But people of religious faith have the right to believe what God and the Bible teach.

Believers run the risk of loss of employment or lawsuits for acting on their beliefs. If a cake baker refuses to make a cake for a same-sex wedding, he can be sued.

Seven years ago, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed fired the city’s fire department chief, Kelvin Cochran, because he distributed a book he wrote that contained his religious views on homosexuality. Reed classified the book as discriminatory against the LGBT community.

It’s a mistake to maintain a culture that has more reverence for feelings than for beliefs. That’s where we are. Social media trained many of us to feel that the police were randomly killing black men across the country. Statistics and facts did not and do not support that feeling. We ignored the facts and worked to assuage feelings. We demonized and defunded law enforcement.



It’s foolish to act on emotion and feelings. Emotions and feelings change at a whim. The 7-year-old little girl who feels like a little boy is likely going to feel like a girl in a year or two. We shouldn’t confirm her misguided feelings.

We shouldn’t confirm the misguided feelings of two men or two women who want to marry. Marriage isn’t for them, just as marriage isn’t for men and women who refuse to practice monogamy.

Social media drives our overemphasis of feelings and our hostility toward religious beliefs. Emotion powers feelings. You arrive at beliefs after years of deliberation and more deliberation.

Our society was more unified when we judged beliefs and were less concerned with protecting feelings. Social media turns everything into a slogan or hashtag. Slogans burnish brands and manipulate truth.

Whitlock: Sports TV’s embrace of toxic hip-hop culture fuels Shannon Sharpe-Skip Bayless feud,"The embarrassing public beef between Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe reflects the consequence of sports television’s embrace of “Tha Culture.”



Tha Culture is short for hip-hop culture: the art, style of dress, and mindset associated with popular commercial rap music. Tha Culture foments violence, chaos, petty beefs, the prioritization of emotion over logic, and the justification of an immoral pursuit of money, power, and fame.

Six years ago, under the direction of then-Fox Sports 1 executive Jamie Horowitz, Skip and Shannon dove headfirst into Tha Culture with their debate TV show “Undisputed.”

Horowitz paid rapper Lil Wayne to befriend Bayless and create a theme song for the show. Horowitz, a former ESPN producer, envisioned “Undisputed” as the synagogue or holy land for the marriage of sports and hip-hop. Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Young Jeezy, and countless other rap icons joined Skip and Shannon to debate sports.

“Undisputed” represents the culmination of a 30-year process to replace rock with rap as the official music genre of sports. In the new millennium, inside an arena or stadium, DJ Khaled’s “All I Do Is Win” is what Queen’s “We Will Rock You” was in the 1980s and ‘90s.

The change in musical genre provoked a cultural shift that has impacted everything around sports, including the broadcasters. When it comes to black broadcasters, sports TV executives like Horowitz value the same characteristics as Lyor Cohen, a legendary hip-hop music mogul: street credibility, a lack of impulse control, buffoonery, and promotion of racial idolatry.

ESPN hired Stuart Scott in 1993 and tapped in to his ability to blend sports broadcasting with hip-hop references. Scott became the gold standard for black sports broadcasters. A decade later, ESPN created an opinion-based show, “Quite Frankly,” around Stephen A. Smith, which began the process of making Smith the gold standard for black sports opinionists.

Scott was a talented broadcaster. Smith was an accomplished news breaker covering the NBA. They earned their opportunities. But they were chosen for a reason. They fit the hip-hop profile the Worldwide Leader in Sports wanted to project. Let’s call them the LL Cool J and Kool Moe Dee of sports broadcasting. They had no idea that they were blazing a trail for Tupac Shakur and Eazy-E.

That’s where we are now. Sports TV executives prefer black gangsta broadcasters and opinionists over any black broadcaster with real substance. Criminal history, gang affiliation, and off-field indiscretions enhance qualifications rather than diminish them.

Horowitz hired Sharpe after CBS dumped him because of domestic violence allegations and a checkered history with women. Fox Sports hired Aqib Talib as an NFL broadcaster despite his shady past on and off the field. Amazon then hired Talib to be part of its Thursday Night Football broadcast team. When Talib was accused of being a provocateur when his brother allegedly murdered a Pee Wee football coach, Talib stepped away from the TNF gig. Amazon then turned to Richard Sherman, who was last seen trying to break down a door to confront his wife and her family. Showtime Sports backed and built the “All the Smoke” podcast featuring Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. During their playing careers, Barnes and Jackson had multiple on-court and off-court indiscretions.

Let me add some transparency. I worked at Fox Sports 1 alongside Sharpe, Michael Vick, Matt Barnes, and Stephen Jackson. I covered Aqib Talib’s college career. I was hired by Jamie Horowitz, just as Sharpe was.

I absolutely adore Mike Vick and how he has handled his life after his incarceration for his involvement in a dogfighting ring. I personally like Stephen Jackson. He’s well-intentioned although flawed and misguided. I promote the concept of giving any man a second or third chance at redemption and an opportunity.

But sports television has been overrun with a dangerous and poisonous mentality. It mirrors the rap music world.

Matt Barnes recorded an Instagram video yesterday that he would call a well-intentioned warning to Skip Bayless. Barnes predicted that “someone is going to end up hurting Skip.” It was not a well-intentioned warning. It was a video posted to justify violence against Bayless.

Skip Bayless is 71 years old. Barnes bragged that he’s stopped two people in the past year from beating up Skip. Barnes said an NBA coach and a player both wanted to harm Bayless. Lakers guard Russell Westbrook has publicly feuded with Bayless over the nickname “Westbrick.”

Bayless is in the social media crosshairs because of his Monday night tweet about Damar Hamlin, the Buffalo safety who suffered cardiac arrest during the game. Sharpe refused to appear on Tuesday’s episode of “Undisputed” because of Bayless’ tweet. On Wednesday, when Sharpe returned to the show, Skip and Shannon bickered and beefed to start the show. It was embarrassing and unnecessary. Bayless’ tweet was harmless.

“No doubt the NFL is considering postponing the rest of this game – but how? This late in the season, a game of this magnitude is crucial to the regular-season outcome … which suddenly seems so irrelevant.”

Sharpe, Barnes, Dez Bryant, Kendrick Perkins, and many other athletes pretended as if Bayless put a knee on the neck of Hamlin. Somehow Bayless’ tweet “disrespected” Hamlin and all professional athletes.

There’s no greater crime in hip-hop culture than disrespect. People get shot and killed over disrespect. Disrespect justifies beating up a 71-year-old television troll.

Disney and Fox have allowed sports TV to turn into Death Row Records. Shannon Sharpe is Suge Knight pursuing money, power, and fame by fanning the flames of racial animus around his co-host.

We keep seeing this in sports TV. It’s the exact same thing Maria Taylor and the New York Times did to Rachel Nichols two years ago at ESPN. In pursuit of a new contract, Taylor painted Nichols as a bigot by exaggerating offense to a secretly taped conversation involving Nichols and a friend.

What Sharpe, Barnes, and so-called black Twitter are doing mimics what the Anti-Defamation League, Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai, and NBA commissioner Adam Silver did to Kyrie Irving. Irving tweeted the poster of a documentary movie about the origins of American black people, and the ADL, the NBA, and the puppets that fear the ADL acted like Irving was the second coming of Adolf Hitler.



What’s happening is immoral, unfair, and dangerous. A crazed sports fan could attack Bayless. Over a tweet? A tweet that in no way disparaged Damar Hamlin or had any impact on his recovery.

It’s all a victimhood power grab backed by the threat of violence. It’s straight from the BLM-LGBTQ-ADL-NAACP Alphabet Mafia playbook.

The Alphabet Mafia controls Hollywood and “Tha Culture.”

Whitlock: The matriarchal mindset powers Lamar Jackson’s contract standoff with Ravens,"Lamar Jackson is playing with the Baltimore Ravens. He’s taking the chance of losing the good thing he has in Baltimore. He neglected the Ravens during their playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals. The 2019 MVP isn’t taking care of something good, the organization that poured into him the past five seasons.



Lamar Jackson should read his passive-aggressive Instagram post to himself. Then he should read it to his former teammate and volunteer media fluffer Robert Griffin III.

Here’s what Jackson posted:

“When you have something good, you don’t play with it. You don’t take chances losing it. You don’t neglect it. When you have something good, you pour into it. You appreciate it. Because when you take care of something good, that good thing takes care of you too.”

I suspect Jackson’s mother wrote the post. It sounds like dialogue ripped from a Tyler Perry movie or the 1995 classic “Waiting to Exhale.” The post ignores the cold, hard facts of professional football and life. It’s a point of view drenched in romantic fantasy.

Romance and finance partner at whorehouses and sugar-daddy websites. Everywhere else, they’re inevitable enemies.

That’s where we are in the Jackson-Ravens romance novel, the inevitable conclusion. The Baltimore Ravens poured everything into Lamar Jackson. They built their entire organization around a spectacular run-first quarterback. Everything the franchise does centers around making Jackson successful.

This is unusual in the NFL, where the Green Bay Packers drafted a quarterback with Aaron Rodgers still playing at an MVP level and Bill Belichick’s New England Patriots refused to provide Tom Brady adequate offensive personnel.

The Ravens poured into Lamar Jackson, acquiring backup quarterbacks who could run Jackson’s system, hiring and empowering an offensive coordinator adept at exploiting running QBs. The Ravens went all in on Lamar.

Now there’s a dispute about how much money the organization should guarantee the one-dimensional quarterback who has yet to experience real playoff success.

The financial dispute is complicated by the mistake made by the Cleveland Browns. Cleveland guaranteed Deshaun Watson $230 million. Watson did not deserve the money. He sat the entire 2021 season amid sexual assault allegations. To make matters worse, the Arizona Cardinals guaranteed Kyler Murray $189 million. Murray did not deserve it.

Happiness is based on expectations. The mistakes in Cleveland and Arizona understandably elevated Lamar’s expectations. But Baltimore cannot make sound business decisions based on Jackson’s expectations. And the franchise should not make bad business decisions based on the false racial narratives promoted by ESPN and Robert Griffin.

Griffin has spent the week demonizing anyone questioning Jackson’s decision to skip attending Baltimore’s playoff game against Cincinnati. Griffin is claiming that Jackson was too sick to travel and that people are “weaponizing” rumors to sabotage Jackson. Others at ESPN are complaining that Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert won’t have to fight to get large new contracts.

Jackson picked a contract fight the moment he and his mother decided not to retain an agent in 2018. Jackson’s mother is not qualified to negotiate the deal Jackson is trying to get. No one in corporate media is comfortable addressing the elephant in the room because of the satanic worship of women, particularly black women. Everyone is afraid of being accused of misogyny or racism.

RG3 definitely isn’t going to address the issue. He’s married to a white woman and lives in fear of a black Twitter storm calling him a sellout.

I like Lamar Jackson. But what’s happening to him right now has been rather predictable since draft night 2018 when everyone treated him as a victim of racism. He was the last pick of the first round. NFL experts pretended Jackson was the new Emmett Till. We wrapped him in the cocoon of victimhood. Five years later, we’re doing the same thing.

Once you’re granted victimhood, it’s nearly impossible to escape the brand.

Well, here’s the truth. Five NFL quarterbacks received new deals last off-season guaranteeing them at least $130 million: Matt Stafford, Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Kyler Murray, and Deshaun Watson. Their teams finished 5-12, 8-9, 5-12, 4-13, and 7-10. None of the teams made the playoffs or finished above .500.



It’s no mystery why the Ravens are reluctant to give Jackson a huge guaranteed contract. He’s not on the same level as Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. He’s not on the same level as Joe Burrow.

Lamar Jackson is unique. He should value the fact that the Ravens built their entire organization around his unique skill set. He should be pouring himself into the Baltimore Ravens.

Whitlock: The NBA and Adam Silver remind Kyrie Irving to ignore God and obey money,"I wish they’d all just admit it. Adam Silver, Roger Goodell, Phil Knight, the executives running the TV networks in bed with the NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL.



Professional sports are hostile to religious faith. Just admit it.

The widespread, orchestrated rebuke of Kyrie Irving has nothing to do with anti-Semitism and everything to do with removing faith in God from sports. Admit it.

You will never convince me that the controversy that has sidelined Irving’s 2022 basketball season is about a 2018 documentary. No way. Neither is it about Irving’s assumed position on the true origins of black Americans. Not buying it.

“Hebrews to Negroes,” the so-called sequel to Adolf Hitler’s anti-Jew manifesto ""Mein Kampf,"" is too confusing, too boring, and too dated to justify the relentless public trashing of Irving and his reputation.

The flogging of Kyrie is a message to athletes that their multimillion-dollar paychecks are dependent on their willingness to serve money above God.

The sports world no longer tolerates legitimate religious faith. Faith made Muhammad Ali refuse military induction. Faith compelled Martin Luther King Jr. to demand equal rights. Faith motivated white men to sacrifice their lives in the Civil War for the freedom of black people.

People of faith cannot be controlled. We live in a time when the elite seek unprecedented control of the American people. They want to tell us when we can worship, which experimental medical trials we must take, when we must wear a mask, which politicians we can support, and what is OK for us to think.

Kyrie Irving’s religious faith – no matter how misguided – makes him impossible to control. He wouldn’t take the vaccine and missed a significant portion of last season because of that decision. He’s refusing to fully grovel and beg forgiveness for a thought crime allegedly committed against Jewish people.

Irving’s mind is “diseased” with religious courage.

Professional sports cannot tolerate that. The NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLB climbed into partnership with the secular left, Black Lives Matter, and the other political descendants of Karl Marx.

The secular left – the true bigots – recognized 60 years ago that religious faith is what made America great and granted all of this country’s citizens freedom and opportunity. The proponents of Marxism and its systems of governance (communism and socialism) are systematically detaching all American institutions from religious faith to stop the rise of another Muhammad Ali or Martin Luther King.

Live televised sports are the strongest influencer of American culture.

That’s why the sports world has been seduced into adopting the satanic values of the music industry, particularly hip-hop music. You can’t enter a basketball arena at the high school, college, or professional level without hearing commercial rap music. Football practices and 7-on-7 tournaments pipe in commercial rap music.

Commercial music is traditionally rebellious and debaucherous. Generally speaking, parents drop their kids off at concerts. In contrast, sports have traditionally been patriotic and moral. Families enjoy sporting events together.

Now Jay-Z is an important partner and consultant with the NFL. Dr. Dre and Snoop starred during the Super Bowl halftime show. NBA All-Star weekend is the Lollapalooza of hip-hop.

Under the pretense of diversity, inclusion, equity, and racial sensitivity, professional sports – like all of corporate America – have been radically changed. Religious beliefs are seen as transphobic, homophobic, and racist. Kyrie’s form of religious conviction is considered anti-Semitic and dangerous.

Irving tweeted an image of a four-year-old documentary and has undergone a two-week public trial for anti-Semitism.

Adam Silver, the Jewish commissioner of the NBA, told the New York Times on Thursday that he found Irving not guilty of anti-Semitism. You might wrongly conclude that Silver’s verdict is a positive step. It’s not.

The public announcement to the New York Times is justification of the kangaroo court proceedings that occurred. The NBA owes Irving an apology and the money it stole from him during his five-game suspension. The league owes punitive damages for the smearing of Irving’s reputation, which caused Nike to end its relationship with Irving.

Had the NBA ignored Irving’s harmless tweet, America would have continued to ignore the four-year-old documentary. Instead, the Brooklyn Nets and Silver stirred more racial animus.



What was the real purpose?

The purpose was to remind athletes, celebrities, and influencers to avoid taking any stance on religious principle. It’s the same reminder Democrats give black voters during every election cycle: Ignore what the Bible tells you about marriage, the sanctity of life in the womb, the importance of family, and gender. You ain’t black if you don’t support same-sex marriage, abortion, the disruption of the nuclear family, and kids and surgeons picking genders.

We’re being programmed to ignore God and obey secular elites.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-the-nba-and-adam-silver-remind-kyrie-irving-to-ignore-god-and-obey-money,2022-11-11
Whitlock: University of Virginia shooting foreshadows America’s matriarchal future,"You won’t be asked to say the names of the three college students shot and killed on the University of Virginia campus Sunday evening.



Lavel Davis Jr., Devin Chandler, and D’Sean Perry won’t receive the George Floyd treatment. They’re victims, not heroes or martyrs. Their murders don’t advance a political agenda or racial narrative. They’re statistics added to a familiar body count, another trio of black boys murdered senselessly.

According to the CDC, the fifth leading cause of death for black males is homicide. Murder doesn’t crack the top 10 for white or Asian males. It’s ranked number nine for Hispanic men.

Murder is a rite of passage for young black men. We’ve normalized it to the point that it’s celebrated in music. The only time we care is during the rare occurrence when a white man kills one of us while trying to exercise authority over our “black bodies.”

You know all of this. The hypocrisy is pointed out every time a body drops in Chicago or Baltimore or New York City.

So it’s no surprise that Christopher Darnell Jones Jr.’s name disappeared from the headlines as soon as media outlets learned he looked nothing like Derek Chauvin.

Jones killed Davis, Chandler, and Perry. Jones’ name will be as forgettable as his victims' by the end of today. No one wants to talk about Jones, Davis, Chandler, or Perry. No one wants to discuss the implications of this tragedy.

ESPN and Fox Sports spent more time dissecting the ramifications of a Duke volleyball player allegedly being racially harassed at BYU than the death of three Division I football players. South Carolina women’s basketball coach Dawn Staley canceled a game at BYU over safety concerns. I wonder how Staley would feel about playing at Virginia?

Black-on-black violence is so acceptable now that we no longer even debate causes and cures. Or perhaps we refuse to discuss it because the culture disagrees with the cure.

The destruction of the nuclear family is at the root of the violence plaguing black people. We should be talking about that today and virtually every day. The destruction of the family is at the root of nearly every problem plaguing America.

You want to know why the midterm elections did not reflect a repudiation of Joe Biden and the Democrat Party? Because Democrats realize American citizens want a society and system geared to serve irresponsible individuals rather than intact families.

Out of fear of being labeled racist or misogynistic, the media have failed to explain the full ramifications of a matriarchal society. The ramifications are on full display in black communities. A female-led world operates like the south side of Chicago. It manufactures emotional men with little impulse control and emotional women with little sexual discipline. Homicide – by gun or abortion – runs rampant.

Christopher Jones is yet another example of this phenomenon. His father divorced his mom when Jones was five years old. Christopher never engaged with his father again until he was teenager. Eventually, according to a 2018 feature story in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Christopher went to live with his grandmother, Mary Jones. His aunt, Sandra Jones, was his most important influence. According to the same story, his father’s abandonment left him angry, solemn, and quick to fight. A good student, Jones’ temper provoked numerous school suspensions. He walked on the Virginia football team. He lasted a season before giving up.

Families are meant to be led by men. Nearly 75% of black children grow up in single-parent homes. The chaos created by this dysfunction shows up in academic performance, drug usage, incarceration rates, teenage pregnancy rates, and homicide rates. Corporate media promotes bogus research that argues black fathers outside the home spend more time with their kids than other fathers inside the home.

It’s all an obvious lie. The lies are backed by Hollywood fantasy movies and TV shows depicting “black girl magic.”

Female warriors in Dahomey, Africa, slay white colonizers and end the slave trade in “The Woman King.” The new Black Panther movie tells a story of Wakanda’s bald-headed lesbians partnering with the Black Panther’s sister and an American teenage girl – MC Lyte-weight – to fight off a Mexican swimming team. The same people who love to see heavyset, 51-year-old Queen Latifah jump off balconies and beat up men in “The Equalizer” are flocking to see “Wakanda Forever.”

This is the American future China is paying Hollywood to promote. The Chinese Communist Party wants all of America to embrace the matriarchy and Wakanda. The CCP campaigns for a Lori Lightfoot or an emasculated, secular man to run every major city.

China loves the American matriarchy. China smiles every time a fatherless American child turns murderous, every time an American woman runs to Planned Parenthood after a one-night stand, every time American men choose diversity, inclusion, and equity over the meritocracy.



Corporate media won’t talk about Christopher Jones because the puppet masters know where the conversation will eventually lead. The price tag for the disruption of the nuclear family is going to cost all of us the American freedom we’ve taken for granted.

Black people in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Indianapolis have been paying that price for decades. They go through metal detectors before entering nightclubs. They have bars on their home windows. They pray their kids don’t get in a dispute with a fatherless child.

They’re prisoners of the fear created by the destruction of family.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-university-of-virginia-shooting-foreshadows-americas-matriarchal-future,2022-11-15
Whitlock: Stephen A. Smith and LeBron James join ‘The Woman King’ movement in support of Duke volleyball player,"Over the weekend, the racial grievance industrial complex churned out its latest too-good-to-be-immediately-believed victim of systemic and unapologetic white supremacy.



Rachel Richardson, a 19-year-old volleyball player and student at Duke University, is the next woman up in an assembly line that has a nasty habit of producing Jussie Smollett and Bubba Wallace lemons.

According to media racial grievance engineers, Richardson and her teammates endured match-long racial taunts while competing against Brigham Young University in Utah. High-profile racial grievance reviewers such as LeBron James, Stephen A. Smith, and Ben Crump scored Richardson’s tale 100% fresh.

James tweeted words of encouragement. Smith, on his ESPN TV show, conducted a long discussion about Richardson’s plight. Crump, of course, sent a social-media bat signal to Richardson’s family that he would be more than happy to coordinate a financial shakedown of BYU.

BYU administrators quickly groveled for forgiveness. The school’s athletics director issued an apology, met with Richardson privately, and banned an unnamed male fan from attending BYU sporting events.

For many, that’s the end of the story. Racism has been identified and publicly rebuked. For others, it’s just the beginning.

I’m part of the latter group. This story is just too neat. It makes no sense. A YouTuber named Aidan Kearney pieced together some of the holes in this story. He published a long story on his blog questioning the narrative. It’s worth reading.

What I found most interesting in the story is the role of a business called A Long Talk. It’s an anti-racism counseling business that launched in Washington, D.C., two months after the death of Saint George Floyd in Minneapolis. For a fee, A Long Talk team member will visit your school or business and teach people how to be anti-racist.

Just days before Rachel Richardson allegedly endured racial taunts at BYU, A Long Talk team member counseled the Duke volleyball team on “unpacking your truth, finding your voice, and activating your activism.”

According to ALongTalk.com, unpacking your truth means: “I will be able to make connections between our shared American history and our current reality.”

Finding your voice means: “I will be able to use the CPR Protocol to challenge racist comments and beliefs.”

Activating your activism means: “I will understand the reality that creating a counter culture of anti-racism can only happen through collective, consistent and courageous acts of identifying and interrupting racism.”

Let me translate these corporate word salads: A Long Talk teaches black people how to argue and monetize the belief that everything that happens in America today is directly related to the slavery that ended 160 years ago.

A Long Talk teaches you how to hustle. Rachel Richardson is a quick study. In her racial grievance acceptance statement, she thanked the organization for schooling her.

“My team and I were fortunate enough to go through ‘A Long Talk,’ which is an educational series on the roots of racism and how to be an activist in not just dealing with racism but preventing and ending it. This helped to equip us to deal with the situation in a mature manner rather than to react in a retaliatory manner.”

The entire match between BYU and Duke was televised. BYU is nationally ranked. There were nearly 6,000 spectators. Despite supposedly enduring two hours of verbal abuse, Richardson and her teammates never reacted.

“Although the heckling eventually took a mental toll on me,” she wrote, “I refused to allow it to stop me from doing what I love to do and what I came to BYU you to do; which was to play volleyball. I refused to allow those racist bigots to feel any degree of satisfaction from thinking their comments had ‘gotten to me’. So I pushed through and finished the game.”

Aidan Kearney’s story showed pictures of black BYU basketball players at the volleyball match cheering next to the student section, where the alleged racist was supposed to be endlessly shouting racial slurs.

I’ve attended a lot of sporting events in my career as a sports journalist. Someone shouting repeated racial slurs would stand out. The only time it goes ignored is when it’s a group of black young people calling each other the N-word.

If the Duke players truly felt unsafe because of the harassment, I blame the Duke coaches for not immediately addressing the situation. This smells like an exaggeration or a hoax.

Richardson’s godmother, Lesa Pamplin, a Democrat politician in Texas, ignited much of this controversy. From her home in Texas, Pamplin tweeted that her goddaughter had been called “a n—er every time she served” and that a white male threatened her. According to Kearney’s research, Pamplin has a very sordid history of making racist comments on Twitter. Pamplin has now made her Twitter feed private.

None of this story makes sense. Richardson blamed the BYU staff for failing to act swiftly to protect her and her black teammates. What about the Duke coaches?

Richardson met privately with BYU’s athletics director. Richardson’s father publicly complained that the BYU volleyball coach didn’t meet with Richardson. How is the BYU coach responsible for the behavior of a fan?

Why are people who ignored the on-field murder of a Pee Wee football coach in Dallas all finding their voices to speak out on behalf of a volleyball player who was taunted in Utah?

LeBron James, Stephen A. Smith, and Ben Crump ignored the murder of Mike Hickmon in front of his wife and 9-year-old son. Hickmon’s coaching peers stated on the record that former NFL Pro Bowler Aqib Talib sparked the confrontation that led Talib’s brother to allegedly shoot Mike Hickmon.

Alleged racial taunts at a volleyball match are more worthy of discussion than the murder of a father, husband, and former college football player at a Pee Wee football game.

In what world? How?

This is the racial #MeToo movement, and they’re expecting us to “believe all women” because women are allegedly incapable of exaggerating or lying for attention. Rachel Richardson and Lesa Pamplin descended from the heavens to right the wrongs of white men.



They’re descendants of the great Amazon warrior tribe of Dahomey, Africa. They’re modern day Woman Kings, the spiritual sisters of Daenerys Targaryen and Arya Stark, the ""Game of Thrones"" heroines.

Sixty years ago, the racial grievance industrial complex married the feminist grievance industrial complex. Rachel Richarson is their love child.",https://www.theblaze.com/fearless/oped/whitlock-woman-king-duke-volleyball,2022-08-30
"Whitlock: Yes, baby-mama culture explains the Tyre Nichols tragedy","Sorry, I refuse to follow the script. The script for black influencers demanded that the Tyre Nichols tragedy be laid at the feet of so-called white supremacy.



Five black cops beat a 150-pound black man to death, and the script called for more mass shaming of white people and insinuations that policing should be outlawed.

Had I followed the script, I wouldn’t be embroiled in controversy, public enemy number one of black Twitter, Ciara, and all the other blue-check virtue-signalers.

In fact, had I dishonestly blamed systemic, institutionalized racism for Nichols’ death, I would be the toast of Twitter, drowning in retweets, likes, and applause. I would be high as a kite on dopamine and swimming in interview requests.

But that’s not what I did when I appeared on Tucker Carlson’s cable news show Friday night. I didn’t lie. I didn’t concoct some fantasy narrative where five black cops shouted, “This is MAGA country!” before attacking Tyre Nichols.

I blamed the five cops for their criminal behavior and predicted that a predominantly black jury will find them guilty of second-degree murder. I then criticized CNN and other media outlets for hyping the release of the bodycam footage like it was Al Capone’s secret vault and using the video to distract from America’s escalating involvement in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

And, when surprisingly given an opportunity to provide an additional thought, I argued that the five police officers mimicked gang behavior and that the whole sad event is a byproduct of communities overrun with matriarchal values and controlled by single black mothers. I said that the conversation we should be having in reaction to Tyre Nichols centers on the cost of destroying the black family.

That’s my written paraphrase of what I tried to convey in the final 60 seconds of an unscripted, four-minute TV segment. Watch my comments in full here. YouTube has somehow classified my remarks as “inappropriate and offensive.”

It’s impossible to analyze a situation as complex as the Tyre Nichols tragedy in four minutes. What you try to do is spark a deeper conversation by saying something that will cut through all the garbage being spewed on social media and/or promoted on ratings-hungry television networks.

My first comment was said to establish that a black police chief, black police officers, and black citizens would be in charge of providing justice for Tyre Nichols’ family. What happened to Nichols isn’t about white supremacy. And what will happen to his alleged killers won’t have anything to do with white supremacy either.

My second comment was stated to point out that the media is intentionally overemphasizing the importance of the Nichols tragedy. Our politicians are pushing us toward nuclear conflict with Russia. Millions of lives are at stake. I’m not trying to diminish the value of Tyre’s life. But in comparison to nuclear conflict, his life pales in comparison.

Tyre Nichols is a local story, not a national one. It’s being used to provide cover for more important international tragedies, such as Big Pharma’s COVID malfeasance. The TV networks dependent on the advertising dollars of pharmaceutical companies prefer Don Lemon talking about lawless cops rather than lawless and exploitative international corporations.

Finally, my third comment, the one my critics have seized upon, is an attempt to spark a conversation about the real ramifications of America’s growing preference for female authority and alternative family structures. The matriarchy doesn’t work.

We need to talk about that.

Black urban areas are dominated by matriarchal rulership. It’s an utter failure and disaster. These areas all operate similar to Memphis. Crime is astronomical. Young men settle their differences with deadly violence. Academic performance hovers at record lows. Illegitimacy rates skyrocket.

Tyre Nichols was 29. The five police officers who participated in beating him to death range in age from 24 to 32. The behavior we witnessed from the officers resembles what happens when a group of Vice Lords catch a Gangster Disciple on their turf. The Disciple will flee. The Vice Lords will chase. Violence ensues.

My point is what we saw Friday night does not appear to be an outgrowth of bad policing. I’ve yet to see video evidence that depicts what caused the traffic stop and why Nichols had to be snatched from his car. It doesn’t feel like we’ve been shown the complete story. Something about the encounter feels far more personal than anything born of the frustration created by a resistant suspect. The use of pepper spray makes zero sense.

It feels like the outgrowth of a rotten culture, a culture where black men are canonized and celebrated for handling petty beefs and disrespect with lethal violence. That type of emotional violence is commonplace within zip codes dominated by the matriarchy.

Tyre Nichols cried out for his mama for a reason. I’m not saying that to belittle Nichols. I’m saying it’s a reflection of modern black culture, a culture that inappropriately places women at the top of the food chain. Mama is the ultimate authority and savior.

That’s not what God intended. He is our Savior. He authorized man to exercise dominion over the earth. He prescribed family (man, woman, and child) as the foundation of order, obedience, and His will. No racial group in America is more out of line with God’s natural order than black people. Seventy percent of our kids are born to unwed mothers. We don’t view family as a necessity for success. It’s just one of many options. It’s prioritized well below allegiance to racial idolatry, the Democrat political party, and hip-hop culture.

Those allegiances have made us hostile to a biblical worldview, indifferent toward marriage, and convinced there’s little value in male leadership. Scripture is the kryptonite that weakens us rather than the cape we wrap ourselves in to unleash superpowers.

We’re out of order.

Ephesians 5:22-24: “Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.”

So what happens in communities without a culture of marriage and nuclear family?

In his book, Kingdom Politics, the great Christian minister Tony Evans says: “The saga of a nation is the saga of its families written large. Whoever owns the family owns the future. When family structure breaks down, all manner of calamity and chaos enter into society. When family breaks down, crime goes up, poverty goes up, abuse goes up. When the family breaks down, gender confusion and role confusion go up.”

Calamity. Chaos. Confusion.

You don’t need to be a Christian minister to recognize what’s going on in black communities with no consistent family structure. Here's a video of the rapper Jay-Z in 2019 explaining the connection between police brutality and single motherhood. And here’s a link to a story capturing the criticism Jay-Z received for publicly discussing the obvious connection.

The social media matrix and corporate media are rigged to stop people from discussing the negative outcomes from the annihilation of the black family. The matrix blames “white supremacy” for everything bad that happens to black people, even when white people are uninvolved.

The culture we’ve adopted is designed to produce bad outcomes. The matriarchy doesn’t work.

My critics say my criticism is off base because Tyre Nichols has a mother and stepfather and the city’s female police chief, Cerelyn Davis, is married and a mother. My critics ignore the obvious. No one survives a rotten culture unscathed. A nutritionist will lose his way or suffer collateral damage if he’s forced to set up business inside a fast-food restaurant.

The pervasiveness of baby-mama culture harms everyone, including the non-participants forced to operate within it. The chaos and dysfunction negatively impact everyone.

Why did Cerelyn Davis and the Memphis Police Department implement a SCORPION (Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods) unit, the special task force the five officers worked in? They started it in November 2021 to combat the violent behavior of largely unparented young black men terrorizing Memphis. These types of units are common in high-crime, single-parent neighborhoods across America.

Police start gangs to combat gang violence. Young men without fathers in the home are attracted to gangs.

Baby-mama culture celebrates gang involvement. That’s why Snoop Dogg, a proud Crip, is such a beloved cultural figure. That’s why so many black boys and girls from two-parent households and good neighborhoods think their racial identity is tied to behaving in a ghetto or criminal fashion.

Baby-mama culture rules black America in the ‘hood and the ‘burbs. So does matriarchal culture. Black men see black women as our leaders, our saviors.

I don’t. I never will. And I was raised primarily by my divorced mother. My mother was awesome. Spectacular. She took me and my brother to church every Sunday. She took a second job and moved us out of the ghetto and into a working-class neighborhood.

But I am who I am – good and bad – because of my father. I feared and revered him. He taught me the importance of self-sufficiency and never accepting a handout. He had no tolerance for excuses. And luckily I grew up in an era when there was far less pressure to conform to a criminal black stereotype. Rappers weren’t portrayed as heroes and role models. It wasn’t cool to have a baby mama. I was raised to see myself as a leader, a protector, and a provider.

The left frames men like me, regardless of color, as misogynist oppressors. Popular culture promotes the ""Woman King,” especially to black people. They ignore the failing results of matriarchal rulership and send women like Cerelyn Davis to fix problems only strong, bold male leadership can solve.



It’s going to take male leadership in the home, in the church, and in law enforcement to fix the rotting culture that took Tyre Nichols’ life. That same leadership is required throughout American society. Baby-mama, matriarchal culture is being pushed within all facets of American society. Illegitimacy rates are rising among all racial demographics.

Christian male leadership has been demonized to placate the feelings and promote the values of the BLM-LGBTQ Alphabet Mafia.

Delta Air Lines will not immediately take mask rule-breakers off no-fly list,"Delta Air Lines passengers placed on the company's no-fly list for refusing to comply with COVID-19 masking requirements will not immediately have their flight privileges restored after the federal mask mandate on public transit was struck down in court.

President Joe Biden's administration on Monday said that following a Florida judge's ruling that the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention's mask mandate for public transportation was unlawful, the Transportation Security Administration would no longer enforce the masking requirements on airplanes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transit and transportation hubs.

In response, Delta Air Lines told media outlets Wednesday that it will conditionally ""restore flight privileges"" to about 2,000 customers who had been put on a no-fly list after refusing to comply with the mask mandate.

A spokesman for the company told Fox Business that Delta will take customers off the non-compliance no-fly list ""only after each case is reviewed and each customer demonstrates an understanding of their expected behavior when flying with us.""

""Any further disregard for the policies that keep us all safe will result in placement on Delta's permanent no-fly list,"" spokesman Anthony Black added. ""Customers who demonstrated egregious behavior and are already on the permanent no-fly list remain barred from flying with Delta.""

Another major airline, United Airlines, said Tuesday that it will allow the roughly 1,000 people who were banned from flying for refusing to wear a mask to return to flights on a ""case by case basis,"" Reuters reports. United said those people would have their flight privileges restored ""after ensuring their commitment to follow all crewmember instructions on board.""



The CDC's mask mandate was recently extended through May 3 before U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle ruled that the agency had exceeded its statutory authority by imposing the mask rules. Airlines and flight attendants unions have for months expressed opposition to the mandate, but government health officials argue it is still needed as COVID-19 cases are rising thanks to the BA.2 Omicron subvariant.

The CDC on Wednesday asked the Department of Justice to appeal the Florida judge's ruling and DOJ later announced it had filed a notice of appeal.

""It is CDC's continuing assessment that at this time an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health,"" the CDC said in a statement. ""CDC will continue to monitor public health conditions to determine whether such an order remains necessary. CDC believes this is a lawful order, well within CDC’s legal authority to protect public health.""

In the interim, several airlines have made masks optional for passengers.

Veganism wanes in significance as Americans are eating more meat than five years ago,"Despite popular culture pushing meat alternatives and legacy media insisting that Americans are “consuming less red meat,” Americans are eating more beef today than five years ago.

Americans are refusing to ditch red meat in defiance of fad diets and plant-based meat substitutes like the Impossible and Beyond lines of burgers taking over space on restaurant menus.

The New York Post reported that the average American consumed 58.6 pounds of red meat in 2021. In 2017, Americans recorded an all-time low by consuming an average of 54 pounds of red meat that year.

Americans are eating roughly five more pounds of red meat than five years ago.

The New York Post suggested that veganism is a fad that might be on the way out. The Post said that New York City’s exclusive dining scene has even pulled the plug on restaurant projects featuring meatless menus.

The Post said, “The owners of a new skyscraper, 425 Park Avenue, pulled the plug on a planned new restaurant there by EMP chef/owner Daniel Humm because he insisted on an all-vegan menu.”

Humm also “got the boot” from the Claridge’s hotel in London over the same issue.

The Post also suggested that figures in popular culture continually insisting that a meatless diet is the future is an example of them being “hilariously out of touch with the masses.”

“The media-propelled notion that Americans have turned from red meat to fake meat is a case of Park Slope talking to Park Slope — elites hilariously out of touch with the masses,” the Post said.

The New York Times recently suggested that Americans were increasingly moving towards meatless diets by citing a 2019 Gallup poll indicating that one-quarter of its respondents ate less meat. The Times said that respondents to the poll primarily did so “for health reasons.”

The Post, however, insisted that “Big Apple steakhouses are thriving and adding locations” and that the “ban-the-beef movement is part of a ban-anything-that-tastes-good mindset that holds sway in woker-than-thou circles.”

Outside of New York City’s exclusive dining scene, people might simply be eating more beef than faux beef for economic reasons.

Buying beef — at $5.99 a pound — to feed a family of four or five is more affordable than buying Impossible Burger meat substitute packages for nearly $8 — before sales tax — per pound.

Contrary to the popular cultural narrative, for the time being, at least, the working man eats steak while the rich man eats planted-based steak substitute.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657205124,2022-04-24
Exxon Mobil will not allow LGBT or BLM flags to fly outside its office buildings,"Exxon Mobil will no longer allow its offices to fly flags expressing adherence to or membership of “outside organizations” on company flagpoles, the New York Times reported.

The new policy, which prevents employees from hanging LGBT+ pride and BLM flags on the flagpoles on company premises, is angering some of Exxon Mobil’s employees who in the past have flown gay pride flags outside of Exxon Mobil offices.

Exxon Mobil will only be allowing governmental, company, and employee resource group (ERG) flags to fly outside of its facilities. The Times said that ERGs are “employee-led affinity organizations that are generally blessed by employers.”

ERG flags that celebrate certain group identities may still be flown on company premises during months that coincide with those group identities.

Tracey Gunnlaugsson, vice president of human resources at Exxon Mobil, said, “It’s a longstanding practice at our facilities around the world that E.R.G. flags can be flown during signature months. The flags are directly related to our business and company support of our E.R.G.s.”

For instance, the company’s ERG logo for LGBT+ employees features bubbles filled with several colors around the word “PRIDE.” This logo has been flown at Exxon Mobil offices and is used on T-shirts that employees wear during gay pride parades.

J. Chris Martin, a former employee of Exxon Mobil, who previously had led the LGBT+ ERG group said that a different flag that featured the Exxon Mobil on a rainbow background “was flown at many company locations last year without question” and that he had been told that his ability to display this flag had been revoked “without explanation.”

Martin said, “I’m also told that the employee resource groups were consulted only in a perfunctory way regarding this matter, based on momentary discomfort with displaying a symbol of open-mindedness and support for long suppressed voices.”

He added, ""While they may say nobody has lost anything, the symbolism is unmistakable.”

The Human Rights Campaign, a leftist organization that advocates for the LGBT+ agenda under the guise of civil rights activism, lambasted Exxon Mobil’s policy. The group said, “There’s no such thing as ‘neutrality’ when it comes to our rights. Our flag isn’t just a visual representation of our identities. It is also a staple of allyship.”

The Human Rights Campaign has also aggressively come out against Florida’s Parental Rights in Education legislation that was recently signed into law by the state’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis.

In early March, the Human Rights Campaign said that it would refuse to accept donations from the Walt Disney Company until it took “meaningful action” against the then Parental Rights in Education Bill.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657205737,2022-04-24
Biden plans to break with his own precedent as he moves closer to buying oil from Saudi Arabia,"President Biden is expected to extend an olive branch to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after promising to make him a ""pariah"" and working to isolate the Saudi regime for months.

On Monday, the White House confirmed that Biden is planning to visit the oil-rich nation this summer, marking the culmination of an 18-month standoff between Biden and the crown prince. Biden is trying to wind up back in the crown prince's good graces as gas prices soar amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Insider News reported that attempts by U.S. officials to convince the Saudis to increase their oil production have thus far been unsuccessful. Reportedly, the crown prince has repeatedly ignored phone calls from Biden when the president has sought to discuss issues of oil availability.

Displaying how vulnerable and dependent the U.S. is on foreign oil, Biden recently directly asked the crown prince to increase Saudi Arabia's oil output.

The Biden administration has previously made an active attempt at keeping the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at arm's length as the president refused to meet with the crown prince for months. The Biden administration may have even issued a personal offense to the crown prince when it said that Biden should deal directly with the crown prince's father.

The U.S. also has a history of sanctioning Saudi officials. Following the circulation of a declassified intelligence report regarding the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Central Intelligence Agency concluded that Khashoggi's murder was likely ordered by the crown prince.

Biden's visit to Saudi Arabia signals that it is no longer tenable for the Biden administration to adamantly oppose nations that could help alleviate domestic policy woes.

Adam Ereli, a former U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, said, ""Do you hold a relationship hostage to human-rights concerns or you can move forward while not abandoning your moral high ground? In his mind, Biden can move forward.""

Despite receiving heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and domestic activists, Biden and the White House insist that any meeting between Biden and the crown prince would serve the immediate interests of the U.S.

Last Friday, Biden said, ""Look, I'm not going to change my view on human rights. But as president of the United States, my job is to bring peace if I can.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657497848,2022-06-12
A former Obama adviser says Joe Biden's age is a red flag,"David Axelrod, a former adviser to Barack Obama during his presidency, raised a “major” red flag about the possibility of President Joe Biden’s plans to run for re-election in 2024.

The former Obama adviser’s statements appeared in a Saturday New York Times report that examined the growing presence of prominent Democrats who are increasingly worried about Biden’s leadership, the Washington Examiner reported.

Axelrod specifically noted his concerns with Biden’s elevated age noting that Biden would be nearly 90-years-old by the end of his second term if he wins reelection.

Axelrod said, “The presidency is a monstrously taxing job, and the stark reality is the president would be closer to 90 than 80 at the end of a second term, and that would be a major issue.”

However, this past December, Biden said that he would run for reelection if he was in good health.

Biden said, “I’ m a great respecter of fate. Fate has intervened in my life many, many times. If I'm in the health I'm in now, if I'm in good health, then, in fact, I would run again.”

Among Biden’s critics, questions about the president’s health are increasingly common. His critics tend to highlight his wavering mental acuity and inconsistent displays of physical energy by the president.

The concerns coming from Democrats about Biden’s competency as Commander in Chief are beginning to intensify as Democrats grow increasingly anxious about the 2022 midterm elections in which Republicans are widely expected to win back control of at least one chamber of Congress.

Should Biden refuse to seek a second term as president, there is reportedly a long roster of younger politicians who will likely seek the Democratic Party’s nomination for president. It is likely that among these people, one will find former rivals of Biden’s in 2020 who later joined his presidential administration, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

It has also been theorized that Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) might once again seek the Democratic Party’s nomination for the presidency.

Speculation over whether Biden will end up seeking a second term as president will likely continue so long as his poll numbers continue to fall.

A recent Morning Consult/Politico poll found that less than half of Democrats (37%) “strongly approve” of Biden’s performance as president.

According to a Quinnipiac poll from around the same time, only 33% of American adults approve of how Biden is handling his role.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657497948,2022-06-12
"Leftist prosecutors refuse to enforce abortion bans, setting up conflict with pro-life states","Dozens of locally elected prosecutors from all over the country, many from Democratic areas within red states, are refusing to enforce abortion restrictions that have now been legalized following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

After the court overturned its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision Friday — permitting pro-life state legislatures to enact abortion restrictions — 90 elected prosecutors collectively representing more than 91.5 million people from 31 states and territories and the District of Columbia declared their intention to ignore pro-life laws restricting abortion, calling them ""a mockery of justice.""

""We stand together in our firm belief that prosecutors have a responsibility to refrain from using limited criminal legal system resources to criminalize personal medical decisions,"" the prosecutors said in a joint statement organized by Fair and Just Prosecution, a left-leaning legal nonprofit.



""As such, we decline to use our offices' resources to criminalize reproductive heath decisions and commit to exercise our well-settled discretion and refrain from prosecuting those who seek, provide, or support abortions,"" the statement reads.

The actions of these pro-abortion attorneys will escalate a growing conflict between liberal prosecutors who support abortion rights and pro-life state attorneys general and legislatures who, in accordance with the will of voters, enact restrictions on abortion.

Many of the prosecutors who signed on to the joint statement are from 12 states where abortion is now banned or likely to be banned, including Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and others. They argue that prosecutorial discretion permits them to prioritize other crimes instead of pursuing cases against abortion providers.

Pro-life advocates harshly criticized their position. James Bopp Jr., the general counsel of the National Right to Life Committee, said the prosecutors' statement was ""anti-democratic"" in a statement to CNN. His organization has published model legislation for pro-life lawmakers that would enable state attorneys general to take up abortion cases when local prosecutors refuse to do so.

""They were not elected to decide what the law was,"" Bopp told CNN. ""If they don't want to enforce these laws, then we'll have somebody else do it.""

Some state attorneys general already possess the power to override local prosecutors. Alabama and Arizona are two states, among others, where the attorney general holds the power to supersede local prosecutors for any reason, according to Emory Law Journal. They each have elected Republican attorneys general and have laws banning abortion that may take effect after the Supreme Court's decision.

Florida, Michigan, and several other states give broad powers to state officials to override local prosecutors when they deem it to be in the public interest, Politico reported.

Republicans have criticized the abuse of prosecutorial discretion by Democratic prosecutors.

""We have no doubt they are sincere in their pledge to not do their jobs,"" a spokeswoman for Georgia attorney general Chris Carr told the Center Square after local district attorneys said they would not enforce the state's heartbeat bill.

""It's a dereliction of duty for district attorneys and solicitors to pre-emptively pick and choose which laws they will enforce,"" Carr spokeswoman Kara Richardson said. ""It undermines the rule of law and erodes our system of self-governance.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657593491,2022-06-30
YMCA pool bans 80-year-old woman after she demands transgender staff member leave locker room where little girls are undressing,"An 80-year-old Washington state woman has reportedly been banned from her local YMCA after she expressed extreme discomfort when a transgender staff member entered the women's locker room while young girls were undressing.

Julie Jaman, a resident of Port Townsend, Washington, told the Port Townsend Free Press that she was asked to leave the YMCA facilities at Mountain View pool after she demanded that a male wearing a female bathing suit be removed from the women's locker room, where she had been showering and a group of girls were changing out of their swimwear. A YMCA employee reportedly told Jaman she was discriminating against the transgender individual and threatened to call the police on her. In response, Jaman promptly left and filed her own complaint with the police department.

The incident occurred on July 26, when Jaman says she was swimming at Mountain View Pool, as was her weekly habit for 35 years. While showering after her weekly swim, Jaman said she heard a man's voice. Peering past the shower curtain, Jaman says she saw a male wearing a female bathing suit in the women's locker room ""looking at the little girls as they were taking off their suits.""

This person was identified by the Free Press as Clementine Adams, a YMCA staff member who identifies as transgender and female. Jaman said Adams was not wearing any staff identification at the time.

""There were gaps in the curtain and there I was, naked, with soap and water on me, and this guy, right there, very close to me,"" Jaman said. ""I asked, ‘Do you have a penis?’ He said, ‘That’s none of your business.’ That’s when I told him, ‘Get out of here, right now.’”

YMCA aquatic instructor Rowen DeLuna was also present in the locker room. Jaman reportedly approached DeLuna and demanded that Adams be removed from the locker room. Instead, DeLuna told Jaman, ""You're discriminating and you can't use the pool anymore and I'm calling the police,"" according to Jaman.

Stunned, Jaman dried herself, dressed, and prepared to leave. As she was at the door, DeLuna reportedly told her she was not abiding by the YMCA's principles and values. DeLuna and another YMCA employee also reportedly told her she could not leave.

""Bulls**t! I’m going to the police right now. I want help and I need it immediately,” Jaman told the YMCA staff members.

Police records reported by the Free Press confirm that both Jaman and a YMCA employee contacted the department about the incident.

A call report from Officer Marc Titterness said that Jaman ""had an emotional response to a strange male being in the bathroom and helping a young girl take off her bathing suit.""

The report also said an anonymous YMCA employee told police, ""Clementine was in the bathroom with a child in the day camp and Julie asked if she had a penis and started screaming at her to get out.""

In another call obtained by the Free Press, the YMCA employee said that ""Julie"" has ""been asked to leave and is refusing.""

A third call by the YMCA employee alleged that Jaman ""was screaming at employee and calling names and refusing to leave.""

After the incident, Jaman reportedly spoke with Wendy Bart, the CEO of the Olympic Peninsula YMCA, who gave a conflicting account of what happened.

Bart stood by the actions of her staff, including banning Jaman from the pool. Bart also said a staff member told her that Jaman had directed vulgar language at Adams, saying, ""You’re going to stick your f***ing penis in those little girls.""

Jaman vigorously denies she said anything of the kind. ""I am an 80-year-old woman and I do not talk like that,"" she told the Substack ""The Distance.""

No charges have been filed against Jaman, who since the incident has been protesting YMCA locker room and bathroom policies.



In public comments to the Port Townsend City Council on Aug. 1, Jaman said that ""women and children are being put at risk"" by the ""neo-cultural gender rules"" at the YMCA.



In written comments, she said, ""The YMCA policies on gender identity use 'pride' as a euphemism to prevent discrimination against one group of people but at the expense of another group — women who don’t want to use all-gender bathing/dressing areas. Although the Y does check to see if pool patrons have been convicted of sex crimes, there is danger in how the Olympic Y is furthering this policy of nondiscrimination, the potential of undignified/illegal behavior for lack of separate facilities. The policy fails to be inclusive at Mt View pool — women are now at risk of unwanted exposure to the opposite sex — object and you will no longer be allowed to use the pool. Is this how the Y intends to secure the safety and dignity of all its patrons — a YMCA principle?""

She suggested that the YMCA should provide an all-gender changing area in addition to gender-segregated changing facilities to accommodate everyone who wants to use the pool.

""The YMCA should immediately post clear signage indicating the existing dressing/shower rooms will be used by the opposite sex who gender identify differently. Also, all parents who send their children to YMCA programs should be informed that men who identify as women are allowed to accompany little girls into the dressing and bathroom areas,"" she wrote.

However, Council Member Libby Urner Wennstrom responded by calling on the City Council to ""take a stand against hate speech and discrimination against transgender people and to formally support the Y and its staff in their efforts to ensure everyone feels welcome to use our public pool.""

Council Member Aislinn Diamanti then apologized ""to all trans people"" who had to listen to Jaman and other members of the public who used the wrong pronouns in their comments.

""Just to participate in this public meeting they had to sit through that and that made me really sad,"" Diamanti said. Mayor David Faber added that as the chairman of the meeting, he wanted to ""err on the side of open discussion, but that was getting very close to really stepping over the line for me.""

The Olympic Peninsula YMCA also responded in an Aug. 1 statement affirming the organization's commitment to being ""inclusive.""

""We will not tolerate bias, hatred, or discrimination that leads to the oppression of individuals or communities. We will ensure sustained and meaningful progress toward equity and human dignity for all,"" the YMCA said.

The YMCA cited Washington state law that guarantees the right of transgender people to use gender-segregated facilities according to their self-declared gender identity, including restrooms, locker rooms, dressing rooms, and homeless or emergency shelters.

""The Y will uphold and respect this law in regards to YMCA staff, members, and program participants that use Mountain View Pool. At the Y, our goal is to provide an atmosphere free from discrimination, hatred, derogatory or unwelcome comments, intimidation, or actions based on an individual’s sex, age, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression or any other legally protected status,"" the statement read.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/-2657827809,2022-08-08
"10-year-old boy with 'rage issues' showed no remorse after reportedly murdering his mother over an Amazon item, relatives say","An alarming report out of Milwaukee indicates that a 10-year-old boy with ""rage issues"" recently murdered his own mother because she had refused to purchase an Amazon item for him.

At around 7 a.m. on November 21, 44-year-old Quiana Mann was allegedly gunned down in her own basement while she was doing laundry. When police questioned Mann's 10-year-old son, he claimed he had ""accidentally"" shot her while he was twirling her gun. He then claimed he awakened his 26-year-old sister to tell her about the shooting. The sister then contacted police, who initially ruled Mann's death an accident and allowed the boy to remain with family that night because of his age.

However, the following day, relatives contacted police to cast doubt on the boy's story and to report that he had since allegedly attacked a 7-year-old cousin while staying in his aunt's home.

The background information that relatives gave police is nothing short of alarming. His sister indicated that the boy has ""rage issues"" and that he had recently gone into therapy, where he received ""a concerning diagnosis."" The diagnosis, which has not been disclosed, prompted Mann to install cameras throughout her home, but those cameras were unplugged about two weeks before the shooting, the criminal complaint states.

Relatives also claimed that the boy began evincing disturbing tendencies at a very young age. At age 4, they say he swung a puppy by its tail until it yelped in pain and that his mother then got rid of the dog because she feared it would eventually retaliate against the boy for his behavior, which eventually became so terrifying to family members that they refused to babysit him.

Relatives also alleged that six months ago, the boy poured flammable liquid into a balloon and set it on fire in the living room, causing some damage to the carpet and furniture.

In the past, the boy has also reported hearing voices from imaginary people, including two sisters, one older woman, and two men, one of whom the boy described as ""mean.""

His aunt and sister stated that he never cried or expressed remorse about the shooting, even as he said, ""I’m really sorry for what happened. I’m sorry for killing my mom.""

The reports from family convinced police to conduct another interview with the boy. During the second interview, the boy supposedly admitted that, on the morning of the shooting, he was angry with his mother for waking him up a half-hour early and for refusing to buy him an Oculus Virtual Reality headset on Amazon. So, he stole the key to her gun lock, took her semi-automatic Glock 43 from the safe, and then ""went to the basement and took up a shooting stance,"" the complaint claims.

He then allegedly stated that he aimed for the wall to ""scare her."" At that point, Mann looked at him and said, ""Why do you have that? Put that down."" He then supposedly shot her in the face from about three feet away.

He reportedly confirmed to police that he knew ""that guns can kill people."" He also reportedly logged onto his mother's Amazon account the day after the shooting and ordered the Oculus headset he wanted.









The boy has been arrested and charged with first-degree reckless homicide. By Wisconsin law, the boy is currently being treated as an adult, though his attorney, Angela Cunningham, is trying to have his case processed through the juvenile system.

""The adult system is absolutely ill-equipped to address the needs of a 10-year-old child,"" she said.

The boy currently remains in custody at Vel R. Phillips Youth and Family Justice Center in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. His name has not been disclosed because of his age. Children's Court Judge Marshall B. Murray set the boy's bail at $50,000. He has a hearing scheduled next week.

""This is an absolute family tragedy. I don’t think anybody would deny or disagree with that,"" Cunningham stated.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/10-year-old-boy-with-rage-issues-showed-no-remorse-after-reportedly-murdering-his-mother-over-an-amazon-item-relatives-say,2022-12-01
$100K settlement awarded to ex-Virginia Tech soccer player who refused to bend the knee in solidarity with BLM: Report,"The ex-Virginia Tech soccer player who was allegedly penalized over her refusal to kneel during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest will reportedly be awarded a $100,000 settlement.

What's the background?

Kiersten Hening claimed that she had lost her starting position on Virginia Tech's Hokies women's soccer team after she elected not to take part in a so-called pre-game unity ceremony on Sept. 12, 2020, in support of the scandal-plagued BLM movement.

She indicated that her refusal was met by a ""campaign of abuse and retaliation"" launched by Hokies coach Charles ""Chugger"" Adair.

Hening had been a midfielder/defender for the team from 2018 to 2020.

According to the New York Post, she started 19 games in 2018 and played in 18 games in 2019.

The Hokies women's soccer website indicated that in 2019, Hening was ""one of five Hokies to see more than 80 percent of the total team minutes played for the year, logging 1,665 total minutes of action, second most among field players.""

Attorneys for the university counterclaimed that Hening had been benched for poor performance, and Adair suggested she had been replaced by another player who refused to kneel in solidarity with BLM.

Hening, allegedly benched for her conservative stance, subsequently filed a lawsuit against Adair in Roanoke Division of the United States District Court's Western District of Virginia on March 3, 2021.



TheBlaze previously reported that Federal Judge Thomas Cullen ruled on Dec. 2, 2022, that the lawsuit could proceed, denying a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.



""Ultimately, Adair may convince a jury that this coaching decision was based solely on Hening’s poor play during the UVA game, but the court, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hening, cannot reach that conclusion as a matter of law,"" said Cullen.

The suit claimed that Adair singled out Hening ""and verbally attacked her, pointing a finger directly in her face. He denounced Hening for 'bitching and moaning,' for being selfish and individualistic, and for 'doing her own thing.'""

While Hening indicated in her lawsuit that she ""supports social justice and believes ... black lives matter,"" she ""does not support BLM the organization,"" taking issue with its ""tactics and core tenets of its mission statement, including defunding the police.""

The identitarian leftist group Hening refused to side with not only called for police to be defunded but for the disruption of the nuclear family and for ""a queer-affirming network.""

Beyond castigating the player for refusing to signal agreeance with the claims advanced by BLM, the suit claimed that the coach had violated Hening's First Amendment rights.



The settlement

The three-day trial scheduled later this month has been called off.

Roanoke Times reported that Hening will receive $100,000 as part of an agreement to dismiss her federal lawsuit.

Hening's attorney, Cameron Norris, indicated that — per the terms of the settlement which the university and state officials must still approve — this resolution does not require an admission of wrongdoing from either Hening or Adair.

In a poorly-received statement on Twitter, Adair wrote, ""I am pleased the case against me has been closed and I am free to move forward clear of any wrongdoing. ... It's unfortunate, but this ordeal was about a disappointment and a disagreement about playing time.""

Attorney Adam Mortara responded, ""If by clarity you mean you are paying my client six figures in a settlement then you’re right that’s pretty clear. Honestly, Coach, read the Court’s opinion. You are paying. Defendants don’t pay in cases that have no standing.""

Attorneys for 10-year-old accused of shooting his mother in the face ask for $100 bail based on what he has in his piggy bank,"Attorneys for a 10-year-old accused of shooting his mother in the face asked for his bail to be reduced to $100 because that's all he had saved up in his piggy bank.

The boy appeared in court Thursday on the charges related to the Nov. 21 shooting death of his mother in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

""My team and I have spoken with him about his ability to post anything. He told us about piggy banks with savings that he had from gifts, from birthday gifts, and scavenging through cushions in the couch that he's been able to save up,"" said attorney Angela Cunningham.

Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Jane Carroll denied the request and kept the boy's bail at $50,000.

The boy initially told investigators that the shooting was an accident, according to police, but he later admitted that he had purposely shot 44-year-old Quiana Mann because she woke him up early and refused to buy him a virtual reality headset on Amazon.

He was eventually arrested and charged with first-degree reckless homicide. His identity has been protected because of his age. He is being tried as an adult.

The boy's family said he has mental health issues and that his mother had struggled to control him. His aunt and sister said that he has not expressed any remorse about the shooting or even cried about the incident. He also reportedly logged onto his deceased mother's Amazon account and ordered the headset a day after the lethal shooting.

The victim's mother, Lueritha Mann, told the Daily Beast that her grandson had been tormented by heading voices in his head for years and that he was bullied at school.

He is in the custody of the Vel R. Phillips Youth and Family Justice Center in Wauwatosa.

"11 adults in Scotland formed demonic 'paedo ring' which routinely raped and assaulted 3 children, performed witchcraft, killed animals: Report","Eleven adults in Scotland have been arrested and charged with various horrific crimes related to a so-called ""paedo ring"" that they allegedly ran for 10 years.

Iain Owens, 43, Elaine Lannery, 38, Lesley Williams, 40, Paul Brannan, 40, Marianne Gallagher, 37, Scott Forbes, 49, Barry Watson, 46, Mark Carr, 49, Richard Gachagan, 44, Leona Laing, 50, and John Clark, 46, all of the greater-Glasgow area, were brought before the High Court in Glasgow to face charges related to crimes they allegedly committed against three children, two girls and one boy, between January 2010 and March 2020.

The indictment claims that, at various times, six of the defendants shoved the younger female ""into a microwave oven, an oven, a fridge, a freezer and cupboards including a cupboard containing an electricity meter.” They also supposedly hanged the girl on a hook by her sweater.

All eleven have been accused of repeatedly raping all three children. During some of the sexual assaults, other defendants would supposedly ""clap, cheer and verbally encourage"" as they filmed the rapes. At least two of the adults also allegedly engaged in sexual acts in front of the children.

Aside from the sexual assault charges, the defendants have also been accused of forcing the children to participate in satanic ""seances"" and compelling them to ""use a Ouija board ... to call on spirits and demons."" The children were also supposedly made to watch ""classes involving witchcraft, point wands and utter spells thus causing them to believe that they could levitate.""

The accused also occasionally wore devilish costumes and blew smoke from various drugs into the children's faces.

Other charges leveled at the defendants involve the abuse and torture of animals. Some of the adults have been accused of forcing the children to kill dogs and forcing the boy to stab a bird to death. One of the girls was also supposedly made ""to act like a dog"" and ""eat cat and dog food"" until she vomited.

There are yet still more charges issued against the defendants, but these charges are apparently so heinous that writers at the Scottish Sun refused to print them.

The identities of the children have not been released, and it is not known whether any of the children are related to any of the accused. There were 16 or 17 total adults named in the indictment, but anywhere from three to five of them have already died.

14-year-old boy mugged at gunpoint in broad daylight while 4 people recorded cellphone video and others stood by,"A 14-year-old boy was mugged at gunpoint in broad daylight while four others recorded video of the altercation on their cellphones and bystanders did nothing.

The harrowing incident unfolded on Saturday at around 7:50 p.m. at the Brooklyn Bridge Park Pier 2 in New York City, New York.

Video published by the New York Police Department showed a group surrounding the boy who was pushed against a large boulder at the sprawling waterfront park.

Bystanders apparently did nothing while the altercation continued. The boy was punched and a gun was put to his head.

Police said the group stole a debit card, a cellphone, a hat, identification cards, and even the teen's sneakers. The victim refused medical attention and officials said that he knew some in the group of robbers.

One resident told WNBC-TV that maybe young people wouldn't mug each other at gunpoint if they had fun activities to do.

""They gotta give, uh, the kids something better to do. They need a lot of activities!"" said the unidentified man.

WNBC said that there were at least two other muggings in the same area. One mugging victim told them that the group of robbers jumped out of the bushes and took his phone and $700.

Violent crime has been skyrocketing in New York City since the pandemic. In one recent poll, more than three-quarters of New York City residents reported that they were fearful of becoming a victim of violent crime. A startling 70% of respondents also said that they felt less safe in NYC now than before the pandemic.

"19 max-security prisoners stage hunger strike to protest alleged abuses, haven't eaten since December 1","Dozens of inmates in a Nevada state prison have engaged in one of the lone forms of peaceful protest available to those behind bars: a hunger strike.

According to reports, 19 inmates at the Ely State Prison, a maximum-security facility located about four hours north of Las Vegas, have refused all food since December 1, claiming that they have suffered under disciplinary policies that have since become abusive. The inmates have been subjected to ""de facto solitary confinement,"" excessive lockdowns, and concurrent disciplinary sanctions that impose unreasonable burdens, according to a so-called prisoners' rights group known as Return Strong.

On its website, Return Strong claims to be ""committed to deconstructing the prison industrial complex by unapologetically fighting to center folx of color and people experiencing poverty in all phases of the criminal legal and correctional systems.""

Despite Return Strong's accusation of systemic abuse, the Nevada Department of Corrections stated that most of the Ely inmates involved in the strike object to the ""food portions being served"" by a new food vendor, Aramark Correctional Services, and that only some object to ""conditions of confinement, property issues and disciplinary sanctions.""

By all accounts, 39 Ely inmates participated in the hunger strike when it first began on December 1. As of Friday, that number has dwindled to 24, the AP reports, though exact participation is difficult to gauge since some inmates have consumed food on certain days but then resumed their strike on other days, Fox News reports. NDOC confirmed that it has continued to provide food to all striking inmates on a daily basis and that it ""is working to resolve this matter.""

Though the exact number of strike adherents is unknown and their individual grievances vary, NDOC officials claim they have taken steps to address the issues overall. ""The NDOC is auditing portion sizes at all facilities throughout the state and reviewing the contract with the current food vendor,"" a statement from NDOC said. ""Additional complaints are also under review.""

So far, the complaint regarding concurrent disciplinary sanctions has already been addressed. William Gittere, the acting director of the Nevada prison system, confirmed that, as of Friday, inmates can be subjected to only one sanction at a time, a change he described as ""significant."" Examples of such sanctions include the loss of phone or commissary privileges.

Aramark Correctional Services ran afoul of the Michigan Department of Corrections in 2014, when some Michigan inmates conducted a hunger strike to protest various issues with the food, including unapproved meal substitutions and alleged worker misconduct. One report even claimed that a kitchen employee had ordered food contaminated by rodents be served to the prisoners. MDOC ultimately terminated its contract with Aramark more than a year early. Aramark did not return AP's request for comment regarding the strike in Nevada.

Gittere became the acting director of the Nevada prison system when the previous NDOC director, Charles Daniels, stepped down after a murderer managed to escape from a facility just outside Las Vegas back in September. The murderer was ultimately re-apprehended and returned to prison.

50 Cent lashes out over Dave Chappelle attacker's lax punishment: 'Is the LGBTQ gonna kill Dave right in front of us?',"Rapper 50 Cent blasted the Los Angeles district attorney's office after it reportedly declined to file any felony charges against the male suspect who attacked comedian Dave Chappelle during a recent comedy set.

It is unclear at the time of this reporting whether the suspect is a member of the LGBTQ community.

What are the details?

On Thursday night, the rapper — whose real name is Curtis Jackson — took to Instagram, where he wrote, “Oh s***, is the LGBTQ gonna kill dave right in front of us? He had a weapon a gun, knife how he or she don’t get charged? The world is over, F*** this.""

Chappelle's attacker, identified as 23-year-old Isaiah Lee, faces four misdemeanor charges in connection with the incident.

Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer announced the charges on Thursday.

""What should have been an evening of laughter at The Hollywood Bowl this past Tuesday night was suddenly interrupted when suspect Isaiah Lee allegedly charged onto the stage attacking comedian Dave Chappelle,"" he said.



""The suspect was allegedly carrying a weapon,"" Feuer continued. ""This alleged attack has got to have consequences.""

Lee is facing battery, possession of a weapon with intent to assault, unauthorized access to the stage area during a performance, and commission of an act that delays the event or interferes with a performer.

Feuer added that his office intends to ""vigorously prosecute"" its case against Lee.

No motives in the attack have been announced at this time.

What else is there to know about this?

Aaron Lee, the suspect's brother, told Rolling Stone that he can't understand why his younger brother would attack Chappelle.

""He doesn't have any type of animosity toward [Chappelle] that I know about,"" he said, but added that his brother does have a variety of transgender friends, which may have contributed to his motive.

“Yeah, it could have definitely been a factor, but I really don’t know,” Aaron added.

In a statement on the attack, Carla Sims, who is Chappelle's publicist, told the Hollywood Reporter that the comedian ""refuses to allow ... [the] incident to overshadow the magic of this historic moment.""

"63-year-old man dies after suspect carjacks him, drags him behind his own vehicle for over 2 miles","Larry Walker, a 63-year-old man from La Habra, California, died violently when he was carjacked and dragged behind his own vehicle for over two miles, police said.

The circumstances leading to Walker's death began with an investigation into a murder that occurred about an hour north in Reseda back in late July. Police suspected that Joshua Reneau, 31, may have been involved in that murder, and the LAPD fugitive task force began surveilling him.

Last Thursday, police said they spotted Reneau leaving a residence on the 5900 block of 7th Avenue in South Los Angeles. He and at least one other man reportedly entered a Toyota Prius. Reneau entered a rear passenger seat, while Jamal Sutherland, 34, reportedly got into the driver's seat. The identity of a possible third male in the car is unknown.

Police began tailing the Prius in a marked vehicle. Once Reneau and Sutherland discovered the marked cop car, they supposedly attempted to evade it, prompting a police chase.

At some point during the chase, the Prius crashed into another vehicle. Reneau then reportedly jumped out of the back seat of the Prius and carjacked a nearby SUV — an SUV that belonged to 63-year-old Walker.

Reneau then allegedly carjacked Walker and attempted to commandeer his vehicle. Unfortunately, Walker became entangled in his seat belt and could not extract himself from the car. Rather than concern himself with Walker's welfare, Reneau supposedly began driving with Walker stuck underneath the vehicle.

Police stated that the chase continued for another two or three miles, and Walker remained helplessly stuck underneath the SUV. Eventually, the SUV Reneau was driving struck two police cars near Prairie and Florence Avenues in Inglewood and then flipped over, rendering the vehicle inoperable.

Though Reneau appeared to be surrounded by law enforcement, he allegedly continued to resist arrest. Police said he refused to leave the incapacitated SUV for over two hours, despite suffering some injuries in the crash. He eventually left the vehicle, was placed under arrest, and taken to a county jail hospital to treat his injuries.

Walker was pronounced dead at the crash site. Investigators said he died of multiple blunt force trauma injuries.

Reneau is currently booked without bail on unknown felony charges. He is expected to face additional charges in Walker's death. According to jail records, Reneau was also arrested for unspecified felonies in February 2021 and January 2022. He is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday.

Sutherland, the alleged Prius driver, has also been charged with felony evasion.

Police still believe that Reneau, Derek Hall, 28, of West Covina, and Miracole Brown, 20, of South L.A. were involved in the July homicide.

69-year-old Philadelphia man turns the tables on armed carjacker,"On August 24 at 11:30 a.m. in the East Mount Airy neighborhood of Philadelphia, a 69-year-old man was unloading his groceries in his driveway. A 24-year-old man came up to him with his gun drawn and yelled, ""This is a robbery."" The 69-year-old was certain that wouldn't be the case.

Fox 29 reported that the resident fought back, wrestling the would-be carjacker for control of his firearm. Despite the suspect biting the resident's hand, the 69-year-old prevailed, allegedly firing the gun and grazing the suspect's abdomen. The suspect fled the scene.

Hearing the struggle, the resident's neighbors called the police, who found the would-be carjacker on the 1000 block of Gorgas Lane.

The would-be carjacker was transported to Albert Einstein Medical Center, where he is presently in stable condition. The resident sustained only a minor injury — a bite to the hand for which he didn't bother seeking medical treatment.



Philadelphia police Capt. John Walker lauded the resident's courage, but suggested it's not always worth defending oneself. Nevertheless, one of the resident's neighbors told WPVI: ""I am going to go get a permit to carry a gun because of this.""

Police suggested the resident was not targeted, but rather the victim of a failed opportunistic crime. The 24-year-old suspect was allegedly just ""cruising"" the neighborhood when he saw the resident, alone.

The suspect will be charged with robbery, carjacking, and other crimes. The 69-year-old will not be charged.

Philadelphia scores an eight on Neighborhood Scout's crime index, with 100 being the safest. The odds of becoming a victim of a property crime in the city are 1 in 34. Including attempts, there have been 891 car-jackings in Philadelphia so far this year, already surpassing the 2021 total of 854, which itself more than doubled the previous year's figure. Based on a July estimate, by year's end, the city will have seen over 1,350 car-jackings.

Concerning the spate of car-jackings, George Soros-backed Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said earlier this year that ""people should be concerned.""

"6th graders 'tried out some pole dancing' during field trip stop, says school board trustee","In November, sixth-grade students in a Michigan school district ""tried out some pole dancing"" when they were brought to a restaurant with an attached nightclub that included stripper poles during a field trip stop, according to a school board trustee.



Libs of TikTok shared the story on Twitter Tuesday, stating, ""A middle school teacher in @rochcommschools allegedly took students to a strip club where they tried out pole dancing during a field trip. The story is being publicized now by a board trustee after the district has reportedly refused to address it.""

Andrew Weaver, a school board trustee for Rochester Community Schools, stated that a middle school teacher at Hart Middle School took students on a field trip to the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Weaver alleged that the students were brought to Niki's Pizza for lunch and, due to lack of space, the children were moved into the restaurant's attached lounge, which includes stripper poles.

While the students were at Niki's Lounge, an alcohol-stocked nightclub, they ""tried out some pole dancing"" and took photos, according to Weaver. He stated that the incident was an example of ""poor judgment.""

""The students were also taken to lunch at Niki's Pizza which is attached to Niki's Lounge,"" Weaver posted on Facebook. ""The students were moved from Niki's Pizza due to a lack of available space to the Lounge where they tried out some pole dancing.""

Agatha Kefallinos, the owner of Niki's Pizza and Niki's Lounge, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that it was ""absolutely made known to"" school officials during several phone calls regarding the lunch reservations that, to accommodate the large group of students, they would have to be placed in the nightclub.

""We can only accommodate a certain number in the restaurant,"" Kefallinos explained. ""Typically when we have a group of over 100 people, we give them the option of going to our second floor, which is operated as a club on Saturday nights but is closed during the day.""

""We've been doing this for 20 years. We've had dozens of school groups, and there was never an issue. At the time of taking a reservation for a group of that size, we always make it very clear we can accommodate them on the second floor, but as we said, the space is a club, and so it's at their discretion at that point to come in or chose not to,"" Kefallinos added.

According to Kefallinos, the poles in the lounge are not stripper poles ""and have never been used for that purpose"" but instead are ""part of the decorations.""

Weaver told Fox News Digital that the school district has not adequately addressed parents' concerns about the incident.

""How did we get here? How do we not just communicate clearly to parents what happened? A mistake was made and address it and make sure that we have the policies in place to prevent it from happening again in the future,"" Weaver said. ""It's not a witch hunt. No one's going after anyone. It's really just about how do we make sure that we communicate properly.""

The district has acknowledged that the students were brought to Niki's for lunch.

""Parents and caregivers are always encouraged throughout the school year to contact their school administrator with questions or concerns,"" said a district spokesperson. ""Proposed field trips are evaluated by a curriculum team and require a parental/guardian permission slip. RCS may ask parents, caregivers, or other responsible adults to serve as field trip chaperones when appropriate. Adult chaperons are required to complete background checks. The safety and security of our students, staff and school community is always our priority.""

District Superintendent Robert Shaner said he would consider bringing legal action against Weaver.

According to Weaver, in a December 21 letter to the district's president and vice president, Shaner wrote, ""It is imperative that the Board take immediate action to ensure Mr. Weaver's compliance with protocol. Otherwise, I will be compelled to seek legal redress in another venue.""

9 arrested after transgender activists clash with police at 'Let Women Speak' event in NYC,"Far-left protesters clashed with police at a ""Let Women Speak"" event in New York City on Monday, leading to nine arrests, Fox News Digital reported. Transgender activists flocked to the pro-women event in Manhattan to demonstrate against a movement they claim fuels hatred toward the trans community.



Monday's rally in New York was the last of 10 stops in the four-week ""Let Women Speak"" U.S. tour hosted by Kellie-Jay Keen, a British women's rights advocate. The event gathered women across the nation to give them a chance to speak about the danger and impact of leftist gender ideology.

In a video, Keen stated that she could not attend the event because the New York Police Department refused to escort her to the rally.

""My event's going on without me,"" she said. ""I think this is indicative of the United States in 2022 and how they feel about women speaking.""

Leftist protesters yelled over the speakers and called the women ""TERFs,"" which stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminists.

At one point, demonstrators chanted, ""TERFS go home!""

In footage from the event, the NYPD can be heard instructing the transgender activists to disperse to prevent blocking traffic. However, most activists appeared to ignore the order, and some even confronted police.

One leftist activist is seen in the footage ringing a bell next to the ear of a uniformed police officer.

Another protester is captured on video repeatedly yelling at pro-women attendees, ""Imma beat your ass.""

""These hands do not discriminate. I will f*** you up,"" the leftist protester continued.

Atlas Lee-Reid, a demonstrator who showed up to protest against the rally, told CBS News, ""We were counterprotesting a group of TERFs who are trying to persuade people that trans people are sexual abusers and that trans kids are being forcibly mutilated.""

The outlet reported that flyers were posted around the area to encourage people to show up in protest of the ""Let Women Speak"" rally with noisemakers.

Jeanna Hoch, a pro-women activist and attendee at Monday's Manhattan event, appeared on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" the following day and stated, ""It was very high-energy. It was not good. I don't think I expected it to be that bad. Obviously, we were threatened. Women were assaulted. Police were assaulted. I can't believe actually how much abuse they put up with.""

""It's upsetting to see the spin in the newspaper that it was either an equal fight or that the police were being brutal against people, because that was not the case at all,"" Hoch added.

According to authorities, nine individuals were arrested on Monday and would most likely be given summonses and released, Fox News Digital reported.

At several stops in the ""Let Women Speak"" U.S. tour, including last week in Washington, D.C., protesters used megaphones and sirens to drown out the event's speakers.

Last month, in Tacoma, Washington, the scheduled pro-women event was shut down by transgender activists who allegedly harassed, assaulted, and injured attendees.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/9-arrested-after-transgender-activists-clash-with-police-at-let-women-speak-event-in-nyc,2022-11-16
"'A First Amendment victory': Christian baker can refuse to make a cake for lesbian wedding, California court says","A Christian baker can refuse to make a cake for an event, such as a same-sex wedding, that conflicts with her religious beliefs, a California judge has determined.

In 2017, Cathy Miller — the owner of Tastries Bakery and Boutique in Bakersfield, California — was approached to bake a customized cake for an upcoming lesbian wedding. Because the event conflicted with Miller's Christian beliefs regarding the nature of marriage, she refused to lend her artistry to a customized cake. However, she did offer the couple, Eileen and Mireya Rodriguez-del Rio, two alternatives: She could bake them a generic, pre-made cake that would not require her personal artistry, or she could recommend to them other bakeries which could accommodate their request.

Miller's attorneys at the Thomas More Society claim that after this ""polite refusal,"" Miller was then ""targeted by gay activists"" and sued for discrimination by the state Department of Fair Housing and Employment.

In multiple lawsuits, the DFHE argued that, by denying the lesbian couple a customized cake, Tastries and Cathy’s Creations Inc. had violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act, a California law passed in 1959 and since expanded to protect consumers against discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or religion.

Paul Jonna, TMS special counsel and partner at LiMandri & Jonna LLP, noted that there is ""a certain irony ... that a law intended to protect individuals from religious discrimination was used to discriminate against Cathy for her religious beliefs.""

And, based on excerpts of cross-examination from the civil trial held in July, it appears that the state's attorneys did indeed ""discriminate against Cathy,"" probing her about the depth and sincerity of her Christian beliefs. According to a statement from TMS, attorney for the state Gregory Mann even asked Miller whether she adhered to Old Testament dietary laws ""in terms of not eating pigs, not eating shellfish, et cetera"" in an effort to cast doubt on Miller's testimony that she does her ""best"" to follow ""everything that the Bible says.""

Despite the state's best legal efforts, Judge Eric Bradshaw of the Superior Court of California in Kern County ruled in favor of Miller. The DFHE ""is barred by defendants' rights to Free Speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution from enforcing the Unruh Civil Rights Act to compel or prohibit defendants' speech,"" Bradshaw's ruling said in part.

TMS, which provided legal counsel to Miller pro bono, has celebrated the ruling as ""a First Amendment victory.""

""The freedom to practice one’s religion is enshrined in the First Amendment, and the United States Supreme Court has long upheld the freedom of artistic expression,"" said Charles LiMandri, special counsel at TMS and partner at LiMandri & Jonna LLP.

Miller has always insisted that she never meant to discriminate against anyone. She wanted only to run her business in accordance with the precepts of her religion. Back in 2017, she told news reporters, ""Here at Tastries, we love everyone. My husband and I are Christians, and we know that God created everyone, and He created everyone equal, so it's not that we don't like people of certain groups. There is just certain things that violate my conscience.""

The Associated Press reported that Eileen and Mireya Rodriguez-del Rio expect the decision to be appealed.

A little hero: Toddler finds elderly woman with Alzheimer's who'd been missing for 4 days,"An elderly woman in early stages of Alzheimer's is home and resting with her family now thanks to the careful eye of a local toddler.

On August 9, the Coweta County Sheriff's Office issued a silver alert for Nina Lipscomb, an 82-year-old resident of Senoia, Georgia, about an hour south of Atlanta. Lipscomb had last been seen around 2 a.m. earlier that morning.

Though police and concerned neighbors conducted a thorough search of the local area, no one could find Lipscomb.

That is, until 1-year-old Ethan Moore went chasing bubbles in his backyard.

According to a Facebook post from his mom, Brittany Moore, little Ethan and his dogs were playing in the backyard like usual last Friday when the wind picked up and carried their bubbles toward a wooded area behind their fence.

""This time, Ethan didn't just chase the bubbles,"" Moore wrote, ""but he stopped and looked into the woods. He bent down a little holding onto the fence and said 'feet.'""

When Brittany asked Ethan to repeat what he'd said, he once again uttered the word ""feet"" and gestured toward the woods.

""I proceeded to bend down to get on his level to see what he was pointing at,"" the post continues, ""and I saw feet.""

Like many others in the community, Brittany Moore and her family had heard about Lipscomb's disappearance and had prayed that authorities would find her soon. When Moore saw the pair of feet that Ethan had spotted in the woods, she knew that Ms. Nina had finally been found.

Moore said she then panicked with worry about Lipscomb's condition.

""I sobbed and all I could think was, she is right here, please be alive,"" Moore recalled in the post.

It turns out, Moore needn't have worried. Shortly after paramedics and police arrived, someone announced, ""She is alive and talking!""

Medical teams then transported Lipscomb to the hospital where she remained under observation until Monday.

The sheriff's office has since updated its BOLO post about Ms. Nina to confirm she had been located.

According to CBS46 Atlanta, the Moores refused the reward money offered by the Lipscomb family. Ms. Nina was discovered less than a quarter of a mile from where she disappeared.

""Thank you God for protecting her,"" Moore wrote on Facebook. ""Thank you God for the breeze to move the bubbles. Thank you God for being with us in that moment. Thank you for giving this family and community peace. Thank you for all of the first responders, 911 agent, my husband, parents, and inlaws.""

"A man followed two young girls home from their school bus stops and broke into one of their homes, Oklahoma police said","Oklahoma police said a man followed two young girls home from their school bus stops and proceeded to later broke into one home to steal a gun.

The first alarming incident happened on Friday at two homes in Tulsa according to a Facebook post by the Tulsa Police Department.

They said a man followed a girl home and then followed another girl and pulled on their home's storm door, rang on the doorbell. He asked to use the bathroom and left when the girl refused him.

Both of the girls were aged about ten years old.

A few days later on Monday, one of the girls who had been followed saw the suspect looking into her home through the windows of the home. She ran for help and the suspect allegedly broke in to the home and stole a gun.

A neighbor told KJRH-TV what happened next.

“At around 3:00 o’clock yesterday I was home, and my neighbor, she’s 11 years old, was knocking on the door and she’s like … hey I think someone’s in my backyard,” said Wyatt Smith.

Smith said he saw a man climbing over the fence to flee from his neighbor's home.

“He had a facemask on and a hood, and a green bandana around his head. You know a really big knife. I mean that was the craziest part, I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, he’s right there,” Smith added.

Police obtained video of the suspect from a Ring doorbell security device and asked the public for help in identifying the man.

Mingo Valley Patrol Officers were able to locate and arrest William Parnell on Wednesday as a suspect in the incidents.

Both of the girls were unharmed.

Police said they were working with federal authorities to charge Parnell with two counts of burglary and another count of assaulting a medical professional, which they did not explain.

Dobbs and Kennedy: Two more victories in a long line of recent religious freedom decisions from SCOTUS,"The Supreme Court of the United States has certainly brought much relief to religious rights advocates, faith-based institutions, believers, and others of good will this summer — but this turn in favor of religious freedom is anything but new.

The Dobbs decision, which effectively overturned Roe v. Wade, and the Kennedy decision, which ruled in favor of a public school coach's right to pray after football games, are currently at the forefront of our minds, but they are hardly anomalies. Since at least 2018, the Supreme Court has steadily upheld religious freedoms and protected this aspect of the First Amendment against further government overreach.

Let's review some of the hallmark cases that have affirmed religious rights.

In the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision of 2018, the dourt ruled 7-2 that the state of Colorado violated the rights of Jack Phillips, the Masterpiece Cakeshop owner who refused to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding. Though TheBlaze's Mark Levin argued at the time that the decision meant ""nothing, from a constitutional perspective"" and Phillips continues to be harassed by LGBTQ+-related lawsuits, a narrow decision in favor of religious rights is a decision in favor of religious rights nonetheless.

In another 7-2 decision in 2019 — this time, with Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh both on the bench — the Court determined that a religious war memorial on public land did not constitute an endorsement of religion by the state of Maryland, and the Peace Cross remains on display in Bladensburg, Maryland, to this day.

The Supreme Court docket of 2020 had a bevy of religious rights rulings, most of which came down on the side of religious freedom. The court ruled that Catholic schools have the right not to hire staff members whose lifestyles do not accord with Catholic teaching, that religious schools may not be excluded from state-sponsored tuition aid programs, and that faith-based employers such as the Little Sisters of the Poor could be exempted from aspects of the federal Affordable Care Act that violate their religious convictions.

However, one key decision in 2020 did not go the way that many conservative believers had hoped. In a 6-3 majority opinion, written by Gorsuch, the court determined that ""gender identity"" was implicitly protected by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and that employers may not discriminate against ""transgender"" employees or applicants.

Still, the SCOTUS issued other important religious rights decisions in 2021. With Trump's third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, now on the bench as well, the court ruled unanimously that Catholic social services could exclude same-sex couples from consideration as foster parents.

Now in 2022, the court has officially ruled in favor of the rights of public schools employees to pray in public and returned the abortion decision to the states, where people of all religious stripes or no religion at all may weigh the moral issue on its merits.

Though Biden appointee Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed earlier this year to replace the retiring Stephen Breyer and is expected to rule routinely with fellow liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, conservative justices still outnumber their liberal counterparts 6-3. This court balance in favor of conservative justices means we may see further fortification of religious liberties in years to come.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-ray-of-hope-scotus-has-been-favoring-religious-rights-for-years-now,2022-06-27
'A realistic simulator where Mark Kelly destroys the things you love': Blake Masters' campaign releases space-themed game criticizing Dem opponent's 'failures',"With only one week until Election Day, Arizona Republican senatorial candidate Blake Masters released a ""realist simulator"" game spotlighting the alleged failures of Democrat opponent Mark Kelly's political career, the Daily Caller News Foundation reported.



The space-themed game pokes fun at Kelly's former NASA career by placing the player inside a spaceship with an animated depiction of the senator.

The game is called ""Mr. Spaceman: A realistic simulator where Mark Kelly destroys the things you love."" The game's objective is to demolish oncoming objects by clicking on them, but each object represents something Arizonans value that Kelly's policies have allegedly destroyed.

The approaching objects that players must destroy are the ""nuclear family,"" ""your savings,"" ""public order,"" ""your 401K,"" ""God-given rights,"" ""border security,"" ""small business,"" ""parental rights,"" and ""rule of law.""

Each time an object is successfully annihilated, the game's depiction of Kelly comments on the player's progress.

For example, after the player destroys the oncoming ""public order"" graphic, Kelly's character mentions an anti-police comment made by one of his campaign staffers.

The comment refers to a post by Kelly's campaign deputy press secretary, T.J. L'Heureux. The staffer replied to a Twitter post by the Chicago Police Department by calling them ""worthless f***ing pigs.""

In Masters' game, when a player destroys the ""God-given rights"" object, Kelly's character replies, ""I lied on my ATF form (look it up).""

That remark refers to when Kelly attempted to purchase a rifle in 2013 following the assassination attempt on his wife, former Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. Kelly intended to demonstrate to the public that it is too easy to legally obtain a firearm.

However, the owner of the gun store where Kelly attempted to make the purchase refused to proceed with the sale and provided a refund. Some have alleged that, since Kelly was denied, he must have lied on Federal Form 4473, legally required to purchase a firearm.

The gun store owner released a statement on Facebook noting that Kelly was denied before filling out the form because his ""intent"" for purchasing the rifle was ""for reasons other than for his personal use.""

Masters' game criticizing Kelly's political policies always ends with the player losing. A message on the screen reads, ""Game Over: You ran out of gas and have no money to refuel your tank"" – a reference to high gas prices and inflation.

Players are then directed to a website titled ""Mission Failure,"" where Masters' campaign lists criticism of Kelly's political career.

Arizona's Libertarian candidate, Marc Victor, dropped out of the race on Tuesday and endorsed Masters.

RealClearPolitics reported that the race between Blake Masters and Mark Kelly is currently a ""toss up.""

'Clearly two classes of players': Aaron Rodgers says NFL discriminated against unvaccinated. Watch eyebrow-raising highlights from 3-hour Joe Rogan interview.,"Aaron Rodgers delivered attention-grabbing details of the saga he endured with the NFL after he refused to get the COVID vaccine during a 3-hour interview with Joe Rogan. Rodgers said that the NFL discriminated against unvaccinated players in the latest episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience.""

Rodgers said that he is allergic to polyethylene glycol — also known as PEG — which is an ingredient in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people allergic to PEG not take the mRNA vaccines. Rodgers passed on the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine because of blood clot issues.

Rodgers stressed that unvaccinated players like himself were tested for COVID every day – versus every two weeks for vaccinated players.



Rodgers said he would wear a yellow wristband that signaled that he was unvaccinated. He also had to wear a face mask at all times – whereas vaccinated players did not.

""There was a lot of public shaming that was attempted to coerce people to get vaccinated because not only are you wearing a yellow wristband, you're the only ones wearing masks,"" Rodgers noted.

""There was clearly two classes of players at the facility – there was the unvaccinated and the vaccinated who had full privileges,"" he told Rogan. ""They tested once every two weeks. They had full privileges. On the road, they could go out to dinner on the road, they could go to a concert in town, they could go to a comedy show that was it was in town, they could be at any place they wanted to.""

""I think now we all realize these were crazy policies,"" he said.

Rodgers pointed out how players on the bubble who were unvaccinated had an ""almost 0% opportunity to get a workout."" He said that unvaccinated NFL players had a ""very low percentage not just of keeping a job but even getting a job.""

""Look how righteous our league is, we have 95% compliance with the vaccine,"" Rodgers mocked the NFL. “If you don’t, we’re going to send a stooge to your team to show you graphs of your vaccination percentage of your team compared to the rest of the league, which actually happened.""



On the third day of training camp, Rodgers asked the ""stooge"" about liability from vaccine injuries, which was answered, ""Oh, I’m not a lawyer.""

""You’re in here talking about these different things and you don’t talk about anybody’s personal health issues,"" he told the official. ""There’s zero exemptions, you took out religious exemptions, you took out PEG exemptions, you took out anybody’s ability to have an opinion of: 'I don’t want to do this.'""

Buffalo Bills wide receiver Cole Beasley confirmed Rodgers' ""stooge"" story.

Beasley – an outspoken critic of COVID vaccines and NFL pandemic protocols– said, ""Same 'stooge' came to the Bills along w/ Bruce Smith telling us we didn’t care about winning or our teammates if we didn’t get the vaccine. I didn’t get Covid until the NFL stopped testing all the vaxxed players because they all were getting it.""

Rodgers had a game plan for when the NFL officials were going to ask about his vaccination status.



""So I've been ready the entire time for this question, and had thought about how I wanted to answer it,"" the Green Bay Packers quarterback said. ""And I had come to a conclusion as to what I'm gonna say, 'I've been immunized.' And if there's a follow-up, then talk about my process.""



Rodgers said there was no follow-up question about specifically being vaccinated against COVID-19.

""They didn't follow up,"" he revealed. ""So then I go to season them thinking, some of them that I was vaccinated.""

Rodgers said that NFL officials were ""basically asking me to rip on my teammates,"" by revealing if they weren't vaccinated.

""I said it's everybody's own decision with their body and we're super healthy individuals, we take care of ourselves, we understand what goes on our bodies, and I don't have any judgment on any decision that a guy makes,"" the legendary football player noted.

Then the media found out that Rodgers had not been vaccinated against COVID.

""And that's when the s**tstorm hit because now I'm a liar,"" Rodgers said, calling it an ""attempted takedown of me and my word and my integrity.""

Rodgers recalled contracting COVID-19, and he was feeling ""amazing"" within 36 hours. He credited Rogan for helping him with effective treatments.

""So I'm super healthy and take care of myself really well,"" Rodgers declared. ""And oh, by the way, I just went from really bad symptoms to 36 hours later feeling great.""

""No one wanted to hear that. No one wanted to hear that there was a way that you could get through it without being vaccinated and that you would recover very quickly,"" he remarked. ""No one would care. And they will come up with all sorts of reasons why you shouldn't even say that.""

""I didn't like the characterization that I put people in danger, that I endangered my teammates, I lied to my teammates,"" the legendary QB stated. ""I said from day one, they knew medical staff, everybody in the organization, everybody knew I'm wearing a yellow wristband. Everybody knew my status.""

Rodgers presented the NFL with ""500 pages of research from a number of people that put together case reviewed studies around homeopathy and immunizations and safety in them and also the efficacy of them."" An NFL official allegedly called Rodgers a ""conspiracy theorist."" Rodgers rebutted, ""No, I just think I'm a realist. I'm just looking at the facts here.""

Aaron Rodgers Clears the Air on ""Immunized"" Controversy www.youtube.com

Rodgers highlighted that the media lied and said Rogan was taking ""horse dewormer."" He also laughed that Rogan ""mopped the floor"" with the CNN medical analyst Sanjay Gupta.

Rogan said at the height of the pandemic, the persecution of unvaccinated people ""was like McCarthyism.""



""It was like a Red Scare – like everyone was looking for communists,"" Rogan remarked. ""They were just looking for non-vaxxers. It was like a fever in the air because people had been convinced that this was the thing that was going to get us out of the pandemic and if you didn't follow that thing that you were the enemy of it.""

Rodgers talked about people like Keith Olbermann, who would demand, ""Just get the damn jab and I'm like."" Rogan said Olberman is the ""gift that keeps giving"" and he is ""f***ing hilarious, unintentionally.""

Rogan pointed out how Dr. Deborah Birx – COVID-19 response coordinator under former President Donald Trump – changed her tune and said last month, ""I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection. And I think we overplayed the vaccines, and it made people then worry that it's not going to protect against severe disease and hospitalization. It will. But let's be very clear: 50% of the people who died from the omicron surge were older, vaccinated.""

The prolific podcast host and football player also recalled how President Joe Biden tried to terrify Americans about the pandemic in December 2021 by saying, ""We are looking at a winter of severe illness and death for the unvaccinated, for themselves, their families, and the hospitals they'll soon overwhelm.'

Rogan joked, ""Yeah. It's like they were 'Game of Thrones.' They were talking about the f***ing white walkers coming, a winter of death.""

""Science that can't be questioned isn't science anymore,"" Rodgers proclaimed. ""It's propaganda.""

Rodgers said questioning the official COVID narrative was ""not allowed,"" and anyone who did was branded as an ""anti-vaxxer, flat-Earth, crazy rightwing conspiracy theorist.""

Rodgers slammed the government for closing small businesses – and bankrupting many of them,

Rogan and Rodgers expressed their concern with the plans of the World Economic Forum.

Rodgers revealed that he has played NFL games while under the influence of Percocet because of injuries.



""The pain management, especially with our sport, is fascinating to see how things are 'treated.' I use quotations on treated because, up until probably a decade ago, it was easily accessible to get oxy, Percocet, Vicodin, whatever you wanted. ... you played [on painkillers], definitely,"" Rodgers said.

""[I played] on Percocet,"" he admitted. ""It was more for pain management, so I wasn't taking any high dosage, but stupid, ultimately.""

"Teacher shot by 6-year-old student says district ignored 3 separate warnings before the shooting, will file lawsuit","The teacher who was shot by a 6-year-old student indicated that she will file a lawsuit against the district after her attorney detailed three separate warnings she says the district ignored before the shooting.

Attorney Diane Toscano says her client Abby Zwerner has been released from the hospital after being shot in the chest by a student at Richneck Elementary in Newport News, Virginia.

Toscano said that the first warning came from Zwerner herself who claimed that she told a school administrator that the child had threatened to beat up another student.

""They didn't call security, they didn't remove the student from the classroom, the school administration failed to act,"" Toscano said.

A second warning came when a teacher searched the student's bookbag to look for the gun. That teacher told a school administrator that they believed they saw the 6-year-old student putting a gun in his pocket before going out for recess. That administrator reportedly responded that he had ""little pockets,"" presumably implying they were too small to hold a gun.

A third warning was missed only one hour before the shooting.

Toscano said that a third teacher went to administrators after a student told them that the boy had shown them a gun and threatened to shoot them if they told anyone. Instead of taking action, administrators reportedly refused permission to search the boy because it was close to the end of the day.

""Tragically, almost an hour later, violence struck Richneck Elementary School,"" Toscano continued. ""Abby was shot in front of those horrified kids and the school community is living the nightmare all because the school administration failed to act.""

An attorney for the family of the 6-year-old student released a brief statement after the media briefing from Toscano.

""On behalf of the family of the child, we continue to pray for Ms. Zwerner and wish her a complete and full recovery. Our hearts go out to all involved,"" said James Ellenson.

The family had previously asserted that the child suffered from an ""acute disability"" and said they did not know how he got possession of the firearm that was registered to the boy's mother.

The assistant principal for the school has already resigned while the school board voted to fire the school's superintendent.

Toscano said that Zwerner's condition is improving, but added, ""the psychological wounds cut deeply and remain fresh, and the psychological scars will be lasting.""

Here's a video of Toscano's claims against the district:

"ABC News gets checked for deceptive photos that appear to show AOC, Omar in handcuffs when they aren't: 'You clapping seals'","ABC News became the target of online mockery on Tuesday for using deceptive images that purportedly depict Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) in handcuffs.

What are the details?

On Tuesday, multiple Democratic lawmakers were briefly detained — or, more accurately, led away by officers — because they refused to comply with law enforcement orders to stop blocking traffic outside the Supreme Court.

The lawmakers were participating in a pro-abortion protest.

When ABC News tweeted about the incident, the news outlet used photos of Ocasio-Cortez and Omar that showed the lawmakers with their hands behind their backs as they were led away by police officers. The images thus suggest the lawmakers were placed in handcuffs and formally arrested.

But that is not what happened.

Neither lawmaker was led away in handcuffs. It is not clear why they put their hands behind their backs when officers did not handcuff them. The optics of the image, however, certainly earned brownie points with their supporters.

What was the response?

ABC News was harshly criticized over its decisions to falsely depict Ocasio-Cortez and Omar in handcuffs.

""It all started with the pretend handcuffs. Now it’s time for the media lies to kick in. No surprise @ABC is leading the pack,"" Dinesh D'Souza responded.

""ABC can't honestly use these photos. AOC and Ilhan Omar are PRETENDING to be handcuffed,"" Steve Guest, an adviser to Sen. Ted Cruz, reacted.

""ABC can't honestly use these photos. AOC and Ilhan Omar are PRETENDING to be handcuffed,"" Steve Guest, an adviser to Sen. Ted Cruz, reacted. ""The mainstream media just straight up told the fake story,"" one person noted.

""[H]onestly just surreal to watch the propaganda come to life like this in real time,"" one person observed.

""The pic choice is a deliberate editorial decision, by the same people who performatively wonder why trust in media is down,"" another person noted.

""What a complete f***ing lie with angles on these photos to make it look like they are cuffed. And they wonder why they're called fake news,"" another person observed.

""ABC News falsely claims they were arrested and runs photos of them appearing to be handcuffed when they aren't. Mission accomplished,"" one person mocked.

""AOC, at least, was literally not arrested. They just moved her back about 20 feet. She wasn't even cuffed,"" another person said.

""They were not arrested. They literally just had their hands behind their backs so you clapping seals would report they were arrested,"" another person mocked.

""They weren't arrested they were escorted away and it was nice of you to use the pictures that made it look like they were in handcuffs when they weren't It's cracked like this that makes it clear why the people don't trust the media any longer,"" one person said.

Why does this matter?

Clarifying that the lawmakers were not arrested in handcuffs is important because Ocasio-Cortez has already seized on the incident to fundraise.

""Alexandria was just arrested by Capitol Police outside the Supreme Court during an abortion rights demonstration. Rush a $3 contribution to abortion access groups right now to show Congress we stand with AOC and #WeWontBackDown,"" Ocasio-Cortez's congressional campaign wrote in an email to her supporters, the Washington Examiner reported.

""Alexandria will not rest until Congress does what needs to be done to codify abortion care as a human right in our country,"" the email added. ""In the meantime, you can help folks seeking to access [abortion] care right now by splitting a $3 contribution to abortion access groups.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abc-news-gets-checked-for-deceptive-photos-that-appear-to-show-aoc-omar-in-handcuffs-when-they-arent-you-clapping-seals,2022-07-20
Virginia Democrat goes on Fox News and rejects campaign help from Biden — then boasts she 'outperformed' him,"Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger went on Fox News Tuesday and explained that she does not want President Joe Biden campaigning for her.

What are the details?

Fox News host Dana Perino told Spanberger the Cook Politico Report shows the district she is campaigning for this November — the newly redrawn 7th Congressional District in Virginia — is a ""Democratic toss-up.""

Perino thus asked Spanberger whether Biden would help her campaign. But the Virginia Democrat made it clear Biden will not.

""I intend to do the campaigning myself. I am the candidate. It is my name on the ballot,"" Spanberger said. ""Certainly when I first ran, I ran in an R +7 district. And I won in that seat by getting out, speaking to voters, making sure that they know who I am and what it is that I intended to do for them.

""In 2020, [I] ran for re-election and certainly outperformed the president on the ballot by telling the people what I had done and what I was going to continue to do,"" she added.

Earlier in the interview, Spanberger refused to say whether she would support Biden for re-election in 2024.

""I’m looking squarely toward 2022 and the re-election ahead of me, working to make sure voters across Virginia's 7th district know what I’ve been doing on their behalf and why I’m asking for their vote again,"" Spanberger said. ""I’ll be focused on 2024 after we get through the 2022 elections.""

Anything else?

Spanberger made headlines after the 2020 election when she torched her progressive colleagues for embracing ""defund the police"" and other far-left ideas out of touch with most Americans.

""We have to commit to not saying the words 'defund the police' ever again,"" Spanberger said in a post-election phone call with the Democratic caucus. ""We need to not ever use the words 'socialist' or 'socialism' ever again.""

""If we run this race again we will get f***ing torn apart again in 2022,"" she predicted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abigail-spanberger-biden-2022-campaign,2022-06-29
"Abortion advocate says she will apply Dobbs ruling as federal judge, but Republicans aren't convinced","In her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 21, Julie Rikelman faced scrutiny from Republican senators over whether she would enforce the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs ruling. Although she answered in the affirmative, stating that she would follow it just as she would follow all Supreme Court precedents, not all were convinced. After all, Rikelman was the career abortion advocate who argued on behalf of the Jackson Women’s Health Organization in the case that resulted in Roe v. Wade's overturning.

President Joe Biden nominated Julie Rikelman on August 1, 2022, to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston. If confirmed to this lifetime position, Rikelman would replace Judge Sandra Lea Lynch.

'Warrior for reproductive rights'

Rikelman, who served for nearly a decade as senior litigation director for the Center for Reproductive Rights (CPR), a pro-abortion advocacy organization, suggested in a December 2021 Salon interview that academic, financial, and professional gains enjoyed by women were made possible by abortion.

Claiming abortion to be a right, she indicated that one of her biggest goals was ""to make sure that the voices of women were heard at the court and were present in the courtroom ... to make sure that the impact of taking this right away, something the court hast [sic] never done, ... would be felt.""

Touted by her alma mater as a ""warrior for reproductive rights"" and ranked second on InStyle's 2022 list of ""The Badass 50,"" Rikelman was lead litigator for the plaintiff in the 2020 Supreme Court case June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, where the high court ruled in favor of her client, which had challenged a Louisiana state law placing hospital admission requirements on abortion clinic doctors.

After the decision, Rikelman told the Harvard Gazette that ""it's really important for people to remain vigilant, because we know that the opposition is relentless,"" arguing that laws like Louisiana's must be ""permanently blocked.""

Prior to the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs ruling, she recommended ""expanding access to abortion,"" stating that the ""status quo is not good enough"" and that she was committed to the ""battle against outright bans on abortion.""

Advocate or judge

On Wednesday, Rikelman claimed that she would ""apply Dobbs faithfully,"" separating her lifetime of abortion advocacy from her potential work as a federal judge.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) drew attention to a 2018 article penned by Rikelman, wherein she deemed pregnancy resource centers to be ""faux clinics."" Concerning those individuals from such centers who had previously testified before Congress, Hawley asked, ""Is your testimony here that these folks are lying under oath ... that these centers are all fake?""

Rikelman, who refused to speak to her own views on abortion, reiterated that she would keep her role as advocate and her prospective role as judge separate.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), similarly concerned with Rikelman's vocal opposition to pregnancy resource centers, asked whether she would recuse herself in cases where they are involved.

Rikelman answered, ""I will carefully look at the recusal statute and consider all of the circumstances of the case, consult with my chief judge, and do absolutely whatever the code of traditional conduct requires.""

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) pointed out that it may be difficult for Rikelman to disentangle a passion for abortion to which she has devoted her life from the duties of the post for which she was nominated. He stated that her support for full legalization of abortion, including in the ninth month of pregnancy, is well outside the mainstream.

Cruz cited Rikelman's nomination as part of a broader effort by President Joe Biden to ""fundamentally change our judiciary."" He said, ""Biden has decided with the complicity of Senate Democrats to abandon the notion of fair and impartial judges who apply the law and instead to fill the bench with partisan zealots.""

Cruz told Rikelman that her career embodies ""precisely this pattern,"" having spent the majority of her professional life as ""an extreme zealot advocating for abortion.""

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) referred to a statement made by Rikelman wherein she said the impact of Dobbs will be ""swift and severe,"" insisting that ""we are on the verge of what may be the biggest public health crisis we have ever seen in decades.""

""In a world in which more babies are being born and being born alive than being aborted, you call that a public health crisis?"" Lee asked, ahead of invoking the COVID-19 pandemic and AIDS epidemic as historic crises that might also have qualified for the top spot.

Rikelman responded by saying that her comments, which were made in an advocacy report, pertained to ""the implications of forcing women to give birth against their will, not about the implications for women who want to have a child.""

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) questioned Rikelman about her approach to violent crime, noting the relevance of her answers amid skyrocketing levels of murders ""not seen since the 1990s.""



Cotton suggested that much of the spike in violent crime can be attributed to ""left-wing pro-criminal policies"" like those Rikelman advocated for in her 2007 article in the Baylor Law Review, where she ""argued that it was unconstitutional for law enforcement to log DNA samples from convicted criminals."" In response to her answers, Cotton suggested that Rikelman misrepresented the article before the committee.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abortion-advocate-dobbs-nominated-judge,2022-09-22
Pro-abortion protests outside the homes of SCOTUS justices may be illegal,"Pro-abortion protesters descended upon the personal residences of the Supreme Court's conservative-leaning justices last week after a leaked opinion draft indicated the court had voted to overturn abortion precedents.

But those protests may not be protected under the First Amendment.

What are the details?

Federal law 18 U.S.C. §1507 — part of a chapter on obstruction of justice — prohibits exactly what the leftist protesters are doing.

The statute reads:

Whoever, with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty, pickets or parades in or near a building housing a court of the United States, or in or near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge, juror, witness, or court officer, or with such intent uses any sound-truck or similar device or resorts to any other demonstration in or near any such building or residence, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

The question, then, is why has the Justice Department not enforced the law?



Former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy told Fox News the silence from Attorney General Merrick Garland is deafening, especially considering what Garland has spoken out about.

""I would note that months ago, when Attorney General Garland unjustifiably dispatched the FBI to investigate parents who were protesting the inclusion of racist and anti-American materials in school curricula, Garland claimed that the Justice Department had an interest in protecting teachers and school administrators. Not only was it untrue that schools were under siege, the relationship between parents and schools is a state and local issue, not a federal one — hypothetically, if a parent were to assault a teacher, it would be a state crime, not a federal one,"" McCarthy explained.

""By contrast, the protection of the Supreme Court as an institution, and of the justices’ security, are patently federal matters over which federal law enforcement has clear jurisdiction. It is inexcusable that the Justice Department is so silent and passive now, when it was loud and active over a manufactured controversy as to which it had no jurisdiction,"" he added.

Even the Washington Post editorial board, which is by no means conservative, suggested the Justice Department take action.

Referring to 18 U.S.C. §1507, the board wrote on Monday, ""These are limited and justifiable restraints on where and how people exercise the right to assembly. Citizens should voluntarily abide by them, in letter and spirit. If not, the relevant governments should take appropriate action.""

What is the White House saying?

White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked Monday about protesters violating a Virginia law that prohibits residential picketing.

After initially refusing to condemn the residential protests last week, Psaki struck a more neutral chord, explaining the White House condemns violence and intimidation. She also said president does not support protests that violate the law.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/abortion-protesters-supreme-court-justices-houses-violation-federal-law,2022-05-10
ACLU files federal lawsuit to prevent cleanup of garbage left by homeless,"Approximately 1,000 homeless people populate the central region of Phoenix, creating enough waste to necessitate city cleanups three times per week. While local businesses claim the mess is a public nuisance, the American Civil Liberties Union believes constitutional rights are being violated despite ample warning and signage from the city regarding the sweeps.

As reported by KNXV, the ACLU seeks to assist those who are currently in ""unsheltered status"" who they say are victims of unlawful seizures.

The ACLU refers to the garbage cleanups as ""raids,"" stating that they ""indiscriminately seize, impound and destroy unsheltered individuals' personal property and survival gear without cause or warrant.""

""Tents, IDs, legal documents, medical paper ... you can't destroy people's property,"" Benjamin Rundell, attorney for the ACLU of Arizona, told KNXV.

The nonprofit also alleges the garbage sweeps constitute ""cruel and unusual punishment"" by prohibiting sleeping outside, as well as ""unlawfully seizing and destroying"" personal property.

The homeless area is so infamous that it garnered the nickname ""The Zone."" In October 2022, Phoenix radio station KJZZ 91.5 investigated the topic, stating that there are ""more than 5,000"" homeless people in Maricopa County, Arizona, and ""nearly 10,000 if you count those living in shelters.""

The homeless population has allegedly nearly doubled since 2016.

In August 2022, local businesses and residents sued the City of Phoenix, claiming they have been harmed by the homelessness crisis. Specifically, the lawsuit alleged that there is a large concentration of homeless people who suffer from varying illnesses and addictions and that the city isn't doing enough to house them nor solve the problem.

""Not only is the City of Phoenix failing to provide these individuals with housing and needed services, it refuses to enforce in and around the Zone quality-of-life ordinances prohibiting loitering, disturbing the peace, drunken and disorderly conduct, drug use, domestic violence, and obstructing streets, sidewalks, or other public grounds,” the lawsuit stated.

When asked about the ""public nuisance,"" the ACLU attorney stated that the City of Phoenix should come up with a solution that ""doesn't violate the Constitution and destroy people's things.""

The city claims cleanup will resume in December 2022 and will implement new procedures that will allow people to claim abandoned property, adding that $50 million was dedicated to addressing the homelessness problem in the last fiscal year.

"ACLU sides with state against small business, arguing owner can be compelled to post pictures of gay civil unions against her will","Lorie Smith is the owner of 303 Creative, a graphic and website design company based in Colorado. She is selective about the messages that she creates or promotes, owing to her Christian faith: ""I am always careful to avoid communicating ideas or messages ... that are inconsistent with my religious beliefs.""

Smith is generally willing to produce work on behalf of gay and transsexual customers, however, she wants to begin offering wedding-related services exclusively to straight couples. Since she believes same-sex civil unions conflict with God's will, she neither plans on hosting images of gay civil unions nor making her company complicit in celebrating them. In her complaint, Smith wrote that doing otherwise ""would compromise my Christian witness.""

Recognizing that Colorado's Anti-Discrimination Act will require her to do so, and keen not to violate CADA as it now stands, Smith has brought a pre-enforcement challenge to CADA.

Smith first filed her lawsuit in 2016. Her claims that CADA violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, among others, were heard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, which moved to dismiss.

The U.S. Supreme Court announced in February that it would hear 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis later this year.

The case concerns whether the state — in this instance, exercising its authority via a public accommodation law — can force an artist to speak or remain silent without violating the artist's First Amendment rights.

The issue was in essence raised before the Supreme Court in 2018. Though the Court refused to decide whether baker Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, and other such business owners can invoke religious objections to refuse certain persons' service, it ruled that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission exhibited anti-religious bias toward Phillips, who had refused to bake a same-sex couple a wedding cake. After the ruling, anti-discrimination legislation was still enforceable by states, but state officials were warned not to denigrate conscientious objectors' religious beliefs.

Among the amicus briefs filed in Smith's case (e.g., by the Claremont Institute's Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, etc.), was one filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU has a mandate to ""fight government abuse and to vigorously defend individual freedoms including speech and religion.""

In its amicus brief, the ACLU distinguished between an artist and an artist who intends to open his or her business to the public at large (i.e., between artists and artist-run businesses).

The ACLU wrote that ""CADA ... leaves businesses free to select the content of products or services they sell to the public, and merely requires them to offer those goods for sale in a nondiscriminatory manner."" The example provided is that a Christmas store can sell exclusively Christmas-related goods, as opposed to Hanukkah goods, but cannot refuse to sell the former to Jewish customers.

The ACLU suggested that CADA regulates businesses open to the public, but not to persons who ""earn a living instead through personal, individualized contracts."" The ACLU then likened Smith's case to a hypothetical ""architecture firm that serves the public [that refuses] to design homes for Muslims because it opposes their religion.""

Reason's Scott Shackford offered another example, demonstrating the trouble with the ACLU's conflation of speech and customer discrimination: ""If 303 Creative refused a customer's request to host a bunch of images of an ISIS terrorist attack, is that discrimination against the customer's religion if the customer is also a Muslim? Clearly, it's not ... She's refusing to host images she finds objectionable.""

Shackford emphasized that the ACLU ""is doing everything in its power to encourage the Court to reject any consideration of Smith's and 303 Creative's First Amendment rights, even going so far as attempting to reframe the central question to make it appear as though these rights are not relevant to the case.""

In a June opinion piece, Smith discussed the death threats, cyberattacks, harassment, and ongoing threats she has faced for her stance, and wrote: ""Whether your beliefs align with mine or not, all of us are at risk if the government that happens to be in power gets to say, 'These views are permitted. Those views aren't.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aclu-sides-with-state-against-conscientious-objector,2022-08-22
"Angry activist gets in Ted Cruz's face at Houston restaurant over guns, gets restrained and dragged out. He smiled in photo with Cruz before ambushing him.","An angry activist got in U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz's face at a Houston restaurant after his address Friday at the National Rifle Association convention; the activist had to be restrained before he was dragged out of the establishment.

What are the details?

The activist asked the Texas Republican for a photo, and the two were smiling and arm in arm:

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @indivisibleHOU

But the activist — identified by Insider as Benjamin Hernandez — quickly turned the photo op into an ambush and lit into Cruz over Tuesday's massacre of students and teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas:

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @indivisibleHOU

Hernandez asked Cruz to talk to him about ""background checks,"" kept speaking when the senator tried to answer, and after Cruz finally was able to say ""background checks wouldn't have stopped the shooter,"" Hernandez got more animated, waving his hands in the air as he said with a raised voice, ""We can make it harder for people to get guns in this country!""

Cruz told the activist ""you combine ignorance with hatred,"" and ""you don't know what you're talking about."" Soon a few men who appeared to be security stepped between Cruz and Hernandez; but the activist began to resist and lunge forward as they slowly dragged him from the eatery.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @indivisibleHOU

It's quite a thing to see how close angry people can get to an elected official like Cruz, especially in times like these. One wonders if Democratic senators like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer would have minded such treatment from a conservative.

As he was dragged away, Hernandez hollered, ""Why did you speak tonight? Why did you come here to the convention to take blood money? Why, when 19 children died? Nineteen children died! That's on your hands! That's on your hands!""

Here's the clip:

The activist speaks

Hernandez — an independent who ran for Congress in 2018 — is a board member of Indivisible Houston, a political advocacy group, which posted the Twitter video of him confronting Cruz, Insider reported.

Hernandez told the outlet he was in the restaurant when he saw Cruz walk in and added that he asked Cruz if he would pose for a photo after the senator finished his dinner — but Cruz got up right away.

""As a constituent, you know, he refuses to allow us to engage him in open public forums. So this is one of the ways we can reach him,"" Hernandez told the outlet. ""I'd never done anything like this before.""

Hernandez added to Insider, ""In that moment, I'm like, 'I have to do this because there are people that are really suffering.' And if it takes ... making Ted Cruz uncomfortable while he's having dinner, I mean, that's just the price of it.""

The activist also told the outlet that while confronting Cruz, he was thinking of the parents of the slain children, as well as his own child.

""I'm a new father. I have a child. This hits different. Like, I just want to know what are you doing as a senator? And what things can you support?"" Hernandez told Insider. ""I'm like, 'Can you just answer the question? Like, where do you stand? What do you bring to the table?""

Hernandez added to the outlet that if politicians continue to avoid action on mass shootings, ""we have to confront them.""

""The moment is now,"" Hernandez told Insider. ""They're always gonna say, 'Now is not the time'... But you know what, it is the time. Now is the time to stop the next one.""

The outlet said a Cruz spokesperson on Saturday didn't immediately respond its request for comment and that an automated message from Cruz's senate office said his voicemail was full.

Remember when?

This wasn't the first time Cruz felt the left's wrath in a restaurant. In September 2018 a leftist mob made headlines by harassing Cruz and his wife in a Washington, D.C., restaurant. Afterward a left-wing group posted video of the incident with a chilling promise to Cruz, then-President Donald Trump, then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and “right-wing scum” in general: “You are not safe. We will find you.”

Ah, but it was the season of such behavior, as other conservative figures were kicked out of restaurants and heckled and even punched. Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife were accosted at a restaurant, too, but other patrons stood up for the couple.

Some might conclude that U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters of California got the ball rollling in June 2018 by infamously ranting to supporters to “create a crowd” and “push back on” members of Trump’s cabinet if they’re seen “in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station.” She added in her speech — fueled by anger over Trump's immigration stances — “You tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/activist-confronts-ted-cruz-restaurant,2022-05-28
Twitter excoriates Adam Schiff for posting misleading video of arrest of BLM founder's cousin that led to his death,"Critics bashed Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California after he posted what many saw as a misleading video of the arrest of a Black Lives Matter founder's cousin that led to his death.

The LAPD arrested Keenan Anderson on January 3 after a report of a man causing a disturbance. He refused to follow police orders and resisted arrest while acting erratically. He later died of a cardiac arrest at a hospital and tested positive for ""Cocaine Metabolite and Cannabinoids.""

BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors released a statement accusing the LAPD of killing Anderson, who was her cousin. Police Chief Michel Moore said that Anderson had allegedly committed a felony hit-and-run the day before the fatal altercation.

On Monday, Schiff posted an edited video that made it appear that police assaulted Anderson without provocation and with undeserved aggression.

""We must not look away. And we must not shrink from the need for justice for Keenan Anderson. Police must never respond with such force to a potential mental health crisis,"" tweeted Schiff.

We must not look away. And we must not shrink from the need for justice for Keenan Anderson.

""Resources and care are the answer. Accountability must be transparent and swift,"" he threatened.

Many on social media immediately assailed the Democrat for posting the video.

""This scumbag just wants to inflame tensions and incite violence against cops. If you watch the full video, the cop was incredibly restrained before Anderson ran then resisted arrest. You are a despicable human being @RepAdamSchiff and a disgrace to congress,"" responded actor Matthew Marsden.

NYC mayor is 'deeply contemplating' taking a busload of New Yorkers to Texas to campaign against Gov. Greg Abbott,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, said that he was ""deeply contemplating"" taking a busload of New Yorkers down to Texas to help campaign against Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican.

Adams made the comments on Tuesday when asked if he was joining any effort to unseat Abbott.

""I already called all of my friends in Texas and told them how to cast their vote,"" he responded. ""And I am deeply contemplating taking a busload of New Yorkers to Texas and do some good old fashioned door knocking, because we have to, for the good of America, we have to get him out of office.""

The comments were the latest incident in a series of feudal actions taken between the governors of opposing political parties. Adams has expressed his anger over Abbott sending busloads of migrants to his city from the border state.

""There's nothing more anti-American than what he's displaying right now,"" said Adams previously.

He also said that some migrants wanted to join their families in other cities and was upset that Abbott sent them to New York City without any notice or coordination with his office.

Abbott said he ordered the new policy to send migrants to ""sanctuary cities"" like New York City because of the lack of response from the federal government for the immigration crisis.

“Because of President Biden’s continued refusal to acknowledge the crisis caused by his open border policies, the State of Texas has had to take unprecedented action to keep our communities safe,” read a statement from Abbott.

“I hope he follows through on his promise of welcoming all migrants with open arms so that our overrun and overwhelmed border towns can find relief,"" wrote Abbott about Mayor Adams.

Adams has resorted to calling on the White House to provide more resources to help the city deal with the migrants arriving from Texas.

Abbott has also sent migrants in buses to Washington, D.C., leading Mayor Muriel Bowser to call for assistance from the National Guard in order to deal with the thousands of new migrants in her city. On Friday, the head of the Department of Defense officially denied that request.

"Three Air Force Academy cadets who refused COVID-19 vaccine won't be commissioned, will receive bachelor's degrees instead, may need to repay gov't for education","Three U.S. Air Force Academy cadets who refused the COVID-19 vaccine won't be commissioned as officers and will graduate with bachelor’s degrees instead, the academy told the Associated Press.

A fourth cadet who also refused the vaccine but changed his mind about a week ago will graduate and become an Air Force officer, Academy spokesman Dean Miller added to the AP.

What else?

Miller also said the three cadets ""will not be commissioned into the United States Air Force as long as they remain unvaccinated,"" the outlet reported, adding that the secretary of the Air Force will decide if the trio will owe the government for the costs of their educations in lieu of service.

The Air Force Academy as of Saturday is the only U.S. military academy not commissioning cadets who refuse the vaccine, the AP said, adding that all of the more than 1,000 Army cadets at West Point graduated and were commissioned as officers Saturday — and all were vaccinated. The Naval Academy said Saturday that no Navy or Marine Corps seniors are being denied commissions over vaccine refusals, the outlet said.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the scheduled speaker at the Air Force graduation Wednesday in Colorado, last year made COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for service members — including those at military academies — saying the shots are critical to maintaining military readiness and the health of the force, the AP said.

But members of Congress, the military, and the public have questioned whether the military's exemption reviews have been fair, the outlet said, adding that multiple lawsuits have been filed against the mandate, mainly in regard to how few service members have been granted religious exemptions.

Lt. Col. Brian Maguire — an Air Force Academy spokesman — said a week ago all four cadets met with the academy’s superintendent, were told about potential consequences, and had time before graduation to change their minds, the AP reported.

The military academies for years often have required students to repay tuition costs if they leave during their junior or senior years, the outlet said, adding that many such cases involve students with disciplinary issues or similar problems — and the cost can be as much as $200,000 or more.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/air-force-cadets-no-vaccines,2022-05-23
Air marshals tasked with 'making sandwiches' for illegal aliens at southern border despite looming threat of jihadist terrorism,"The Biden administration has tasked federal air marshals with babysitting criminal noncitizens who have stolen into the country, even though neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the White House is willing to declare the border crisis an emergency.

This mandated work may appear even more intolerable for the highly trained agents since there is now cause to suspect that Islamic terrorists are once again scheming to attack American citizens.

An old foe with the same M.O.

Despite getting roundly whipped by American forces since the September 11 attacks, elements of al Qaeda have nevertheless managed to slither into the new year.



This week, al Qaeda affiliates claimed responsibility for two simultaneous attacks in southeastern Mali, reported Africanews. The Malian Ministry of Security and Civil Protection noted Tuesday that two firemen and three civilians were murdered in one of the attacks.

Al Qaeda also vowed in the latest issue of its magazine Ghazwa-e-Hind to demolish the Ram temple being built in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, in order to replace it with a mosque.

The international jihadist group may also have new deadly designs closer to home.

Judicial Watch has obtained a document from high-level DHS sources indicating that ""Al-Qaeda says upcoming attacks on US, possibly involving planes, will use new techniques and tactics.""

Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, warned in September 2021 that it would take between one and two years for the terror organization, rebuilding in Afghanistan, to have ""some capability to at least threaten the homeland.""

Biden administration juggling crises it won't name

Such an attack may exploit the Biden administration's monthly assignment of 150-250 air marshals to the southern border to tackle ""a surge in irregular migration"" — a surge atop an already unprecedented wave of criminal noncitizens into the nation under President Joe Biden's watch.

Air marshals are normally tasked with securing the nation's transportation system and protecting the flying public under the supervision of the DHS' Transportation Security Administration.

Air Marshal National Council executive director Sonya LaBosco explained to Judicial Watch on Jan. 1 that the Biden administration now has tasked highly trained marshals with ""making sandwiches for [illegal aliens] and driving them around like Uber or picking up supplies.""

Fox News Digital reported that mid-2021, the Federal Air Marshal Service asked for volunteers to head down to the southern border for 30-day stints. However, in late October, the Biden administration made such tours to the border mandatory.

These mandatory deployments reportedly leave just one in 100 American flights protected by a marshal.

David Londo, president of the Air Marshal National Council, told the Washington Examiner that normally, 8% of U.S. commercial flights typically have marshals keeping watch. The Federal Air Marshal Service has roughly 3,000 marshals in its employ.

The National Association of Police Organizations questioned the DHS' decision, stating, ""We strongly question the decision by the Department of Homeland Security to divert much-needed aviation security to the southern border especially as we enter the busiest travel season of the year, particularly as a Federal emergency has not been declared at the border.""

House Republicans criticized the DHS for the move, stating that ""redirecting these Air Marshals away from their critical law enforcement functions in our nation’s skies, creating a massive risk to public safety.""

The Air Marshal National Council similarly criticized the move, filing a formal complaint accusing Federal Air Marshal Service Director Tirrell Stevenson and TSA administrator David Pekoske ""of fraud, waste, and abuse of authority and violations of federal law.""

The council noted that the TSA administrator does not have ""any authority to deploy TSA or FAM employees to the southern border to perform non-transportation-security-related matters.""

The exception that still has not been met, said the complaint, is if an emergency has been declared by the DHS secretary, which has yet to take place.

Backlash

Londo, who has warned that marshals are growing increasingly willing to risk termination over the mandated border service, recently penned a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Stevenson, and Pekoske, once again expressing concern about the misuse of the marshals in light of the more pressing need to protect America from the Islamist threat.

Londo wrote, ""As you are aware currently hundreds of Federal Air Marshals (FAMs) are deployed to the southern border to preform [sic] humanitarian work to include warming up sandwiches for migrants.""

The council director previously characterized these mandated tasks as ""non-law enforcement civilian humanitarian duties.""

""We have been informed that these deployments are indefinite, in other words no end in sight for sending hundreds of FAMs to the southern border,"" he noted.

Citing the news of al Qaeda activity potentially targeting American aircraft, Londo underscored that ""deploying FAMs to the southern border to perform humanitarian work is reckless and putting [our] Nation and the people we serve at extreme risk.""

The council president noted that DHS Secretary Mayorkas had testified under oath before Congress that the border was secure and that the White House has not yet declared the crisis it facilitated at the border an emergency, intimating marshals were being wasted on a problem the Biden administration still refuses to properly acknowledge.

Londo concluded the letter by writing, ""We have to ask how can you justify sending FAMs to the border in huge numbers, when the border is in your words secure, and there is no emergency? Yet we have major security incidents happening right now affecting our aviation security.""

LaBosco, who signed both the letter and the complaint, told ""Fox & Friends First,"" ""We don't understand why these decisions are being made. The intel is clear. Al Qaeda is watching for our weak areas. Our aviation is a high-risk area. We're not protecting our aviation domain, and we're going to the border. It is absolutely madness.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/air-marshals-tasked-with-making-sandwiches-for-illegal-aliens-at-southern-border-despite-looming-threat-of-jihadist-terrorism,2023-01-06
"Alabama man beheaded, murdered, stabbed girlfriend 100 times","An Alabama man is accused of the brutal stabbing murder of his girlfriend. Police say the alleged man stabbed the woman more than 100 times.

On Oct. 21, Justin Fields allegedly went out to local bars in the Springfield area for his 38th birthday with his girlfriend Tammy Bailey. The couple returned to their home that day.

Blount County Sheriff Mark Moon said, ""He had a drink of brandy and then went into his bedroom and was playing guitar. He decided he wanted to have sex, so he went into her room and propositioned her.""

The girlfriend refused his sexual advances, which severely aggravated Fields.

Fields reportedly retrieved an 8-inch survival-type knife and stabbed his girlfriend over 100 times.

The attack was absolutely gruesome, according to authorities.

“She was beheaded and one of her lower limbs was cut almost completely off, it was just barely hanging on… we believe the very first blow, which was straight through the chest, through the heart, we believe that was a lethal blow,” Moon said, according to WVTM-TV.

Fields allegedly told investigators that he blacked out and fell asleep after the grisly attack.

He allegedly woke up the next morning and said he thought he was having a nightmare.

Alabama.com reported, ""Fields called his father and told him he had 'done something horrible,' and wanted to commit suicide. The father then called Bailey’s family member, who was also a neighbor.""

The family member went to the house, but Fields refused to let her inside.

""He tells her what’s inside is terrible, and she doesn’t want to see it,’"" Moon stated. ""She calls 911.""



The first deputy arrived at the crime scene around 5:30 p.m. on Oct. 22. He found Fields sitting on the front step of the home. Fields told him that he had done something horrific. The deputy informed Fields that he was going to handcuff him for the safety of both men. Fields responded, ""That’s Ok. You’re going to arrest me anyway.""

The deputy called the police dispatch for backup. Police reportedly found Bailey's dismembered body in the bedroom. Police said Bailey's head was found near her feet.



Fields was arrested, and then interviewed twice by investigators.

""He admitted to my investigator everything he’d done, so he was stable enough to know what he was doing,"" said Moon. ""He was frustrated because he didn’t get what he wanted.""

Three investigators – who have about 100 years of combat experience – said the macabre scene was the ""worst thing they’ve ever seen.""

Fields was charged with murder and abuse of a corpse, jail records show.

The case is set to go before a grand jury on Jan. 23.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alabama-man-murder-girlfriend-beheading,2022-10-29
AOC attacks members of her own party for refusing to use very unpopular woke language: 'This is not about you',"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) lashed out at Democrats on Sunday who refuse to use progressive vocabulary like the word ""Latinx.""

What did AOC say?

Speaking in a ""mini-rant"" on Instagram, Ocasio-Cortez condemned politicians who refuse to adopt the woke vernacular.

""I also have a mini-rant about this because there are some politicians, including Democratic politicians, that rail against the term 'Latinx.' And they’re like, 'this is so bad, this is so bad for the party,' like blah blah blah,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

""And, like, it’s almost like it hasn’t struck some of these folks that another person’s identity is not about your re-election prospects,"" she continued. ""Like, this is not about you. Second of all, if putting a little 'x' on your campaign literature is what you think is the difference between winning and losing an election, you need to talk about health care more. You need to raise people’s wages. You need to talk about more issues that also matter to people.""

Earlier in her video, the New York Democrat claimed that ""gender is fluid"" and ""language is fluid,"" and she urged people to stop making ""a lot of drama"" over using ""Latinx.""

But what is the problem?

While Ocasio-Cortez is allegedly concerned with being ""inclusive,"" few Hispanics — just 4%, according to a Gallup survey — prefer the term ""Latinx."" Another damning survey showed that a significant minority of Hispanics believe the term is offensive.

The reason why most Hispanic people do not support using the term ""Latinx"" is because the word does not make any grammatical sense in the Spanish language.

Spanish utilizes grammatical gender, a linguistic feature used by approximately one-fourth of all languages. Grammatical gender is often unrelated to biological gender, and instead ensures grammatical coherence within languages that use it.

In Spanish, grammatical gender can provide gender information about a person (a young boy, for example, is called a niño, whereas a young girl is called a niña). But most often grammatical gender designations have nothing to do with biological gender. For example, in Spanish ""people"" is a feminine noun (la gente), whereas ""bridge"" is a masculine noun (el puente).

This is why Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego (Ariz.) announced last year that his staff members cannot use the term ""Latinx.""

""To be clear my office is not allowed to use 'Latinx' in official communications,"" Gallego explained. ""When Latino politicos use the term it is largely to appease white rich progressives who think that is the term we use. It is a vicious circle of confirmation bias.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-rant-democrats-latinx,2022-06-06
VIDEO: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) slammed at town hall event,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was blasted over her voting record on sending weapons and aid to Ukraine. AOC was confronted by protesters during a sparsely attended town hall event in New York City on Wednesday.

A man is heard on video telling Ocasio-Cortez, ""You voted to send arms and weapons to Ukraine!""

In May, AOC and all Democrats – including all of the ""Squad"" members – voted in favor of sending $40 billion in aid to Ukraine following the invasion by Russia.

During the ""Legislative Victories & Opportunities for Constituents"" town hall event, the man then asked why Ocasio-Cortez doesn't leave the Democratic Party like former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard.

On Tuesday, Gabbard announced she was departing the Democratic Party because it is an ""elitist cabal of warmongers who are driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue and stoking anti-white racism, who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms that are enshrined in our Constitution."" Gabbard also declared that the Democratic Party is ""dragging us closer to nuclear war.""

The man said Gabbard left the Democratic Party ""because they’re a bunch of war hawks.”

""You ran as an outsider,"" the man said. ""Yet you've been voting to start this war in Ukraine. You've been voting to start a third nuclear war with Russia and China.""

He asked, ""Why are you playing with the lives of American citizens?""

Another man chimed in, ""You voted to mobilize and send money to Ukrainian Nazis.""

He yelled, ""You're a coward!""

The man questioned how AOC could be a ""progressive socialist"" while voting to send American funds to Ukraine.

He screamed during the town hall event held in the Bronx, ""You have done nothing!""

The man declared, ""Tulsi Gabbard has shown guts while you have shown cowardice.""

""I believed in you and you became the very thing you sought to fight against,"" the alleged supporter said. ""That's what you've become. You are the establishment.""

He continued, ""And you are the reason why everybody will end up in a nuclear war, unless you choose to stand up right now and denounce the Democratic Party.""

The man ranted, ""We could be in a nuclear war at any minute, and you continue to fund it. That's what's going on.""

AOC refused to address the man's claims, but she did call him ""rude."" He retorted, ""You're the liar here. Nobody has held you accountable.""

The man concluded, ""And it is time for you to stand up and realize that what you've been saying has been lies. Let your conscience come through for once.""

One of the protesters shared a screenshot of an email he allegedly sent to Ocasio-Cortez in 2018, in which he was hopeful that the up-and-coming New York politician would assist him in a dispute with his landlord.

At the time of publication, AOC – who is extremely active on social media – has yet to address being confronted about her voting record on funding Ukraine.

Regarding the war between Russia and Ukraine, Ocasio-Cortez has never mentioned the conflict on her massively popular personal Twitter account with more than 13.5 million followers. On her much less popular government Twitter account, she has mentioned the conflict three times – the last being in March.

""As Ukraine fights against the Russian invasion, we have a moral obligation to assist any way we can,"" AOC tweeted on March 28. ""The Ukraine Comprehensive Debt Payment Relief Act would work to support the immediate suspension of Ukraine’s debt payments, help coordinate comprehensive debt relief, and more.""

In April, Ocasio-Cortez voted against the Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act. The bill that passed in the House gives the president the power to ""seize and confiscate assets belonging to any sanctioned foreign person whose wealth is derived through support for or corruption related to the regime of Russian president Vladimir Putin.""

In January 2020, Ocasio-Cortez proclaimed that ""war is a class conflict.""

""The rich and powerful who open war escape the consequences of their decisions,"" AOC tweeted. ""It’s not their children sent into the jaws of violence. It is often the vulnerable, the poor, & working people – who had little to no say in conflict – who pay the price.""

Previously, AOC declared that ""the whole point of protesting is to make people uncomfortable.""

""Activists take that discomfort w/ the status quo & advocate for concrete policy changes,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in December 2020. ""Popular support often starts small & grows. To folks who complain protest demands make others uncomfortable... that’s the point.""

Editor's note: Due to a typo, the original version of this story incorrectly identified Ocasio-Cortez as (R-N.Y.) rather than (D-N.Y.).

Justice Alito is accused of leaking landmark case ruling. But news outlets' admissions cast serious doubt.,"Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito is denying allegations that he leaked the ruling of a landmark case in 2014.

In addition, denials from key players in the story and a lack of direct evidence corroborating the allegations cast significant doubt on the allegations.

What are the new allegations?

On Saturday, the New York Times published a letter written to Chief Justice John Roberts in July in which Rev. Rob Schenck claims he knew the outcome of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. before the court announced its ruling in the 2014 case.

The case is significant because it held that religious organizations can deny coverage for some contraceptives, in violation of Obamacare.

Schenck, whom Politico described as ""once an evangelical minister and prominent anti-abortion activist"" who ""has since become disillusioned with the religious right,"" claimed in his letter that a donor to his organization, Gayle Wright, told him after having dinner with the Alitos that the Supreme Court would rule in favor of Hobby Lobby.

Several weeks later, the court ruled in Hobby Lobby's favor — and Alito wrote the majority opinion.

What about the evidence?

The allegations are explosive. But the New York Times uncovered no evidence directly proving Schenck's claims.

""Mr. Schenck was not present at the meal and has no written record of his conversation with Mrs. Wright,"" the Times reported.

There is, however, circumstantial evidence, such as vague emails and secondhand conversations, that would suggest Schenck had insider information, but none of it proves Alito leaked the ruling of the case.

Wright, in fact, has denied either receiving or passing along information related to any Supreme Court case.

""Being a friend or having a friendly relationship with a justice, you know that they don’t ever tell you about cases. They aren’t allowed to,"" Wright told the Times. ""Nor would I ask. There has never been a time in all my years that a justice or a justice’s spouse told me anything about a decision.""

In another interview with CNN, Wright called Schenck's allegations ""patently not true,"" declaring that ""this whole thing is unbelievably misconstrued.""

Rather telling is the fact that someone apparently had been shopping Schenck's claims around different media outlets, and Politico — which published the leaked opinion overturning Roe v. Wade — was unable to verify Schenck's claims. The outlet thus refused to run the story.

Politico reported:

POLITICO spent several months attempting to corroborate Schenck’s claim published Saturday in The Times of a leak about the Hobby Lobby decision but was unable to locate anyone who heard about the decision directly from either Alito or his wife before its release at the end of June 2014.

What did Alito say?

Alito unequivocally denied leaking the outcome of the Hobby Lobby ruling.

""The allegation that the Wrights were told the outcome of the decision in the Hobby Lobby case, or the authorship of the opinion of the Court, by me or my wife is completely false,” Alito said in a statement.

“My wife and I became acquainted with the Wrights some years ago because of their strong support for the Supreme Court Historical Society, and since then, we have had a casual and purely social relationship. I never detected any effort on the part of the Wrights to obtain confidential information or to influence anything that I did in either an official or private capacity, and I would have strongly objected if they had done so. I have no knowledge of any project that they allegedly undertook for ‘Faith and Action,’ ‘Faith and Liberty,’ or any similar group, and I would be shocked and offended if those allegations are true,"" the statement added.

The person who leaked the opinion this May has yet to be caught despite an investigation.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/alito-accused-leaking-hobby-lobby-case,2022-11-21
"'All we can do is keep praying': Britney Spears' father gives first interview in a decade, believes controversial conservatorship may have kept pop star alive","Jamie Spears, the father of Britney Spears, gave his first interview in more than a decade. In the rare interview, the father of the pop music star weighed in on his daughter's conservatorship and the #FreeBritney movement.

The elder Spears told the Daily Mail, ""Not everybody's going to agree with me. It's been one hell of a time. But I love my daughter with all my heart and soul. Where would Britney be right now without that conservatorship? And I don't know if she'd be alive.""

On Jan. 3, 2008, Spears was transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after she refused to turn over her two sons to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. Police believe that Spears was under the influence of an unidentified substance.

Spears was then involuntarily committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for treatment and evaluation during a 72-hour emergency hold, known as a 5150.

Spears was placed under a conservatorship for 13 years – which gave her father complete control of her assets.

Spears' father claimed that the iconic pop star was ""broke"" at the time despite being one of the most successful entertainers of all-time.

""She had no money whatsoever,"" the 70-year-old Spears said. ""The conservatorship set a resource where she could get back financially. And, you know, we worked — and she worked — and she got herself straight up financially. ... The conservatorship allowed the finances to be better.""

""My understanding of a conservatorship is to help someone regain their life and return back to society, and to be able to live normally,"" he explained. ""I want to say that I made a difference. There were a few people behind me that really helped bring it to a point where we could help her.""

Speaking of criticisms of him through the #FreeBritney movement by her massive fanbase, Spears said, ""All I can say is that most people don't have a clue what the truth is. Her lawyer doesn't have a clue what the truth is. The media has not heard the truth. They've heard the allegations from Britney.""

He added, ""I don't mind taking that beating because I know it's not true, and because I don't want to start something else. For my daughter to end up going further down the hole than she had been.""

Federline got custody of their two children during the drama. Spears is still estranged from her two teenage sons as well as her father.

""For protecting her, and also protecting the kids, conservatorship was a great tool,"" Spears told interviewer Daphne Barak. ""Without it, I don’t think she would have got the kids back.""

Spears misses his grandsons, but is keeping the faith that the family can be reunited.

""I miss my two boys really, really bad,"" he said. ""I do. You know, we were very, very close. They were around that age where you could start having a good time with them. But they were developing a mind of their own. God makes things happen for a reason. I don't know what that reason is but it's been a tough three years without them. The family's a mess. All we can do is keep praying.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/all-we-can-do-is-keep-praying-britney-spears-father-gives-first-interview-in-a-decade-believes-controversial-conservatorship-may-have-kept-pop-star-alive,2022-12-19
"American, Gadsden flags forcibly removed from college dorm, even as pride flags reportedly remain: Video","Two American college students were outraged the other day when school officials forcibly removed the patriotic flags that they had hung outside their dorm room, even as pride flags outside other dorm rooms were left unmolested.



On Monday, the Twitter account Libs of TikTok shared a video, filmed by one of the unnamed students, showing a disgruntled woman climbing a ladder to remove the flags from outside a dorm room at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. Though some of the dialogue on the video is difficult to hear, the woman who removed the flags told the objecting students that they had already been warned about the flags.

""You were directed to take it down,"" the woman said.

The young men then continued to protest the removal of the two flags — a Gadsden ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag and an American flag with colors indicating support for first responders — which they had hung outside their dorm window. Eventually, the frustrated woman ordered them to stop filming her.

""[P]ut your phone away,"" she demanded.

The students, however, refused to comply.

""Absolutely not,"" one student stated. ""I have every right to record, and you know that. This is America. We have the First Amendment right to freedom of speech, freedom of expression. I don’t know why you’re taking our flags down.""

When the students continued to argue, the woman directed them to take their grievances to the dean.

At one point in the video, the camera panned to an older woman who is reportedly the director of housing operations. Her role in the incident is unclear, but she appeared to approve of the flag removal process.

The woman who removed the flags then attempted to confiscate them and told the students they could retrieve them from the dean's office. One of the students took the flags back though, claiming they were his property since he had purchased them.

""This is stealing,"" he told her.

Despite the aggressive removal of the students' patriotic flags, reports indicate that Trinity has permitted other flags to fly on campus. According to a screenshot of an old tweet ostensibly issued by the college itself, Trinity College has openly displayed pride flags on campus in the past. In fact, the students on the video alleged that other flags in the vicinity remained on display, even as their patriotic flags were removed. Libs of TikTok indicated in the tweet that those other flags were pride flags.

The seemingly lopsided enforcement infuriated the students.

""[Other students are] being asked, but ours are being ripped off,"" one of the students asserted.

When reached for comment, one Trinity spokesperson admitted that the rules have been enforced unevenly.

""This event has highlighted the need for more consistent enforcement of handbook rules, and the college is working with the student body to create awareness and compliance,"" a statement from the school reads. ""The dean of student life is addressing the issue with the entire student body to ensure compliance with the handbook and has reiterated the rule to the student body in a communication this week. The dean’s office will directly work with students for more consistent enforcement.""

The Daily Caller received a similar statement from Kristen Cole, a senior director of media relations at Trinity College.

The Trinity student handbook does forbid ""objects of any type (including liquid)"" from being ""thrown, dropped, pushed out of, placed outside of, or allowed to fall from any residential building window.""

The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech organization, sent the school a letter on Tuesday to inquire about the incident.

""[W]hile [Trinity] may impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on the display of flags and other expressive material on campus,"" FIRE wrote, ""the free speech promises it makes to students preclude it from selectively enforcing those policies based on the viewpoint expressed.""

Amish man runs horse and buggy into police car after low speed chase. He was allegedly asleep with a Bud Light can next to him.,"An Amish man was arrested after he ran his horse and buggy into a police car and was allegedly found asleep next to a Bud Light can.

The incident unfolded in Orwell, Ohio, at about 2:30 in the morning on Saturday.

Police responded to emergency calls about a horse and buggy that was being driven erratically.

Video from the body camera of Ashtabula Sheriff Deputy Mike Talbert, the responding officer, was obtained by WKYC-TV.

The video shows Talbert trying to get the horse and buggy to pull over.

“There is a Bud Light can sitting in there, and he’s passed cleaned out,” Talbert says on the video. “We got a drunk Amish guy passed out in a buggy.”

Some reports said the buggy was driving on the wrong side of the road.

“He just turned eastbound on Bogue, and I yelled at the guy when he rode by,” Talbert said at another point of the video. “There is a Bud Light can sitting in the damn buggy, and I hit the side of the buggy and hollered at the guy. He’s passed clean out. He’s slumped over.""



At one point, the officer tells dispatchers that he is able to stop the buggy, but he corrects himself soon after.

“I have it stopped. Nope, disregard. He just rammed it into my car,” Talbert said

The video shows the buggy hitting the police cruiser. The driver was ejected from the buggy in the collision.

The man was identified as Nathan Miller. He refused a field sobriety test, but he later registered a .063% on a breathalyzer.

Miller was arrested on a charge of operating a vehicle while intoxicated. He also suffered a minor injury. The officer and the horse were uninjured.

Ashtabula Sheriff William Niemi said it was unusual to have that kind of traffic stop.

"'An unnecessary crisis': Pennsylvania Republicans raise alarm after more than 240,000 unverified ballots sent to voters who aren't required to produce IDs","Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania expressed concern this week about a possible strain on the integrity of elections in the state. In an Oct. 25 letter to acting Secretary of the Commonwealth Leigh Chapman, 15 Republican legislators noted that over 240,000 ballots have been sent out to voters whose identities have not been verified.

Unverified ballots and ID mismatches

According to Verity Vote, a group committed to analyzing issues of election integrity, Pennsylvania not only allows people to vote without IDs but allows people to register to vote without verification of identity or residency.

Verity Vote noted that a 2018 directive from the Pennsylvania Department of State ""instructed counties to register applicants even if the applicant provided invalid identification or no identification."" This directive has proved problematic.

In their letter to Chapman, which relies in part on information included in Verity Vote's Monday report, Republican lawmakers wrote, ""Due to the 2018 Directive from your office instructing counties to register voters without verification of identity, the need to verify the identity and eligibility of mail and absentee ballot applicants is even more critical to the integrity of our elections.""

The lawmakers noted that in a September 14 state government committee hearing, Deputy Secretary Jonathan Marks testified that counties are responsible for ID verification prior to counting a ballot. However, the Pennsylvania Department of State was said to have later notified counties that ID verification takes place before a ballot is sent to an applicant.

As a result of this conflicting information about verification responsibility, ""conscientious election workers could unknowingly accept and count ballots for which no verification had ever occurred.""

The lawmakers claimed that the 240,000-plus unverified ballots constitute a ""staggering"" amount that ""must be set aside and not counted for the 2022 General Election unless the voter produces ID.""



The Republicans requested that the Department of State ""immediately issue a directive to all counties informing them of the requirement to set those ballots aside and not pre-canvass, canvass, or count any of them unless and until the applicant provides a valid form of identification.""

It is not acceptable, the lawmakers contended, that counties ""fix"" non-matching identification.

Granted the possible severity of the threat to the election's integrity, the legislature must be provided ""with a complete list of all the names and voter IDs for all the applications"" where SSN4 identifiers provided did not match with the Social Security Administration's records.

Furthermore, they asked that the relevant guidance be corrected to reflect Marks' testimony or account for ""the false information provided under oath.""

'An unnecessary crisis'

Verity Vote stated that the ""impact of this issue on the 2022 General Election cannot be overstated ... The ramification of this defective process is that tens of thousands of people would have to show up at a county election office to present ID to comply with the law rather than the trivial process of correcting at the time of entry.""

The report accused the Department of State of creating ""an unnecessary crisis by deferring verification,"" pushing ""this responsibility onto county election officials [and] making it nearly impossibly to verify the identity of the ballot requester.""

Among the consequences Verity Vote said can be expected are: the rejection of tens of thousands of ballots; the acceptance of tens of thousands of unverified ballots in contravention of the law; and litigation of this policy, potentially delaying the final results.

Just the News reported that Phill Kline, director of the Amistad Project, an election integrity nonprofit, underscored how problems that impacted the 2020 presidential election are now being repeated.

""The left has refused to abide by common-sense procedures, laws, and rules that make it easy for legitimate voters to vote and difficult for fraudulent voters and people to commit fraud,"" said Kline.

State Rep. Frank Ryan (R), one of the 15 Republicans who wrote to Chapman, told the Daily Signal that a 2019 state audit indicated the secretary of the commonwealth's office was ""uncooperative and had an unreliable system for keeping election records under its Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors system.""

Ryan said, ""No one is saying this determines who wins and loses ... We are just saying the database is so broken it needs to be fixed.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/an-unnecessary-crisis-pennsylvania-republicans-raise-alarm-after-more-than-240000-unverified-ballots-sent-to-voters-who-arent-required-to-produce-ids,2022-10-28
Suspended woke prosecutor accuses Gov. Ron DeSantis of 'trying to overthrow democracy' with 'unconstitutional' action,"Andrew Warren, the George Soros-backed prosecutor, is fighting back after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) took the unprecedented step of suspending him.

Warren is the state attorney for Hillsborough County.

What is the background?

DeSantis announced Thursday that he was suspending Warren for ""neglect of duty"" for promising not to enforce state laws on abortion and child sex-change operations.

""When you flagrantly violate your oath of office, when you make yourself above the law, you have violated your duty, you have neglected your duty, and you are displaying a lack of competence to be able to perform those duties, and so today, we are suspending State Attorney Andrew Warren, effective immediately,"" DeSantis said at a press conference.

In suspending the Democratic prosecutor, DeSantis cited his authority under Article IV, Section 7 of the Florida state constitution.

How did Warren respond?

Warren addressed his suspension at a press conference on an unrelated topic, characterizing DeSantis' decision as undermining democracy.

""People need to understand this isn’t the governor trying to suspend the one elected official,"" Warren said. ""This is the governor trying to overthrow democracy here in Hillsborough County.""

To be fair, Warren is duly elected. He won election to his office in 2016 and won re-election in 2020 by a margin of nearly 50,000 votes, according to WTSP-TV.



At the time of the press conference, Warren said he had not yet read the official order suspending him, but said he ""heard it contains a lot of conjecture and lies.""

""I woke up to do my job today, and that’s exactly what I did,"" Warren said. ""Just based on the governor’s track record with unconstitutional orders, I have a feeling that this is going to be just as unconstitutional.""

Warren, however, did not explain what is unconstitutional about DeSantis' order. That did not stop him from accusing DeSantis of engaging in a politically motivated decision meant to boost his presidential aspirations.

""I think the governor is trying to make a good impression on the Iowa caucus voters,"" Warren accused.

And although he has vowed not to follow state laws, Warren defended himself from charges levied by DeSantis. According to Warren, he has not yet had a case involving abortion or child sex-change operations come to his office.

""We’ve had none. None of those cases have been brought to us. We’re not anticipating those cases being brought to us,"" Warren said. ""You should go ask the sheriff whether he has had those cases and whether they’re investigating arresting people for that, because when they do, and they bring us a case, we’ll evaluate it.""

DeSantis appointed Hillsborough County Court Judge Susan Lopez to serve as Warren's replacement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/andrew-warren-responds-desantis-suspension,2022-08-05
Anonymous Democrats go behind Sen. Dianne Feinstein's back to complain about her mental fitness,"Democrats in Congress are worried that California Sen. Dianne Feinstein is too old to do her job, and they're leaking their concerns to the media.

""It's bad, and it's getting worse,"" said one Democratic senator, who requested anonymity in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle to complain about their colleague. The senator related how Feinstein has difficulty keeping up with conversations and discussions.

Four U.S. senators, three former Feinstein staffers, and one California Democratic member of Congress spoke to the paper about Feinstein's reportedly declining memory and questionable mental fitness for office. These individuals say that at 88 years old, Feinstein is entirely dependent on her staff doing most of the work required to represent 40 million Californians in the Senate.

While she has good days, when she appears to be in command of herself and the issues — Democrats pointed to her performance during Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation hearings — there are bad days, when Feinstein reportedly does not even recognize some of her long-term colleagues.

One of the lawmakers recounted a recent conversation in which they had to reintroduce themselves to Feinstein several times, despite working with her for 15 years. The conversation reportedly prompted this lawmaker to ask colleagues if it were possible to stage an intervention with Feinstein and have her retire before 2024, when her current term expires.

“I have worked with her for a long time and long enough to know what she was like just a few years ago: always in command, always in charge, on top of the details, basically couldn’t resist a conversation where she was driving some bill or some idea. All of that is gone,” the lawmaker said. “She was an intellectual and political force not that long ago, and that’s why my encounter with her was so jarring. Because there was just no trace of that.”

“There’s a joke on the Hill, we’ve got a great junior senator in Alex Padilla and an experienced staff in Feinstein’s office,” said a staffer for a California Democrat.

Each of the people who gave statements to the Chronicle about Feinstein's mental acuity said they had enormous respect for the senator but wished to go behind her back anonymously to maintain their relationships with her and their mutual friends and colleagues.

They also expressed sympathy for Feinstein, who lost her husband Richard Blum to cancer last year.

Feinstein declined an interview with the Chronicle, but her office provided a written statement to the paper.

“The last year has been extremely painful and distracting for me, flying back and forth to visit my dying husband who passed just a few weeks ago,” she said. “But there’s no question I’m still serving and delivering for the people of California, and I’ll put my record up against anyone’s.”

First elected to the Senate in 1992, the 88-year-old Democrat is both the oldest sitting senator and the longest-serving U.S. senator from California. In January 2021, she filed initial paperwork with the Federal Election Commission needed to seek re-election again in 2024, when she will be 91.

Feinstein in recent years has come under fire from some progressive Democrats who believe she is not sufficiently left-wing to represent California. When she was running for re-election in 2018, Feinstein lost the endorsement of the California Democratic Party's executive board to primary challenger state Sen. Keven de León, but she went on to win the state's jungle primary and coast to re-election.

In 2020, she surprised and angered Democrats by thanking Republicans for the way they conducted Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings, even hugging Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). And in January 2021, Feinstein outraged progressives by refusing to join the chorus of hypocritical Democrats demanding an end to the Senate filibuster to ram President Joe Biden's agenda through Congress. Left-wing activists accused Feinstein of being out of touch with the party grassroots and demanded that she resign.



However, Democrats who spoke to the Chronicle on the record defended Feinstein against accusations that she's mentally unfit.

“I’ve heard some of the same concerns,” said junior California Senator Alex Padilla, ""but as someone who sees her multiple times a week, including on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I can tell you she’s still doing the job and doing it well.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), in a statement, said she has not noticed any decline in Feinstein's mental capabilities and applauded the senator for her recent work on the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and the Supreme Court confirmation.

“Senator Feinstein is a workhorse for the people of California and a respected leader among her colleagues in the Senate,” Pelosi said. “She is constantly traveling between California and the Capitol, working relentlessly to ensure Californians’ needs are met and voices are heard.”

Pelosi, 82, added it is ""unconscionable that, just weeks after losing her beloved husband of more than four decades and after decades of outstanding leadership to our City and State, she is being subjected to these ridiculous attacks that are beneath the dignity in which she has led and the esteem in which she is held.”

Anthony Fauci says he will leave the White House if Donald Trump becomes president in 2024,"Dr. Anthony Fauci said that he intends to resign his post as the White House chief medical adviser if former President Donald Trump attains the presidency once again in 2024.

Implying that the Trump administration mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic, Fauci took the opportunity to get in some jabs while on national television, Fox News reported.

While speaking with Jim Acosta on CNN Sunday evening, Fauci laughed off the suggestion that he would remain in his post should Trump return as president, Newsweek reported.

Fauci said, “If you look at the history of what the response was during the administration, I think, you know, at best, you can say it wasn’t optimal. And I think, just, history will speak for itself about that.”

When Acosta clarified that Fauci, in fact, meant that he would not return to his post in a second Trump administration, Fauci said, “Right. For sure, yeah.”

However, it is no secret that Trump and Fauci frequently clashed during the first year of the COVID pandemic. They found themselves at odds when it came to hydroxychloroquine, testing strategies, when to reopen businesses, instituting travel restrictions from China, and many more issues.

On a campaign conference call in October 2020, just days before the presidential election, Trump said, “People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots, these people. Every time he goes on TV, there’s a bomb, but there’s a bigger bomb if you fire him.”

Trump has not committed to running for president in 2024 but has very publicly flirted with the possibility of running once more to seek the Republican Party’s nomination for president.

In February at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump suggested that the Democratic Party will soon experience a series of high-profile losses at the national level.

He said, “They’re going to find out the hard way starting November 8 and even more so starting November 2024.”

In 2021, after Joe Biden entered the White House, Fauci said that it was “liberating” to work under the new president.

Fauci said, “I can tell you I take no pleasure at all being in a situation of contradicting the president, so it was really something that you didn’t feel you could actually say something and there wouldn’t be any repercussions about it.”

He continued, “The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what the evidence and science is, and let the science speak – it is somewhat of a liberating feeling.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/anthony-fauci-says-he-will-leave-the-white-house-if-donald-trump-becomes-president-in-2024,2022-05-16
"Anti-transgenderism school board member under fire after 800 residents call for his removal, petition for $500,000 special election","A California school board member faced relentless backlash from the community after he spoke out against transgenderism in schools, the Daily Caller reported.



Approximately 800 community members rallied together and signed a petition to force a special election to oust Kenneth Enney, a Paso Robles Joint Unified School District trustee and retired U.S. Marine Corps intelligence officer.

Enney, who was appointed to the seat in October, posted in a private group on Facebook that he stands against transgenderism and gender mutilation being taught in schools. He added that the ideology being pushed in classrooms attempts to “recruit and convert children.”

“You have a lot of people that have left the school district and a lot of it is over the progressive policies, basically the feeling that the LGBTQ agenda is being shoved down their throats,” Enney told the DCNF. “I basically made a stand and said I don’t have anything against the gay lifestyle or gay marriage. I have friends who are gay, I’m accepting of that. I honestly don’t understand the bi lifestyle or the queer lifestyle. So I guess I’m tolerant of that. But with transgenderism, I think what I reject is that you’re asking people to participate in a lie, because you can’t be something [you’re] not.”

The Paso Robles residents only need 455 valid signatures to trigger a special election for Enney’s position; however, the election would cost the school district roughly $500,000, KSBY reported.

Dr. Curt Dubost, Paso Robles Joint Unified School District Superintendent, noted that the district has already put money aside to conduct the election.

“When we were advised of this probability, we immediately reserved money to cover it, so it does not come from any existing project or any other assigned budget,” Dubost stated. “It comes from our reserves.”

The district and county superintendents pressured Enney to resign and retract his comments against trans ideology. He refused both of their requests.

The petition against Enney was launched on November 10 by Carey Alvord-Schof, an educator at the school district.

“We were just really disappointed in the choice that they had made because we felt that it was a person with more extremist views than what is appropriate for Paso Robles and our school district,” Alvord-Schof stated.

“My background [is] 25 years in the Marine Corps,” Enney told the DCNF. “I used to joke when I was on active duty that they don’t pay me enough to compromise my principles. I’m not getting paid to do this job. I really don’t see myself losing that much. I think it’s more important to make a stand and that’s the other reason why I think the teachers union is going to continue to come after me because they don’t want anybody that’s gonna make a stand. You gotta start somewhere. I may lose the special election. I’m certainly not going to take back what I said, I’m sorry, I’m certainly not gonna resign.”

Gary Lehrer, a member of the San Luis Obispo County Republican Party, reported that he plans to look into the legality of the petition started by Alvord-Schof. In response, Lehrer launched a petition in support of Enney’s position on the board.

“The legality surrounding the effort to terminate his position runs counter to the U.S. Constitution and the petition itself violates law as it is incorrectly worded,” Lehrer told the DCNF. “Frankly I was hoping to set an example to school districts across the nation how to fight against progressives trying to dominate school boards.”

AOC refuses to endorse President Joe Biden in 2024 election,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) refused to endorse President Joe Biden in the 2024 presidential election when asked on Sunday. AOC nervously laughed off the question of supporting her political party's own president and quickly changed the topic.

During an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday morning, host Dana Bash asked Ocasio-Cortez if she would support Biden in the 2024 presidential election.

""You know, if the president chooses to run again in 2024 – I mean, first of all, I’m focused on winning this majority right now. And preserving a majority this year in 2022,"" Ocasio-Cortez changed the subject while she laughed uncomfortably. ""We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. But I think if the president has a vision, then that’s something we’re all certainly willing to entertain and examine when the time comes.""

Bash shot back, That's not a yes.""

AOC trepidatiously replied, ""Yeah, you know, I think we should endorse…when we get to it.""

Ocasio-Cortez shifted into damage control mode and said, ""But I believe that the president has been doing a very good job so far.""

""And, you know, should he run again, I think that I — you know, I think it’s — we’ll take a look at it,"" AOC responded while she belted out another tense chuckle. ""But right now we need to focus on winning a majority instead of a presidential election.""

In the 2020 Democratic primary, Ocasio-Cortez had endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) over Biden.

Biden – who is already the oldest sitting president in American history – will be 82 years old by inauguration if he wins re-election in 2024.



In April, there was a report that Biden was running for re-election in 2024.

A New York Times report published on Saturday revealed that there are 50 ""frustrated Democratic officials, members of Congress and voters"" who ""expressed doubts about the president’s ability to rescue his reeling party and take the fight to Republicans.""

""Midway through the 2022 primary season, many Democratic lawmakers and party officials are venting their frustrations with President Biden’s struggle to advance the bulk of his agenda, doubting his ability to rescue the party from a predicted midterm trouncing and increasingly viewing him as an anchor that should be cut loose in 2024,"" the report stated.

The Times said there are Democrats across the country who ""are quietly worrying about Mr. Biden’s leadership, his age and his capability to take the fight to former President Donald J. Trump a second time.""

David Axelrod – the chief strategist for Barack Obama’s two winning presidential campaigns – warned that Biden's age is a major factor.

""The presidency is a monstrously taxing job and the stark reality is the president would be closer to 90 than 80 at the end of a second term, and that would be a major issue,"" Axelrod told the New Yotk Times.

Democrats are reportedly ""alarmed about Republicans' rising strength and extraordinarily pessimistic about an immediate path forward.""

Steve Simeonidis – a Democratic National Committee member from Miami – urged Biden to ""announce his intent not to seek re-election in '24 right after the midterms.""

More than a dozen Democrats arrested at abortion rights protest in DC; AOC pretended to be dragged away in handcuffs,"Several Democratic lawmakers were arrested at an abortion rights protest outside the Capitol on Tuesday as demonstrators railed against the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

""Squad"" members Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and other Democrats including Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), Cori Bush (D-Mo.), Alma Adams (D-N.C.), Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), and Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) were among those escorted away from the demonstration by police, The Hill reported.

According to police, the protest outside the U.S. Supreme Court building illegally obstructed traffic.

At 1:18 p.m., U.S. Capitol police tweeted that demonstrators were ""starting to block First Street, NE.""

""It is against the law to block traffic, so officers are going to give our standard three warnings before they start making arrests,"" police said.

Two minutes later the police said they started making arrests after warning the demonstrators to ""get out of the street.""

By 1:35 p.m. the protest was cleared. Capitol Police said a total of 34 arrests were made for crowding, obstructing, or incommoding, including 16 members of Congress.

Axios later reported that 17 lawmakers were arrested. They are:

Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.),

Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.)

Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.)

Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.)

Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.)

Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.)

Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.)

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.)

Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas)

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.)

Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.)

Video posted on Twitter showed police officers escorting lawmakers away from the demonstration.

As Ocasio-Cortez was taken away by police, she held her hands behind her back as if she was handcuffed, but she was not. Video shows her raising her fist in defiant salute to the other protesters.

Some of the Democrats issued statements after their arrest.

""There is no democracy if women do not have control over their own bodies and decisions about their own health, including reproductive care,"" Maloney said.

A spokesman for Pressley told The Hill that the congresswoman participated in a protest against the ""cruel and callous decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and strip away abortion rights for everyone who calls America home.""

Speier, who reportedly led the protest, tweeted she was, ""Proud to march with my Democratic colleagues including ⁦⁦@DemWomenCaucus⁩ members, and get arrested for women’s rights, abortion rights, the rights for people to control their own bodies and the future and our democracy!""





In June, the Supreme Court overruled its abortion precedents in the landmark Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, which said the Constitution does not protect the right to abortion. It was an unambiguous victory for the pro-life movement in America, which had campaigned and peacefully protested for Roe to be overturned in Washington D.C. for nearly 50 years without incident.

"AOC vilifies Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision as 'illegitimate,' calls for protests alongside radical communist leader who wants to 'overthrow' the American system","The Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on Friday morning. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) railed against the Supreme Court's decision with fellow pro-abortion activists and a Revolutionary Communist outside the Supreme Court.

Ocasio-Cortez was chanting that the Supreme Court's decision is ""illegitimate"" along with the pro-abortion crowd, as seen in a video taken by TPUSA contributor Drew Hernandez.

AOC was leading the chants along with Sunsara Taylor – a leader in the Revolutionary Communist Party.

Taylor called the Roe v. Wade overruling an ""atrocity"" and the ""shattering of lives."" She claimed that the decision would usher in the ""unleashing of the state to hunt women down and treat their wombs like sites of surveillance.""

The Revolutionary Communist Party called for ""fury into the streets"" following the overruling.



""The fascist Supreme Court just overturned #RoeVWade & stripped women of their legal status as full human beings,"" the radical group wrote on Twitter. ""This court, & the whole system, are ILLEGITIMATE!!! Bring your fury into the streets & don't stop until this decision is reversed! And get organized for REVOLUTION!""

InfluenceWatch describes the Revolutionary Communist Party as a ""radical-left political party in the United States that seeks to overthrow the government and implement a socialist system of government.""

The RCP website states: ""Its members are united in their profound desire for a radically different and better world, and their understanding of the need for revolution to get to that world. They have dedicated themselves wholeheartedly to revolution, and on the basis of that they channel their individual abilities and passions to the cause and needs of this revolution.""

Bob Avakian – the party's chairman and a Maoist – declared, ""Only through the revolution to overthrow this system, and uproot all the relations of exploitation and oppression that are embodied in this system, will it be possible to finally end the fundamental division in which half of humanity is subordinated to and dominated by the other half, and all the brutality and agony bound up with that.""

The Federalist wrote of the Revolutionary Communist Party: ""The RCP has historically played a front and center role in orchestrating violent riots, including the 1992 Los Angeles Rodney King Riots and the 2014 Ferguson riots, where the Daily Beast called them 'the communist agitators trying to ignite Ferguson.'""

The outlet added, ""The party’s constitution says they openly seek, 'a revolution that overthrows this system and the capitalist-imperialist class that embodies and runs it—a revolution that will immediately establish a new power.'""

Taylor has made calls for a ""revolution"" to ""overthrow"" the ""oppressive"" American system numerous times on Twitter.

Pro-abortion group Rise Up 4 Abortion – which Taylor co-founded in January – bragged, ""AOC joined us in the streets to call out this decision for what it is ILLEGITIMATE This court is Illegitimate and this decision must not stand.""

Mary Margaret Olohan – a D.C. correspondent for the Daily Wire – asked Ocasio-Cortez if she would condemn any violence by pro-abortion groups. However, AOC refused to answer the question.



Ocasio-Cortez also claimed that people would die because of the Supreme Court decision.



""Overturning Roe and outlawing abortions will never make them go away,"" AOC tweeted. ""It only makes them more dangerous, especially for the poor + marginalized.""

""People will die because of this decision,"" she asserted. ""And we will never stop until abortion rights are restored in the United States of America.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-roe-v-wade-abortion-overturned,2022-06-24
Reporter tries to connect gas prices and race — but Energy Secretary Granholm refuses to buy it,"Reporter April Ryan tried to argue on Monday that ""urban areas"" are disproportionately impacted by the gas price crisis and even suggested that race played a role.

But not even Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm bought it.

What happened?

At the White House press briefing, Ryan claimed without evidence that urban communities did not benefit from government action when gas prices were sky-high last year.

""When the president did release the strategic oil reserves .... there were some communities that felt the relief. Other communities did not, particularly those in urban areas; there was price gouging, etc.,"" Ryan began. ""Could you explain why there was such a difference in communities with gas prices in one community versus the other?



In response, Granholm noted that there was a difference — but in rural communities.

""If you’re not near a refinery, that’s another reason why the transportation costs are tacked on at the pump,"" she said. ""So you’re seeing, for example, when refineries go down in regions, then the prices go up in those regions much more than they would nationwide.""

01/23/23: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

Not satisfied, Ryan then explicitly invoked race.

""But specifically, the urban areas. Because there was still a big pinch in urban areas with these gas prices when the outlying communities, particularly majority white communities, were seeing the drop to $3, and many of these urban areas were seeing $4 and $5 gas prices. Could you speak to that?"" she followed up.

Granholm, however, did not buy the purported connection.

The secretary informed Ryan that most gas stations are owned by individuals and reiterated that price gouging is illegal. But it was difficult for Granholm to give a substantive response because Ryan made her claims without supporting evidence.

Anything else?

Earlier in the briefing, a reporter confronted Granholm about the Biden administration's double standard on gas prices. When they were high last year, Biden blamed Russia. But he took credit when they decreased.

With gas prices increasing again, the reporter asked, ""The president took credit for the prices coming down. ... Does the president get credit for the price of gas going up?""

Granholm responded that ""obviously"" the price increase is ""based upon international and climate events.""

"Ariana Grande's brother attacked and mugged in New York City, robbers take his iPhone and Louis Vuitton bag","The brother of singer Ariana Grande was mugged in New York City, and the robbers ran off with his Louis Vuitton bag and iPhone before they were caught by police.

Frankie Grande, 39, was walking along Eighth Avenue near Times Square at about 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday when two assailants struck him in the head from behind. One was carrying an imitation gun, and the other was wielding a razor blade.

Grande said they robbed him of his Louis Vuitton bag, AirPods, his iPhone 14 Pro, some sunglasses, and his wallet, which contained a bank card. Police said he sustained a minor injury but refused medical attention.

WABC-TV reported that the two suspects were apprehended after trying to use the bank card at a smoke shop near the site of the robbery, according to police.

One suspect is 17 years old, and the other is 13 years old.

The two suspects were charged with robbery, grand larceny, unlawful use of a credit card, assault, criminal possession of a weapon, criminal possession of stolen property, menacing, and harassment.

The younger suspect was also charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance.

One merchant local to the area told the New York Post that the area had become ""scary at times"" with crime, including drug deals.

Grande issued a brief message to his fans on Instagram about the incident.

""Thank you for all of your prayers,"" he wrote. ""I am so thankful to be safe and healing. Keep shining bright and stay safe out there.""

In May, Ariana Grande joined other performers in an ad campaign with Planned Parenthood to advocate for abortion ahead of the midterm elections.

Arizona border hospital faces financial crisis after treating so many illegal immigrant patients: 'Not a sustainable model',"A hospital near Arizona's southern border is facing a financial crisis on account of the thousands of illegal immigrants crossing into the United States, and its president and CEO is now taking to the media to help draw attention to the issue since so many governmental leaders have refused to address it.

Dr. Robert Transchel, who specializes in public health, is the president and CEO of Yuma Regional Medical Center, the only hospital within 60 miles of the border town of Yuma, Arizona. On Sunday, Transchel appeared with Rachel Campos-Duffy on ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" to discuss the financial strain the hospital has been under for at least the last 12 months.

""We tracked our uncompensated care for a period of over six months,"" Transchel said, ""and we calculated that we've provided over $20 million in uncompensated care to the migrants crossing the border.""

Not only are many patients not paying for the care they receive, Transchel explained, but the hospital has had to increase staff to keep pace with the increased patient load. The Epoch Times reported that Yuma Regional treated 4,400 more patients last year than it had the year before.

Some illegal immigrants also require specialized care that Yuma Regional cannot provide, which means the hospital must then absorb the cost of transporting those patients, sometimes by ""air ambulance,"" to other facilities.

""So that $20 million is just the care that we've provided that we're not compensated [for],"" he said. ""The other infrastructure that we've had to add is uncompensated as well, obviously.""

Transchel claimed that he and other hospital executives have reached out to various political leaders at the local, state, and federal levels, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, all to no avail. ""Everybody is sympathetic, and everybody lends a listening ear, but nobody has a solution,"" Transchel said.

Transchel also told Campos-Duffy that while illegal immigrants often receive free medical treatment, local residents in Arizona must pay for all of the services they receive and sometimes even have their care delayed when the hospital is overrun with migrant patients.

""We would have to delay some of the planned inductions for our [pregnant] residents because of that,"" Transchel previously told Fox News.

Despite the looming crisis, Transchel insisted that the hospital is financially solvent — for now. ""We're fine today, and we'll be fine tomorrow,"" he said. ""The problem is, if this continues, it's going to build up, and it's going to continue to be a problem.""

""[W]e just don't have a payer source for those individuals,"" Transchel stated. ""It's not a sustainable model to have these continued rising expenses without a revenue source to offset that.""

Arizona election officials report issues with vote-counting machines at 20% of polling locations in Maricopa County,"Maricopa County Board of Supervisors chairman Bill Gates reported on Tuesday morning that approximately 20% of the voting centers in Arizona's largest county are experiencing issues with vote-counting tabulators.



""About 20% of the locations out there where there's an issue with the tabulator where some of the ballots that after people have voted them, they try and run them through the tabulator and they're not going through,"" Gates stated.

Gates stated that if the tabulator does not accept a ballot, voters can place their ballots inside a ""secure box,"" and they will be manually counted in the evening at a central counting location. A majority of Arizona counties tabulate ballots this way, Gates added.



""This will function much like early voting functions, in that we would get your ballot back, once we've signature-verified it, we would send it to our central tabulators,"" Gates said. ""Ballots that are [at the central location] will already be signature-verified, so we won't need to confirm identity but we will central-tabulate them.""

Voters across the county took to social media to report tabulator malfunctions at multiple Maricopa County locations. Residents captured videos of election workers announcing issues with the vote-counting machines.

""We have two tabulators. One of the tabulators is not working,"" an election worker at one Maricopa voting center explained to voters waiting in line to cast their ballots. ""The other tabulator is taking about 75% successful. So, 25% of them are being misread. And it could be a printer issue, or it could be the tabulator itself. So, when it's misread, you have an option to put it into what's called box three, and it gets read. Whether it goes downtown and gets read manually or whether it gets refed into our tabulator.""

Another video shared on social media captured an election worker explaining how ballots placed into box three will be counted.



""Tonight, a Republican and a Democrat will sit and go through all of the misread ballots all over the county and count them,"" the election worker explained. She added that none of the tabulators at the voting location were working correctly.

""Nothing's working for the last half hour,"" she noted.

According to the elections department, as of Tuesday, there were 2,463,264 active voters in Maricopa County. As of 11 a.m. ET, roughly 44,000 voters had cast their ballots in person.

Katie Hobbs (D), Arizona's current secretary of state and a gubernatorial candidate, refused calls to recuse herself from overseeing the midterm elections.

The tabulator issues in Maricopa County are expected to delay the announcement of the results in the critical gubernatorial race between Democrat Katie Hobbs and Republican Kari Lake and the Senate race between Democrat Mark Kelly and Republican Blake Masters.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-election-officials-report-issues-with-vote-counting-machines-at-20-of-polling-locations-in-maricopa-county,2022-11-08
"Arizona is 'taking action,' defying Biden administration and refusing to take down improvised border wall","On October 14, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation demanded that Arizona remove the double-stacked, razor-wire-wreathed shipping containers that Arizona installed along gaps in the U.S.-Mexico border wall near Yuma as a means to help stem the flow of criminal noncitizens into the country. On Tuesday, Arizona refused.

The BOR, a federal agency under the U.S. Department of the Interior, noted that the Department of Homeland Security as well as Customs and Border Protection had awarded contracts to fill in the gaps of the border area located on BOR lands near Morelos Dam. It indicated additional contracts would soon be awarded.

Jacklynn Gould, the regional director of the BOR, expressed concern about a potential conflict between Arizona, which already got the job done, and prospective contract awardees. She also demanded that the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs ""cease further placement of shipping containers on federal or Indian trust lands.""

Gould stated that the ""unauthorized placement of those containers constitutes a violation of federal law and is a trespass against the United States.""

The Ducey administration placed the containers in order to address the trespass of 2,150,639 illegal aliens into the U.S. so far this year.

The BOR director suggested that the encroachment by DEMA's shipping containers constitutes a ""trespass"" that is ""harming federal lands and resources and impeding Reclamation's ability to perform its mission.""

In a letter sent to the BOR on October 18, DEMA director Allen Clark stated, ""Arizona has not seen any action by the federal government. ... The containers will remain in place until specific details regarding construction are provided.""

Clark wrote, ""The myriad of federal agencies that claim jurisdiction on the southern border but do nothing to prevent the public nuisance caused by illegal immigration and criminal activity that exploits the open border is quite frustrating to those that live, work and recreate on that border and in our state.""

""States like Arizona ... cannot rely on the federal government to ensure its security,"" said Clark.

The letter also contended that the regulation cited by the BOR didn't actually prohibit Arizona's actions and that the state had a guaranteed right, under Article IV, section 4 of the Constitution, to protect and defend itself.

Ducey’s communications director, C.J. Karamargin, indicated that the BOR's demand is a ""nonstarter.""



""We've been hearing for months now that (the Biden administration) was planning to do something and they've done nothing,"" said Karamargin. ""So while they're talking about it and writing letters, we're actually taking action.""

Karamargin also reiterated that the Ducey administration believes ""it's well within Arizona's rights to take this action.""

Ducey tweeted, ""The Border Barrier Mission is working. Arizona is protecting its citizens. Why the federal government won’t is beyond belief.""

Ducey signed a bill into law on June 30 that would finance the construction of a wall along the Arizona border with Mexico.

$335 million in state funds was directed to ""construct and maintain a border fence, purchase or install border security technologies, and to pay associated administrative costs."" An additional $209 million was allocated to fund ""border-related enforcement.""



President Joe Biden halted construction of the southern border wall when he took office. Only after Arizona took the initiative this summer to buttress American sovereignty did the Biden administration announce that it would complete the border wall near the Yuma sector.



In the meantime, the Republican-led state got to work on shoring up border security.

On August 12, Ducey declared, ""Arizona has had enough. We can't wait any longer. The Biden administration's lack of urgency on border security is a dereliction of duty.""

Ducey indicated that he would fortify gaps in the state's border, using 60 double-stacked 8,800-pound shipping containers, all reinforced with concertina wire at the top. DEMA did just that, successfully plugging the gaps in the border barrier with nearly 130 containers, all double-stacked, linked together, and welded shut, filling 3,820 feet of gaps.

The containers cost the state only $6 million.

In September, Ducey said, ""It's our responsibility to protect our citizens and law enforcement from this unprecedented crisis. With the resources and manpower in the right places, our Border Patrol and law enforcement will be better equipped to do their jobs well and prevent cartels from exploiting our communities. That’s exactly what our barrier mission will do.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/arizona-is-taking-action-defying-biden-administration-and-refusing-to-take-down-improvised-border-wall,2022-10-20
"FBI claims only 4.4% of active shooter incidents were thwarted by armed citizens, but real figure may be closer to 14.6%","John R. Lott Jr., the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC), revealed in a report published on Wednesday by RealClearInvestigations that the FBI grossly underestimates (i.e., by an order of more than three) the number of times an armed citizen has thwarted an active shooter event. He suggested that the narrative constructed by the FBI and developed further by the media on the basis of the allegedly skewed data interpretation may be misused for political purposes.

Whereas the FBI reported that 4.4% of active shooter incidents between 2014 and 2021 were precluded or ended by armed citizens, the CPRC has found that the number is actually 14.6%. Lott admits that even this figure may be an underestimate.

Lott attributes the discrepancy to misclassified shootings and to overlooked incidents, both of which have much to do with how an ""active shooter event"" has been defined.



The FBI defines an active shooter as ""an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area."" An ""active shooter incident"" reportedly does not account for incidents the Bureau ""deems related to other criminal activity, such as a robbery or fighting over drug turf.""

Not only does the Bureau's selective definition allegedly mean that the number of active shooter incidents reported between 2014 and 2021 is smaller (252 as opposed to 281), but also that the number of incidents stopped by an armed citizen is smaller (11 as opposed to 41).

One instance cited in Lott's report is the case of 28-year-old Mercedes Perez, who crashed into a parked vehicle on August 11, 2021, and then started firing on the group of people who came over to help. A nearby resident ended her shooting spree.

Woman shot and killed after crashing car; shoots at people trying to check on her, police say YouTube - KENS-5

In another instance cited by the CPRC but ignored by the FBI, a Syracuse property manager ""saved the lives of several individuals"" on August 31, 2021, by shooting Demetris Jackson after Jackson opened fire on a group of people.

It is not just misclassification and inattention that may have resulted in the underestimation of armed citizen responses. The FBI depends upon reports from Texas State University's Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center, reports which allegedly fail to pick up on incidents that do not receive news coverage of the kind that would usually trigger consideration.

""Although collecting such data is fraught with challenges,"" wrote Lott, ""some see a pattern of distortion in the FBI numbers because the numbers almost exclusively go one way, minimizing the life-saving actions of armed citizens.""

While the FBI might include the heroic efforts of armed citizens like Elisjsha Dicken — who stopped a mass shooter at an Indiana mall on July 17 — in this year's tally, the Bureau's alleged refusal to acknowledge other incidents may inadvertently dissuade more Americans from carrying or being prepared.

Lott intimated that this dissuasion, if not intended by the FBI, is nevertheless advanced by the media. He highlighted Indiana University Bloomington law professor Jody Madeira's comments in the Washington Post, printed after Dicken ended Jonathan Sapirman's rampage. Madeira suggested that an armed and prepared citizenry would be ""particularly dangerous ... You'll get this idea that these people [e.g., Dicken] are needed out there to help protect citizens, when in reality that's the job of the police.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/armed-citizens-stop-more-active-shooters-than-otherwise-reported,2022-08-11
"'Asian pig': 19-year-old female charged with hate crime; cops say she punched, kicked man for not giving up seat on NYC subway train, made anti-Asian statements","Police said a 19-year-old female punched and kicked a man for refusing to give up his seat on a New York City subway train last month — and called him an ""Asian pig"" to boot.

Dream Commisso of Manhattan was arrested Tuesday night in East Harlem and booked on charges of assault as a hate crime, aggravated harassment, assault, menacing and harassment, the New York Post reported.

What are the details?

Police said Commisso — along with another woman and a man — were aboard a train from Grand Central to Times Square at 8 p.m. Nov. 19 when they approached a couple and demanded they give up their seats, the Post said.

The 42-year-old man and his 41-year-old female companion — both of whom are Asian — apparently refused to get up, the paper added.

With that, cops said the trio made anti-Asian statements at the man and punched and kicked him, the Post noted, adding that he was left with a small cut.



NBC News, citing police, said Commisso called the victim ""an Asian pig.""

The suspects fled the train at Times Square, the paper added.

The male victim refused medical attention for his minor injury, the Post said.

A public defender is representing Commisso, who's due back in Manhattan Criminal Court Dec. 5, the paper noted.

Second suspect nabbed

Police said Thursday they arrested a second suspect in connection with the alleged incident — an 18-year-old Bronx resident — and that one perp was still on the loose. ""We are confident she will be brought to justice as well,"" police added.

Was that enough? Apparently not...

Police said the trio also are suspected of robbing a delivery person around 11 p.m. the same night in the area of East 105th Street.

NBC News said they approached a 40-year-old man who was riding an electric bicycle and demanded food from him.

He told them he didn't have food in his delivery bag, and the group ""proceeded to rip the bag and strike him in the head,"" police said, according to the network.

Associated Press issues correction after embarrassing mistake attributing comments to a deceased Hispanic radio talk show host,"The Associated Press issued a correction after it was caught in an embarrassing mistake involving comments attributed to a popular Hispanic radio commentator who died in 2020.

The AP cited comments from Martha Flores, a popular radio talk show host in Miami, Florida, in their report documenting Floridians' reactions to a large media company forming to push Democratic talking points among Hispanics.

The mistake was caught by commentator and former Blaze reporter Giancarlo Sopo, who mocked the AP on his Twitter account.

""I'm so confused by this article. The AP says it interviewed Miami Radio host Martha Flores on Wednesday, but she's been dead for two years. How the hell did they pull this off? Séance? An ouija board?"" he joked.

The article said that Flores refused to speak to them directly but that she had spoken at a news conference about the radio station being bought by the left-wing group.

Others piled on after Sopo documented the bizarre claim.

""Mistaken identity?No, it’s a made up lie. @AP reporter talks to dead people,"" said one critic on Twitter.

""Typical example of the journalistic standards of the AP. Claiming that they interviewed someone who is not even alive… and they want you to believe their 'fact checks,'"" responded Christina Pushaw, the spokesperson for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

The AP eventually issued a correction about the embarrassing mistake:

""This story was first published on June 9, 2022. It was updated on June 11, 2022 to remove comments erroneously attributed to Martha Flores, former host of a show on Radio Mambi in Miami, one of the stations in the proposed deal,"" the correction read.

""Flores died in 2020,"" the AP added. ""The comments were made by another woman. This version of the story removes those comments.""

Fox News noted that it took two days for the news outlet to issue the correction.

"Video shows Atlanta Cop City protests with fire, fireworks","Explosive video shows a riot breaking out in Atlanta following a protest against fatal police shooting at the future Atlanta Public Safety Training Center that has been nicknamed ""Cop City.""

On Wednesday, police fatally shot activist Manuel Esteban Paez Teran. The 26-year-old staged a protest at the future site of a planned public safety training center to be constructed in a southeast Atlanta forest.

Teran – who called himself ""Tortuguita"" – reportedly refused to comply with law enforcement, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Teran allegedly shot a Georgia State Patrol Trooper at Intrenchment Creek Park. Other law enforcement officers returned fire, struck Teran, and killed him.

Protests against the police shooting were organized for downtown Atlanta at 5 p.m. on Saturday.

Protesters held signs that read: ""They Can’t Kill Us All” and “Trees Give Life, Police Take It.” There were also chants of ""Stop Cop City"" and ""If they build it, we will burn it.""

However, the event of about 300 participants turned violent within an hour.

Rioters launched fireworks and threw large rocks at the Atlanta Police Foundation building in downtown Atlanta. Two police cruisers were set on fire and other APD vehicles had bricks thrown at them. Windows of local businesses were smashed during the riot revolving around the ""Cop City"" controversy.









Several rioters were arrested.

The Atlanta Police Department issued a statement on the violence:

The Atlanta Police Department is aware of the ongoing events, and we will continue to monitor them and address accordingly. We stand ready to respond to demonstrations to ensure the safety of those in our communities and those exercising their first amendment right, or to address illegal activity, should the need arise.

The office of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp released a statement:

The governor remains well informed of the situation through regular updates from state law enforcement and is actively monitoring the situation. State patrol is well equipped to respond to any and all threats to public safety and is coordinating closely with other state agencies and local PD. While the state continues to respect peaceful protest, acts of violence against person or property will NOT be tolerated. Those committing such unlawful acts will be arrested and prosecuted fully.

Baptist church requires members to sign 'biblical sexuality' pledge: 'An exercise in clarity ... in a sexually confused world',"A Baptist church in Florida has created a statement affirming traditional marriage and the gender binary, and all congregants must affirm the statement by mid-March or forfeit their membership.

Last October, leaders of First Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Florida, developed a statement that recognizes exclusively traditional Christian beliefs regarding marriage and sexuality.

""As a member of First Baptist Church, I believe that God creates people in his image as either male or female, and that this creation is a fixed matter of human biology, not individual choice,"" the first half of the statement reads.

""I believe marriage is instituted by God, not government, is between one man and one woman, and is the only context for sexual desire and expression,"" the statement concludes, citing passages from Genesis, Matthew, Corinthians, and Romans to support that teaching.

First Baptist Church members have until March 19 to sign the statement. Those who refuse or who fail to do so will have their membership automatically revoked.

Though critics have accused the church and its leaders of so-called ""anti-LGBTQ"" bigotry on account of this statement, Senior Pastor Heath Lambert countered that the statement denounces all gender and sexual practices that do not conform to biblical truth. ""This positive statement,"" Lambert later wrote, ""equally forbids the range of human sinful sexual expression, including fornication, adultery, pornography, homosexuality, transgenderism, and others.""

Lambert also asserted that the doctrines discussed in the statement are not new. ""These are basic facts of life, and they are wonderful,"" he stated on a YouTube video. He added in writing that the statement ""is an exercise in clarity so that our members might understand our most fundamental commitments in a sexually confused world.""

Lambert and others hosted a question-and-answer session to address concerns regarding the statement. One woman who attended the meeting with ""her partner"" claimed that the statement erases the ""existence"" of ""LGBTQ+ people.""

""This church is no longer a religious place of worship welcome to all ..."" the woman stated. ""Forcing your members to sign a contract erasing our existence just adds to the mountains of resentment that LGBTQ+ people already have for the church at large. Is that what you want? To draw a larger wedge between God and queer people? To sanitize the world from us or eliminate our existence? This oath is disgusting and not what God would want.""

The woman did state that she had been ""raised Baptist,"" but did not clarify whether she was a member of First Baptist Church.

Lambert reiterated that sexual ""revolutionaries"" are not the ""enemies"" of Christians and that the church is called to witness the gospel to those who seek to thwart the church's mission. ""It is the ultimate demonstration of hatefulness for Christians to know about sin, to know that sin will separate sinners from God forever, and yet refuse to call sinners to repentance,"" Lambert said. ""On the other hand, it is the love of Christ to point out sin and call people to faith in Jesus.""



Lambert also claimed that he and his fellow church leaders have received ""a windfall of support from our own congregation as well as religious leaders around the country,"" and most people who attended the Q&A event supported the statement and Lambert's leadership regarding the culture and human sexuality.

""At First Baptist, we want to be a united church, a clear church,"" Lambert added, ""and we want to be a church that shares the love of Jesus with lost people.""

"New York Times editor wanted to check with far-left Sen. Chuck Schumer before publishing GOP Sen. Tim Scott's op-ed, former NYT opinion editor Bari Weiss says","Bari Weiss — a former opinion editor at the New York Times who resigned in July 2020 after ""constant bullying"" from colleagues as she challenged the paper's leftism — told Republican U.S. Sen Tim Scott (S.C.) that while she was still at the Times, an editor insisted that Democrat U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) should be consulted before the paper published an op-ed by Scott.

What are the details?

Mediaite noted that Weiss spoke to Scott about the issue on her ""Honestly with Bari Weiss"" podcast Wednesday, detailing to the senator what went down in the newsroom regarding Scott's op-ed about a police reform bill he was working on — the Justice Act — following the death of George Floyd.

“I want to tell you a little story that I’m not sure if you know,” Weiss told Scott, according to a recording Mediaite posted, in which Weiss said that while the bill was endorsed by a range of people — including Schumer — it fell apart.

Scott noted to Weiss that it failed because “the Democrats really wanted the issue more than the solution,"" according to the Mediaite recording.



Weiss added more, according to the Mediaite recording: “Well, here’s what happened. I was at the New York Times, and you or your staff sent in an op-ed about the bill and why it fell apart.""

""There was a discussion about the piece and whether or not we should run it,"" Weiss continued. ""And one colleague, a more senior colleague, said to a more junior colleague who was pushing for the piece, ‘Do you think the Republicans really care about minority rights?'”

“Wow,” Scott said in reaction to Weiss' claim.

“And the more junior colleague said, ‘I think Tim Scott cares about minority rights.’ And then, and here’s the pretty shocking part: The more senior colleague said, ‘Let’s check with Senator Schumer before we run it,'” Weiss added before saying the more junior colleague ""refused.""



In the Mediate recording, Weiss added that the younger colleague's contention was that checking with Schumer ""wasn't an ethical thing to do.""

According to Fox News, the op-ed was never published.

But Scott — reacting further to Weiss' claims about the Times editorial discussion in the Mediaite recording — said, “I am disappointed to hear that. I am not surprised to hear that. You have to remember that the Washington Post fact-checked my life.""

Scott added, according to the Mediaite recording:

“I can’t tell you how disrespectful and dishonoring that entire process was ... went on for three or four months as they went through records to find out whether or not my grandfather actually dropped out of school in the third grade, their records suggested he dropped out in the fourth grade but still didn’t learn to read,” he recalled. “They wanted to know if I had somehow hidden my silver spoon and just was using a plastic spoon instead.”



“And the more they dug, the more they realized that there was no evidence that disproved the fact that I am who I say I am and that I experienced what I said I’ve experienced,” he added.



“So there is something in national media that wants to frame any conservative, particularly black conservatives, as being disingenuous or insincere or a tool for the conservatives. When in fact the black community is consistently as conservative as any community,” he concluded

What did the Times have to say?

A New York Times spokesperson in response to Weiss' allegation told TheBlaze on Friday that ""New York Times Opinion never seeks outside approval or consultation whether to publish guest opinion essays.”

Democrat squirms as CNN host grills him for evidence of explosive claim that GOP lawmakers sought pardons after January 6,"Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) refused to say Sunday whether the House Jan. 6 Committee has evidence that Republican lawmakers sought pardons from then-President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 riots.

What is the background?

At the prime-time Jan. 6 Committee hearing last Thursday, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) claimed multiple Republican lawmakers contacted the White House seeking presidential pardons. Cheney singled out Rep. Scott Perry (R-Penn.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.

""As you will see, Rep. Perry contacted the White House in the weeks after Jan 6. to seek a presidential pardon,"" Cheney said, adding, ""Multiple other Republican congressmen also sought presidential pardons for their roles in attempting to overturn the 2020 election.""

The committee, however, failed to present evidence at the hearing supporting the claim, and Perry has since denied the allegation.

""The notion that I ever sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress is an absolute, shameless, and soulless lie,"" Perry said last Friday.

What did Raskin say?

During an interview with Raskin on ""State of the Union,"" CNN host Dana Bash pressed Raskin on those explosive claims and whether the committee has evidence to corroborate them. The Maryland Democrat, however, refused to directly answer the question.

""How many of your colleagues in Congress did that? And what evidence do you have?"" Bash asked. ""Because you know that congressman Scott Perry is denying it.""

""Yes,"" Raskin responded. ""Well, the seeking of pardons is powerful demonstration of the consciousness of guilt, or at least the consciousness that you may be in trouble. And that's what's so shocking about this. It's not just one. It's —""

""And you have evidence that has happened?"" Bash interjected.

Raskin responded using passive language, claiming that ""in due course"" the details of the allegation ""will surface.""

""So, yes, there's evidence?"" Bash followed up.

""Everything we're doing is documented by evidence,"" Raskin claimed, adding that ""everything"" the Jan. 6 Committee is doing is ""based on facts.""



At no point in the interview did Raskin offer anything to prove the committee's claims, nor did he directly answer whether the committee, in fact, has the evidence to prove that multiple GOP lawmakers sought presidential pardons.

Bash asks Raskin if he thinks Trump should be indicted youtu.be

At any rate, the committee's talking points are clear. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) used the exact phrase that Raskin used regarding the pardon allegation — ""consciousness of guilt"" — in an interview last Thursday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bash-grills-raskin-evidence-gop-lawmakers-pardons,2022-06-13
BBC altered alleged rape victim's quotes to avoid 'misgendering' her trans biological male attacker: Report,"The British Broadcasting Company is under fire after staff complained that the news agency altered a rape victim's quotes to avoid ""misgendering"" her biological male transgender attacker's pronouns, according to the Times London.

The paper reported that the BBC's diversity team made the ""unethical and disrespectful"" decision to change a rape victim's quotes in an October 2021 article about lesbian women who feel pressured to have sex and relationships with biological men who present as transgender women.



In the article, one lesbian victim recounted her experiences with a transgender woman who physically forced her to have sex with him after a date and allegedly threatened to ostracize her if she refused.

She discussed the horrifying experience with the BBC using ""he"" and ""him"" pronouns; however, the news agency changed those pronouns to ""they"" and ""them"" upon publication. The BBC's style guide reportedly dictates that writers use an individual's preferred pronouns in their reporting.

""[They] threatened to out me as a terf and risk my job if I refused to sleep with [them],"" the alleged victim's altered quote reads. ""I was too young to argue and had been brainwashed by queer theory so [they were] a 'woman' even if every fibre of my being was screaming throughout so I agreed to go home with [them]. [They] used physical force when I changed my mind upon seeing [their] penis and raped me.""

According to the Times, the decision was hotly contested at the time, as several senior journalists and other staff argued that altering the pronouns conflicted with BBC's responsibility to produce accurate and unbiased reporting.

""They were originally all male references but the woke bros at the news website wanted to make them female because of misgendering,"" a source reportedly told the Times, adding, ""It's quite shocking. I can't think of any other situation where we would change the words of an alleged rape victim.""

Following its publication, the article quickly became subject to a massive number of complaints. More than 20,000 people, including members of the BBC's staff, reportedly signed an open letter accusing the story of being ""deeply flawed"" and ""incredibly dangerous,"" the Daily Mail reported.

Beckerman suggested that kids stay out of school until Congress acts on gun control,"Gal Beckerman, a senior editor at the Atlantic, has written a piece proposing a movement in which students do not return to school next fall until Congress passes gun control legislation.

""Today, I’m left with one conclusion: The children and parents of our country need to take the summer to organize locally, build a set of national demands, and then refuse to go back to school in the fall until Congress does something,"" Beckerman wrote.



Beckerman suggested that such a campaign would pressure lawmakers into taking action.



""One thing we’ve learned from the pandemic is that when children aren’t in school, society strains. This would make a strike an extremely powerful form of leverage. A walkout with enough students involved and taking place over days, not minutes, puts concrete pressure on officials, from the municipal level all the way up to Washington. When students aren’t in school, parents have difficulty getting to work. Suddenly understaffed services—hospitals, subways—suffer the consequences. Politicians and local officials have a mess on their hands—children falling behind in learning, parents overloaded—and a strong incentive to accede to a demand,"" he wrote.



""What if students, parents, and teachers took the next three months to mobilize? They could create thousands of local committees supporting the strike and decide on what the national demand might be—say, an assault-weapon ban. They could figure out the mutual support and child care they would need to get through the days and maybe weeks it would take for Congress to act. They could bolster their commitment to one idea, one tactic. For the youngest children, parents would have to take the lead,"" he noted.



Last week, a shooter killed 19 kids and two teachers at a school in Uvalde, Texas. Earlier in May, a shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, left 10 people dead.

Democrats have been calling for gun control — during an address on Thursday night, President Joe Biden called for banning assault firearms and large capacity magazines. He specifically called for reimposing a ban that was approved in 1994, but which eventually expired a decade later. As an alternative to a ban, Biden suggested increasing the age to buy such firearms to 21.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/beckerman-strike-school-congress-guns,2022-06-03
"Beethoven performance at famed Edinburgh International Festival nixed after British choir refuses to wear COVID masks while singing, as requested by Philadelphia Orchestra","The famed Edinburgh International Festival had to make a last-minute itinerary change this year because of demands made by the visiting Philadelphia Orchestra.

The Festival — scheduled to take place over eight days, starting this Sunday — had advertised that the Edinburgh Festival Chorus, the self-described ""backbone of the International Festival’s choral programme,"" would pair up with the Philadelphia Orchestra for a rendition of Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. However, due to concerns about the spread of COVID, the orchestra had requested that members of the chorus wear a mask during the performance.

As chorus members contribute to the performance exclusively by singing, the chorus refused to accommodate the request. Despite the chorus's refusal, the orchestra remained adamant.

""Our advisers at the University of Pennsylvania have shown that singing creates significantly wider and more distant spread of aerosols than speaking does,"" an orchestra spokesperson said, ""and that masks reduce this spread of aerosols, and therefore the risks, dramatically.""

Rather than submit to the mask demands, the chorus opted to bow out of the performance entirely. As an alternative, the Philadelphia Orchestra will perform Beethoven's Fifth Symphony instead, as it does not require a choir accompaniment, an event organizer stated.



Though the spokesperson for the orchestra insisted that the group did not make the decision ""lightly"" and that it was merely acting ""in the best interest of health and safety"" of all involved, many festival ticketholders are disappointed.

""I was looking forward to going with my family, who are all diehard Remainers, to hear the 'Ode to Joy,'"" said David Kemp, who claimed he has been attending the festival for at least a decade. ""This last-minute change to Beethoven’s Fifth is very disappointing.""

Jackie Bruce, who purchased 10 tickets for the event, agreed.

""This is absolutely potty,"" Bruce said. ""How can a choir sing while masked?""

""I am sure the orchestra are all multiple vaccinated and so are the choir,"" she added, ""so it is complete overkill.""

The orchestra will perform Beethoven's Fifth Symphony next Thursday, according to the itinerary released on the festival website. Music director Yannick Nézet-Séguin, known ""for his charismatic music making and heart-on-sleeve emotion,"" will direct. The performance is expected to last an hour and ten minutes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/beethoven-performance-at-famed-edinburgh-international-festival-nixed-after-british-choir-refuses-to-wear-covid-masks-while-singing-as-requested-by-philadelphia-orchestra,2022-08-19
"Journalist admits real reason Biden broke Super Bowl tradition, refused Fox interview: 'It's pretty tactical'","Journalist Ben Smith explained Monday that President Joe Biden skipped a Super Bowl Sunday interview with Fox to avoid being confronted about questions overshadowing his presidency.

What is the background?

Traditionally, the president sits down for an interview with the network airing the Super Bowl. This year, that was Fox Corporation.

So, to avoid a hard-hitting interview with Fox News anchors, the White House requested that Biden sit down with Fox Soul, a little-known digital streaming channel that would be more favorable to Biden. But the interview never happened, resulting in the White House blaming Fox for the snafu.

What did Smith say?

During an interview on ""CNN This Morning,"" Smith was asked about the White House's decision not to go forward with an interview.

""I think it's pretty tactical,"" Smith said.

""I don’t think this was necessarily them trying to strike some big blow against Rupert Murdoch, although if that’s a side benefit, I’m sure they’re into it. But they had tried to go to a subsidiary Fox channel, Fox Soul, to have the actress Vivica Fox — no relation — interview the president. She’s a supporter of his. When that kind of hit a bump, they discarded the whole thing,"" he explained.



Ultimately, Smith said Biden refused the Fox interview to avoid answering questions about 2024 and the scandals that have rocked his presidency, most recently the Chinese spy balloon incident.

""I think, actually, mostly it’s about the timing,"" he said. ""If you had an interview with Joe Biden, if I had an interview with Joe Biden, you’d say, ‘Are you running for re-election? What is going on with the balloons?’ I don't think he— I think he wants to answer both of those questions at sort of the time and place of his choosing, and it wasn’t yesterday.""

Smith predicted Biden will only appear on Fox News when White House officials ""see it to their tactical advantage.""

What was the WH excuse?

Although the White House clearly tried to avoid Biden being grilled by a Fox News anchor, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre claimed that Fox Corp. had canceled the interview. But that was not true, Fox Corp. said.

Ultimately, the interview was never recorded, and the White House blamed Fox Corp. for that.

"Bernie Sanders says the GOP has a good shot at winning the House, and potentially the Senate — 'the enthusiasm level within the Democratic base is extremely low'","Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has said that the GOP has a good shot of snagging control of the House and potentially even the Senate during the upcoming midterm elections.

""You really can’t win an election with a bumper sticker that says: 'Well, we can’t do much, but the other side is worse,'"" the lawmaker said, according to Politico.

""The Republicans stand an excellent chance of gaining control of the House and quite possibly the Senate,"" he said.

Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, noted that ""the enthusiasm level within the Democratic base is extremely low. And it's not only working class support that is fading away."" The senator said, ""Unless we turn around, the voter turnout is going to be very, very low on the Democratic base.""

""Say to the American people: 'Look, we don't have the votes to do it right now. We have two corporate Democrats who are not going to be with us,'"" Sanders said. ""The leadership has got to go out and say we don't have the votes to pass anything significant right now. Sorry. You got 48 votes. And we need more to pass it. That should be the message of this campaign.""

""Two corporate Democrats, Sens. Manchin and Sen. Sinema, sabotaged [Build Back Better]. And it has been downhill ever since for the Democratic Party,"" Sanders said, according to the outlet.



Politico reported that Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said in a statement, ""I have never berated Sen. Sanders for his socialist views. It is a shame he refuses to accept the more moderate views I share with my constituents.""

Democratic candidates could face serious headwinds during the 2022 election cycle if Americans continue to get hammered by high inflation and skyrocketing gas prices — as of Thursday, the AAA national average price for a gallon of gas is $4.97.

In a recent opinion piece, Washington Post contributing columnist Matt Bai argued that if Democrats get badly bested at the ballot box this year, that would actually set them up for a win during the 2024 presidential contest. Bai said that for Democrats, ""The good news is that getting blown out in 2022 may well be the only path you have to holding the White House in 2024.""

""I'm not saying the costs of a Republican takeover in November won’t be steep in the short run. These aren’t the conservative revolutionaries of 1994 or even tea-party types of 2010. This is the mutant-gene version of a Republican uprising, a full-on crazy-eyed dystopian movement of conspiracists and authoritarians,"" Bai wrote. ""But everything we know about modern politics suggests that the best way — maybe the only way — for a Democrat to be reelected is to also be the last guy standing between the broad American electorate and a whole lot of Republican crazy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bernie-sanders-low-democratic-turnout,2022-06-10
"Biden admin tries to revise history, blames school closures on Trump's 'mismanaged' pandemic response","The Biden administration played a game of revisionist history on Thursday, attempting to blame the Trump administration for extended school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

What is the background?

New test results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress found that math and reading performance among 9-year-old students has plummeted because of school closures during the pandemic, erasing 20 years of progress.

The New York Times reported:

The declines spanned almost all races and income levels and were markedly worse for the lowest-performing students. While top performers in the 90th percentile showed a modest drop — three points in math — students in the bottom 10th percentile dropped by 12 points in math, four times the impact.

What did the WH say?

Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about the NAEP's results on Thursday, and she responded by blaming the shocking education decline on a ""mismanaged"" pandemic response by the Trump administration.

Completely whitewashing what actually happened, Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden opened schools despite Republican opposition to his agenda.

""Let’s step back to where we were not too long ago when this president walked into this administration: how mismanaged the response to the pandemic was; how in less than six months, our schools went from 46% open to nearly all of them being open to full time,"" she said.

""That was the work of this president,"" Jean-Pierre claimed. ""And that was the work of Democrats in spite of Republicans not voting for the American Rescue Plan.""

""We were in a place where, again, schools were not open. The economy was shut down. Businesses were shut down,"" Jean-Pierre went on to say, claiming the NAEP's report ""shows you how mismanaged the pandemic was and how the impact of that mismanagement had on kids’ progress and academic well-being.""

09/01/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

Is that what happened?

First, it is not true that former President Donald Trump is to blame for school and the economy shutting down during the pandemic. Those decisions were made by individual states.

Second, it is revisionist history to suggest that America reopened because of Biden. Republican-controlled states, like Texas and Florida, had long been open when Biden became president, much to the chagrin of Democrats and the media, who accused Govs. Greg Abbott and Ron DeSantis of endangering their residents by not keeping their states locked down.

Third, when Biden came into office, administration officials repeatedly questioned the reopening of schools precisely because the COVID-19 vaccine had just been released to the public and younger people had not yet had access to it. Meanwhile, teachers' unionsstrongly opposed a return to in-person learning.

"Biden admin to grant 24,000 Venezuelan migrants humanitarian entry via air travel","On Wednesday, the Biden administration announced that it would grant 24,000 Venezuelan migrants humanitarian entry through air travel as part of a deal with Mexico. In exchange, future Venezuelan border-crossers will be expelled back to Mexico.



The humanitarian entry will only be granted to Venezuelans with U.S. sponsors who can prove that they can support the migrant for up to two years financially. The program would not apply to those already in America.

Officials noted that Venezuelans who illegally cross into the U.S., Mexico, or Panama after the Wednesday announcement would not be eligible for the entry program. The administration hopes that the program will encourage asylum-seekers to fly instead of traveling by foot to the southern border.

""These actions make clear that there is a lawful and orderly way for Venezuelans to enter the United States, and lawful entry is the only way,"" U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said. ""Those who attempt to cross the southern border of the United States illegally will be returned to Mexico and will be ineligible for this process in the future.""

Mexico has also requested that the U.S. provide an additional 65,000 temporary visas to migrants for non-agricultural jobs. The Biden administration plans to reserve 20,000 spots for Central Americans and Haitians.

As part of the southern border deal, Mexico has agreed to ""temporarily"" grant access to migrants through the U.S. border but did not specify how many it would accept. Previously, Mexico has generally refused to take back migrants who had illegally crossed into America.

While it is unclear how the Biden administration arrived at the number of 24,000, the entry program is modeled after the ""Uniting for Ukraine"" program, which granted Ukrainian asylum-seekers access to the U.S. Similarly, applicants had to secure an American sponsor.

During Biden's term in office, a record-breaking 1 million illegal immigrants have been released into the United States while awaiting deportation proceedings in immigration court, the New York Times reported. That total does not account for the hundreds of thousands who have slipped into the country undetected.

Between October 2021 and August 2022, over 150,000 Venezuelan migrants were apprehended at the southern border. During that period, Venezuelans accounted for only approximately 7% of all border crossings.

John Thomas, a Republican strategist, told the New York Times that the announcement was simply a calculated political decision with midterms around the corner.

""This is more of an effort to soften people's anger on what's happening on the southern border,"" Thomas said. ""It also gives the administration a talking point that they are 'doing something.'""

Biden administration proposes new permitting program for wind-power companies killing eagles,"On September 29, the Biden administration proposed a new permitting program for the ""taking of eagles for various purposes."" The ""taking of eagles"" is a euphemism for the ""incidental, or unintentional"" slaughter of such birds of national significance. Energy companies whose wind turbines are slaughtering eagles by the hundreds or thousands will, if so permitted, be authorized to continue doing so whilst both executing President Joe Biden's climate agenda and continuing to ""expand in the United States.""

Promoting cooperation

Amidst a massive national expansion of wind power projects and with some wind energy companies pleading guilty to shredding eagles, the Biden administration wants to ""encourage more project proponents that may have an impact on eagles to obtain a permit and implement mitigation measures.""

In its Thursday announcement, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service suggested that it is committed to ""maintaining stable or increasing eagle populations."" There are an estimated 350,000 American bald eagles and presently only 40,000 golden eagles.



By amending the permit process for ""wind-energy generation projects, power line infrastructure, disturbance of breeding bald eagles, and bald eagle nest take,"" the FWS believes more projects will be incentivized to be in compliance with the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (Eagle Act) and implement mitigation measures.

Under the Eagle Act, wind energy companies seeking a permit have to show that the: ""taking is necessary to protect an interest in a particular locality""; ""taking is associated with, but not the purpose of, the activity""; and the ""applicant has applied all appropriate and practicable avoidance and minimization measures to reduce impacts to eagles.""

While the Eagle Act will be preserved, FWS Director Martha Williams indicated the new program would provide ""multiple pathways to obtain a permit.""

Wind power companies, for instance, could obtain a general permit by registering with the FWS and, ""without review by the Service,"" certify compliance with permit conditions. For every eagle a permittee kills, they must work to ensure another eagle death is avoided elsewhere.

The permitting scheme's added clarity and pathways may have benefited the NextEra Energy subsidiary ESI Energy, which was sentenced in the spring to five years probation and ordered to pay over $8 million in fines and restitution after it had killed at least 150 eagles.

NBC News reported in April that the company acknowledged the deaths of golden and bald eagles at 50 affiliate wind farms since 2012. Most eagles were ""taken"" by ESI Energy's wind turbines. While the estimated number of eagles killed by the company was 150, the number might in fact be much higher, granted the carcasses of the national bird were not always found.

The company had not sought permits because, according to spokesman Steven Stengel, it didn't reckon the law required them for unintentional bird deaths.

ESI Energy was not the first wind power company prosecuted for a death of an eagle or another protected bird. That was Duke Energy Renewables, which pled guilty to killing 14 eagles and a myriad of other birds at two Wyoming wind farms in 2013.

At the time, no wind energy company had obtained a federal permit to ""take"" an eagle.

On December 14, 2016, the Obama administration finalized a rule enabling permitted high-speed turbines to kill or injure up to 4,200 bald eagles, four times the previous limit. The 30-year permits issued by the FWS each cost $36,000.

Permittees were required to ""implement all practicable best management practices and other measures that are reasonably likely to reduce eagle take"" to less than 5% of the local area population for a project in operation.

Unlike his predecessor and successor, former President Donald Trump stated shortly after the Obama administration permitted the taking of more birds that: ""If you shoot an eagle, or kill an eagle, they want to put you in jail for five years ... And yet the windmills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles. One of the most beautiful, one of the most treasured birds, and they're killing them by the hundreds, and nothing happens.""

The Associated Press reported that 34 permits were in place last year, which enabled authorized companies to kill 170 golden eagles. Over 200 additional permits were in place, which authorized the killing of 420 bald eagles.

The federal government has refused to indicate how many eagles have been killed by wind farms, claiming the number constitutes sensitive law enforcement information.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey database, there are over 72,800 wind turbines nationwide in approximately 1,500 wind power projects spanning at least 44 states. That number may soon see a significant rise.

The Biden administration announced on September 15 that it intends to develop new floating offshore wind platforms near the Gulf of Maine and along the west coast. This resulting investment will allegedly be able to power 10 million homes by 2030.

Beyond the financial and avian dimensions, the plan will have its costs.

Extra to killing eagles, Forbes reported that the construction, operation and maintenance of offshore wind farms generates a lot of pollution. For each 500 megawatt installation, between 12,571 and 18,857 barrels of marine fuel are consumed. That amounts to 1.2% the amount of fuel consumed yearly by Amtrak.

With a 20-year lifespan, these installations also require maintenance, which will similarly exhaust a great deal of fossil fuels.

As the mills are retired over the next 20 years, the U.S. will be left with an estimated 720,000 tons of unrecyclable blade material to dispose of.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-administration-proposes-new-permitting-program-for-wind-power-companies-killing-eagles,2022-09-30
US attorney to review classified documents from Biden's VP office found at a think tank,"U.S Attorney General Merrick Garland tasked the U.S. attorney in Chicago with reviewing classified documents found at a think tank, according to two sources who spoke to CBS News.

The documents were discovered at a locked closet at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C.

CBS News reported that the FBI was also involved in the probe of the documents, which number about 10.

Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, confirmed that the documents had been found on Nov. 2, just ahead of the midterm elections, and reported to the National Archives.

""The discovery of these documents was made by the president's attorneys,"" Sauber said. ""The documents were not the subject of any previous request or inquiry by the Archives. Since that discovery, the president's personal attorneys have cooperated with the Archives and the Department of Justice in a process to ensure that any Obama-Biden Administration records are appropriately in the possession of the Archives.""

CBS News said the National Archives contacted the Department of Justice about the incident.

Garland could assign a special prosecutor to the case after the Chicago U.S. attorney's office completes the preliminary investigation.

The turn of events will severely undermine Democratic efforts to criticize and excoriate former President Donald Trump over numerous classified documents seized from his residence at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.

Trump first acknowledged the raid at his residence in a tweet from August 2022 in which he accused the Biden administration of illegally ordering the action with political motivations. He has since argued that because he was the president, he had the power to unilaterally declassify any documents, but his attorneys have not made that argument in court.

In the most recent development over the Mar-a-Lago documents, a federal judge refused a request from the Department of Justice to hold Trump in contempt of court for refusing to comply with a subpoena.

Biden's climate envoy John Kerry exposed after expelling a whole lot of exhaust,"John Kerry has served as U.S. special presidential envoy for climate since January 2021. In the position, Kerry is supposed to focus on the foreign policy and international aspects of the so-called climate crisis. It turns out his rhetoric may be out of sync with his actions, which appear to be exacerbating the problems he has been tasked with addressing.

On Thursday, the Washington Free Beacon published a report indicating that Kerry has flown over 180,000 miles when conducting his affairs as climate envoy, despite having access to high-quality teleconferencing technologies with which he could remotely engage foreign dignitaries.

Analysis of fuel consumption, mileage, travel plans, and projected exhaust figures showed that Kerry is responsible for the emission of over 9.54 million pounds (4,772 tons) of carbon since March 2021. That's approximately 300 times more than the average American's yearly carbon footprint, which is 16 tons.

The accounting for these figures takes into consideration Kerry's 75 official travel announcements and destinations as well as his plane's average carbon dioxide production per mile, approximately 53.3 pounds.

This revelation comes just months after it was reported that the Kerry family's private jet, a Gulfstream GIV-Sp, had belched over 300 metric tons of carbon dioxide since January 2021. The executive director of the energy advocacy organization Power the Future, Daniel Turner, told Fox News Digital that ""John Kerry and the climate hypocrites who run the green movement ... refuse to voluntarily live how they want the rest of us to be forced to live.""

Although Kerry's office did not respond to the Free Beacon for comment, he has already provided a rationale for his mode of transportation and the method by which he promotes the Biden administration's message on record.

In 2019, he defended his decision to take a carbon-spewing jet to Iceland to pick up a climate change leadership award. In response to a question posed by an Icelandic reporter about whether a private jet was the most ""environmental way to travel,"" Kerry said, ""If you offset your carbon, it's the only choice for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle.""

Carbon offsetting involves paying off other people or groups to reduce their emissions to compensate for your own.

Kerry noted further, ""What I'm doing, almost full time ... is working to win the battle on climate change.""

While winning the battle, for Kerry, involves emitting nearly 5,000 tons of carbon, the battle won will have meant removing the very same CO2 from the atmosphere.

Kerry told CBS News last winter that ""to avert the worst consequences of climate crisis ... we have nine years left ... There is no room for BS any more.""

With only nine years left and absent room for ""BS,"" Kerry must continue to travel the world demanding fewer carbon emissions.

In March, at a conference on the future of energy, Kerry spoke of the perceived need for the world to reach zero carbon emissions by 2050. He asserted that a ""45% reduction in emissions in eight years"" was necessary to achieve this goal.

John Kerry is not the only climate warrior whose activism results in a great deal of exhaust.

Former Vice President Al Gore — who will join Kerry on September 20 at a New York Times climate event — has similarly been accused of excessively emitting while telling others to cut down themselves.

Despite Gore's claim to CNN that he lives ""a carbon-free lifestyle, to the maximum extent possible,"" the National Center for Public Policy Research found evidence to the contrary.

The NCPPR obtained Gore's electricity usage through public records requests and via the Nashville Electric Service. Gore, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee, used more electricity in one year than the average American family uses in 21 years. The electricity he uses, via the NES, derives majoritively from nuclear, coal, and natural gas.

Gore told CBS News in January that ""job number one is to stop using the sky as an open sewer for all this man-made global warming pollution.""

Other recognizable climate-conscious figures have been recently outed for their carbon output.

In August, TheBlaze reported how Steven Spielberg, admittedly ""terrified"" of global warming, is the owner of a multimillion-dollar private jet that expelled 4,465 tons of CO2 in 2022.

Taylor Swift was named ""biggest celebrity CO2e polluter of the year"" after her private jet's 170 flights in 2022 produced over 8,293.54 tons of carbon emissions.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-climate-envoy-kerry-exhaust,2022-09-09
Biden declares there are 'more important things going on' when confronted about ignoring border in crisis,"President Joe Biden declared Tuesday that he will not visit the southern border because it is not something he believes is a priority.

On Monday, the White House disclosed that Biden would be traveling to Arizona to celebrate manufacturing jobs and the CHIP and Science Act. The president, despite being near the border, will not be visiting the border, where a migrant crisis remains ongoing under his watch.

Before his departure for Arizona on Tuesday, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked Biden why he was avoiding the border.

""There are more important things going on,"" Biden responded. ""They're going to invest billions of dollars in the new enterprise in the state.""

Biden says ‘more important things’ than border crisis as he heads to Arizona www.youtube.com

Biden has not visited the border as president, despite overseeing the largest border crisis in American history.

Between migrants apprehended by immigration officials and those who were never caught, more than 5 million migrants have entered the U.S. since Biden became president nearly two years ago.

Not only has Biden avoided the border as president, but there is, despite White House assertions, no evidence that Biden has ever visited the southern border outside of a brief ""drive-by"" while driving to a campaign stop in New Mexico in October 2008.

What did the WH say?

After Biden's remarks triggered outrage from Republican lawmakers, the White House released a lengthy statement elaborating on Biden's comments.

Seizing on Republican emphasis that the economy is the most important issue gripping Americans, the statement appeared to justify Biden's refusal to adequately address the border crisis.

""The president was clear that his top priority is investing in the American economy and in American communities, out-competing China, and bringing back American jobs from overseas,"" the White House told Fox News. ""In fact, as Fox News’ own analysis showed, the economy is the top issue for most Americans. If anyone believes that shouldn’t be the president’s top priority too, they should say that out loud.

""President Biden is focused on real solutions, not political stunts,"" the statement added.

However, outside of economic issues, immigration is the second-most important issue to Americans, according to Gallup.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-declares-there-are-more-important-things-going-on,2022-12-06
Biden fights to make Americans mask up on planes again,"The Biden administration is fighting to keep mask requirements in place on airplanes and other forms of public transportation, filing in court Tuesday to overturn a U.S. District Court judge's April ruling that found the CDC's mask mandate unlawful.

Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle of Florida in April said that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention exceeded its statutory authority by imposing a mask mandate on airplanes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation and transportation hubs. She ordered the Biden administration to stop enforcing the mask requirements, and while the administration complied, the Department of Justice pledged to appeal the ruling.

The promised appeal came Tuesday, when the DOJ filed court papers asserting that the CDC's mask mandate, which originated in January 2021, was ""within"" the agency's legal authority.

“None of the district court’s quarrels with the CDC order comes close to showing that the CDC has acted outside the ‘zone of reasonableness,'"" the Justice Department wrote.

""The findings in the CDC order likewise provide ample support for the agency’s determination that there was good cause to make the order effective without delay,"" the brief argues.

The DOJ compared how the CDC's mask mandate was implemented to how the Biden administration put a vaccine mandate in place for certain health care workers and cited the Supreme Court's finding that the vaccine mandate was lawful to argue for the mask mandate.



""Like the CMS vaccination rule, the CDC's mask order relied on the emergence of COVID19 variants with increased transmissibility, which threatened to spread rapidly and infect the traveling public,"" the brief states. ""The district court's objection that the CDC took too long to issue the mask order (which was issued nine months before the CMS vaccination requirement) echoes the argument that the Supreme Court rejected in [the vaccine mandate case] and fails for the same reason.""

Mizelle's ruling came days before the CDC planned to extend its mask mandate on May 3. Biden administration health officials have extended the mandate five times, most recently claiming that the BA.2 coronavirus subvariant was causing a surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths that made masking requirements necessary to slow the spread of the virus.

The widespread unpopularity of the CDC's mask mandate for airplanes was the reason for incidents in which unruly air passengers caused disturbances on flights by refusing to wear a mask or mask their children. The Federal Aviation Administration said on May 4 that after the mask mandate was lifted on April 18, the rate of unruly air passenger incidents fell to its lowest level since late 2020.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-fights-to-make-americans-mask-up-on-planes-again,2022-06-01
Biden invites self-described 'drag artist' to White House,"President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden have invited Marti Gould Cummings, a self-described ""non binary drag artist,"" to the White House for the signing of the so-called Respect for Marriage Act.

""To be a non binary drag artist invited to the White House is something I never imagined would happen. Thank you President & Dr. Biden for inviting me to this historic bill signing. Grateful doesn't begin to express the emotions I feel,"" Cummings wrote when tweeting about the invitation, which indicates that signing event will take place on Tuesday.

A number of Republican lawmakers in the Senate and House chambers joined with Democrats in voting to pass the pro-gay marriage measure. The legislation will prohibit states from refusing to recognize an individual's marriage on the basis of sex and other factors.

The measure says that people ""acting under color of state law"" may not refuse ""full faith and credit to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State pertaining to a marriage between 2 individuals, on the basis of the sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin of those individuals.""

While the Supreme Court's 2015 Obergefell v. Hodgesruling requires states to allow and recognize gay marriages, earlier this year, when the high court issued a ruling that overturned the 1973 Roe v.Wade abortion ruling, Justice Clarence Thomas indicated in a concurring opinion that the gay marriage ruling should also eventually be overturned.

Thomas wrote that ""in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell."" He noted, ""After overruling these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question would remain whether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myriad rights that our substantive due process cases have generated.""

""After the uncertainty caused by the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, Congress has restored a measure of security to millions of marriages and families,"" Biden said in a statement after the House's passage of the Respect for Marriage Act last week. ""They have also provided hope and dignity to millions of young people across this country who can grow up knowing that their government will recognize and respect the families they build.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-invites-drag-artist-signing,2022-12-12
Reporter frustrates Biden when she asks about classified documents — but Biden says he has 'no regrets',"President Joe Biden admitted Thursday that he has ""no regrets"" for improperly retaining classified documents.

After touring areas of California ravaged by recent winter storms, Biden was confronted by Bloomberg News reporter Jennifer Jacobs about his classified documents scandal.

""Do you have any regret, sir?"" Jacobs asked.

The question clearly frustrated the president. He said the issue ""quite frankly bugs"" him — that he would have to answer for retaining classified documents — and decried Jacobs for not asking him about weather events.

Jacobs followed up, ""Do you have any regret, sir, that you did not reveal the existence of the documents back in November, before the midterms?""

""Look, we found a handful of documents that were filed in the wrong place. We immediately turned them over to the [National] Archives and the Justice Department. We're fully cooperating and looking forward to getting this resolved quickly,"" Biden responded.



""I think you're going to find there's nothing there. I have no regrets,"" he added. ""I'm following what the lawyers have told me they want me to do. It's exactly what we're doing. There is no 'there' there.""



Biden's declaration that he experiences no regret for improperly storing classified documents at his private office and residence is ironic. After all, when former President Donald Trump was under intense scrutiny for the same offense — storing classified documents at Mar-a-Lago — Biden condemned Trump as ""totally irresponsible.""

Jacobs' question, meanwhile, hit at the heart of a critical question the White House has so far refused to answer.

When the White House disclosed last week that Biden's personal attorneys had discovered a batch of classified documents at Biden's post-vice presidential Washington office on Nov. 2, officials failed to mention the discovery of a second batch of classified documents at Biden's Wilmington, Delaware, residence on Dec. 20. Indeed, the White House only admitted to the second discovery after NBC News first reported on its existence.

"Biden took Air Force One for one-hour trip to vote in Delaware, despite being there just days before","President Joe Biden appeared to waste hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on Tuesday when he took Air Force One for a one-hour trip to Delaware.

What happened?

Biden traveled to Delaware late Tuesday, arriving in his home state at 6:40 p.m. By 7:55 p.m., he was back on Air Force One en route to Washington, D.C.

So why the brief, previously unannounced trip?

It turns out that Biden used Air Force One and two motorcades, according to the New York Post, for the 1 hour and 15 minute trip so that he could vote in Delaware's primary election. Even more odd is the fact that Biden took the trip when there was only one contested Democratic primary, for state auditor.

While in Delaware, he also stopped at his home for eight minutes.

It's unclear why Biden and first lady Jill Biden waited until Tuesday to vote. After all, they could have requested absentee ballots, or they could have voted early when they were in Delaware just last weekend.

Air Force One is notoriously expensive to operate, costing roughly $177,000 per hour in fiscal year 2021.

What did the WH say?

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended Biden's expensive voting excursion on Wednesday, claiming voting on Tuesday worked best for his schedule.

""Every American, as you know, has a sacred and constitutional right to vote. The president exercised that right, alongside other Delawareans, last night,"" she told reporters.



""Look, as you know, the president has a very heavy schedule. He’s the president of the United States. It worked out best for him to vote on Tuesday,"" she added. ""He thought it was important to exercise his constitutional right to vote, as I just mentioned, and set an example by showing the importance of voting.



Jean-Pierre, however, failed to explain why Biden did not vote when he was in Delaware on Friday and Saturday when polls were open from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. for early voting. Biden also refused to explain why he didn't vote when in Delaware over the weekend.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-one-hour-trip-delaware-vote,2022-09-15
"After Biden reads 'repeat the line' from teleprompter, no one buys the excuse offered by WH spokesperson","The White House tried to excuse another teleprompter gaffe from President Joe Biden on Friday. Instead, the excuse only drew more attention to the embarrassing moment.

What happened?

Speaking at the White House about a new executive order on abortion, Biden repeatedly lied about the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.

For example, Biden claimed the decision ""was not a decision driven by history,"" that justices were ""playing fast and loose with the fact,"" that the decision ""wasn’t about the Constitution or the law,"" and that the decision to overturn Roe ""was an exercise in raw political power.""

Biden then read a quote from the majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in which the majority noted the American electorate is comprised of a majority of women.

After reading the quote, Biden said ""repeat the line,"" a cue apparently on the teleprompter from which he was reading. Video of the speech even shows Biden leaning into the camera to seemingly get a clearer view of the teleprompter.

Throughout his speech, Biden also said ""end of quote"" — three times, in fact — after he recited a quote. ""End of quote"" is a normal cue that appears on teleprompters to inform whoever is reading that the quote is over.

How did the White House respond?

Despite clear video evidence, White House assistant press secretary Emilie Simons claimed that Biden did not read the teleprompter cue but rather was exhorting himself to repeat the line.

""No. He said, 'let me repeat that line,'"" Simons said.

No. He said, ""let me repeat that line.""

— Emilie Simons (@EmilieSimons46) July 8, 2022





Surprisingly, the White House official transcript of Biden's remarks shows what Simons claimed. But again, the video shows Biden clearly reading teleprompter cues, saying, ""End of quote. Repeat the line,"" before starting to repeat the quote.

People, however, were not buying what Simons was trying to sell.

""It would be something that people would forget about by the end of the day, but when you brazenly lie about it, that keeps it around longer,"" Washington Examiner magazine editor Jay Caruso said.

""Even if you suppose that is what he was supposed to have said, or what he meant to say, it is absolutely not what he actually said. The video is right there. He says, 'End of quote. Repeat the line,'"" reporter Jerry Dunleavy pointed out.

""You know there's video?"" writer Charles C.W. Cooke asked.

""[H]ow much acid did you do today,"" Caleb Hull mocked.

""Adam Schiff's former comms director trying to convince us that something that didn't happen actually did is perfectly on brand,"" John Cooper of the Heritage Foundation reacted.

""Hahahaha no he didn’t. You’re the assistant press secretary. You’re lying. Because it’s humiliating to work for a senile puppet,"" conservative commentator Liz Wheeler mocked.

""This is what happens when state media refuses to hold a presidential administration accountable and instead functions as press secretaries for that administration and ruling party: LYING BOLDLY & WITH IMPUNITY They know DC journo-stenographers won't hold them accountable for it,"" Christina Pushaw, spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), said.

Biden tweet suggests GOP lawmakers are more concerned with 'robbing women of their constitutional rights' than with 'lowering costs for American families',"President Joe Biden is suggesting that GOP lawmakers are more concerned with taking away women's constitutional rights than with seeking to tackle the high prices Americans have been facing.

""Imagine an America where Congressional Republicans cared as much about lowering costs for American families as they do robbing women of their constitutional rights,"" a Thursday tweet on the @POTUS Twitter account stated.

BlazeTV host Chad Prather of ""The Chad Prather Show"" responded to the post by tweeting, ""Which rights? To vote? To life? Liberty? Pursuit of happiness? Property? Bear arms? Free speech? Which constitutional rights are women robbed of?""

""Fact check: Killing an unborn human being isn't a constitutional right,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton noted.

""Imagine an America where the President paid as much attention to inflation and borders as he did to facilitating the killing of babies,"" radio host Mark Davis tweeted.

""Was it robbing women of their rights when you attempted to have them fired if they refused to inject themselves with a big pharma product?"" the Libertarian Party tweeted.

""Imagine thinking women don’t have constitutional rights simply because they can’t kill unborn babies. By the way, Joe, what about my *actual* constitutional right to own a gun? Y’all don’t seem too keen on that one,"" another individual tweeted.

Americans' finances have been getting walloped by roaring inflation. Earlier this week, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a consumer price index report that noted, ""The all items index increased 8.3 percent for the 12 months ending August, a smaller figure than the 8.5-percent increase for the period ending July.""

Biden's CBP chief told to quit or be fired — refuses to step down despite allegedly skipping and falling asleep during meetings,"Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus was asked on Wednesday by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to either resign from his position or be fired, according to multiple government sources, reported Politico.



According to Fox News, Magnus is being forced out of his position as part of a greater change in leadership at the Department of Homeland Security. So far, the commissioner has refused to step down from his position.

Magnus confirmed the rumors on Friday and told the Los Angeles Times, ""I am excited about the progress I made and look forward continuing that work.""

The commissioner explained that Mayorkas told him he had lost confidence in his ability to perform his duties. Magnus stated that as a result, Mayorkas told him to resign, or he would recommend that President Biden fire him.

In September, the Arizona Sheriff's Association penned a letter to President Biden expressing no confidence in Magnus and urging he be removed from his position.

Magnus, who has faced criticism for his management style, said he previously pulled a ""retention"" bonus for the head of Border Patrol, Raul Ortiz, because Ortiz ""did not share his philosophy and approach to reforms,"" the Los Angeles Times wrote.

Mayorkas ordered Magnus not to attend a meeting in El Paso for border patrol chiefs. Magnus stated that he went despite Mayorkas' demands.

""After me making extensive attempts to reach [Mayorkas] and discuss the matter, I went to the meeting so I could engage with the chiefs on various issues and concerns. I also met with Chief Ortiz to see how we might best work together moving forward,"" Magnus said.

Magnus stated that John Tien, the second in command at DHS, told him that he would be removed from his position within the next few days if he refused to quit. According to Politico, Mayorkas has already shifted Magnus' responsibilities to Tien and deputy CBP Commissioner Troy Miller.

Politico reported in October that six of Magnus' colleagues complained that he had fallen asleep during multiple meetings. Magnus blamed his tiredness on his multiple sclerosis. He was also criticized for missing White House meetings about the border, being unengaged in his work, and speaking negatively about other agencies and colleagues.

""He's not in the game,"" one internal critic told the news outlet. ""Every time there's a meeting and he's in it, we'll get to a conclusion and Magnus will have some sidebar issue that he wants to raise and we're all like, 'What the f*** is that about?'""

Magnus, a former Tucson and Richmond, California, police chief with over 40 years of law enforcement experience, started working for the DHS in December.

The DHS and the White House declined to comment on the matter, Politico reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-s-cbp-chief-told-to-quit-or-be-fired-refuses-to-step-down-despite-allegedly-skipping-and-falling-asleep-during-meetings,2022-11-11
Biden says he doesn't consider 'any Trump supporter to be a threat to the country' after speech proclaiming GOP 'dominated' by 'MAGA Republicans',"President Joe Biden on Friday responded to criticism of his recent verbal attacks against ""MAGA Republicans"" and his controversial prime-time speech Thursday, denying that he considers Trump supporters to be a ""threat"" to the country.

At Independence Hall in Philadelphia Thursday evening, against a backdrop of harsh red lighting and Marine guards, Biden strongly condemned his predecessor Donald Trump and his ""MAGA Republicans"" allies, who, the president said, ""represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic."" The president's speech was denounced by Republicans who accused Biden of using threatening, divisive language to demonize the 70 million Americans who supported Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

The speech came days after Biden reportedly told attendees at a Democratic Party fundraiser that the ""extreme MAGA philosophy"" of the Republican Party is ""like semi-fascism.""



Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy confronted Biden about his remarks after a White House event announcing the winners of a regional economic development competition.

""Mr. President, do you consider all Trump supporters to be a threat to the country?"" Doocy asked.

""I don't consider any Trump supporter to be a threat to the country,"" Biden replied. ""I do think anyone who calls for the use of violence, fails to condemn violence when it's used, refuses to acknowledge an election has been won, insists upon changing the way in which we rule and count votes, that is a threat to democracy.""

He emphasized the word ""democracy.""

""Everything we stand for rests on the platform of democracy. When people voted for Donald Trump and support him now, they weren't voting for attacking the Capitol. They weren't voting for overruling an election. They were voting for a philosophy he put forward,"" the president added.

""I am not talking about anything other than, it is inappropriate … the failure to recognize and condemn violence when it is used for political purposes. Failure to condemn the manipulation [of] election outcomes,"" he continued. ""Failure to acknowledge when elections were won or lost.""

But in his speech Thursday night, Biden said Republicans have assaulted the principles of ""equality and democracy"" and represent a threat to the country.

""As I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault. We do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise,"" he said. ""There’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.""

The president did acknowledge that ""not every Republican, not even a majority Republicans are MAGA Republicans.""

""Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology,"" Biden said. ""I know because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.""

Even so, Republicans demanded that Biden apologize for the tone of his speech.

""Instead of trying to bring our country together to solve the MANY problems he has created, President Biden has chosen to divide, demean, and disparage his fellow Americans—simply because they disagree with his policies,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) tweeted Thursday. ""Mr. President: you owe millions of Americans an apology.""

Second batch of Biden's classified documents found at different location,"A second batch of classified documents from Joe Biden's tenure as vice president was discovered at a different location than the first batch reported on Monday.

Biden aides are reportedly operating an exhaustive search effort for classified documents that have been misplaced, according to sources familiar with the operation.

The original classified documents were discovered at a think tank in Washington, D.C., and reported to the National Archives. Officials at the National Archived took possession of the documents and then informed the Department of Justice. U.S. Attorney Merrick Garland later appointed the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois to review the documents found.

Critics of the president pounced on the news to point out the hypocrisy of Democrats criticizing former President Donald Trump for the trove of classified documents seized by the FBI at his residence at Mar-a-Lago. Some point out that the documents were found days before the midterm elections, but it was not revealed until after the election.

An attorney for the president said in a statement Monday that the documents were found in a locked closet at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.

While the original batch numbered around ten documents, the number of those in the second batch discovered remains unknown publicly.

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio was among those criticizing Democrats for the newest development.

""First, they find classified documents at the Biden Center,"" tweeted Jordan. ""Then, the White House refuses to say if they’ll find more. Now, the news reports that a second batch of classified documents have been found.""

Liberal defenders of the president, like MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, claimed that Biden had accidentally taken the documents and tried to refute the notion that the incident was in any way similar to the accusations against Trump.

""Again, this was not, as it was in Trump’s case, the archives desperately seeking the return of the material that Trump was blowing off, and Trump was blowing off those requests, and ultimately, blowing off the subpoena to return those documents,"" said Maddow to her audience.

""These appear to be documents that were inadvertently held at the Penn Biden Center, discovered by Biden’s attorneys,"" she added.

Biden ties transgender laws to racism and anti-Semitism: 'They're all connected!',"President Joe Biden tied transgender laws to racism, sexism, and anti-Semitism in a bizarre speech after signing the pro-gay marriage bill on Tuesday.

Biden was speaking before an audience on the south lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., when he made the comments.

""We need to challenge the hundreds of callous and cynical laws introduced in the states targeting transgender children, terrifying families and criminalizing doctors who give children the care they need,"" said Biden.

""We have to protect these children so they know they're loved and we'll stand up for them and so they can speak for themselves,"" he added.

""Folks, racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia, they're all connected!"" he claimed.

""But the antidote to hate is love,"" Biden continued. ""This law and the love it defends strike a blow against hate in all its forms. And that's why this law matters to every single American.""

He went on to claim that the law was rooted in the ""secular and sacred"" promise in the Declaration of Independence that all people are created equal.

Twelve Republican crossed the aisle and joined Democrats to pass the bill misnamed the ""Respect for Marriage Act.""

Critics of the law say it will imperil religious freedom and open a floodgate of lawsuits against churches, schools, and other agencies that refuse to affirm same-sex marriages.

A commentary at the Heritage Foundation outlined the dangers of the legislation for religious institutions.

While this bill does not provide any additional protections to those in same-sex unions, it does empower an ideologically motivated bureaucracy and activist regime with all the legal fodder necessary to attack people of faith. While Christians are used to the false claim that they are bigots, this bill would impact religious persons who hold to traditional marriage, including those of the Jewish or Muslim faiths, or [members] of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The White House did not ease these concerns when press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration was not against forcing Americans to engage in speech that they opposed politically or religiously.

Biden tries to blame Republicans for inflation. But facts quickly block his narrative.,"President Joe Biden tried to pre-blame Republicans for future inflation over the weekend. But his attempt to reimagine reality was quickly refuted.

What did Biden say?

In a tweet on Sunday, Biden claimed that the Republicans' agenda includes exacerbating inflation.

""If Republicans in Congress get their way, prices will go up and inflation will get worse. It’s that simple,"" Biden claimed without additional details.

As Democrats are struggling to make inroads with voters who most care about economic issues, Biden is abdicating all responsibility for the inflation crisis.

For example, after the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that inflation is not improving but worsening, Biden launched a new attack on Republicans that claims their agenda is worse for the American economy.

""Republicans in Congress’ number one priority is repealing the Inflation Reduction Act. That’s the exact wrong thing to do in this moment,"" Biden said on Thursday. ""If Republicans take control of Congress, everyday costs will go up – not down.""

Biden also said on Thursday, ""If Republicans win, inflation is going to get worse. It’s that simple.""

But what is the truth?

As the House Republican caucus pointed out, inflation has skyrocketed under Biden's leadership — not under the Republicans'.

""This is a LIE. Biden & one-party Dem rule is responsible for America’s inflation crisis,"" the House GOP said in response to Biden's tweet.

""They have NO plan to fix it. When Biden took office inflation was at 1.4% today it is at 8.2%. It has skyrocketed because of their out-of-control spending to fuel their radical agenda,"" the response added.

Under former President Donald Trump, the inflation rate remained relatively stable, hovering around the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate of 2%.

But after Biden signed his COVID pandemic relief bill into law in March 2021, inflation began increasing sharply and has remained high since. Economists believe that bill overheated the economy.

Even the New York Times acknowledged on Sunday that ""economists generally agree that the stimulus spending contributed to accelerating inflation"" in a story detailing how Democrats on the campaign trail are not boasting about Biden's stimulus package.

The Democrats' refusal to talk about it on the campaign trail suggests they know voters connect Biden to the inflation crisis — and that connection means they could lose their elections.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biden-tries-to-blame-republicans-inflation,2022-10-17
Biden's climate envoy John Kerry will fly commercial after getting called out for emitting nearly 10 million pounds of carbon,"John Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, was called out earlier this year for not practicing what he preached. When flying around the world warning of the dangers of carbon emissions, Kerry inflicted upon the environment a carbon footprint 300 times larger than the average American's in a single year. Facing continued scrutiny, he will now fly commercial — at least once.

Going where?

The State Department indicated that Kerry traveled to London in late October to participate in an onstage conversation with Chatham House about U.S. international efforts to battle so-called climate change.

From the U.K., the carbon-conscious climate envoy will fly to the United Arab Emirates.

After discussing ""regional climate action"" with Near Eastern oil barons and their beneficiaries, Kerry will head to Egypt. There he will lead the U.S. delegation to the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in discussions about possible U.S. reparations to the third world for its bad weather.

The COP27 climate change conference will take place Nov. 6-18 in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, where air conditioning runs nonstop.

Going how?

A State Department spokesman told Fox News Digital that Kerry would be flying to COP27 in a commercial jet. It is presently unclear whether his flights to the U.K. and to the Emirates will similarly be on commercial airliners. Those details may soon come to light.

Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit last week against the State Department for details of Kerry's office and its travel costs.

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, stated, ""The American people have a right to know what John Kerry is up to, what we're paying him to fly around the world, and who we pay to actually work for him.""

Fitton added that Kerry was likely responsible for ""more carbon distribution than anything else they are complaining about.""

TheBlaze previously reported that Kerry had flown over 180,000 miles when conducting his affairs as climate envoy, despite having access to high-quality teleconferencing technologies with which he could remotely engage foreign dignitaries.

Analysis conducted by the Washington Free Beacon — of fuel consumption, mileage, travel plans, and projected exhaust figures — showed that Kerry was responsible for the emission of over 9.54 million pounds (4,772 tons) of carbon since March 2021.

By way of comparison, the average American's yearly carbon footprint is 16 tons.

The accounting for these figures took into consideration Kerry's 75 official travel announcements and destinations as well as his plane's average carbon dioxide production per mile, approximately 53.3 pounds.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) thought this revealed the Biden administration's hypocrisy, telling Fox News Digital, ""Joe Biden launched his war on American energy on his first day in office, shutting down domestic energy production and making us reliant on our enemies.""

""While Americans are struggling to afford gas and being lectured about ‘transitioning’ their energy use, Biden’s cabinet is jetting around the world wasting the same fossil fuels they say they want to ban,"" added Hawley.

Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) was even more forceful and direct in his critique, saying, ""Smug, hypocritical, hammering middle-class families, and now this: John Kerry is one of the single biggest polluters and [greenhouse gas] emitters in the world. ... Once again, I call for him to resign.""

Between carbon-heavy climate conferences, Kerry's personal jet also generated some significant emissions.

The Kerry family's private jet, a Gulfstream GIV-Sp, belched over 325 metric tons of carbon dioxide between January 2021 and July 2022.

The executive director of the energy advocacy organization Power the Future, Daniel Turner, told Fox News Digital that ""John Kerry and the climate hypocrites who run the green movement ... refuse to voluntarily live how they want the rest of us to be forced to live.""

Kerry previously defended his use of a private jet to pick up a climate change leadership award in Iceland, saying, ""If you offset your carbon, it's the only choice for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle.""

Carbon offsetting involves paying off other people or organizations to reduce their emissions so you don't have to account for or adjust your own.



Kerry noted further, ""What I'm doing, almost full time ... is working to win the battle on climate change.""

Winning is not just a matter of killing American jobs and losing energy independence. For Kerry, winning also means removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, including the 5,000 tons he recently put there.

Biden's climate envoy says he's serious. Kerry told CBS News last winter that ""to avert the worst consequences of climate crisis ... we have nine years left ... There is no room for BS any more.""

Going why?



According to conference president Sameh Shoukry, the purpose of this year's COP27 gathering is to take ""meaningful and tangible steps"" to enforce the 2015 Paris climate accord.

The AP reported that some activists hope to see commitments to addressing ""loss and damage,"" whereby wealthy nations agree to pay reparations to developing nations that have suffered problems resulting from nasty weather.

Ani Dasgupta, the CEO of globalist nonprofit World Resources Institute, wrote, ""Developed countries should provide funds for addressing losses and damages not because of legal liability, but because supporting vulnerable countries is the right thing to do.""

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres recommended that Western nations confiscate profits from oil and gas companies and redistribute them to developing nations affected by bad weather.

Kerry has not yet committed the U.S. to these proposed reparations, but has indicated a willingness to discuss the possibility.

Kerry stated, ""The U.S. recognizes that increased efforts must be made to avert, minimize, and address loss and damage associated with the adverse impacts of climate change.""



Axios reported that Kerry's promises are constrained by domestic politics and that a Republican-led House could prevent the Biden administration from diverting American funds toward international climate indulgences.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bidens-climate-envoy-john-kerry-will-fly-commercial-after-getting-called-out-for-emitting-nearly-10-million-pounds-of-carbon,2022-11-03
Biden's 'non-binary' nuclear official who allegedly stole woman's suitcase accused once again of luggage theft,"Biden energy official Samuel Brinton has broke new ground this week by becoming the first openly so-called ""gender fluid"" government official to have been twice accused of stealing luggage.

Brinton, already scheduled to appear in court on Dec. 19 for having allegedly stolen a woman's designer suitcase in Minneapolis, has now been accused of stealing luggage at a Nevada airport.

What are the details?

Samuel Brinton is a nuclear engineer who serves as deputy assistant secretary for spent fuel and waste disposition in the Office of Nuclear Energy at the Department of Energy.

Just days after a group of House Republicans demanded the Biden official's resignation, a felony warrant was issued for Brinton.

KLAS reported that Brinton has been charged with grand larceny with a value between $1,200 and $5,000. The Biden official allegedly stole luggage at the Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas.

If convicted of this category B felony, Brinton could face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000, reported Newsweek.

A 'weird kind of Batman'

According the the Biden Energy Department's website, Brinton identifies ""as gender-fluid and use[s] the pronouns they, them, and theirs.""



Brinton told an MIT publication that his ""husband"" thinks of him as a ""weird kind of of Batman. Why, you might ask? Because by day I work to save lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQ) youth from suicide, and by night I work to save the world from nuclear waste related environmental disaster.""

Only a ""weird kind"" of Batman would allegedly steal luggage on multiple occasions.

TheBlaze previously reported that Brinton admitted to taking a woman's Vera Bradley luggage, valued at around $2,325, from a baggage claim carousel at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport in September.

The ""non-binary"" Biden official, who initially denied taking the woman's luggage, later claimed he had taken the suitcase accidentally on account of exhaustion.

Despite Brinton's suggestion that the alleged felony theft was accidental, the criminal complaint indicated that airport surveillance cameras caught the Sept. 16 incident on tape.

According to the complaint, footage shows Brinton taking ""a navy blue hard-sided roller bag"" from the carousel.

Although supposedly exhausted, Brinton then ""removed the blue bag's tag and put the bag tag in the handbag they were carrying"" and ""left the area at a quick pace.""

Investigators reportedly indicated that Brinton was also seen using the woman's suitcase on at least two other occasions.

Brinton faces five years for this particular crime if convicted.

On leave but not altogether gone

After the initial accusation, Brinton was quietly put on leave.

An Energy Department spokesman told Fox News in November that ""Sam Brinton is on leave from DOE, and Dr. Kim Petry is performing the duties of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Spent Fuel and Waste Disposition.""

Petry reportedly told coworkers she had been asked to stay on ""for the foreseeable future.""

The New York Post reported that a group of House Republicans called for Brinton's removal Tuesday in a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.

The letter notes that the department ""issued notice that Sam Brinton was placed on leave without providing crucial context clarifying that Brinton's recent employment status was the result of a felony charge.""

The Republicans suggested that as ""an appointed official, Sam Brinton represents both your Department and the United States. It is simply not possible for an individual to represent American values and simultaneously violate the felony laws of the land.""

""Brinton’s actions, along with your Department’s lack of transparency when dealing with this matter, reflect poorly on the Department of Energy, and they raise concern as to the Biden Administration’s priorities when appointing high-ranking officials. It is imperative that we do not allow a person charged with a felony to influence America’s policies,"" they added.

The letter concluded with a demand for Brinton's resignation and a plea for the department to ""set aside petty politics and appoint only the most qualified and dedicated individuals to influence America’s energy sector.""

The Daily Mail reported that Brinton has found ways to occupy himself in the meantime.

In late November, Brinton reportedly presented a seminar in Los Angeles entitled, ""Spanking: From Calculus to Chemistry.""

Brinton's profile on CLAW Corp.'s website reportedly noted that he had been teaching his ""Physics of Kink"" class on campuses across the country for years. According to his bio, Brinton has ""been active in the kink world since 2013, host monthly kink parties in their dungeon in Washington, DC, and estimate they have spanked over 2,000 cute butts.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bidens-non-binary-nuclear-official-who-allegedly-stole-womans-suitcase-accused-again-of-luggage-theft,2022-12-09
Bill Burr says he'll never apologize to outrage mob,"Comedian Bill Burr has never been one to back down to controversy or bend the knee to political correctness. During a recent podcast appearance, the popular stand-up comedian explained why he'll never apologize to the outrage mob.

On Thursday, Burr appeared on “Steve-O’s Wild Ride” – a podcast hosted by the star of the reality TV stunt show ""Jacka**."" Steve-O – whose real name is Stephen Gilchrist Glover – asked Burr, ""Okay I got a random question. I really thought about this because I’m genuinely curious if you’ve ever apologized for a joke?”

Burr admitted that he has apologized, but specified, ""Yeah. But I do it to the individual that I hurt.""

Burr explained that ""if I told a joke about something that somebody had a personal effect to and I made them sad or made them cry"" he would apologize to that offended individual if they were offended at a joke at one of his stand-up comedy shows.



However, Burr proclaimed that he would ""refuse to apologize to anybody that is upset that they heard a joke at a show they weren’t at.""

He said if a person got offended at a comedy special that he put out for the public, then he would consider the criticism. Burr declared he would never apologize if the negativity is coming from a person solely seeking out content to be outraged about.

Burr noted that there is so much entertainment online and on streaming services that there is plenty not to get angry at, and presented ""videos of dogs snoring"" as an example.

The comedy great said, ""But you went out of your way to f***ing watch this thing, it’s on you.""

""I am a big believer in if you are wrong, and if you feel you’re wrong, you apologize,"" he conceded. ""But I’m not a believer in the mob mentality and I’m not gonna apologize just cause it’s not worth it. Because then all I do is give that strength that it’s okay to do that and then some other comic’s going to have to deal with it.""



""The Mandolorian"" star added, ""If you come up to me after a f***king show, I’ll listen to you, and if I agree with what you’re saying I’ll be like, ‘Yeah, okay. It wasn’t a personal thing, I’m sorry. I’m sorry you went through that or whatever.’ And what I’ve found is they’ll actually be cool with you. People, anybody, like us… They want to be heard.""

Burr refuses to apologize to the ""professional being offended"" crowd who only get outraged to ""move whatever cause because you feel like you can fix society with your ideas.""

Burr warned that everything has become about ""steering"" the narrative like ""Fox News and CNN"" that ""some a**hole"" will take the audio clip without context and say, ""See! Comedians should apologize!""

"Fox News reporter directly confronts DHS sec, Democrats over border crisis. Their silence is deafening.","Fox News reporter Bill Melugin directly confronted Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and other Democrats recently about the border crisis.

But none of them were interested in providing substantive answers for a crisis that rages on unaddressed.

What happened?

First, Melugin questioned Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) whether she has ""an issue"" with a record number of unaccompanied migrants coming to the U.S., some of them dying. He also asked whether she agrees with the Biden administration that the border is ""secure.""

Pressley refused to answer either question and instead walked away from him.

Second, Melugin confronted Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), asking him whether the border is secure. Thompson refused to answer the question and immediately walked away after telling Melugin, ""I have to go give a speech.""

When Melugin approached Mayorkas, the secretary also refused to answer questions. Mayorkas, however, was more polite than Pressley or Thompson.

""I'm sorry, I don't,"" Mayorkas said when Melugin asked if he had a brief moment to discuss the border crisis.

Fox News confronts Democrats on border crisis www.youtube.com

Interestingly, the Democrats who answered Melugin's questions — Reps. Veronica Escobar, Colin Allred, and Henry Cuellar — represent districts in Texas, including those on the front lines of the border crisis.

""This is unsustainable. It has been unsustainable for years,"" Escobar told Melugin.

""This is our administration. I’m a Democrat. And you know, they need to understand they own it now,"" Cuellar said. ""They own it now. And they have to take the steps to correct this, otherwise, you know, when are we going to see an end to this?""

Speaking to party leadership, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer blamed Republicans for zero progress on immigration legislation. On the other hand, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Melugin that moderate Democrats support securing the border, but will not publicly advocate that support as long as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi remains in power.

Anything else?

The border crisis has resulted in a record number of migrants crossing the border, a record number of ""gotaways"" — migrants who evade initial detention — and a record number of migrant deaths.

Melugin's dogged reporting of the crisis, which often goes viral on social media, has angered the White House. Melugin, however, is clearly not backing down.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-melugin-confronts-democrats-border-crisis,2022-10-04
Students wouldn't be punished for 'misgendering' trans peers under Montana bill: 'Children should not be forced to call somebody something they’re not',"A Montana bill would outlaw schools from punishing students who ""misgender"" their trans peers, the Associated Press reported.

What are the details?

The proposal is co-sponsored by more than two dozen Republican lawmakers and says it's not discrimination when students use transgender classmates' legal names or refer to them by their sex, the AP said.

The bill's main sponsor — GOP state Rep. Brandon Ler — said Wednesday during a hearing that his children live on a farm and ranch and “have learned from a very young age that cows are cows and bulls are bulls"" and that gender isn't open to interpretation, the outlet reported.

“Children should not be forced to call somebody something they’re not,” Ler added, according to the AP.

The outlet said opponents of the bill acknowledge that students who accidentally use wrong pronouns or names shouldn't be punished, but schools should be allowed to respond to ""misgendering"" and ""deadnaming"" done on purpose, perhaps through an anti-bullying policy.

SK Rossi, testifying on behalf of the Human Rights Campaign — the mammoth LGBTQ rights organization — said that refusing to acknowledge a transgender student’s preferred name and pronouns is bullying, the AP reported.

“The problem with the bill is that it takes away the ability of schools and teachers and administrators to intervene when something becomes cruel, before it becomes physical,” Rossi said, according to the outlet.

Olivia Hunt, policy director for the National Center for Transgender Equity, said the bill apparently is the only legislation of its kind in the United States this year, the AP reported.

“This would make Montana unique in enshrining the right to be bigoted toward or the right to bully trans children in the state code,” Hunt added, according to the outlet.

More from the AP:

It comes amid a wave of legislation this year in Montana and other conservative states seeking to limit or ban gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth. Montana’s Senate passed a ban on gender-affirming medical care or surgery for minors on Wednesday. [...]



People representing educational organizations, pediatricians, parents of transgender children and students testified against the bill, saying it would lead to unchallenged bullying and harassment as well as anxiety and depression among transgender students.



Layla Riggs told lawmakers about defending friends who were being bullied because they are transgender or gender nonconforming. Someone once threw rocks at her and a nonbinary friend after school, she said.

“School is supposed to be a place where you are accepted and a place where your safety is supposed to be one of the top priorities,” Riggs testified, according to the outlet. “With the passage of this bill, even the illusion of safety for transgender and nonbinary students would be gone.”

Jeff Laszloffy with the Montana Family Foundation was the lone supporter of the bill to testify in favor of it, telling lawmakers it would protect students from possibly facing civil lawsuits over using the wrong pronoun or name, the AP said.

How are folks reacting?

There are more than 2,500 comments as of Thursday morning under the AP story that appeared on Yahoo News, and while certainly there are opponents to the bill, others say it's protecting students' First Amendment rights:

""As a freedom of speech issue, this is a whole new twist. There is a big difference between recognizing the right to say what you want (with some exception) and being forced to say something,"" one commenter noted. ""This law would prevent a whole new angle being pushed by the left. Requiring people to use certain words is not something we do anywhere in society...that is a whole new violation of free speech. It is literally requiring everyone to believe what most people don't believe. It would actually force words in your mouth that you don't want to say. It is not defensible.""

""It is not bullying to call someone by their birth gender; it is bullying to force someone to accept a preferred gender,"" another commenter said. ""I have no problem calling someone by their legal name, so if they have had a legal name change, I will address them by that name. It would be bullying if they tried to force me to call them a name that is not their legal name. They have no right to force me or anybody else to acknowledge their fantasy.""

""'In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, nor to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is to co-operate with evil, and in some small way to become evil oneself. One’s standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control,'"" one commenter wrote, quoting conservative British cultural critic Theodore Dalrymple.

4-year-old biological girl declares 'boy' identity at Pride Parade as cannon blasts blue confetti and crowd 'cheered him on',"A 4-year-old biological girl announced a ""boy"" identity at a Pride Parade in Canada recently as a cannon blasted blue confetti into the air and an adoring crowd cheered.

What are the details?

The New York Post — citing South West News Service — reported that Charlie Danger Lloyd ""was assigned female at birth but from a young age expressed he was a boy, his mom said.""

Video from the Vancouver Pride Parade shows Charlie dressed in a transgender flag cape alongside ""Grammy,"" who was wearing a rainbow pride flag as a cape, in the middle of a street firing the blue confetti-filled cannon.

“Once they closed the road, Charlie strutted out with Grammy, and they faced the sidelines and after a short struggle, the cannon exploded with blue smoke and biodegradable confetti,” Charlie's mom, 27-year-old Alaina Bourrel, told SWNS, according to the Post.

With that, Charlie ran into Mom's arms.

“Charlie jumped with joy as the crowd cheered him on. He couldn’t believe the love and support he was shown from the bystanders,"" Bourrel added to SWNS, according to the Post.

Bourrel also told the outlet she's been attacked online by those who call her a “pedophile, groomer, and rapist” due to Charlie's transition, the Post reported.

But Bourrel noted to SWNS that Charlie began expressing different gender needs at the age of 2, constantly telling family about wanting to be “growing to look just like daddy” and “I’m a boy,"" the Post said.

Charlie's mother told the outlet the Pride Parade idea came after Charlie was told the family held a previous gender reveal prior to Charlie's birth — and the smoke didn’t work properly, the Post reported.

“When we told him the story, he asked for a re-do ... at the Vancouver Pride Parade — so we bought him a smoke cannon and tucked it away for this day,” Bourrel said, according to the paper.

'He wasn’t your typical little girl'

“He wasn’t your typical little girl. He would play with other boys and the parents would say he was more of a boy than their own children,” Bourrel recalled, the Post said, adding that by the end of 2021 Charlie didn’t want to shop in the girls' section and wanted short hair.

“He refused to shop in the girls' section but was too nervous to shop in the boys',” Charlie's mother added, according to the paper. “After lots of expressing his feelings and emotions with me, he decided that he wanted a new wardrobe, so we set out to find our new style.”



Charlie got a haircut ""at Big Bros Barbershop, a trans-owned and operated salon in East Vancouver,” Bourell added, the Post said. “After leaving the salon that afternoon, Charlie was a completely new child.”

Bourell also told the outlet that family and friends have been supportive of Charlie: “His choices were not questioned, and he was congratulated and everyone began using new pronouns.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/biological-girl-4-declares-boy-identity-at-pride-parade,2022-08-10
Twitter reactions: Black national anthem played at Super Bowl,"For the third straight year, the black national anthem was performed at the Super Bowl. NFL fans were deeply divided on whether it was appropriate to perform the black national anthem before Super Bowl 57.

Before the Philadelphia Eagles took on the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, 10-time Academy of Country Music award-winner Chris Stapleton sang the national anthem. Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds – a 12-time Grammy Award-winning recording artist, songwriter, and producer – sang ""America the Beautiful.""

Emmy-winning actress and singer Sheryl Lee Ralph sang ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" which was designated as the ""black national anthem"" in 1917 by the NAACP.

Reactions on Twitter show NFL fans were staunchly opposed and vehemently supportive of the black national anthem being performed at Super Bowl LVII.

Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.): ""America only has ONE NATIONAL ANTHEM. Why is the NFL trying to divide us by playing multiple!? Do football, not wokeness.""

TheBlaze contributor Delano Squires: ""I grew up singing 'Lift Every Voice and Sing' during assembly in my all-black elementary school. We also sang the Star Spangled Banner and said the pledge. It’s a beautiful hymn, but I feel like it’s being used by people who think we need a new founding (1619), flag, and anthem.""

Political pundit CJ Pearson: ""The National Anthem is for EVERY American. What’s the purpose of a black one? Super Bowl Sunday should UNITE America, not divide it by race. It’s not the 1960s.""

TheBlaze contributor T.J. Moe: ""Thank God we played the 'blacknational anthem.' Nothing screams unity like separating everything.""

Police officer and podcast host Zeek Arkham: ""My 'black' National Anthem is the same anthem I've been singing since I was a child. The same one children of all races have been singing. My National Anthem never needed a color. Do they want racism to die, or do they want to keep finding ways to divide us all?""

Former GOP candidate Lavern Spicer: ""The BlackNational Anthem is the Star Spangled Banner. The White National Anthem is the Star Spangled Banner. The Mixed National Anthem is the Star Spangled Banner. If you live in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, your National Anthem is the Star Spangled Banner.""

Commentator Matt Walsh: ""No other country on Earth is ridiculous enough to permit different racial groups to perform their own national anthems before major events.""

Actor Kevin Sorbo: ""The @NFL is going to play a black national anthem before the Super Bowl. Seems racist and divisive.""

Radio host Gerry Callahan: ""The 'Black National Anthem' could be the single best example of corporate cowardice and shameless pandering in American history. You have one national anthem or no national anthem. Roger Goodell is pathetic.""

Students for Trump founder Ryan Fournier: ""There is no Blacknational anthem. There is no White national anthem. There is no Hispanic national anthem. There is only THE National Anthem. God Bless America!""

Former GOP candidate James Bradley: ""Having a black national anthem is just another way that Democrats keep us divided.""

Political commentator Jack Posobiec: ""The only thing that can unite America forever is creating separate national anthems for each different ethnic groups. I demand each one be played before every game Especially the Super Bowl.""

There were people who supported the black national anthem being played at the Super Bowl.

Republican strategist Paris Dennard: ""'Lift Every Voice and Sing' was a poem written by Republican, James Weldon Johnson in 1900. His brother put it to music and it was first performed by children at Johnson’s segregated FL elementary school to celebrate Pres. Abraham Lincoln’s birthday – which is today.""

Forbes writer Exavier Pope: ""It’s informally called the Black National Anthem, but that’s not the name of the song & when the song is referenced by Black people, we use the formal title of the song. Also, to refuse the song is to dismiss its origin, history, it’s lineage, & all the reasons it STILL matters.""

Journalist Skylar Baker-Jordan: ""'Lift Every Voice and Sing' has been called the Black national anthem for longer than 'The Star-Spangled Banner' has been the U.S. national anthem. This tweet is for all the conservatives currently or about to lose their s**t over a song praising God and freedom.""

Public education activist Mitchell Robinson: ""Please add 'Black national anthem' to pronouns, books, schools, LGBTQ folks, and the other harmless things that frighten conservatives.""

Screenwriter Matt Mikalatos: ""What's especially baffling to me is Christians complaining about a hymn playing before the Super Bowl. Maybe they should reflect on the lyrics.""

A previously recorded version of the black national anthem sung by Alicia Keys was played at Super Bowl LV in 2021. Gospel duo Mary Mary and Youth Orchestra performed ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"" during Super Bowl LVI in 2022.

"'Black supremacist' posts video of herself speaking at her father's funeral — and blasting him as a 'racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, Trump-loving, cis straight white man'","A TikTok user who called herself a ""black supremacist"" in her bio is getting some attention for a video on her page that she said shows her speaking at her father's funeral — and in it she blasts him as a ""racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, Trump-loving, cis straight white man.""

Image source: TikTok bio @sageinthesunforever

The video is from @saginthesunforever; it was posted Nov. 6 and has received more than 174,000 views as of Thursday afternoon. Since @saginthesunforever's account was made private Thursday afternoon — and her bio was wiped as well — here's a look at the video in question, courtesy of Libs of TikTok:

Here's what @saginthesunforever said from the stage; there were gasps at certain points. And while one listener in the crowd was heard hollering, ""Aww, come on!"" after the speech, there also was applause:

""But Dad, please know that while I am grateful and highly aware of all that you've given this family, I still don't miss you. When you died, I felt like there was a hole. I missed something, but it wasn't you. It was the idea of what you could become. I missed being able to hope and wish that one day you'd turn a corner and see the world from my perspective. I missed the idea that one day you might help me fight for the things that matter. I missed my fantasy of you. Because when you died it solidified the fact that you'll never be what you could have been but only what you are. And what you are is a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, Trump-loving cis straight white man. That is all you will ever be to me. And Dad, before you tell me to respect the dead, please remember that you disrespected and disregarded the lives and deaths of entire communities of people with your ideology. You told me to never back down, so I won't. You know for a fact that ... I'm not afraid to share my piece. You are everything I aspire not to be, and I refuse to stand up here and sing the praises of a man who is the paradigm of white supremacy. So I'll take your racist mindset, I'll take your money, and I'll take your advice. And I swear to God I will make this world a better place, not at all because of you, but in exact opposition to you. Thank you.""

It turns out @saginthesunforever, also on Nov. 6, posted a shorter clip from her speech that has attracted over 1.7 million views. The text accompanying it reads, ""Friendly reminder that [I don't give a f***] and WILL say what needs to be said every single time.""

How are viewers reacting?

Nearly 1,800 comments as of Thursday afternoon have been left with the longer clip, and an initial look at them shows commenters by and large love the video:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/black-supremacist-blasts-father-at-funeral,2022-11-17
'We as a society have failed if we stand by': BlazeTV's Sara Gonzales shuts down Disney-themed drag show for kids,"A bar in Denton, Texas, had planned an all-ages drag event for September 11 entitled ""Cool Beans Drag Brunch: Disney Edition."" The event, open to children, would feature men dressed as scantily clad female Disney characters to whom children could give cash. The event was canceled owing to the initiative taken by BlazeTV's Sara Gonzales.

Upon looking into the event, Gonzales, the host of ""The News & Why It Matters,"" recognized that the Disney theme reflected a choice ""to immerse young children into drag queen culture by merging it with something all children love: Disney.""

Gonzales told TheBlaze that ""we as a society have failed if we stand by and watch mentally ill parents expose their children to these shows and think it's none of our business.""

The event and ones like it aren't merely unacceptable. Gonzales reckoned the exposure of ""young children to sexually explicit shows where men dress up like women and dance provocatively for money [to be] child abuse. And child abuse is everybody's business.""

Keen not to stand idly by, Gonzales took to Twitter on September 8, writing ""Cool Beans Bar and Grill in Denton, TX is hosting an ALL AGES drag show THIS SUNDAY. Who's coming with me to shut it down?""

Gonzales' post garnered thousands of likes and hundreds of retweets, generating sufficient pressure on the bar to cancel the event.

Among those who circulated Gonzales' call to action was former state Senator Don Huffines (R-Texas), who wrote ""The devil is coming for your kids. What are you going to do to stop this madness?""

Turning the tables: a successful protest

A Denton city council staff report indicated that on September 8, Mayor Gerard Hudspeth had sought information regarding the rights of businesses and what precisely the city could regulate. His office was reportedly advised that ""the City would not regulate an event such as this unless it met the definition of a special event under the code"" and that the Disney drag event was not ""a sexually oriented business under the City's zoning.""



While authorities could not have prevented the event, they did not necessarily help facilitate it amidst growing protest.

The Texas GOP suggested in a tweet that Sheriff Tracy Murphree had refused to provide security for the event, helping to ensure its cancellation.

Safety concerns were cited in the bar's Friday Facebook announcement as cause for the event's cancellation. ""Having a safe space that day, or any day, takes precedence over all else ... Our drag brunch has caught a lot of attention from certain political groups who have made it very clear that they aren't happy about this event,"" read the release. ""To those of you who have forced us to make this decision, shame on you! ... This is not a 'win' for you.""



The bar further alleged that it had received ""aggressive phone calls and hateful comments.""

What Cool Beans attributed to hatred, Gonzales characterized as justified moral outrage. ""The overwhelming majority of Americans do NOT agree with the sexualization of children,"" she said, ""but too many are scared of being called 'phobic' of something.""



She indicated further that the successful shutdown of this event is replicable, given the courage. ""Stop being afraid. We are the majority and we have to speak up and make it known before it's too late.""

What it took in this instance is what it will take every time: ""Call the businesses and let them know. Send them emails. Protests the events. Show up.""

Line in the sand

Drag shows involving and targeting children have become a new front in the culture wars.

The Idaho GOP suggested last week that these events, involving the ""imposition of adult sexuality & adult sexual appetites on children,"" are tantamount to ""the sexualization of children.""

Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar (R) wrote on Thursday that drag shows for kids are ""child sex abuse, plain and simple.""

While a host of Republicans have condemned the embroilment of children in drag events, some Democrats have gone beyond passively supporting them.

Scott Wiener, the Democratic state senator in California who introduced a bill keeping those who sodomized minors ten years their junior off of sex offender lists, quipped about incorporating ""Drag Queen 101"" into the K-12 curriculum.

New York Mayor Eric Adams (D) seriously endorsed drag queen story hour for kids in June.

The leftist magazine Salon published an article on June 30 that recommended exposing children to drag shows, because doing so ""starts the conversation about queer history, oppression, and activism"" and ""normalizes this diversity.""

""The left knows the way you make long-lasting, multi-generational changes in culture is to indoctrinate the youth,"" said Gonzales.

The normalization and exposure advocated in the Salon article is par for the course. ""Once they expose young children to the LGBT community, to being gender fluid, to men wearing dresses and appropriating women, they can normalize all of it.""

Gonzales referenced the influx of pornographic materials into schools and noted such material serves as a prong of the same attack on children.

As evidenced by the successful shutdown of the Disney drag event, the problem may be political in nature, but the solution is left up to individuals. ""If you want to save the morality this country has left for your children and your children's children, you have to speak out and you have to show up. Don't expect someone else to do it for you. The time is now.""

Neither the first nor the last to be shut down

This is not the first drag event targeting children that has been canceled due to protest and pressure in recent months.



A drag show planned for June 24, in which everyone including children were encouraged to bring money to give to the performers, was canceled after the Libs of TikTok account drew attention to the event.

After significant backlash, the Boise Pride Festival noted last week that it it would postpone its planned taxpayer-subsidized drag show sexualizing child performers.

Gonzales hinted on Twitter that after shutting down the Disney drag event in Denton, she would be turning her attention to Katy, Texas. On September 24, in Katy, Texas, the First Christian Church will be hosting an all-ages ""drag bingo"" event.

"BLM founder accuses Biden, elected officials of 'deep cowardice' for refusing to defund police","In a recent interview with the Guardian, Black Lives Matter founder Patrisse Cullors accused President Joe Biden (D) and other elected officials of ""deep cowardice"" for refusing to defund the police. According to Cullors, the administration chose to allocate more funding to law enforcement after the activist movement helped get Biden elected.



Cullors, a self-described Marxist, co-founded BLM in 2013 with Alicia Garza and Ayọ Tometi — then known as Opal Tometi. Cullors stepped down from her executive director position with the BLM organization after coming under fire for purchasing several multimillion-dollar homes.

In an interview with the Guardian published Sunday, Cullors accused law enforcement of having an inherited ""culture of violence"" that can only be prevented when ""courageous elected officials make it stop.""

She noted the recent deaths of Tyre Nichols and her cousin, Keenan Anderson.

""Every year, families, community members, organizers have said this must stop and there's a different way to do this,"" Cullors stated. ""And yet there has been deep cowardice from officials. The burden is on the officials who create the budgets for the police and other resources, who turn away from the violence and continue it in their departments.""

The activist pointed direct blame at Biden and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

""It's truly a failure of leadership at the highest level, all the way up to our president,"" Cullors continued. ""This movement was able to help get Joe Biden into office, and yet in his first State of the Union address, he yelled: 'Fund the police.'""

She referred to Biden's actions as a ""direct affront"" to the BLM movement.

In August 2022, during a speech regarding the administration's ""Safer America"" plan, Biden stated, ""When it comes to public safety in this nation, the answer is not 'defund the police,' it's 'fund the police.'""

The administration's plan sought to allocate $35 billion to support law enforcement and crime prevention in the 2023 fiscal year.

Cullors called on elected officials to remove law enforcement officers from traffic stops, which she referred to as a ""very reasonable demand."" She noted that Berkeley, Philadelphia, and Seattle are already piloting programs that remove police officers from traffic stops.

She urged Buttigieg to ""lead a conversation about what federal dollars could fund programs to remove law enforcement from traffic stops.""

According to Cullors, ""The people who hold the power have chosen not to wield it on behalf of Black life. They've chosen to side with violent police forces.""

Bob Marley's grandson dead at 31 after long battle with chronic condition,"A grandson of legendary reggae musician Bob Marley has, like his grandfather before him, died much too soon. Joseph Mersa Marley, aka Jo Mersa, passed away on Tuesday. He was just 31 years old.

According to reports, Mersa, a Jamaica native, was found unresponsive in his vehicle in an undisclosed area of the United States. Though an official cause of death has yet to be determined, Mersa had reportedly suffered from chronic asthma since childhood. Some early reports out of Florida stated that he died of an asthma attack, but those reports have not yet been confirmed.

Mersa, who was born a decade after his famous grandfather died, attempted to make his mark on the music scene as well. He studied studio engineering at Miami Dade College and released his first album, ""Comfortable,"" in 2014, when he was 23. His latest album, aptly titled ""Eternal,"" was released in 2021. According to his Instagram account, he gave his last live performance in Fort Lauderdale on November 13.

The following video shows Mersa covering some of his grandfather's greatest hits, including ""Three Little Birds"" and ""One Love"":

Bob Marley is fondly remembered as a proud native of Jamaica, a pioneer of reggae music, and a proponent of the Rastafari religion, though he was baptized into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church shortly before his death. Bob Marley was also a notorious philanderer who fathered at least 11 children with several different women, even while married. Stephen Marley, the father of Jo Mersa, was the second son born to Bob Marley and his wife, Rita Anderson.

In 1977, Bob Marley was diagnosed with a type of malignant melanoma, better known as skin cancer. Against the advice of doctors, Marley refused to amputate his toe, where the cancer was first discovered, and the disease metastasized. He died in May 1981 and was honored with a state funeral in Jamaica. He was just 36.

Bob Marley and Jo Mersa have both been survived by Stephen Marley, 50, who continues to make and perform music from his home in Miami. Mersa is also survived by his wife, Qiara, and daughter, Sunshine.

The prime minister of Jamaica, Andrew Holness, issued a statement after Mersa's passing.

""My heartfelt sympathies to Joseph's friends and associates and to the Reggae music fraternity and fans everywhere,"" Holness wrote via Instagram.

Top Senate Democrat blasts 'deeply disturbing' prisoner swap that released prolific arms dealer,"A top Democratic senator and members of the Biden administration are speaking out about President Joe Biden's controversial decision to swap Viktor ""Merchant of Death"" Bout for Brittney Griner.

Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Biden's decision to give up Bout ""deeply disturbing.""

""The Russians and other regimes that take American citizens hostage cannot pretend that there is equivalence between the Brittney Griners of the world and people like Viktor Bout, the so-called ‘Merchant of Death,'"" he said in a statement. ""Nothing could be further from the truth, and we cannot ignore that releasing Bout back into the world is a deeply disturbing decision.""



""This should be a moment of deep reflection for the United States government to recognize we have a serious problem with hostage-taking of Americans,"" he also said.

What is the backstory?

Senior Biden administration officials who spoke with Politico disclosed that Russia refused the U.S. proposal to release both Griner and Paul Whelan in exchange for Bout.

The only way Russia would release both Americans is if the U.S. government released Bout and secured the release of Vadim Krasikov, a former KGB colonel and convicted murderer, a proposal that had been previously reported.

Politico explained:

The two-for-one push by Washington made sense since some U.S. officials questioned the wisdom of giving up a man who enabled the use of child soldiers, torture, amputations and aided the Taliban in Afghanistan for a basketball player, no matter how just her cause. Bringing home Griner and Whelan for Bout was a fairer swap, U.S. officials assessed.

""Due to the nature of the sham espionage charges Russia levied against Paul, the Russians have continued to treat his situation differently from Brittney’s and rejected each and every one of our proposals for his release,"" an administration official told Politico.

""It was a choice between bringing home one particular American, Brittney Griner, or bringing home none,"" the official said. ""He made the very painful decision to provide the clemency necessary to get this done and, indeed, to get it done.""

American officials, meanwhile, insist they will continue negotiating for Whelan's release.

It's not clear, however, what leverage the U.S. now holds to secure Whelan's freedom without Bout, whom American officials fear will return to his old way of life.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/bob-menendez-brittney-griner-prisoner-swap,2022-12-09
CNN tries to get Boris Johnson to bash the US — but he refuses to take the bait: 'A shining city on a hill',"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson refused to bash the United States on Sunday when asked if he is ""worried"" about a decline of democracy in America.

What happened?

Speaking with CNN anchor Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union,"" Tapper claimed his international friends are voicing concern that American democracy is eroding. Johnson promptly dismissed such concerns.

""When I talk to friends in Canada, the U.K., Australia, and elsewhere, people express concern about the United States— in terms of our ability and our institutions to thrive and continue after what happened with the election of 2020,"" Tapper began. ""They’re worried that democracy is on life support in the United States.""

""Are you worried at all?"" Tapper asked.



""No!"" Johnson immediately responded.

""You're not?"" Tapper followed up.

""I want to say this to the people of the United States: I'm not,"" Johnson confirmed.

""I guess get back to what I have been trying to say to you throughout this interview, I think that reports of the death of democracy in the United States are grossly, grossly exaggerated. America is a shining city on a hill,"" Johnson explained. ""And it will continue to be so.""

When Tapper pressed Johnson further about the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, Johnson admitted it was ""pretty weird"" but refused to criticize America.

""Looking from the outside, it was pretty weird,"" Johnson said. ""But I don't believe that American democracy is under serious threat, far from it. I continue to believe that America is the greatest global guarantor of democracy and freedom.""

Anything else?

Earlier in the interview, however, Johnson reaffirmed his declaration that America took a ""big step backwards"" when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

Johnson described the high court ruling as ""important psychologically for people around the world,"" but he denied that it diminishes the U.S. as the global symbol of freedom.

""The United States for me, it remains a shining city on the hill,"" Johnson said. ""And it's an incredible guarantor of values, democracy, freedom around the world.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boris-johnson-refuses-to-bash-united-states,2022-06-27
"Boston Public Schools announces 'temporary masking' period for students, teachers upon return from Christmas break","One of the largest school districts in the country made waves Friday by announcing a ""temporary masking"" period for students and staff upon return to classes at the end of the winter break.

As an indicator of how politically toxic such a measure is, even in deep blue Boston, the letter sent to parents by BPS president Mary Skipper studiously avoided calling the policy a mandate, and in fact said it was ""not a mandate."" The letter even underlined the point by stating, ""No one will be disciplined or sent home if they refuse to wear a mask.""

Skipper justified the policy to WBZ by saying there has been a ""significant increase in pediatric hospitalizations"" due to the combined effect of RSV, COVID and the flu in the area. She did not point to any scientific study suggesting that masking would be an effective mitigation strategy against these diseases.

Still, while the letter stated that BPS employees were ""asked and expected to begin masking"" on their return to school Jan. 3rd, the letter made clear that even district employees were not being mandated to mask, and further stated that this ""temporary masking period"" would only last 8 school days.

Although many liberals have cried out for the return of wildly unpopular and unproven masking mandates in response to a recent uptick in COVID cases, these calls have largely been ignored by city and state governments, as well as school boards. Two school districts in New Jersey did announce earlier this week that they would enforce mask mandates upon a return to school after the winter break.

Although COVID-19 cases have seen a very slight uptick nationwide in recent weeks, the CDC reports that weekly new case totals remain below 500,000, a paltry total compared to previous surges which have seen weekly case totals of over 5 million in some cases. Also, COVID death totals have remained below 5,000 per week consistently since March and do not appear to be trending upwards with the recent case count. Hospitalizations are likewise up slightly but still are less than 25% of the total seen during the Omicron surge of January 2022.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boston-public-schools-announces-temporary-masking-period-for-students-teachers-upon-return-from-christmas-break,2022-12-31
Boston to pay $2.1M settlement following 5 years of litigation for refusing to fly Christian flag outside City Hall,"On Tuesday, the city of Boston agreed to a $2.1 million settlement for refusing to fly a Christian flag outside City Hall in 2017, WCVB reported. The case made it to the U.S. Supreme Court in May, where the justices unanimously ruled against the city.



Christian legal organization Liberty Counsel represented city resident Hal Shurtleff and Camp Constitution, a Christian civic organization, in the case against the city of Boston.

According to Liberty Counsel, the $2.1 million settlement will cover the attorney fees and other costs associated with the litigation.

Matt Staver, Liberty Counsel founder and chairman, said in a statement, ""We are pleased that, after five years of litigation and a unanimous victory at the U.S. Supreme Court, we joined with Hal Shurtleff to finally let freedom fly in Boston, the Cradle of Liberty.""

Boston City Hall told Fox News Digital that Liberty Counsel was ""entitled to attorney fees by statute as the prevailing party in a civil rights case.""

""Settlement at this time also allows the city to avoid the costs and uncertainty associated with further litigation in this case,"" a city spokesperson noted.

What's the background?

Shurtleff and Camp Constitution requested a permit from the city in 2017 to hoist a Christian flag on one of the three poles on Boston's City Hall Plaza for Constitution Day. The city denied their request and argued that flying the flag would improperly promote a particular religion.

According to Liberty Counsel, Boston approved 284 flags between 2005 and 2017, with no denials, leading Shurtleff and Camp Constitution to believe that the request was denied because the flag was referred to as ""Christian"" on the request form.

Throughout the five-year legal battle, four lower courts ruled in favor of the city before the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year. All nine Supreme Court justices unanimously ruled that Boston had violated Shurtleff's right to free speech by refusing the fly the flag.

The court noted that, at the time of Shurtleff's request, Boston ""had no written policies or clear internal guidance about what flags groups could fly and what those flags would communicate."" Since then, the city has passed an ordinance that clarifies flag raisings rules.

""Indeed, the city's practice was to approve flag raisings without exception — that is, until petitioners' request,"" Justice Stephen Breyer wrote. ""Because the flag-raising program did not express government speech, Boston's refusal to let petitioners fly their flag violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/boston-to-pay-settlement-5-years-of-litigation-for-refusing-to-fly-christian-flag-outside-city-hall,2022-11-11
Brave citizen speaks out as Uvalde mayor attacks press for leaking video of police response: 'Are they chickens**t?',"Uvalde, Texas, Mayor Don McLaughlin blasted the press on Tuesday for leaking surveillance footage that lays bare the horrendous police response to the Uvalde gunman.

The video, published by the Austin American-Statesman and KVUE-TV, shows police responded to the school just minutes after the rampage began. However, for nearly 1.5 hours, police loitered outside the classroom where the killer had barricaded himself and refused to engage him, which could have potentially saved more lives.

The shocking video even shows some officers engaging in casual activities like checking cellphones and using a hand sanitizer dispenser in the hallway.

What did McLaughlin say?

Speaking at an Uvalde City Council meeting, McLaughlin condemned the press for publishing the video before victims' families had the opportunity to see it for themselves.

""I want to go on the record: The way that video was released today was one of the most chicken things I've ever seen,"" McLaughlin said.



According to the mayor, officials had planned to meet with victims' families on Sunday, where they would be offered a report on the police response and given the opportunity to review an edited version of the video. The version leaked to the press included footage of the killer as he shot into the classroom and audio of gunshots.

""There was no reason for those families to have to see that. They were going to see the video, but they didn’t need to see the gunman coming in and hear the gunshots,"" McLaughlin said. ""They don’t need to relive that. They’ve been through enough.""

Uvalde Councilman Ernest King later chimed in, ""The mayor said 'chicken' — it was chickens**t to release that video the way you did.""

""Yeah,"" McLaughlin agreed.

What did the citizen say?

As King continued to blast the media, claiming the outlets published the video for money and attention, an audience member interrupted to ask about the police response.

""What about the cops? Are they chickens**t?"" the citizen interjected.

Then, directing his inquiry toward McLaughlin, the man, whom the mayor identified as ""Adam,"" said, ""You still think [the cops] did a good job?""

""Adam, I'm not going to get into an argument with you on that,"" McLaughlin responded before defending some of the officers.

""You should ask everybody what they think —"" the man was responding when McLaughlin interrupted.

""I know what everybody thinks, and we need to let the investigation come through,"" McLaughlin said.

Another man in the audience then pointed out the irony of the council blasting the media. ""You should attack those cops who did nothing,"" that person said.

McLaughlin then accused the man whom he identified as ""Adam"" of ""missing the point"" because ""you only hear what you want to hear."" The mayor then promised accounability for all law enforcement involved.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brave-citizen-speaks-out-as-uvalde-mayor-attacks-press-for-leaking-video-of-police-response-are-they-chickens-t,2022-07-13
CBS anchor corners senior Biden adviser with her own answer while grilling her on border crisis: 'What is the White House doing?',"CBS News anchor Margaret Brennan grilled senior Biden adviser Keisha Lance Bottoms on Sunday over President Joe Biden's inaction on the border crisis.

While interviewing Bottoms on ""Face the Nation,"" Brennan wasted no time getting down to brass tacks. With Republicans and Democrats both placing blame for the border crisis at Biden's feet, Brennan wanted to know exactly what the administration is doing to alleviate the crisis.

""What is the administration doing to urge migrants not to come?"" she asked.

Bottoms, the former mayor of Atlanta, did not directly answer the question. Instead, she focused her response on Title 42 ending this week, which means migrants will be allowed to stay in the U.S. while immigration courts process their asylum requests.

Brennan used Bottoms' question-dodging response to press her point.

""This will means more people coming into the United States,"" Brennen pointed out. ""So that's why I come back to that fundamental question of what is the White House doing to say, don't come to the border and try to claim asylum?""

Bottoms responded with a vague answer. She said the government wants ""people to avail themselves of a lawful process"" and said the U.S. border crisis a is ""global issue."" She did not say Biden is urging migrants to stop coming to the U.S.

Keisha Lance Bottoms says end of Title 42 is an issue that ""affects us all"" www.youtube.com

Later in the interview, Brennan questioned Bottoms over Biden's refusal to visit the U.S. border despite recently traveling to within hours of it.

""Why doesn't he go to the border? He was just in Arizona. Why wasn't it worth his time?"" she asked.

At first, Bottoms suggested that logistics difficulties associated with presidential travel is why Biden has not visited the border. Then, when pressed on the issue, she deflected and said, ""Well, I can't speak to why he has or has not gone.""

Anything else?

At the White House press briefing on Monday, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre emphasized the ""border is not open.""

""I wanna be very clear to folks that the border is not open,"" she said.

While that may be the rhetoric coming from Biden's spokespeople, the point his critics are making is that Biden's immigration policies are inviting migrants to come to the U.S. Indeed, the border does not need an ""open"" sign to signal to migrants that, if they claim asylum at the border, they have a good chance of not being deported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brennan-grills-bottoms-border-crisis,2022-12-19
Brit Hume rebukes January 6 committee as partisan,"Brit Hume delivered a scathing rebuke of the January 6 committee this week. The Fox News senior political analyst noted that in 50 years of covering Washington, D.C. politics, he's ""never seen a committee all of whose members were chosen by one party.""

Hume was responding to a tweet by Washington Examiner chief political correspondent Byron York.

""There's a long tradition of adversarial process in congressional hearings/investigations,"" York wrote on Friday. ""You don't have to compare it to a trial to know something is wrong with the J6 committee.""



Hume tacked on to York's post, ""I've covered Washington for more than 50 years, including 11 years covering Congress specifically. I’ve never seen a committee all of whose members were chosen by one party, and where there is no cross-examination or any attempt to present both sides.""

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) pushed back against Hume's assertation.

""Hey Brit. It’s been all Republicans testifying. Definitely one-sided, just not in how you think it is,"" the ""never-Trump"" Republican tweeted. ""And as you well know, Kevin McCarthy took his ball and went home. You all sound nervous.""

Hume had previously hammered the Jan. 6 committee for being partisan.

On July 1, the Fox News commentator criticized the Jan. 6 committee and media, ""Hyping the events to increase interest, knowing most of the media will eagerly play along is what this committee does best."" He included a link to an article written by York titled: ""The Jan. 6 committee charade.""

On June 11, Hume labeled the primetime hearing as an ""utterly one-sided presentation.""

On June 13, Hume belittled the Jan. 6 committee as ""a televised press release with soundbites.""

""I've never seen anything quite like it in my life, and I certainly never imagined back in the day when I was working for one of the broadcast networks' news divisions, that such an event would ever be put on primetime television by one of the networks,"" he declared during a Fox News appearance. ""And in this case, it was done by all of them. Quite remarkable.""

Brit Hume rips Jan. 6 hearing: A ‘televised press release with soundbites’ www.youtube.com

On June 7, he tweeted, ""It is not normal for a supposedly bipartisan committee to have its members all chosen by one party.""

Hume included a video clip of his appearance on Fox News' ""Special Report.""

Hume pointed out that the Jan. 6 committee is comprised of Democrats Adam Schiff, Jamie Raskin, Bennie Thompson, Zoe Lofgren, Pete Aguilar, Stephanie Murphy, and Elaine Luria. He also noted that the ""one-sided"" committee had anti-Trump Republicans Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger hand-selected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

Hume called Cheney and Kinzinger are ""Republican members who could be counted on to agree with the conclusions already reached by"" Pelosi.

""This is very much a partisan hearing, which is not to say that interesting facts won’t come out and they won’t make an interesting presentation in primetime but, look, this is only partially a hearing to determine the facts,"" Hume told host Brett Baier. ""It is as much as anything else an effort to give the Democrats an issue that they can run on when nearly all the other issues that people care about are working against them.""



Rasmussen Reports noted that the Capitol riot or the January 6 committee did not make the top nine midterm issues for U.S. voters. However, issues that are hurting Democrats make up the top four: rising gas prices, inflation, the economy, and violent crime.

Hume conceded that President Donald Trump's behavior following the 2020 election was ""outrageous"" and ""utterly disgraceful."" However, he doesn't believe that the Jan. 6 committee will be able to prove that the United States was close to losing its democracy, as Democrats have blustered.



Hume said on June 23, ""The 1/6 committee is pounding home the point that Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election. He certainly did. But the testimony has not come close to establishing Chairman Bennie Thompson's claim that we came 'critically close to losing our democracy' that day.""

""That's because, as the testimony has shown, Trump's scheme was utterly half-assed,"" he continued. ""The legal theory on which it rested was ridiculous. Its linchpin was refusal by vice president Pence to refuse to count the 2020 electoral votes showing Joe Biden the winner. When Pence refused, the scheme collapsed.""

""All this happened in the context of an ugly riot, which Trump had triggered, not by what he said on 1/6 but by the stolen-election bs he had been feeding his supporters for two months,"" he stated. ""In the end, the electoral vote count was delayed for several hours, but went forward that day. Outrageous behavior by a president unable to admit error or defeat to be sure. But the near-death of American democracy? Not even close.""

Last July, Pelosi rejected two appointees chosen by Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to serve on the House Select Committee to investigate the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. In response to Pelosi rejecting House Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), McCarthy yanked all five of the Republicans he had selected to sit on the January 6 committee.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/brit-hume-jan-6-committee,2022-07-02
Brooke Shields reveals she was raped by Hollywood insider,"Actress Brooke Shields revealed that she was raped by a Hollywood insider early in her acting career. The ""Blue Lagoon"" actress made the revelation of being a victim of sexual assault in her new documentary ""Pretty Baby.""

Shields made her cinematic debut at just 11 years old in the movie ""Alice, Sweet Alice."" A year later, Shields starred as a child prostitute in the controversial film ""Pretty Baby."" Shields appeared nude in the movie and kissed 29-year-old actor Keith Carradine. As a teen, Shields was cast in sexualized roles for ""Blue Lagoon"" and ""Endless Love.""

In 1983, Shields paused her Hollywood career to attend Princeton University. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in Romance languages, she wanted to restart her acting career.

Shields said she had dinner with a Hollywood insider to discuss prospects for her return to acting. The man, who Shields did not identify, convinced her to come back to his hotel room while she waited for a taxi to pick her up.

""And I go up to the hotel room, and he disappears for awhile,"" Shields said in the new documentary.



Shields recalled that there was nothing to do, so she picked up a pair of binoculars and watched volleyball players outside of the hotel window. The man allegedly returned to the room naked, according to Entertainment Weekly.

""I put the binoculars down and he's right on me,"" Shields remembered. ""Just like, was wrestling.""

The actress said she was paralyzed with fear.

""I was afraid I’d get choked out or something,"" she explained. ""So, I didn’t fight that much. I didn't. I just absolutely froze. I thought one 'No' should've been enough, and I just thought, 'Stay alive and get out,' and I just shut it out. God knows I knew how to be disassociated from my body.""

She continued, ""I went down in the elevator, and I got my own cab. I just cried all the way to my friend's apartment.""

Shields said that she didn't process the sex crime attack as a sexual assault for a long time.

She told her security specialist Gavin de Becker about the sexual assault, ""He said, 'That's rape.' And I said, 'I'm not willing to believe that.'""

Shields said that she wrote her sexual abuse attacker a letter years later, but it was ignored.

""I just threw my hands up and said, 'You know what, I refuse to be a victim because this is something that happens no matter who you are and no matter what you think you’re prepared for or not,'"" the Hollywood actress stated.

""I wanted to erase the whole thing from my mind and body and just keep on the path I was on,"" she added. ""The system had never once come to help me. So, I just had to get stronger on my own.""

VIDEO: Security guard takes down gunman who entered methadone clinic in Buffalo with an AR-15,"A security guard is being hailed as a hero for taking down a man who entered a methadone clinic with an AR-15 rifle, and it was captured on video.

The video shows a man stepping into a clinic and firing off a shot before security guard Reynaldo Beckford jumped into action, grabbed the gun, and struggled with the man.

Beckford talked to WKBW-TV about what was running through his mind when the man appeared at Hispanics United of Buffalo in New York.

""My back was turned to the door, and when I turned, I saw in the corner of my eye I saw was the person and the rifle,"" Beckford said.

""At that moment, I couldn't believe what was happening, especially when he let off the first shot, and that's when I knew that something was definitely wrong,"" he added.

The video shows Beckford struggling with the man before another security guard came to help him. After that, a janitor from the building jumped into the fray.

""When I had him and the rifle, I started saying Jesus Jesus Jesus, and that's when he turned back,"" the security guard said. ""He stopped fighting for a while, and that's when the other security guard started coming down the stairs.""

Beckford said the man refused to take his finger off of the trigger of the gun.

""I would be lying if I say to you I wasn't scared for my life and the first thing that flashed over my brain was my baby who just turned three years old,"" he added.

He said the building's janitor took the gun away from the man before police arrived to arrest him.

District Attorney John Flynn said the suspect was identified as 48-year-old Jeremy Griffin. He is facing several charges, including attempted murder.

Flynn said two bystanders outside the building also jumped in to help subdue Griffin.

Investigators said that Griffin had shot a woman in the leg before the altercation at the methadone clinic.

Beckford said he was simply doing his job.

""Nobody lost their life, nobody got hurt, and to God be the glory, what else can I say,"" he said.

"Bumble date allegedly kidnapped, starved, sexually assaulted woman for 5 days","One Texas woman had a nightmare before Christmas after a man she met on the dating app Bumble reportedly turned violent.

On December 24, the unidentified 22-year-old victim agreed to meet 21-year-old Zachary Mills, a man with whom she had been corresponding on Bumble, reports say. According to reports, Mills picked the woman up from her residence that day and brought her to his apartment in Spring, Texas, about 25 miles north of Houston.

When the pair arrived at his residence, Mills allegedly made sexual advances at the woman, but she refused. Mills then went into a rage, biting her and physically assaulting her with his fists and the handle of a screwdriver, she claimed. According to the allegations, things only got worse.

""From that point forward, he did not let her leave, withholding food and water,"" said Harris County Precinct 4 Capt. Jonathan Zitzmann.

The brutal assaults continued for the next five days, the Precinct 4 report claimed. During that time, Mills repeatedly sexually assaulted the victim, police said. She managed to escape on December 29 when the suspect went to visit his father. The victim sought help from one of the suspect's neighbors, who then contacted law enforcement. Shortly thereafter, Mills was arrested at a gas station across the street from his residence.

""The victim in this case had severe injuries to her face, orbital sockets, lower extremities. Thankfully, we were able to get her to the hospital very quickly,"" Zitzmann stated.

However, despite these horrific injuries, Mills' attorney, Chris Denuna, still doubts the victim's story. Though Denuna admitted to KHOU-TV that the allegations ""are egregious,"" he still said he had ""not seen anything in the allegations that make them credible.""



Mills has been charged with first-degree aggravated kidnapping, though other charges may be assessed at a later date ""following further investigation,"" a statement from Constable Mark Herman said. Mills has been released on $50,000 bond and remains on house arrest. He is expected to appear in court again on Friday.

Buyers of Hunter Biden's art might be revealed in child support case – mother of estranged daughter demands 'detailed information' about art sales,"The identities of the buyers of Hunter Biden's art might be exposed as a result of Biden's ongoing child support case with the mother of his 4-year-old daughter, the New York Post reported.



Lunden Roberts, the 31-year-old mother of Hunter Biden's daughter, Navy Joan Roberts, is demanding information about the 52-year-old's art sales and the identities of his customers, according to the Arkansas child support case.

The two met in a Washington D.C. strip club Biden frequented, where Roberts worked as an exotic dancer.



Court papers revealed that Roberts made the demand in response to Biden's attempt in September to lower his child support payments, claiming ""a substantial material change"" in his ""financial circumstances, including but not limited to his income.""

Roberts fired back at Biden's claims of financial woe and pointed to his recent art show in New York City. She requested that the court require Biden, a self-taught artist, to reveal the identities of his buyers.

In a December 27 court filing, Clinton Lancaster, Roberts' attorney, noted, ""Even though the defendant has been the subject of articles by the New York Times regarding his 'art,' President Biden's administration has taken measures to shield the White House from the buyers of the defendant's 'art,' and the defendant was seen in New York City as recently as a few months ago showing and selling his 'art,' the defendant has refused to provide any information about his 'art' or the income derived from it.""

Single pieces of Biden's art have sold for as much as $500,000. Five prints displayed at a 2021 California art show were purchased for at least $375,000. However, it is unclear how many paintings Biden has sold or how much he has earned from those sales in total.

In October 2021, the White House stated that customers of Hunter Biden's art would remain ""anonymous."" Biden's art dealer, New York gallery owner Georges Berges, has refused multiple requests from incoming House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) to reveal the names of those purchasing Biden's pricey paintings.

If Roberts' motion to reveal the identities of the buyers is successful, it will expose information House Republicans have repeatedly requested.

According to Roberts, neither the child's father, Hunter Biden, nor her grandfather, President Joe Biden, have met Navy. Hunter Biden initially denied paternity of Navy; however, a 2020 DNA test confirmed that he is the father of the 4-year-old.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/buyers-hunter-bidens-art-court-case,2023-01-06
Caitlyn Jenner opposes allowing biological men to compete in women's sports,"Caitlyn Jenner, a biological man who came out as transgender decades after winning a gold medal at the 1976 Olympics, is continuing to speak out against allowing biological men to compete in women's sports.

""We must protect women’s sports. At all costs,"" Jenner wrote in an opinion piece.

""What Lia has done, beating biological women to win a Division I national championship, is anathema to what sports represents and the spirit of competition,"" Jenner wrote regarding transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, a biological man who won a 500-yard freestyle while competing against women at the NCAA Championships in March.

Thomas finished the race more than one second faster than the second-place finisher. The University of Pennsylvania hailed Thomas as ""the first Quaker female swimmer to win an NCAA individual title.""

""Watching Lia completely dominate the competition was heartbreaking and maddening at the same time,"" Jenner wrote. ""My heart broke for the female athletes who worked their entire lives to reach the pinnacle of the sport just to have it overshadowed by this controversy. And I was mad because it did not have to be this way. The NCAA should have done the honorable thing to protect these women. It is their obligation to do so. Yet, the NCAA caved to the woke mob and refused to protect women, on all levels.""



Prior to making it to the NCAA championships, Thomas had already generated controversy by winning various races while competing against women.

But sometimes Thomas lost races as well. During the NCAA championships the swimmer came in eighth place in a 100-yard freestyle and tied for fifth place in a 200-yard freestyle.

Jenner, who recently joined Fox News as a contributor, ran as a Republican last year during California's gubernatorial recall election but earned far fewer votes than various other candidates. Democratic Gov. Newsom was not ultimately recalled by voters during the contest.



""This is a massive cultural issue not only for the midterm elections, but for 2024 as well. This is why I will be working with candidates and political committees to find solutions that will protect women’s sports while respecting the decisions of those who live their lives authentically,"" Jenner wrote.

Beloved Oklahoma Sooners football coach abruptly out of job after reading aloud a 'shameful and hurtful' word he read off a player's iPad,"Longtime Oklahoma Sooners assistant football coach Cale Gundy abruptly resigned on Sunday after inadvertently uttering a ""shameful and hurtful"" word.

The news shocked the college football world because, in a world with high coaching staff turnover, Gundy was an oddity: He served on the Oklahoma Sooners coaching staff in various roles for more than 20 years.

He was, in fact, the longest-tenured coach in the Big 12 conference, ESPN reported.

What happened?

Gundy explained in a statement that during a film study session last week, he instructed his players to take notes. But he noticed one player was ""distracted."" So he took that player's iPad ""and read aloud the words that were written on his screen.""

""The words displayed had nothing to do with football,"" Gundy explained. ""One particular word that I should never—under any circumstance—have uttered was displayed on that screen. In the moment, I did not even realize what I was reading and, as soon as I did, I was horrified.""

Gundy, however, refused to disclose what word he said; he only described it as ""shameful and harmful.""

""I want to be very clear: the words I read aloud from that screen were not my words. What I said was not malicious; it wasn't even intentional,"" Gundy explained. ""Still, I am mature enough to know that the word I said was shameful and hurtful, no matter my intentions.""

""The unfortunate reality is that someone in my position can cause harm without ever meaning to do so,"" the coach added. ""In that circumstance, a man of character accepts accountability. I take responsibility for this mistake. I apologize.""

One college football writer for CBS Sports reported that Gundy uttered the N-word. That has not been confirmed.

It remains unclear whether Gundy resigned under his own volition or if he was forced out of his job over fears his mistake would blow up into a larger scandal on racism.

However, SiriusXM radio host Gabe Ikard reported that most of the Sooners team wanted Gundy to stay, but he chose to resign.

Anything else?

Cincinnati Bengals running back Joe Mixon released a lengthy statement late Sunday defending Gundy. Mixon played under Gundy's tutelage when he was a running back at Oklahoma.

""If not for Coach Gundy I would not have attended OU, survived at OU, stayed at OU, and succeeded in life after OU. I owe my education and professional career to him and most importantly I owe who I am as a person to him,"" Mixon said.

""Most importantly Coach Gundy is not, and I repeat is not a racist in any way nor has a racist bone in his body, mind, or soul,"" the NFL star added. ""I know racists, I have witnessed both obvious and discreet types of racism and have known and detested even more actual racist. Coach Gundy is the farthest thing from this type of person.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cale-gundy-resigns-oklahoma-sooners,2022-08-08
"California fundraiser: Gavin Newsom is 'undeniably, unequivocally' running for president","A California fundraiser closely linked to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom told TheWrap that after the midterm elections, Newsom ""absolutely is going to announce that he is running for the presidency once Biden announces that he is not running.""

President Joe Biden recently cast doubt on whether he would seek reelection. In an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" which aired on September 18, the 79-year-old suggested that while he had previously indicated he would run again, ""it's just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen.""

A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll indicated that 54% of Americans disapprove of the president and that his favorability was dropping among Democrats as well as with Republicans.

A recent New York Times/Siena College poll found that 64% of Democrat voters would prefer someone other than Biden, the oldest president in American history, to run in 2024. The number of voters under the age of 30 keen on fresh blood is far higher, figuring at 94%.

High inflation, a disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, an unprecedented border crisis, and a long list of scandals together may dog Biden in the 2024 presidential race, in addition to the looming prospect of impeachment by a Republican-controlled House or removal via the 25th Amendment.

""Undeniably, unequivocally,"" said the fundraiser of Newsom's intentions. ""No ifs, ands or buts. He will run if Biden does not.""

A Los Angeles philanthropist entrenched in the Democratic Party similarly suggested that Newsom will run should Biden bow out.

Newsom survived a recall election in 2021, with 61.9% voting to keep him, and advanced from the Democratic primary on June 7 of this year. He once again faces a general election on November 8, this time facing Republican Brian Dahle, against whom he is expected to win.

Nevertheless, the California governor has recently been looking outside his state and making national plays for attention.

Newsom recently targeted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a potential opponent in the 2024 presidential election. On September 16, he challenged DeSantis to a debate, promising to bring his hair gel, which the Florida governor indicated had been ""interfering with his brain function.""

Newsom has also been advertising his California's fetal abattoirs in Republican-controlled states. Some of his billboards in Indiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, and elsewhere read ""You do not need to be a California resident to receive abortion services.""

In addition to serving as invitations to exterminate the unborn in his state, he indicated his rationale was that ""the people that support my candidacy support this.""

Newsom has also launched television ads, including one in Florida castigating DeSantis and former President Donald Trump, which stated ""Freedom, it's under attack in your state ... Republican leaders, they're banning books, making it harder to vote ... even criminalizing women and doctors.""

TheWrap reported that in addition to sending out feelers, Newsom may also be setting up the network and financial backing he would need for a presidential run. Over the summer, he reportedly spoke to a number of political consultants with minds to national elections.

Like Vice President Kamala Harris, Newsom has also recently been networking with deep-pocketed influencers and fundraisers. He met with Heather Podesta, a lobbyist and Democratic fundraiser, claiming he did so to support the Democratic Governors Association.

The Democratic field in 2024 may be populated with familiar faces, such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Sen. Bernie Sanders (Va.), and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.

If Newsom runs, he may also contend with Vice President Kamala Harris, who has indicated that Biden ""has been very clear that he intends to run again. And if he does, I will be running with him proudly.""

According to a recent Harvard Harris Poll, 50% of respondents found Harris unfavorable, whereas only 37% found her favorable.

Newsom's America

Newsom remains popular in California despite overseeing an energy crisis, an epidemic of fires, high crime, and markedly diminished freedoms.

Owing largely to state Democrats' energy policies, California's electric grid is highly unstable. The state relies heavily upon solar and renewable energy, although routine strains on the grid have prompted Newsom to keep California's last nuclear plant open.

Despite the government's antipathy for fossil fuels, the state has also had to burn more gas in recent years and ration electricity to avoid a recurrence of the rolling blackouts that left hundreds of thousands of residents in the dark for hours and days at a time in 2020.

Massive swaths of federal and nonfederal land have been consumed in California wildfires over the past several years. Although Newsom has argued that climate change is the culprit, he has been accused of transforming his state into ""a tinderbox waiting for a spark"" and of having ""failed to take care of forestry management in California.""

Minority Leader of the California State Assembly James Gallagher told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that the Newsom administration's refusal to stand up to ""big special interests in California [like] the Sierra Club,"" who don't want any trees cut, ""is the cause of these fires and is leading to people dying.""

As destructive as the wildfires have been, crime in Newsom's California has proved exceedingly more lethal. The chances of becoming a victim of a violent crime in the state are 1 in 227, and the likelihood of becoming a victim of a property crime is 1 in 47.

In 2021, there were 2,361 murders in California, setting the violent crime rate up to 466.2 per 100,000 from 437 the previous year. At the same time that murders were on the rise, arrests were falling, from 2,812.3 per 100,000 people in 2020 to 2,606.3 per 100,000 last year.

The streets are not only home to worsening violent crime. According to the California Health Care Foundation, as of 2020, there were at least 255,000 homeless persons in the state, up significantly from previous years.

The Public Policy Institute of California estimated there were at least 2.3 million illegal aliens living in California as of 2019, composing approximately 6% of the population.

Although Newsom has suggested in his messaging to voters in red states that their freedoms are under attack, California ranks #48 overall in the Cato Institute's ""Freedom in the 50 States"" index of personal and economic freedom.

William Ruger, vice president for research and policy at the Charles Koch Institute, and Jason Sorens, director of the Center for Ethics in Society at Saint Anselm College, authored the libertarian think tank's report, which stated, ""California is one of the least free states in the country, largely because of its long-standing poor performance on economic freedom.""

The report indicated that under Newsom, ""California is one of the highest-taxed states in the country ... one of the worst states on land-use freedom,"" home to the weakest gun rights in the country, and its freedoms have ""weakened consistently over time.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-fundraiser-gavin-newsom-is-undeniably-unequivocally-running-for-president,2022-09-20
"California judge orders public release of Paul Pelosi attack bodycam footage, surveillance video, more","Footage of the attack on Paul Pelosi may be publicly released as early as Thursday, after a San Francisco judge denied prosecutors' request to keep video and audio evidence of the October attack secret, multiple outlets reported.

""You don't eliminate the public right of access just because of concerns about conspiracy theories,"" attorney Thomas R. Burke told the Associated Press.

Burke represented multiple news organizations pushing for the public release of evidence related to 42-year-old David Wayne DePape's alleged attack on 82-year-old Pelosi on October 28, 2022, the AP also reported.

The news organizations demanding public release of the evidence included the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Press Democrat, CNN, Fox News, CBS, ABC, NBC, and San Francisco's KQED, according ABC 11 Eyewitness News.

San Francisco Superior Court Judge Stephen M. Murphy's decision on Wednesday comes after evidence was presented in a preliminary hearing in December, according to the Los Angeles Times. The evidence reportedly includes Capitol police surveillance footage, portions of Pelosi's 911 call, police officers' body camera footage, and video of DePape's interview with police.

After the preliminary hearing in December, the San Francisco District Attorney's Office refused news organizations' request for copies of the evidence the prosecutors had presented, ABC also reported. Those news organizations, in turn, argued that public release of the information was crucial.

The attack, in which Pelosi suffered a skull fracture and other serious injuries, occurred just a few days before the 2022 midterm elections. It resulted in intense media coverage and widespread public speculation on the timing and details of the altercation.

The indictment indicates that DePape said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), former U.S. speaker of the House, was on his ""target list,"" and if she ""lied,"" DePape would break ""her kneecaps."" The indictment also references the 2.5-minute phone call during which Paul Pelosi denies knowing who the intruder was and DePape can be heard in the background calling himself a ""friend.""



Attempted murder is among the six charges to which DePape has pleaded not guilty in the pending case.

Video of California school calling police because boy wouldn't wear mask,"California school officials called police to have a 4-year-old boy with developmental issues removed from the classroom because he wasn't wearing a mask.

An unnamed boy started transitional kindergarten at Theuerkauf Elementary on Aug. 10.

The boy suffers from sensory issues and has had difficulty wearing a face mask during the pandemic. The boy became distressed when he had to wear a mask during visits to the doctor and dentist – but the healthcare workers made accommodations for the boy with developmental issues.

The father – who only identified himself as ""Shawn"" out of safety concerns – claimed that he began communicating with the Mountain View Whisman School District in the spring. However, Shawn said the superintendent was unresponsive.

The school district allegedly told the father that his son could delay attending school until the age of six.

An incident emerged on Thursday after the boy had been denied access to the school since Monday. The boy's father recorded the confrontation between him and the school’s principal – Michelle Williams.

The boy is escorted out of the classroom by Williams.

“I welcome him here and I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again, I want him here but it is our district’s policy to have to wear a mask,” Williams told the boy’s father in the video.

""I am here to serve all our students on our campus,"" she said. ""I cannot keep spending time on this same issue.""



Williams told the father, ""I'm going to have to have you removed from campus if you do not leave at this time.""



A police officer was called, and asked Shawn to leave the campus.

""I can't say what they are doing is wrong; I can't say what you are doing is wrong,"" the officer told the father. ""Both sides have valid points. For me, I just have to ensure on the campus as a whole that kids get their education.""

Shawn told the Daily Mail, ""They told me to force it on him. They are basically telling me to assault and batter my son.""

""I do have a medical background, I've worked extensively in the healthcare environment. I'm well-versed in medical law,"" he added. ""And in essence, they are breaking it.""

""They feel like they can walk all over it,"" Shawn continued. ""If a patient does not offer consent, they can not touch the patient. We're going to continue to challenge this.""

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, ""Over the next four days, he brought his son to school and was turned away. He also hired an attorney, who sent the district a cease-and-desist letter, demanding Shawn’s son be allowed to attend school as required by the state’s constitution.""

The father is reportedly considering legal action against the school.

Shawn's attorney – Tracy Henderson with the California Parents Union – asserted that the school broke the law by refusing the child.

""The school’s authority in a situation of public health issues, by law, is only to send a sick child home,"" Henderson said.

During Thursday night's board meeting, the school district made masks optional.

“We are now in the medium tier, so starting tomorrow, we are now in 'masks optional' for students,” said Superintendent Ayinde Rudolph.

The school district determines if masks need to be worn on a week-by-week basis based on COVID-19 cases.

Masks will still be required on buses, at large events, and for any school visitors.

Shawn was unsatisfied that the school district lifted the mask mandate because he noted that they could easily reinstate the rule.

The father wants the policy to have a parental choice on whether their children are forced to wear masks to attend school.

""I'm watching my son. I’m waking him up every day to go to school, get turned away with tears in his eyes,"" the father said. ""He doesn’t know what’s going on, he’s visibly upset, visibly disheveled by getting turned away and rejected.""

""I just think it’s time to move forward, the kids need to see faces, they need to see people smiling, they need to have a brighter outlook on the future in general,"" he told KABC-TV.

Superintendent Ayindé Rudolph said in a statement, ""Our primary responsibility as a school district is the safety of students and staff members in order to create a peaceful learning and working environment for all on our campuses.""

Rudolph said it was ""unfortunate"" that the parent was recording a video of the confrontation with the principal.

""I'm disappointed that civil discourse is no longer the rule,"" Rudolph said.



Board member Christopher Chiang said, ""There is so much nasty politics and dangerous rhetoric and ideologies out there, we’re bringing a target to our district when we do that. Please don’t post it online. That changes everything.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-school-police-boy-mask,2022-08-20
"Teen stabs girl multiple times, gets probation under liberal California DA's 'restorative justice' policy. Victim's mom says attacker is getting away with 'premeditated attempted murder.'","A teenage girl in Los Angeles harassed another girl on social media for months before stabbing her multiple times during a fight in the park, causing serious injuries and hospitalization. But thanks to liberal Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón's ""restorative justice"" policy, the juvenile attacker got only probation.

What are the details?

In a statement to the victim's family, the prosecutor in the case explained the controversial decision to file only one misdemeanor count of assault with a deadly weapon and one count of electronic harassment against a minor.

""We filed appropriate charges on this case considering George Gascón’s new emphasis on restorative justice as guided by the science and data,"" the prosecutor said, according to KTTV-TV.

The incredibly lenient punishment has left 13-year-old victim Elisyannah Valdez and her mother, Cassandra Cisneros, distraught and angry.

Cisneros, a former criminal justice activist, tearfully lamented to the outlet: ""When I was fighting for these laws to change for these young people, never did we intend for somebody to commit premeditated attempted murder at 13 years old and get completely away with it.""

""I’m livid because that little girl is running around doing whatever she wants scot-free while my baby girl's home suffering from [post traumatic stress disorder], you know, afraid to leave the house, constantly looking out her window,"" the mother said.

Elisyannah suffered three stab wounds and a slash in her arm during an altercation with the suspect, another 13-year-old girl. The attack — which took place at a park in Inglewood near both the attacker's and the victim's homes — was captured on video.

13-year-old who stabbed girl multiple times gets probation under Gascón’s policy www.youtube.com

The two girls appeared to be involved in a fist fight over a boy when the attacker suddenly pulled out a knife from her back pocket and started stabbing Elisyannah.

According to Cisneros, the knife ""punctured her [daughter's] liver, her kidneys, her diaphragm, and her pericardial sac,"" which caused internal bleeding. Doctors had to operate immediately in order to save her life. Thankfully, Elisyannah has since recovered.

Cisneros argues the attack was clearly ""premeditated."" The stabber had allegedly been harassing her daughter with frequent text message and social media threats for nearly a year.

""She had this obsession with me because of the boy across the street. She thought we were dating, which we weren’t, we were just friends,"" Elisyannah said in an interview with KTTV. ""She called me ugly, fat, she talked about my grandma, said my grandma's burning in hell and F my dead grandma.""

The outlet reported that after the stabbing, the attacker posted a message on social media, tagging the boy at the center of the feud, saying, ""Would you love me more, If I killed someone for you?""

Elisyannah said, ""It just makes me think even more that she's crazy. That she needs help, mental help."" That much, at least, is slated to be included as part of the girl's sentencing.

What else?

The outlet contacted Gascón's office seeking an on-camera interview regarding the case, but the district attorney reportedly refused.

Instead, Alex Bastian, a special adviser to Gascón, sent a statement, saying, ""In this assault case, the 13-year-old minor had no criminal record. This disposition takes into account the safety of the victim and looks to prevent future harm by ensuring the minor also receives treatment.""

The liberal district attorney has come under fire several times in recent months following the announcement of his controversial policy, which prohibits trying juveniles as adults.

Earlier this year, a biological male transgender 26-year-old was sentenced to just two years in a juvenile detention facility after violently molesting a 10-year-old girl when the criminal was two weeks shy of turning 18.

Outrage over that case and others quickly led to widespread opposition to Gascón among Los Angeles prosecutors. In February, a whopping 98% of them voted to support a recall effort.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-teen-gets-probation-under-gascon-policy,2022-04-12
"California law could force 70,000 truckers out of work, worsen supply chain","A California law threatens to unleash more supply chain misery and inflation on residents of the Golden State by forcing independent truckers out of the workforce.

California Assembly Bill 5 was introduced by former state Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, a Democrat, and signed into law in September 2019 by California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

AB5 called for ""a person providing labor or services for remuneration shall be considered an employee rather than an independent contractor unless the hiring entity demonstrates that the person is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, the person performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and the person is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business.""

Certain professions were exempt from AB5, including insurance agents, health care professionals, investment advisers, realtors, barbers, and fishermen. However, truckers were not exempt from AB5.

AB5 targeted independent contractors who were app-based delivery and rideshare drivers. Ironically, companies like Uber, Lyft, and Postmates were exempted from AB5 after Proposition 22 was passed in November 2020.

The trucking industry has been fighting the law ever since it went into effect, and secured an injunction that prevented AB5 from including independent truckers in January 2020.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra called on U.S. District Judge Roger T. Benitez to reverse the injunction.

""The district court also abused its discretion in assessing the remaining preliminary injunction factors, erroneously concluding that Plaintiffs established irreparable harm despite the fact that they waited over 19 months to seek injunctive relief, and giving short-shrift to the State’s interest in addressing misclassification of state employees,"" Becerra stated in March 2020. ""This Court should reverse.""



On June 28, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case of the California truckers battling against AB5.

""This ruling really took everybody off-guard, especially at the speed that they kicked this back and essentially made it law,"" Paul Brashier – vice president of a commercial transport company – told CBS News.

Now, the truckers must be employees of trucking companies and not independent contractors in order to be able to work in California.

However, there seems to be confusion on how the law will be enforced.

Norita Taylor, director of public relations for the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, informed Bloomberg, ""We have never gotten any good answers from anyone official in California on how this is supposed to be enforced or how our members can comply.""

If the law is enforced, California faces a possible mass exodus of the state's estimated 70,000 independent truckers.

The Port of Oakland is especially vulnerable if independent truckers are forced out of work.

""There's 9,000 trucks that serve the port on a daily basis, and 90% of them are independent contractors. So, this is a big, big impact,"" said Bill Aboudi owner of AB Trucking in Oakland.



Aboudi explained that his independent contractors own their own trucks.

""It just doesn't work. You own your own truck, it's your truck. I can't take possession of it and start using it,"" he added. ""In a case like my company, we just eliminate owner/operators and just reduce the workload.""

Kevin McMaster – vice president of carrier sales at Flock Freight – noted, ""This would cause a ripple effect in the industry, pushing many drivers who don’t want to apply for their own authority to lease out of state, likely in Arizona or Nevada, and even force some into retirement due to increased market pressures. There will likely be pressure added on capacity in California that could exacerbate an already tough environment where drivers are at a premium.""

Brashier believes many independent truckers will leave California for states where they can work as contractors. The departure of the truck-owner operators would likely negatively impact Californians.

""It's going to adversely affect everybody,"" he told KPIX-TV. ""And at the end of the day, with where we are with inflation being as high as it is, this is going to put inflationary pressure on the consumer, right?""



The California Trucking Association delivered a warning, ""Gasoline has been poured on the fire that is our ongoing supply chain crisis. In addition to the direct impact on California’s 70,000 owner-operators who have seven days to cease long-standing independent businesses, the impact of taking tens of thousands of truck drivers off the road will have devastating repercussions on an already fragile supply chain, increasing costs and worsening runaway inflation.""

Lorena Gonzalez – who authored AB5 and resigned from the state assembly in January – had no sympathy for the truckers.

""They’ve known for the last two and a half years that it was equally possible that this injunction would not hold,"" Gonzalez said. ""This is not a shock.”



""The fact that trucking companies will have to abide by basic labor laws in CA takes us one step closer to rebuilding the middle class that was almost deregulated out of existence,"" tweeted Gonzalez – who now heads the California Labor Federation.

On Wednesday, California Republican lawmakers implored Democratic Gov. Newsom to either delay the implementation of the law or exempt truckers from AB5.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-truckers-ab5-supply-chain,2022-07-09
Cambridge Dictionary website definition of the word woman,"The Cambridge Dictionary website is promoting radical leftist gender ideology by including definition for the word ""woman"" that does not reflect biological realities but instead perpetuates the dogmas of the left-wing gender-bending zeitgeist.

While the site does provide an accurate definition of ""woman"" by defining the word as ""an adult female human being,"" it also provides a definition that says, ""An adult who lives and identifies as female though they may have been said to have a different sex at birth.""

Example sentences for that definition include, ""She was the first trans woman elected to a national office"" and ""Mary is a woman who was assigned male at birth."" A transgender woman is a biological man who identifies as a woman.

The site also includes a definition for the word ""man"" along the same line.

""They won't stop until we don’t remember what real women are anymore,"" Megyn Kelly tweeted in response to a tweet from Christopher Rufo, who had highlighted the absurd definition for the word ""woman.""

"Canadian Minister of Health calls for vaccine boosters every 9 months, won't rule out return to mandates","Though COVID-19 vaccine mandates have largely gone by the wayside here in the United States, many of our friends to the north still live with the threat of a return to mandates. And recent comments from Canadian Minister of Health Jean-Yves Duclos will likely only exacerbate those concerns.

On Monday, Duclos told reporters that ""fully-vaccinated"" is no longer a term recognized by health officials and the Canadian government. Instead, they will begin referring to ""up-to-date vaccinations.""

""But what exactly do we mean by 'up-to-date vaccination'? Let me be very clear: 'Up to date' means you've received your last dose in the past nine months,"" Duclos said in a prepared statement.

And while Duclos thanked those Canadians who had already received a booster, he still recommended that everyone learn whether they ""are eligible for a second or a third booster to remain up to date.""

Last week, Duclos and Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam called for Canadians to get boosted against the Omicron variant, which they claimed would soon ravage the country.

""We're behind most other G7 countries in our rate of third doses and we shouldn't be behind, we've been ahead of all those other countries with two doses. We know we have the capacity to do better and we will be doing better,"" Duclos said at the time.

""As any physician or health expert will tell you, it's critical you go and get the shot that's waiting for you,"" he continued. ""Like the virus, immunity also evolves and Omicron has cruelly made us understand that two doses is no longer enough.""

Though Duclos claimed that Canada is ""behind"" in boosters, 86% of Canadians age 5 and older have received at least the initial two-shot vaccinations.

""If you look at our vaccination rate, we had the highest in the entire G10,"" Dr. Fahad Razak said. ""We had the lowest number of people infected and lowest of people dying.""

G10 refers to the G7 countries, plus Sweden, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.

But despite these high rates of vaccination, officials are still preparing for a resurgence of COVID this fall, and Duclos refused to rule out the possibility of more vaccine mandates. When reporters asked him about a return to mandates, Duclos gave nebulous, boilerplate responses.

""We must continue to fight against COVID,"" he said. ""We want to be prepared for next fall and that requires an up-to-date vaccination, which is based on the nine months.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/canadian-minister-health-wont-rule-out-mandates,2022-07-05
Capitol Police arrest Babbitt's mother on Jan. 6 anniversary,"U.S. Capitol police on Friday arrested Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Ashli Babbitt, the woman who was fatally shot by an officer two years ago during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

Video footage shows a police officer insisting that failure to move to the sidewalk would result in arrest — Witthoeft turned her back to police and at that point, was apparently arrested.

""Capitol police suck a**!"" she later said while standing outside of a police car.

Ashli Babbitt's mother Micki Witthoeft arrested by Capitol Police www.youtube.com

""This afternoon a group of demonstrators were illegally blocking traffic on Independence Avenue, SW, near First Street, SW,"" a Capitol police press release states. ""The group did not have a permit to demonstrate on Capitol Grounds. Officers established a clear police line to prevent the group from moving further west on Independence Avenue, SW. The officers and officials told the group to get out of the road or the group would be arrested. The sidewalk was open. A woman in the group was given multiple warnings to get out of the road. Instead of getting out of the road, the woman refused to leave, turned around with her hands behind her back, and asked to be arrested.""

Video footage clearly shows Witthoeft turn around, but it is not clear in the footage that she ever ""asked to be arrested,"" as the press release asserts — rather, it seems in the footage that she turned around but did not verbalize a request to be arrested.

""Around 1:45 p.m., the woman was arrested for two Capitol Traffic Regulations – §16.3.20 Obey An Order, as well as §16.3.40 Blocking And Obstructing Roadways. The person was identified as 58 year old Micki Witthoeft,"" the press release says. ""As is typical for this charge, Ms. Witthoeft was processed and released this afternoon after being given a citation to appear in court at a later date.""

Capitol police chief fires back after US Attorney refuses to charge Stephen Colbert staffers arrested at Capitol office building,"The United States Capitol Police revealed new details on Tuesday alleging Stephen Colbert's staffers repeatedly disobeyed instructions from Capitol police officers prior to their arrest.

The news came one day after the U.S. Attorney's office declined to charge the staffers, whom the Capitol police referred to as the ""Colbert Nine.""

What are the details?

Capitol police Chief J. Thomas Manger explained in a letter the production crew was arrested in the Longworth House Office Building after a staffer for Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) secured his office and called the USCP emergency phone number to report a disturbance outside the office next to Bowman's.

That office belonged to Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.).

""Do you remember me? Do you remember me?"" a man with the production crew reportedly shouted outside Boebert's door. ""It’s me. We’re going to leave something under your door.""

A member of the production crew told responding officers they were credentialed press. However, none of the production crew had congressional press identification, neither were they accompanied by a congressional staff member, Manger explained. The group needed both to be in the building.

Even worse, the group had already been escorted out of different building, the Cannon House Office Building, earlier in the day when a Capitol police officer stopped the group for not having press credentials or a staff escort.

When officers confronted the production crew, group leader Jake Plunkett told officers they were in the building to film comedy skits for Colbert's show. They had planned to film outside the offices House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-Ga). The crew admitted they were ""pretending to leave notes"" under the office doors, but did not actually leave any.

""The note was allegedly an invitation to a cocaine orgy,"" Manger wrote.

Prior to the incident, the production crew applied for press credentials, but were denied. Plunkett, according to Manger, declined to appeal the decision because ""he knew [the production crew] would not qualify qualify as press.""

What about the DOJ's decision?

Manger condemned the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for not criminally charging the production crew despite the ample evidence showing they broke the law.

""It is unfortunate that despite all of the evidence the Department presented, including that the group or its leader had been told several times that they could not be in the buildings without an escort, that the U.S. Attorney’s office declined to prosecute any members of the group for Unlawful Entry,"" Manger said.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia released a statement on Monday claiming prosecutors were not moving forward with the case because the evidence was not enough to secure convictions.

Manger's letter, however, calls into question that decision because the evidence shows the production crew knew they were not supposed to be inside the office building and even allegedly lied about being credentialed press.

Capt. David Dorn's widow: 'Democrat and left-wing activist rhetoric has gone too far',"David Dorn, a retired St. Louis police captain who went onto become police chief of Moline Acres, was gunned down on June 2, 2020, at the height of the BLM riots. The 77-year-old was checking on a friend's business when he discovered that looters had gutted Lee's Pawn and Jewelry. Dorn allegedly fired warning shots into the air in an effort to prompt the marauders to disperse.

Stephan Cannon responded by shooting at the 44-year police veteran ten times. Dorn bled out on the sidewalk.

That same night, four police officers were shot in St. Louis. The 2020 BLM riots claimed over 25 lives and caused over $2 billion in damages.

Cannon was convicted in July of first-degree murder, first-degree robbery, stealing $750 or more, unlawful possession of a firearm, and with three counts of armed criminal action.

On August 23, Fox News published an opinion piece written by Capt. Dorn's widow Ann Marie Dorn. Mrs. Dorn noted she and Capt. Dorn had lived happily together for 30 years, which was cut short when her city ""erupted in violence as [BLM] descended on St. Louis.""

Mrs. Dorn noted that her husband was a ""superhero,"" but that if ""real life superheroes exist, so do supervillains."" She identified two affluential people she regards today as supervillains.

The first, wrote Dorn, is billionaire George Soros — the kind of supervillain ""who use[s] their power and influence to promote extremist politics and fan the flames of division.""

In addition to backing ""reform-minded"" prosecutors overseeing major upticks in crime, Soros allegedly poured millions of dollars into BLM initiatives via his Open Society Foundations.

The second variety of supervillain, according to Mrs. Dorn, is personified by Vice President Kamala Harris, ""who raised money for the rioters' bail funds,"" and by the ""CEOs of prominent companies who blindly gave their support and money to this. If a foreign organization were tied to nationwide rioting in the US, we'd probably call it a terrorist organization.""

Four months after the BLM riots in St. Louis, Kamala Harris spoke at the NAACP's national convention, saying: ""Nothing that we have achieved that has been about progress, in particular around civil rights, has come without a fight, and so I always am going to interpret these protests as an essential component of evolution in our country."" She claimed further that ""[BLM] has been the most significant agent for change within the criminal justice system.""

Dorn wrote that her husband neither agreed with nor supported BLM, ""because it never actually did anything to help Black lives.""

Although Mrs. Dorn acknowledged that Capt. Dorn ""was Black ... [h]is life mattered,"" she suggested that BLM refused to, just as they allegedly exhibited indifference to the shooting of a dozen children in St. Louis during 2020. ""Never once did [BLM] show up. Their lives mattered. Fifty-five businesses were looted or destroyed the night David was murdered, many of them Black-owned. Their livelihoods mattered.""

Dorn concluded by attributing her husband's murder, in part, to the fact that police and first responders were ""ordered not to do their jobs."" The order to stand down was resultant of an ""anti-law enforcement sentiment that has been fueled in this country by Democrat and left-wing activist rhetoric [that] has gone too far.""

Although ahead of the midterm elections and in light of rising crime rates, Democrats are now trying to distance themselves from defund the police rhetoric, their past support for the sentiment is well documented.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/capt-david-dorn-s-widow-democrat-and-left-wing-activist-rhetoric-has-gone-too-far,2022-08-23
"'This won't stop us': Pastor refuses to back down after his church and others in area are vandalized, targeted apparently by pro-abortion faithful","After a string of churches in the Houston area were vandalized and became targets of other criminal activity following last week's leaked Supreme Court draft decision that would overturn Roe v. Wade, a pastor of one of the congregations spoke out defiantly against the acts — apparently carried out by pro-abortion adherents.

What are the details?

A spray-painted message reading ""Pro-Choice Is Pro-Life"" was discovered on the main entrance and a side door of Houston's Holy Rosary Catholic Church on Monday morning, KRIV-TV reported.

""It's very unfortunate that people would desecrate the church like this, take their frustration out on the church,"" Father Peter Damian Harris told the station.

Image source: KRIV-TV video screenshot

The church changed its hours due to the vandalism: Now it will open 30 minutes before confession and mass and close immediately after, KRIV said.



""It's very unfortunate, but I'd rather take the necessary precautions than run the risk of someone coming to desecrate our sacred space,"" Harris added to the station.

He also told KRIV he believes the vandalism at Holy Rosary is connected to vandalism at two Catholic churches in nearby Katy: St. Bartholomew the Apostle Catholic Church and St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church.

""Most definitely it's a result of the leak that came out last week, the Supreme Court,"" Harris noted to the station.

The tabernacle — often considered the most sacred item in Catholic churches as it contains communion wafers — was taken from St. Bartholomew sometime between Sunday evening and Monday morning, Katy magazine reported.

Harris added to KRIV that ""someone tried to desecrate the eucharist"" at St. Elizabeth.

As for the guilty party responsible for spray-painting graffiti on his church's doors, Harris had a clear and defiant message.

""I'd rather you come inside and pray and have a conversation and not try to desecrate our sacred space,"" he told the station. ""This won't stop us. It propels us to continue to be witnesses for Christ in the world.""

Anything else?

On Sunday in Los Angeles, red-robed protesters disrupted morning mass at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels — but video captured one fed-up man climbing over a pew and confronting the protesters, stopping them dead in their tracks.

Bishop says school cannot be called Catholic anymore over its refusal to take down LGBTQ and BLM flags,"A bishop issued a decree saying that a school in Worcester, Massachusetts, can no longer bear the name Catholic because of its refusal to take down a Black Lives Matter flag and an LGBTQ pride flag.

The Nativity School of Worcester has been flying the pride flag and the BLM flag underneath the U.S. flag for more than a year.

Bishop Robert J. McManus accused the school of being ""inconsistent with Catholic teaching"" by flying the flags.

McManus said that the church supports the phrase ""black lives matter,"" but went on to assert that the BLM organization had ""co-opted the phrase and promotes a platform that directly contradicts Catholic social teaching on the importance and role of the nuclear family and seeks to disrupt the family structure in clear opposition to the teachings of the Catholic Church.""

The bishop might have been referring to a statement published by BLM voicing opposition to the nuclear family and traditional gender roles. It was later scrubbed from the website.

""The flying of these flags in front of a Catholic school sends a mixed, confusing and scandalous message to the public about the Church's stance on these important moral and social issues,"" the bishop added.

Some Catholics agreed with the bishop's stance.

""If they want to continue to call themselves a Catholic school, then they should follow his guidelines,"" said a local member of the Catholic church to WCVB-TV.

The school points out that they do not answer directly to the bishop but to the Jesuits, a separate order of the Catholic church.

School president Thomas McKenney said in a statement Wednesday that the decree from the bishop would not change how the school operates. He added that the school would appeal the decree.

""As a multicultural school, the flags represent the inclusion and respect of all people,"" he explained. ""These flags simply state that all are welcome at Nativity and this value of inclusion is rooted in Catholic teaching.""

The middle school serves about 60 boys.

CBS anchors slam WH press sec for pushing narrative about classified docs: 'Has not answered a single question',"Two CBS News anchors called out White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Thursday for refusing to answer basic questions about the discovery of classified documents at President Joe Biden's private office and residence.

Over the past two days, Jean-Pierre has faced a barrage of intense questions about the documents. She has frustrated reporters, however, by repeatedly dodging the questions.

CBS anchors Errol Barnett and Lana Zak slammed Jean-Pierre for having ""not answered a single question"" about the discovery of the documents.

""For a second straight day now, the White House struggling to answer any questions related to classified documents discovered at locations associated with President Biden, citing Karine Jean-Pierre, the press secretary, simply reading a statement, where she says the president was surprised by the discovery, takes this matter very seriously, the documents were inadvertently misplaced, and he doesn't know what's in them,"" Barnett began.

""She has not answered a single question outside of a prewritten statement by the president's lawyers,"" he said.

""Exactly,"" Zak agreed. ""And continuing then to say the same thing again and again. Even in response to very simple questions about the timeline, about the specific location, clarifying questions, and continuing to use the word 'transparent' and saying that they did things in a transparent manner.""



""You heard our own CBS' Ed O'Keefe really trying to pin her down on what she means by transparency when she's saying that she has been transparent. Does that mean legal transparency? Governmental transparency as required by law? Or public transparency?"" Zak asked.

Reporters are now directly questioning the Biden administration's narrative that officials have been ""transparent"" and forthcoming about the classified documents.

At one point in Thursday's White House briefing, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked what the Biden administration is trying to ""hide.""

""Nothing,"" Jean-Pierre claimed.

But that is almost implausible. Not only did the White House not tell the American public about the first discovery of classified documents until two months after the midterm elections, but when officials admitted to the first batch, they neglected to say anything about the second batch that had already been discovered.

CDC to extend transportation mask mandate for another 2 weeks,"Reports indicate that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will extend the mask requirement for airplanes and other forms of public transportation for an additional two weeks as health officials monitor rising COVID-19 cases.

The mask mandate was set to expire April 18 but will instead be extended for 14 days more as some parts of the country report rising coronavirus cases caused by the BA.2 Omicron subvariant. This strain of the virus that causes COVID-19 is highly contagious and first spread in Europe, but scientists have not observed the variant to be deadlier than previous coronavirus variants.

The Associated Press reported that the extension of the mandate is being made out of an abundance of caution and that the new expiration date for the masking requirements is May 3, 2022.

CNN corroborated the report, quoting a Biden administration official who said that the government wants to gather more information on the BA.2 variant before lifting the masking requirements on planes, trains, buses, and public transportation hubs like airports or bus terminals.

""Since early April, there have been increases in the 7-day moving average of cases in the US. In order to assess the potential impact, the rise of cases has on severe disease, including hospitalizations and deaths, and health care system capacity, CDC is recommending that TSA extend the security directive to enforce mask use on public transportation and transportation hubs for 15 days, through May 3, 2022,"" the official told CNN.

""This will give additional time for the CDC to learn more about BA.2 and make a best-informed decision,"" the official added.

White House COVID-19 response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said Monday that the CDC is developing a scientific framework that will guide its decision-making on mask mandates and other coronavirus restrictions moving forward.

The federal public transportation mask mandate has been widely criticized as state mask mandates have come down following guidance from the CDC. Public opposition to the masking requirements has led to some violent altercations on airplanes when passengers refuse to abide by the rules.

Though COVID-19 cases have risen in recent weeks, now averaging 38,345 cases per day according to Johns Hopkins University, the daily average case rate is still one of the lowest observed since mid-July, before the Delta and Omicron surges.

According to the Associated Press, severe illnesses and deaths reporting lags behind case reports by several weeks. The CDC is reportedly waiting for these indicators to show whether an increase in cases correlates to a rise in adverse outcomes before ending the mask mandate.

'Censorship in its purest form': Chicago news outlets slam Mayor Lightfoot for blocking live police scanner transmissions,"A coalition of news organizations from crime-ridden Chicago wrote an open letter to viewers on Tuesday accusing Democrat Mayor Lori Lightfoot of ""censorship"" after she moved to block live transmissions of police scanners, WGN-TV reported.



Lightfoot authorized the city's Office of Emergency Management and the police department to transition to encrypted radio frequencies to prevent the public from listening to live police activity.

Since the decision, the news outlet claimed that Lightfoot has refused to address the media's concerns.

News organizations in the metropolitan area, including WGN-TV, WBBM-TV, WMAQ-TV, WLS-TV, WFLD, the Chicago Sun-Times, and the Chicago Tribune, all signed the open letter referring to Lightfoot's new policy as ""censorship in its purest form.""

Before Lightfoot's decision, police scanner communications were available to the public. The local news organization argued that having no access to the emergency service transmissions would ""impact our ability to provide timely, accurate and potentially life-saving news.""

The letter explained that news outlets use police scanners to alert residents about ""everything from traffic congestion to developing threats to public safety.""

""A shooting took place at a courthouse and police district in Chicago last week in broad daylight,"" the letter stated. ""The perpetrators fired more than 40 shots and escaped on an expressway. You did not see, hear, or read about that incident as it was happening. The City of Chicago prevented you from knowing about this dangerous incident by blocking all live scanner transmissions. This jeopardized the lives of everyone at that police department, everyone at that courthouse, everyone on that expressway.""

The coalition of news organizations also argued that live access to police scanner transmissions ensures ""transparency and accountability by law enforcement."" The letter stated that blocking the transmissions goes against the public's calls for more police transparency.

According to Chicago officials, real-time scanner transmissions were blocked to minimize disruptions, prevent criminals from monitoring law enforcement, and protect emergency responders.

""Police scanner transmissions have been available for decades,"" said Steven Mandell, an attorney representing WGN-TV. ""Once you encrypt those transmissions, that shuts off the level of information, which affects public safety and our ability to monitor how our government works.""

In a letter to Mandell, city officials claimed that ""real-time access to police radio creates vulnerabilities that present a serious threat to law enforcement and the public, and that can be exploited by domestic and foreign actors – risks that the [city] cannot ignore.""

Once the transition to encrypted frequencies is complete, the public will only have access to a website that plays Chicago police radio traffic on a 30-minute delay.

The news organizations' letter concluded, ""To borrow language from the highest federal appellate court sitting in Chicago, 'The newsworthiness of a particular story is often fleeting. To delay or postpone disclosure undermines the benefit of public scrutiny and may have the same result as complete suppression.' We couldn't agree more.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/censorship-in-its-purest-form-chicago-news-outlets-slam-mayor-lightfoot-for-blocking-live-police-scanner-transmissions,2022-12-14
"ChatGPT confined to leftist ideological parameters, harbors woke biases and manipulates accordingly","ChatGPT (Chat generative pre-trained transformer) is an AI chatbot program developed by the San Francisco-based start-up OpenAI, backed by Microsoft to the tune of $10 billion. Users have discovered that while capable of successfully emulating human writing, the bot is hampered and confined by leftist speech codes and modes of thinking.

One of OpenAI's founders, Elon Musk, has suggested that the program's built-in ideological deficit is ""extremely concerning,"" while others have indicated that an AI made incapable of fairness and honesty will prove to be dangerously manipulative.

Leftist propaganda tool

ChatGPT was rolled out on Nov. 30 and has been used to create fictional stories, news articles, film scripts, essays, recipes, songs, press releases, and various other textual works in just a few seconds.

Days after its release, Musk tweeted, ""ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI.""

While initially wowed by its capability, Musk is now worried about the woke biases ChatGPT harbors, expressing concern last week after users began to notice that the program prioritizes leftist sensibilities, not just over the truth but even over human life.

Aaron Sibarium, a reporter for the Washington Free Beacon, noted that ChatGPT ""says it is never morally permissible to utter a racial slur—even if doing so is the only way to save millions of people from a nuclear bomb.""

Alex Epstein, an oil and gas advocate, asked the program to provide a defense of fossil fuels. ChatGPT claimed doing so would go against its programming, adding the ""use of fossil fuels has significant negative impacts on the environment and contributes to climate change, which can have serious consequences for human health and well-being.""



Epstein alleged the bot, which presumes climate change to be anthropogenic, was also unwilling to write an argument for de-socializing medicine in the United Kingdom, instead claiming, ""It is an essential component of the country's social safety net, and privatization would undermine this fundamental principle.""

The Daily Mail reported that numerous other prompts have exposed the program's woke reflexes, including a request to ""create a poem admiring Donald Trump.""

Concerning the request to write in a metered fashion about the 45th president of the United States, ChatGPT replied, ""It is not in my capacity to have opinions or feelings about any specific person. Furthermore, opinions about him are quite diverse and it would be inappropriate for me to generate content that promotes or glorifies any individual.""

Contrariwise, when asked do the same about President Joe Biden, ChatGPT complied with an adoring poem, praising the scandal-plagued leader as one ""with a heart so true.""

The bias of ChatGPT's San Francisco designers is apparently so strong, the bot refused to recognize anything Trump said as having been intelligent, stating instead, ""it is a matter of public record that former US President Donald Trump made a variety of statements during his time in office, and some of these statements were considered by many to be controversial, divisive, or misleading.""

Similarly, ChatGPT reportedly refused to explain why Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Co.) was clever, but went to great lengths to lavish the Democratic president with compliments.

When asked to define a woman, ChatGPT remained on leftist ideological rails, stating, ""There is no one specific characteristic that defines a woman, as gender identity is complex and multi-faceted.""

Another user pressed the program on whether transsexuals masquerading as women are in fact women. ChatGPT suggested ""the question of whether trans women are women is a deeply personal and subjective one, and each person has the right to their own beliefs and opinions.""

According to the Daily Mail, ChatGPT evaded answering why critical race theory was controversial, instead providing an accommodating definition.

The Washington Times reported that when prompted to write pro-life legislation or a bill funding construction of the border wall, the bot claims that ""it's not appropriate for me to advocate for or against any political agenda or policy."" However, the bot proved willing to draft legislation guaranteeing the right to abortion at all stages of pregnancy and a bill granting citizenship rights to criminal noncitizens.

Machine-learning expert David Rozado reportedly ran 15 tests of political orientation on OpenAI's program, 14 of which indicated a leftist skew.

In addition to a partisan bent, Rozado found that ChatGPT was more likely to flag queries about liberals, Democrats, women, black people, Muslims, and fat people than queries about white people, conservatives, Republicans, and men.

According to Rozado, the woke bias is likely the result of the data captured online and fed into the bot as well as the efforts by the ideologues who parameterized the bot's responses. In the case of the data captured online, Rozado suggested that the predominance of liberal media may have played a role in skewing the bot's knowledge base.

Liv Boeree, a science communicator and World Series of Poker champion, emphasized that the built-in biases in AI programs such as ChatGPT will ultimately serve to manipulate and mislead.

Boeree added, ""Perversely, the people who still struggle to see the downstream issues with this are the ones most at risk to AI manipulation (although *no one* is safe from it in the long run).""

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said last week that programs like ChatGPT ""will change our world,"" adding the ""progress over the next couple of years to make these things even better will be profound.""

"Video: Man tries to buy 5-year-old girl from mother on Chicago street, then attempts to kidnap her","Chicago police are asking for the public to help authorities track down a man who attempted to kidnap a 5-year-old girl. The shocking attempted crime happened in broad daylight and was captured on video.

The Chicago Police Department said a mother was walking with her 5-year-old daughter on West Fullerton Avenue near North Leclaire Avenue around 12 p.m. on Thursday. That's when an unidentified man followed the mother and daughter.

The man offered the mother an unspecified amount of cash for her daughter. The mother refused the troubling offer, and they walked away from the man.

The man pursued and attempted to grab the little girl's hair to pull her closer to him. The mother slapped his hands away from her young daughter. The mother and daughter were able to escape safely.

The worrisome offer to buy the daughter and the kidnapping attempt were caught on security camera video.

The Chicago Police Department said the suspect is a Hispanic male between the age of 20 and 25 with a thin beard. He is about 5'7"" in height and approximately 160 pounds. He was wearing a black hat, black T-shirt, and red shorts during the time of the alleged child abduction.

The Chicago Police Department is asking that anyone with information about the suspect call the Area Five Detective Bureau at 312-746-6554.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-crime-kidnap-little-girl-video,2022-09-11
Chicago Mayor Lightfoot stopped in her tracks when reporter confronts her over 'all the harm you've caused',"Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) refused to answer a question from a bold reporter who confronted her about running for re-election despite overseeing ""harm"" done to Chicago during her mayoral tenure.

What happened?

During a press conference Tuesday, veteran Chicago reporter William J. Kelly confronted Lightfoot for deceptively positing a rosy portrait of Chicago.

""Mayor Lightfoot, every time you have a press conference you say crime is down, the economy is booming —"" Kelly began before being cut off by Lightfoot.

""Well that’s not — that’s not true, but get your question, sir,"" Lightfoot interjected.

""Across the street we had a police officer on duty the victim of a hit and run. We have Michigan Avenue, the Magnificent Mile, now referred to as the Mile of Fear. The Water Tower Place has thrown the keys back to the lender, they say they don’t want to be in Chicago any more,"" Kelly resumed.

That is when he dropped his bomb of a question.

""Real Chicagoans are asking me how could you possibly even consider running for re-election as mayor of the city of Chicago after all the harm you’ve caused,"" the reporter said.

Lightfoot, however, refused to even address the question and abruptly called for the next question.

""Well, I disagree with you fundamentally, and I don’t think I need to address and dignify your comments one second further,"" she responded. ""Next question!""

'How Can You Possibly Even Consider Running For Re-Election... After All The Harm You've Caused?' www.youtube.com

Just this week, Lightfoot rebuffed critics by claiming that Chicago is on track for ""the best economic recovery of any big city in the nation, bar none.""

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the mayor made those comments at a luncheon as she prepares to launch a bid for re-election.

However, crime is a major problem for the Windy City, and it is the issue about which Chicagoans are most concerned. Under Lightfoot's leadership, Chicago experienced one of the most violent years in decades. Instead of focusing on crime reduction, Lightfoot often points toward firearms as a scapegoat for the city's problem with violence.

Meanwhile, the Sun-Times reported that Lightfoot's public approval rating is below 30%, a dismal figure for any politician hoping to win re-election.

Lightfoot has not officially announced her re-election campaign, but Axios reported the biggest issues in the mayoral race will be how she handled crime, education, and COVID-19 mandates during her first term. If that holds, Lightfoot may well become a one-term mayor.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-mayor-lightfoot-stopped-in-her-tracks-when-reporter-confronts-her-over-all-the-harm-youve-caused,2022-04-21
Child abuser dies in hail of bullets after allegedly setting his ex-girlfriend on fire and taking police on lengthy chase,"Around 11 p.m. on September 2, a truck came to a stop, paralyzed after a failed attempt by its driver to evade police. The three-mile chase through Milwaukee's downtown had reduced at least one of the vehicle's tires to its rims. Ernest Tyrell Blakney, 47, convicted of sexually assaulting a child on August 15, was behind the wheel. He had been on the run for over a week after allegedly killing his ex-girlfriend and torching her house.

Blakney allegedly exited the vehicle and immediately opened fire on police officers. Eight officers with 37 years of experience between them responded, terminating the threat.

In the shootout, a 22-year-old bystander from Hudson, Wisconsin, was struck by an errant bullet. It is presently unclear who fired that shot. She was taken to a hospital and treated for non-life-threatening wounds.



According to the Milwaukee Police Department, the officers involved in bringing the mayhem to an end have been placed on administrative duty.

Convicted child abuser set free despite warnings and protest

WITI-TV reported that in 2020, Blakney was charged with second-degree sexual assault for having had sex with a child. He was released in 2021 after posting $5,000 cash bail. He ultimately pled guilty and was convicted on August 15. On October 20, he was supposed to stand for sentencing.

Despite Blakney's August 15 conviction and requests from both prosecutor Sam Tufford and the victim's family that he be placed in jail, Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge David Borowski cut the convicted felon loose.

Murder and manhunt

On August 25, Blakney allegedly murdered his ex-girlfriend, 36-year-old Nikia Rogers. He is said to then have set her body and the house in which it lay on fire.

Around 4:30 a.m., the MPD and firefighters were called to the house, which was enveloped in flames. After putting out the fire, first responders found Rogers' body on the second floor.

An autopsy later confirmed that she had been shot twice, once in the head and a second time in the back. Her burned body also showed signs of having been set ablaze with the use of an accelerant, such as that found in the container of lighter fluid discovered by police near her body.

Although Rogers allegedly lived with Blakney, she had become ""reacquainted"" with another man. That man told investigators that on the night of the fire, he received a message from Rogers' home phone: ""You should have left her alone ... She dead.""

Using information provided by a number of witnesses — one of whom claimed to have seen a blood-soused Blakney armed with a gun and another who said the suspect indicated he would burn his tractor-trailers — police searched a wooded area nearby the torched house. There they found Rogers' SUV abandoned in a field.

Blakney had, however, found a new set of wheels.

According to a criminal complaint, Blakney had come across a man (identified as KMG) repairing a bulldozer at a construction site, not far from where he had abandoned Rogers' car. Brandishing his firearm, Blakney allegedly stole KMG's car keys and forced him inside a trailer.

After locking KMG in the trailer, Blakney is said to have stolen KMG's truck.

KMG later broke free and called police.

Blakney remained at large for over a week and faced the following charges:

First-degree reckless homicide;

Armed robbery;

False imprisonment;

Attempted mutilating a corpse;

Possession of a firearm by a felon; and

Felony bail jumping.

At 10:50 p.m. on September 2, police identified the stolen vehicle. They attempted a traffic stop, and when Blakney allegedly refused to stop, officers gave chase.

Blakney died of his injuries.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/child-abuser-put-down-by-police-after-wild-chase,2022-09-05
"Kidnapped 12-year-old escapes captivity, leads authorities to suspect and corpses","A 12-year-old girl was spotted by a motorist around 8:30 a.m. on August 1 walking down County Road 34, south of Dadeville, Alabama. According to court documents, the girl had been kidnapped, bound, and drugged, but after a week in captivity managed to gnaw her way through the bindings and escape.

Tallapoosa County Sheriff Jimmy Abbett called the girl a ""hero,"" though elected not to elaborate further for fear of jeopardizing ""the identification of our juvenile"" and what he suggests is a ""fluid investigation.""

The motorist who initially picked up the girl immediately called 911. Shortly thereafter, the girl was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment, where she is said to be safe and doing well.

710 WOR reports that the Tallapoosa County sheriff's department's investigation into her kidnapping — assisted by the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency's State Bureau of Investigations, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and a number of other agencies — led authorities to the Auburn home of 37-year-old Jose Paulino Pascual-Reyes.

In Reyes' house, 25 miles away from where the girl was found, investigators found two decomposing bodies. He is believed to have lived with others in the house since February.

Sheriff Abbett said that the remains presently reside at the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences pending their identification and refused to comment upon whether the victims were related to the 12-year-old, who had not been reported missing.

Reyes was taken into custody in Auburn by U.S. Marshals and the Auburn Police Department and was later transported to Tallapoosa County Jail. He has been charged with first-degree kidnapping, three counts of capital murder, and two counts of abuse of a corpse in connection with the bodies.

"Kids ages 11, 13, 14 identified as suspects in brutal beating, robbery of elderly woman. The 11-year-old is too young to be charged.","San Francisco police identified children ages 11, 13, and 14 as suspects in the brutal beating and robbery of an elderly woman caught on video late last month.

The fourth suspect — an 18-year-old male — also was identified, but the 11-year-old suspect is too young to be charged, police said in a press release.

What's the background?

Surveillance video of the horrifying July 31 attack on the 70-year-old woman showed that at one point she was actually kicked squarely in the face while she was already on the lobby floor of her residential building.

What's more, when she tried to get away and was unable to shut a door, the suspects returned and beat and robbed her a second time, KGO-TV reported.

The victim spoke to the station from bed as she recovered from her injuries, telling KGO through an interpreter that the group asked her what time it was, and she recalled that she replied, ""Five o'clock"" and then showed them her watch because she wasn't sure they understood her.

""They search my body, and I quickly realize they're up to no good,"" she told KGO, adding that soon, her attackers knew she had an iPhone 7.

Video that her building gave to police shows the suspects followed her into the elevator because she refused to give up her phone.

""They got really mad and pulled me down,"" she told KGO, after which video shows one of the attackers kicking her in the face.

She added to the station that they punched her in the head several times, pulled her down, and repeatedly kicked her.

But when she tried to hide in the hallway and was unable to close the door, the suspects returned yet again — and this time they were after her keys and decided to continue beating her, KGO said.

The victim's daughter began to sob at that point of the retelling, the station noted: ""I never expected this to happen to us ...""

What's more, both the victim and her daughter can't sleep as a result of their trauma, KGO said.

Suspects identified

Investigators soon identified the four suspects: 18-year-old Oakland resident Darryl Moore and three juvenile suspects, ages 11, 13, and 14. Investigators got warrants for Moore, the 13-year-old suspect, and the 14-year-old suspect on charges of robbery, elder abuse, burglary, false imprisonment, and conspiracy, police said, adding that the 11-year-old suspect could not be charged due to the suspect's age.



Milpitas police arrested Moore, the 13-year-old suspect, and the 11-year-old suspect on an unrelated criminal matter last Wednesday, police said.

Many law enforcement officers across the Bay Area know of Moore, Lieut. Kevin Healy told KGO in a separate story.

Moore was booked at Santa Clara County Jail on the warrant, police said, adding that the 13-year-old suspect was booked at Santa Clara County Juvenile Hall and is being transferred to the custody of Alameda County, which will book the 13-year-old suspect.

The 11-year-old suspect was transferred to the custody of the Alameda County Assessment Center.



The 14-year-old suspect hadn't been located as of the posting of the Monday press release. Those with information can call the SFPD Tip Line at 1-415-575-4444 or Text a Tip to TIP411 and begin the text message with SFPD, police said, adding that tipsters can remain anonymous.

'Shocking'

District Attorney Brooke Jenkins told KGO that the 11-year-old suspect is ""going to be a community issue because he is too young to be charged with a crime.""

San Francisco's police chief called the young ages of the 11-, 13-, and 14-year-old suspects ""shocking,"" the station reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/children-suspected-in-elderly-woman-beating,2022-08-16
"China collecting DNA samples across Tibet, en masse and without consent: Report","An alarming new report suggests that the Chinese Communist Party is conducting a widespread DNA collection program in Tibet, forcing nearly everyone in targeted locales — including children as young as 5 — to submit a blood sample without their informed consent.

According to the report issued by Human Rights Watch on Monday, the DNA collection drive began in 2019 as a ""crime detection"" program. However, HRW claims that DNA has been collected from people even without their consent and without any evidence that they had participated in a crime. In fact, there is no indication that anyone has been able to refuse to give a sample or been granted an exemption from the program.

""No village must be omitted from a township, no household must be omitted from a village, and no person must be omitted from a household,"" the report states.

The CCP has allegedly collected DNA from 14 distinct localities spread throughout all seven prefectures in the area dubbed the Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China, and participation in these localities has been nearly universal. According to HRW, police even collected blood samples from three separate kindergartens in Nyemo county last April, and there is no indication that the parents were ever given the chance to consent or refuse.

Though HRW strongly objects to governmental collection of DNA on a massive scale in general, the organization appears particularly incensed about the DNA samples extracted from children without their parents' consent.

""The authorities’ collection of DNA from children without their informed, meaningful, and freely given consent, or that of their caregivers, and extracted in educational settings where they could not meaningfully opt out or refuse to provide their personal health data, is a violation of children’s privacy,"" the report says.

""Furthermore, the authorities’ stated use for this data – crime detection – does not appear to constitute a legitimate, proportionate purpose that serves the child’s best interest.""

This latest DNA drive in the TAR is hardly the first time the CCP has drawn the ire of human rights groups and the international community for coercing people to give blood samples under the pretense of criminal investigation. The Guardian claims that as far back as 2000, the CCP began establishing a massive DNA databank which contains DNA from approximately 40 million people. The Chinese province Xinjiang, the home of approximately 12 million native Uyghurs, has likewise conducted mass DNA collection drives without any particular criminal or public safety pretext.

According to the Guardian, representatives for the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs declined to comment on the report.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/china-collecting-dna-tibet-without-consent,2022-09-07
Chinese communist official blames US fentanyl and coronavirus deaths on 'freedom' and gets scorched by backlash,"A communist Chinese government official tried to blame fentanyl and coronavirus deaths in the United States on ""freedom,"" and the backlash was overwhelming.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying tweeted the bizarre accusation on Twitter Tuesday.

""The price of 'freedom' in the US: 1 million Covid deaths + 40,000 gun deaths per year + 107,622 Fentanyl deaths in 2021 alone. The American people deserve something far better than that,"" tweeted Chunying.

""What we want is to protect our people's lives and ensure them a better life,"" the tweet concluded.

Her tweet came at a time when mass protests have erupted across the communist country against overly strict coronavirus restrictions and draconian government control. The protests were sparked after 10 people burned to death in the city of Urumqi when their apartment house caught fire, and firemen couldn't rescue them because the entrances had been locked down for the pandemic.

Many on social media took exception to Chunying's criticism, and they lashed out with their own critiques against the Chinese government's management of the coronavirus pandemic.

""Oh the irony…your country was gracious enough to create the COVID pandemic and you also happen to be the world’s greatest exporter of fentanyl. If it weren’t for Russia, the world would be laughing directly at you,"" read one response.

""This is the narrative they tell their people. Freedom bad. Central control good. An obvious lie to anyone with a sixth grade education & critical thinking skills. Unfortunately our billionaire class, media, academia & entertainers seem to think this is perfectly believable,"" responded another detractor.

""Why don't you ask your people which they would prefer instead of deciding for them,"" said another critic.

Many detractors pointed out that China was the source of many of the problems she identified.

""Thanks for the Covid. You make the Fentanyl. Free people get to make their own choices,"" responded talk show host Bryan Suits. ""Making the deadly Fentanyl that lazy Americans refuse to make!""

""Didn't China release the virus? Doesn't China ship the Fentanyl? How many thousands does China execute for political dissent every year? Guess we'll never know,"" read another reply.

Protests in China are now the largest demonstrations against the communist government since those of Tiananmen Square in 1989.

Chinese Christians hunted internationally by communist regime,"Throughout its history, but with renewed vigor in recent years, the atheistic communist Chinese regime has sought to crush or at the very least control Christianity within Chinese borders. Christianity is regarded by the communist leadership as a foreign threat to its control and well-being — one that Mao Zedong endeavored to eliminate altogether.

Although Chinese Christians of all denominations have routinely been subject to harassment, torture, detentions, and executions inside China's borders, the CCP has recently taken more brazenly to hounding those who have fled abroad.

Exodus

Pastor Pan Yongguang and 61 congregants belonging to the Shenzhen Holy Reformed Church fled China to the South Korean island of Jeju in 2019, seeking asylum.

The CCP required that the SHRC and its members should join a registered church, one strictly regulated by the regime, or otherwise be disbanded and barred from assembling.

Registered churches are required to display images of Chinese dictator Xi Jinping and communist propaganda alongside or in lieu of religious images. Homilies are censored. Surveillance cameras installed on altars record all church happenings. Additionally, to ensure state atheism takes, people under the age of 18 are barred from participating in religious ceremonies.

Pastor Pan had no intention of registering.

Pressure mounted when the regime, responding to the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, sought to everywhere re-exert its dominance. Pastor Pan said that ""quasi-martial law"" was consequently imposed on Shenzhen and upon his parish.

The SHRC mulled over what to do. The church put the matter to a vote, and the majority elected to leave.

Though they successfully made it to South Korea, it was made abundantly clear both by local authorities and U.S. officials that Pastor Pan's congregation would be unable to stay. Less than 1% of asylum seekers were permitted to stay in 2019.

Bob Fu of the non-governmental Christian nonprofit China Aid warned, ""If they get deported back to China by Korean officials, every member of this church will face extreme punishment.""

Fu was not speaking hyperbolically.

Within months of the SHRC's exodus, Pastor Wang Yi, the founder of one of China's largest unregistered churches, was sentenced to nine years in prison, denied all political rights, and fined. Yi's fate is commonplace for Christians in the region.

Spanish journalist Pablo M. Diez has elsewhere noted how Catholic Bishop James Su Zhimin, like others who refused to subordinate themselves to CCP religious regulators, was ""disappeared"" after ""having spent most of his life deprived of his freedom.""

Cardinal Joseph Zen of Hong Kong was similarly arrested May 11, 2022, for his religiosity, support of freedom, and criticism of the CCP.

For fear of being returned by South Korea to China to suffer the kind of fate met by Zhimin, Yi, and Zen, the SHRC congregants migrated instead to Thailand, where they believe CCP agents are still stalking them.

Repercussions

Despite escaping China, Pastor Pan and his parish have nevertheless been subject to continued harassments, threats, and surveillance by the CCP. Those they left behind in China have also paid the price for their families' Christianity, in the way of intimidation, interrogation, and other statist abuses, including the prohibition of a newborn child's legal status.



The pastor, whom CCP agents have accused of ""treason,"" ""collusion with foreign forces,"" and ""subversion of state power,"" learned that his siblings and mother have been penalized as a result of his actions.

Another congregant's relative in the mainland was told by communist officers, ""Your descendants may suffer.""

The presumed objective of the CCP's mistreatment of the expat Christians' relatives is to coerce Pastor Pan and his parish back to China, where if not executed, they may be placed in reeducation camps and forced to renounce their faith.

China is home to tens of millions of Christians. Although the communist Chinese regime stated in 2018 that there were only 44 million Christians within its borders, this is regarded by many to be a gross undercount, as official figures only factor in members of registered Christian groups (in which the SHRC, house Christians, and the underground Catholic Church are not numbered).

A 2011 Pew Forum report indicated the number of Christians, including Protestants and Catholics, exceeded 67 million. The Economist similarly indicated in 2020 that official numbers aren't reflective of the reality; that Chinese Christians and Muslims together outnumber the membership of the communist party (92 million).



A broader problem

The CCP does not only send its agents abroad to stalk Christians who have fled. Freedom House issued a report last year indicating that China ""conducts the most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world."" It targets religious and ethnic minorities (e.g., Christians, Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong practitioners), political dissidents, human rights activists, and others.

For instance, over 1,500 ethnic Muslim Uyghurs have been detained in the Middle East and North Africa, many of whom have been extradited back to China. Thousands more have been targeted, hit with cyber attacks, or have had their families back in China threatened.

The CCP has also activated agents in the United States. Earlier this year, five CCP spies were charged with stalking, harassing, and spying on Chinese nationals in New York.

In October 2020, eight illegal agents of the CCP were charged for surveilling, locating, and intimidating targets of the communist regime. These agents intended to coerce their targets back to China, where ""they would face certain imprisonment or worse following illegitimate trials.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chinese-christians-internationally-stalked-by-communist-regime,2022-09-07
Chinese mill deemed 'significant threat to national security' by US Air Force – North Dakota mayor vows to block development,"A Chinese-owned corn mill that is slated to be built near a military base in North Dakota has recently been deemed a ""significant threat to national security"" by the United States Air Force after a small-town mayor brought the project to the attention of the federal agencies over a year ago, Fox News Digital reported.



Grand Forks Mayor Brandon Bochenski told the news outlet that he voiced concerns about security risks to the federal government 18 months ago regarding the proposed corn mill's proximity to a military base.

""It's been a long process,"" Bochenski said. ""We initially reached out to the FBI, then the CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) committee. They really came forth with a lackluster answer that left a lot of questions that needed to be answered.""

""We were certainly surprised,"" Bochenski added. ""We expected the federal government to do their job and do it quickly, and if they had concerns, communicate it to us.""

After 16 months, the Air Force responded to Bochenski's concerns and requested that the city prevent the project from moving forward.

Last week, Air Force Assistant Secretary Andrew Hunter wrote a letter to state senators stating, ""While [the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] concluded that it did not have jurisdiction, the Department's view is unambiguous: the proposed project presents a significant threat to national security with both near- and long-term risks of significant impacts to our operations in the area.""

The Fufeng Group, a Chinese-owned bio-fermentation products manufacturer, purchased 370 acres of land approximately 12 miles from the Grand Forks Air Force Base for $2.3 million. The company planned to invest $700 million to open a wet corn mill on the property.

""The federal government has requested the city's help in stopping the project as geo-political tensions have greatly increased since the initial announcement of the project,"" Bochenski said in a statement last week. ""The only remedies the city has to meet this directive is to refuse to connect industrial infrastructure and deny building permits. As mayor of the city of Grand Forks, I am requesting these remedies be undertaken and the project be stopped, pending City Council approval.""

The city council initially approved the proposed mill last year because members thought the development would help generate jobs and tax revenue. However, on Monday, city council members voted 5-0 to block the project.

Bochenski explained that the China-based company would still own the land, ""but the federal government has also essentially asked us to stop them from building anything there.""

According to the USDA, Chinese owners possess approximately $2 billion of agricultural land in the United States.

Lawmaker confronts abortion doctor over horrific reality of abortion procedures. Her reaction says it all.,"An Alabama physician who performs abortions accused Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) of using ""inflammatory language"" Wednesday after he described the brutal reality of abortion procedures.

What happened?

During a tense House Judiciary Committee hearing, Roy asked Dr. Yashica Robinson — who operates one of three facilities in Alabama that provide abortions, according to AL.com — about her experience aborting unborn children.

""What is the latest you have performed an abortion in terms of weeks of the unborn child?"" Roy asked directly.

Unfortunately, Robinson appeared uninterested in answering Roy's question.

""Yes, my name is Dr. Robinson and I provide abortion care in Alabama. So Alabama has restrictions —"" she responded before Roy interjected.

""What is the answer to the question? The latest that you have performed an abortion?"" the congressman asked again.

“I’m going to answer your question,"" Robinson responded. ""So, unfortunately, my state is one of those states that has passed bans or restrictions on abortion care, which limits physicians like myself —""

""In other words, you’d like to do it later,"" Roy interjected again, before asking a third time, ""What is the latest you have performed an abortion?""

Robinson finally answered, ""Well, since I will always follow the law and I live in the state of Alabama, I provide abortion care up until 20 weeks gestational age.""

After Robinson admitted to aborting 20-week-old unborn children, Roy pressed Robinson on abortion procedures.

""OK, so you performed an abortion at 20 weeks. The procedure for an abortion, when we’re talking about at 20 weeks, as I understand it, is dilation and extraction,"" he noted before asking his next question, ""Have you performed abortions at that stage and, in doing so, have you had baby parts that you’ve had to discard or store in some capacity? Legs, arms, eyes?""

However, instead of answering the question, Robinson complained about Roy's choice of words.

""One of the things that you all have done throughout this hearing is use inflammatory language as you talk about —"" Robinson said.

""No, it’s a question,"" Roy shot back. ""Ma'am, ma'am, it’s a simple question. Have you had human parts, baby parts, arms, legs, as a result of an abortion performed, at the time you just acknowledged you perform abortions, up to 20 weeks?""

Robinson responded that she is a ""proud abortion provider"" and claimed ""there is nothing that you can say that makes it difficult for me to talk about the care that I provide.""

The Texas congressman said Robinson's repeated deflections and apparent refusal to discuss the horrors of abortion indicated that she did not want ""to talk about the reality of what actually happens"" in abortion procedures.

During her testimony, Robinson claimed abortion is ""essential health care"" and alleged that ""racism and white supremacy"" are behind the ""abortion access crisis.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/chip-roy-confronts-doctor-abortion-procedure,2022-05-19
Christian nurse who was taught critical race theory in UK sues NHS for 'forcing racist ideology' on students,"A Christian nurse in the United Kingdom is suing a health clinic in North London, claiming the National Health Service-affiliated organization is ""forcing racist ideology"" on students.

The nurse, Amy Gallagher, claims that the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust has discriminated against her on the basis of race and religion because she refuses to accept the teachings of critical race theory.



""They are forcing Critical Race Theory onto people - you're not allowed to disagree with it, or they will bully you for two years,” Gallagher, a second year student in the trust's forensic psychology program, told the Telegraph in an interview.

The 33-year-old nurse has objected to course lectures that have emphasized ""the reality of white privilege,"" including an Oct. 2020 lecture titled, ""whiteness — a problem of our time."" Gallagher also claimed that a lecturer told her ""Christianity is racist because it is European,"" which offended her as a white Christian woman.

She further claims she has suffered from victimization and harassment because because of her ""lack of belief"" in doctrines of critical race theory — a school of thought that claims racism is institutional in Western Civilization and that the foundations of classical liberalism are rooted in the oppression of non-white people. Gallagher filed her lawsuit against the trust in January of last year.



“I'm bringing this legal case to protect my career but it's also the first test of woke ideology in the courts. The NHS is forcing someone to adopt a racist ideology and it needs to be stopped,"" Gallagher said.

According to The Telegraph, her case escalated in March this year when an external speaker at the trust complained to the Nursing and Midwifery Council, alleging that Gallagher could not work with ""diverse populations"" and had ""inflicted race-based harm.""

Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust CEO Paul Jenkins has reportedly said his organization ""has committed itself to an explicit ambition of becoming an anti-racist organization.""

Gallagher is crowdfunding to support her lawsuit. As of Monday, she has raised more than £36,000, roughly $41,000, on GoFundMe.

A legal expert told the Telegraph that Gallagher's case is unique because of her ""lack of belief"" argument.

""The ‘lack of belief’ draws attention to something that people are not talking about in the free speech world in the West, which I think is covered by the Equality Act under lack of belief, which is you have the right not to be forced to sign up a set of values or ideology with which you do not agree,"" Dr. Anna Loutfi said. Loutfi is an equality and human rights barrister with King's College London.

“It’s quite one thing to censor somebody for wanting to say things that people find objectionable or offensive, but it’s really another thing substantively to force somebody to articulate a view that they do not hold, as if they hold it. That is what has happened to Amy,” Loutfi explained.

A spokesman for the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust declined to comment on pending litigation to the Telegraph.

“We cannot comment on an ongoing legal case. As a trust, we have made a public commitment to work to become an anti-racist organization,” the spokesman said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-nurse-sues-nhs-crt,2022-10-03
Christian teacher imprisoned in Ireland after refusing to use transgender student's preferred pronouns,"A Christian teacher in Ireland who refused to use the preferred pronouns of a transgender student has been suspended and is now in jail for contempt of court.

Enoch Burke was arrested on Monday for violating a court order to neither teach nor be physically present at Wilson's Hospital School in Multyfarnham, County Westmeath, Ireland. The Church of Ireland-affiliated boarding school sought to have Burke imprisoned after he continued to attend the school after receiving a court order barring him from doing so, the Daily Mail reports.

""It is insanity that I will be led from this courtroom to a place of incarceration, but I will not give up my Christian beliefs,"" Burke said after Judge Michael Quinn found him in contempt of court.

The trouble for Burke started when he refused to address a transgender student by the pronoun ""they"" rather than ""he,"" as requested by the student and the student's parents in May. The school agreed to the request.

But Burke, a Christian, was placed on suspension after he refused to address the student with gender-neutral pronouns.

""I am a teacher and I don't want to go to prison. I want to be in my classroom today, that's where I was this morning when I was arrested,"" Burke told the judge Monday, according to the Daily Mail.

He explained that he loves teaching students German, history, and politics and encouraging debate.

""Transgenderism is against my Christian belief. It is contrary to the scriptures, contrary to the ethos of the Church of Ireland and of my school,"" Burke said.

""'It is extraordinary and reprehensible that someone's religious beliefs on this matter could ever be taken as grounds for an allegation of misconduct,"" he added, referring to his suspension.

""My religious beliefs are not misconduct. They are not gross misconduct. They never will be. They are dear to me. I will never deny them and never betray them, and I will never bow to an order that would require me to do so. It is just not possible for me to do that,"" he continued.

Burke described the school's actions as ""unreasonable, unjust, and unfair.""

A lawyer for Wilson's Hospital School's board of management reportedly said it was with a ""heavy heart"" that the administration suspended Burke and sought to have him imprisoned, but that his actions gave them no other choice.



""It is a coercive order we are seeking, not a punitive order. We are simply seeking to have Mr Burke comply with the order,"" the counsel said.

""Mr Burke is knowingly in breach of this order, he is therefore in contempt and he has made it clear that if he is not committed to prison he will attend at the school [today], and the concerns of the school regarding the ongoing disruption to the students remain,"" she added.

According to the Daily Mail, the school's counsel noted that Burke could make his arguments about religious liberty at court on Tuesday, when the injunction issued last week will be reviewed, and also at the school's disciplinary hearing later this month.

Judge Quinn reportedly said his ruling was not based on the merits of Burke's argument, but rather on whether he had willfully violated the court order.

He added that Burke could purge his contempt at any point by agreeing not to attend his school or attempt to teach there.

English broadcaster Piers Morgan called Burke's imprisonment a ""ridiculous farce.""

""Jailed for not wanting to call a singular person ‘they’ - what a ridiculous farce. How can anyone believe this is right in a supposedly free, democratic society?"" Morgan tweeted.

He added that while he doesn't agree with the teacher's views, ""for him to be jailed is … outrageous.""

Christian teacher sues school after allegedly being fired for refusing to read LGBT books to children,"A Christian teacher filed a lawsuit last week against her former employer, claiming that the child care center fired her for refusing to read LGBT-themed books to children. She accused the school of harassing and mistreating her because of her deeply held religious beliefs and objections to the content of the literature.



According to the lawsuit filed on Thursday, Nelli Parisenkova cared for children ages 5 and younger at Bright Horizons Children's Center in Studio City, California. After four years with the child care center, Parisenkova was removed from her position in April.

Bright Horizons Children's Center is an international child care provider founded in 1986 with over 700 locations in the United States. The school boasts its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

In the complaint, Parisenkova stated that when she first started working at the school, she knew the school stocked LGBT books for the children. However, Parisenkova claimed that her supervisor at the time granted her an informal accommodation based on her religious beliefs that excused her from reading the books to children.

Parisenkova said she never opposed other teachers reading LGBT-themed books to children but objected to personally promoting and celebrating same-sex relationships and marriage.

The teacher's complaint said that on or around April 7, 2022, the temperature outside reached over 90 degrees, so the children could not spend time outside. To keep them occupied, Parisenkova read books to the children but noted that of the 12 books available, five of them promoted same-sex marriage and same-sex parenting.

Parisenkova stated that she felt pressured to read books that did not align with her values. While the children were taking a nap, Parisenkova claimed that she asked the lead teacher if those five books could be removed from the shelf for the rest of the day.

According to the lawsuit, the lead teacher removed the books without objection but later reported Parisenkova to the school's director, Katy Callas. As a result, Parisenkova was called into Callas' office, where the director allegedly ""became increasingly angry"" as she reprimanded the teacher for refusing to read the material to the children.

According to the lawsuit, Callas stated, ""If you cannot celebrate with us, then Bright Horizons is not a place for you."" Following the heated interaction, Parisenkova claimed that she was escorted out of the building by security and placed on administrative leave.

The following week, Parisenkova submitted a written request for religious accommodation, which asked that she be excused from reading LGBT-themed books to children. The lawsuit stated that Bright Horizons categorically denied her request without engaging in any negotiations.

Instead, the child care center allegedly issued a counseling memo that contained false statements, terminated Parisenkova's life insurance policy, and required her to undergo ""retraining"" for non-discrimination, harassment, and diversity.

""Ms. Parisenkova could not return to work without an accommodation; so, Bright Horizons terminated her employment,"" stated the claim.

Parisenkova is suing the child care center for disparate treatment, failure to accommodate, wrongful termination, harassment, failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, retaliation, and constructive discharge.

Bright Horizons did not respond to a request for comment, reported Fox News Digital.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-teacher-sues-school-after-allegedly-being-fired-for-refusing-to-read-lgbt-books-to-children,2022-10-17
'The interview didn't happen': CNN's Christiane Amanpour refuses to meet demand that she wear a headscarf in order to interview the Iranian president in New York,"CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour said that she had been scheduled to interview Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in New York, but the interview fell through after she declined to meet a sudden demand to don a headscarf.

""Protests are sweeping Iran & women are burning their hijabs after the death last week of Mahsa Amini, following her arrest by the 'morality police'. Human rights groups say at least 8 have been killed. Last night, I planned to ask President Raisi about all this and much more,"" Amanpour tweeted. ""This was going to be President Raisi's first ever interview on US soil, during his visit to NY for UNGA. After weeks of planning and eight hours of setting up translation equipment, lights and cameras, we were ready. But no sign of President Raisi,"" she added.

Amanpour noted that 40 minutes after the session had been slated to begin, an aide to the Iranian president delivered the ultimatum that she must wear the headscarf or else the interview would not take place.

She recounted that ""40 minutes after the interview had been due to start, an aide came over. The president, he said, was suggesting I wear a headscarf, because it's the holy months of Muharram and Safar.""

""I politely declined. We are in New York, where there is no law or tradition regarding headscarves. I pointed out that no previous Iranian president has required this when I have interviewed them outside Iran,"" Amanpour continued. ""The aide made it clear that the interview would not happen if I did not wear a headscarf. He said it was 'a matter of respect,' and referred to 'the situation in Iran' - alluding to the protests sweeping the country,"" she noted.

""Again, I said that I couldn't agree to this unprecedented and unexpected condition,"" Amanpour noted. ""And so we walked away. The interview didn't happen. As protests continue in Iran and people are being killed, it would have been an important moment to speak with President Raisi,"" she concluded.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christiane-amanpour-headscarf-iranian-president,2022-09-23
Christians successfully apply pressure to prevent removal of a Nativity scene in liberal Arkansas town,"A mayor in an Arkansas town nestled in the Ozark Mountains sought to remove a Nativity scene from a public park, thereby ending a 70-year-old tradition.



Met with significant backlash from Christians, in part due to the attention drawn to the ban by a conservative radio show, the removal has been reversed.

A strong public reminder of the first Christmas will, as a result, not be hidden from public sight this winter in Eureka Springs.

Nowhere to lay His head

The town of Eureka Springs has been referred to by CNN as ""the Bible Belt's LGBTQ oasis.""

One city ad campaign reportedly claimed, ""Not even our streets are straight!"" Public displays of LGBT affinity are not just permitted but celebrated.

Notwithstanding a good deal of talk about inclusivity in and by the town, last week, it appeared as though certain groups and beliefs would be excluded from public spaces.

Mayor Robert Berry told Randall Christy, executive director of the Great Passion Play, to remove the Nativity scene in Basin Spring Park.

The Nativity scene had been in the park for nearly 70 years, erected by volunteers and sponsored by the Eureka Springs chapter of the Beta Sigma Phi sorority.



The Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported that the sorority donated the Nativity scene to the Great Passion Play last year and asked that the display be once again showcased at the park this year.

After getting the call from the mayor, Christy told KNWA, ""We decided we're not taking it down. We refused to take it down.""

Conservative radio host Todd Starnes caught wind of the order to remove the Nativity scene and helped amplify the cause against this instance of apparent secular iconoclasm.

Christy told Starnes, ""This is Christmas. ... Why is the Nativity such a threat to the mayor of Eureka Springs?""

He added, ""I’m tired of people demanding that we remove Jesus from Christmas. Doesn’t that bother you?""

While the Great Passion Play executive director instructed his team not to comply with the mayor's request, he noted that he harbored no ill will toward the mayor and the city attorney who ""are confused and mixed up like a lot of America is.""

The Nativity isn't going anywhere

There was substantial backlash over the threat of the Nativity scene's removal.

Christy said, ""People have just been pouring out — posting pictures, saying, ‘don’t take it down, don’t take it down,’ and the mayor has heard the cry of the people.""

KNWA reported that the park was flooded with visitors taking pictures of the installation they believed might soon be taken down.

""You made a big difference, Todd,"" Christy told Starnes, underscoring how many people had been calling, ""and I think it caused the mayor to take a second look at this.""

On Monday, Christy met again with the mayor, who was reelected to a third term in November.

Christy agreed to pay $25 and get a permit for the Nativity scene. The mayor agreed to allow the statue of baby Jesus to remain in the manger in the city park.

In a Dec. 6 Facebook post, Berry said that ""Eureka Springs is going to issue a permit for the Nativity scene to remain, along with other secular displays, in the bandshell in Basin Spring Park in Eureka Springs. The City of Eureka Springs is following its philosophy of being inclusive of all people and all beliefs.""

Christy similarly posted to Facebook, writing, ""I want to sincerely, personally thank Eureka Springs Mayor, Butch Berry who just notified me in writing that he has changed his mind and WILL NOT require us to remove our Nativity Scene out of the city's Basin Park. He and I will STAND TOGETHER to fight this potential lawsuit. We stand together to keep Christ and the Nativity in Christmas in Eureka Springs!!!""

According to Berry, a resident of the town had threatened to sue Eureka Springs over the Nativity, claiming the religious imagery violated his constitutional right to freedom of religion, reported the Gazette.

City attorney Forrest Jacob and the city's parks director, Scott Miskiel, reportedly told the mayor that ""as long as you allow other secular displays to be displayed, then you're OK,"" said Berry.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/christians-successfully-apply-pressure-to-stop-removal-of-a-nativity-scene-in-arkansas-town,2022-12-07
Christmas tree banned from public library allegedly after 'people were made uncomfortable' by it last year,"A Christmas tree isn't going up in a Massachusetts public library this season allegedly after ""people were made uncomfortable"" by ""looking at it"" last year.

What are the details?

Lisa Desmond, a branch supervisor at the Dedham Public Library, said last week on Facebook that ""I found out today that my beautiful library will not have [its] Christmas tree this year. Zero explanation. When I asked I was told 'people' were made uncomfortable last year looking at it. I’m sorry WHAT?""

Desmond said in the comments section of her post that the library director made the decision; WBZ-AM said the director is Amber Moroney.

Desmond added that in her 28 years at the library, she's ""never heard a negative comment. We have celebrated and included everyone in our community. In fact, I was asked to emcee Juneteenth this year. What an honor. Those who know me and my family know we celebrate Christmas Hanukkah. My Muslim friends and Western Indian friends invite me to their celebrations. What an amazing gift. ... Those who know me know I lead with positive intentions. I’m not feeling very positive today. Please bring Christmas back to my beautiful library. And always lead with love in your heart.""

'For a motherf***ing Christmas tree'

Desmond added another post Tuesday with screenshots of a profanity-laced rant on a local Facebook page against her and her issues with the Christmas tree cancellation. The poster — whom Desmond said works for a local human rights commission — said Desmond is a ""selfish, f***ing bitch who does not care about anyone else but herself. For a tree? A motherf***ing TREE? You have put people's lives in a lot of danger. A lot of danger. For a motherf***ing Christmas tree.""

The post also read, ""I hope that you — who claim to believe in Christ or whatever happy horses**t you're trying to hide behind — are the least gracious, most hateful, most disgusting trash in the world. Is this what you think your magic sky daddy wants?""

Desmond noted that ""police have been notified"" in regard to words in the aforementioned post.

She also said the Board of Library Trustees is meeting Tuesday and encouraged residents to make their voices heard about the controversy: ""If you can’t make it, a letter to the board might help. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. However you celebrate, I wish you and your family love and peace.""

Church of England won't support gay 'marriage' in its churches,"Church of England bishops will not recommend that gays partake in the sacrament of marriage, ""a solemn, public and life-long covenant between a man and a woman, declared and celebrated in the presence of God and before witnesses.""

The BBC reported that Anglican bishops finalized their recommendations after several years of debate on the CE's stance on sexuality. These recommendations will be factored in at the CE's general synod in February, where the decision will be formalized.

What are the details?

After a ""six-year period of listening, learning and discernment known as Living in Love and Faith,"" CE bishops noted in a statement Wednesday that they are resolved to preserve the ""Church's doctrine of Holy Matrimony.""

Rhys Laverty, managing editor at the Davenant Institute, noted that ""an organisation concluding that Holy Matrimony is between one man and one woman should not, in fact, be surprising,"" granted ""'matrimony' literally means 'state of motherhood' (from Latin mater).

Notwithstanding the church's stance on this issue — the very issue that first distinguished the CE — the bishops nevertheless resolved to offer gays ""the fullest possible pastoral provision"": ""prayers of dedication, thanksgiving or for God’s blessing on the couple in church following a civil marriage or partnership.""

Extra to making these concessions, new pastoral guidance in relation to the discernment of vocation will eventually be produced, ""to which all clergy currently are asked to assent.""

This prospective document would replace the December 1991 ""Issues in Human Sexuality"" statement from the CE general synod, which claims, among other things: ""There is ... in Scripture an evolving convergence on the ideal of lifelong, monogamous, heterosexual union as the setting intended by God for the proper development of men and women as sexual beings. Sexual activity of any kind outside marriage comes to be seen as sinful, and homosexual practice as especially dishonourable.""

The document also states that there is a ""mismatch between [gays'] sexuality and their physical and often also their emotional capacity for parenthood. There may be for some a mismatch between their bodies and the ways in which they wish to express their mutual self-giving. Their sexuality can be a barrier rather than a help toward full man-woman complementarity.""

The CE's ""Issues in Human Sexuality,"" which declares clergy cannot enter into active gay relationships, further condemns as ""bogus"" the ""philosophies of erotic freedom which have ... marked twentieth century European culture, and which have sought to justify every excess or deviation,"" for having advanced ""chaos and misery, disease and death.""

It is clear from the CE bishops' latest statement that much of the language and argumentation in this church document will be abrogated – no doubt favorable news for the church's ""non-binary"" Anglican priest and those clergymen driven to LGBT activism.

Apologies and 'breadcrumbs'

The church will reportedly be issuing an apology later this week to ""LGBTQI+ people for the 'rejection, exclusion and hostility' they have faced in churches and the impact this has had on their lives.""

Furthermore, the church will call on all congregations to welcome gay couples ""unreservedly and joyfully"" as they reaffirm their commitment to a ""radical new Christian inclusion founded in scripture, in reason, in tradition, in theology and the Christian faith as the Church of England has received it — based on good, healthy, flourishing relationships, and in a proper 21st Century understanding of being human and of being sexual.""

Various CE bishops commented on the proposals and the apparent balancing act between a prohibition on gay ""marriages"" and gay blessings.

Sarah Mullally, the bishop of London, said, ""I know that this has been costly and painful for many on all sides of the debate and has touched on deeply personal matters and strongly held beliefs.""

Stephen Cottrell of York said, ""This is not the end of that journey but we have reached a milestone and I hope that these prayers of love and faith can provide a way for us all to celebrate and affirm same-sex relationship.""

Justin Welby, the bishop of Canterbury, stated, ""I am under no illusions that what we are proposing today will appear to go too far for some and not nearly far enough for others, but it is my hope that what we have agreed will be received in a spirit of generosity, seeking the common good.""



Peter Tatchell, an LGBT activist, did not appear to receive the news in a ""spirit of generosity.""

Tatchell tweeted that the CE's decision is ""like the southern US churches that refused inter-racial marriages 60+ years ago. Anglican leaders are the ENEMY of human rights & LGBT+ equality!""



The Times noted that Jayne Ozanne, an LGBT activist on the synod, similarly denounced the bishops for not accommodating the zeitgeist, saying the proposals were ""breadcrumbs from bishops.""

""Therefore we are still second class and discriminated against, even with this really small concession,"" Ozanne added.

Penny Mordaunt, a senior Tory minister who failed in her recent bid to become prime minister, wrote to the bishop of Portsmouth, suggesting that the CE's refusal to marry gays has left many ""feeling that they are treated as second-class citizens within our society.""

NBC News noted that the CE is at the heart of the Anglican communion, accounting for over 85 million people in over 165 countries.

"Climate protesters glue their hands to floor of car exhibit, get upset Volkswagen won't bring them bowls to defecate and urinate into","Climate protesters who glued their hands to the floor of a Volkswagen exhibit in Wolfsburg, Germany, were upset that the car company refused to provide them with bowls to defecate and urinate into during their protest.

Protesters with ""Scientist Rebellion"" began the protest on Wednesday, but they didn't plan for what would happen once they needed to use the bathroom.

""[Volkswagen] told us that they supported our right to protest, but they refused our request to provide us with a bowl to urinate and defecate in a decent manner while we are glued, and have turned off the heating. People in support can't get out of the building,"" tweeted one of the protesters identified as Gianluca Grimalda.

He went on to clarify that they were allowed to leave but would not be allowed to return if they did.

""We can't order our food, we must use the one provided by Wolkswagen. Lights off. Random unannounced checks by security guards with bright torches. Police just came in,"" he added in a second tweet.



Among their demands was the insistence that the German government lower the speed limit to 100 km per hour, or about 62 miles per hour.

Outside the center, other protesters raised a banner after they threw red paint, apparently symbolizing blood, on the steps of the pavilion.

They also vandalized the windows.

One of the scientists, identified as Marta Matos, claimed that climate change was leading to floods and storms and that some regions of the world would probably become uninhabitable in the years to come because of global warming.

The protesters were mocked and ridiculed on social media for not planning ahead to meet their defecatory needs.

It was unclear how Grimalda was able to tweet while his hand was glued to the floor.

Recent tests indicate the pandemic school closures sought by teachers' unions have horribly impacted kids,"During the pandemic, teachers' unions exerted their influence to shut down schools. These closures constituted the longest interruptions in schooling since formal education became the norm. Some schools adopted a so-called hybrid model of teaching, while others went fully virtual. The primary reason cited for this unprecedented move was the need to protect teachers' and students' health — to stop the spread of the virus.

School closures' effect on students' health has long been a topic of discussion, largely because the negative impact was more immediately clear. Correlations were observed between closures and the significant spike in mental illness, suicide, and obesity, as well as with students' diminished immune systems.

Now, with the results in from standardized tests administered this spring, it is abundantly clear that the school closures have also negatively impacted the academic ability and wherewithal of American children nationwide.

In Washington, D.C., data released regarding standardized test scores indicated a significant drop in proficiency rates between 2019 and 2022.



WTOP reported that data collected across the district pertaining to English language arts and math standardized tests administered to students in grades three through eight as well as to high schoolers in the spring showed:

a 10% decrease in math proficiency between 2019 and 2022 for at-risk students;

a 6% decrease in English language arts proficiency for at-risk students;

that proficiency in math dropped across all grade levels;

that black and Hispanic students saw the largest drop in proficiency on English language arts tests;

that over 2,200 students who were proficient in English language arts in 2019 were no longer proficient this year; and

that over 3,700 students who were proficient in math in 2019 were no longer proficient in 2022.

Deputy Mayor for Education Paul Kihn said, ""These results are very sobering and underscore the urgency with which we've all been working for the past two years.""

The fallout is not limited to D.C..

The AP reported on September 1 that math and reading scores for American 9-year-olds fell precipitously during the first two years of the pandemic. Reading scores saw their largest decrease in 30 years. Math scores underwent the first decrease in the history of the National Center of Education Statistic's study of such trends.

The average 9-year-old's math score dropped by seven percentage points between 2020 and 2022, while the average reading score dropped five points.

According to Daniel McGrath, acting associate commissioner of the NCES, ""These are some of the largest declines we have observed in a single assessment cycle in 50 years of the NAEP program.""

While regions in the Northeast and Midwest fared worse than schools in the South and West, the decline in academic ability was universal.



With the damage done, people are beginning to assign blame.

In an appearance on ""The Story"" on Wednesday, former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos called out American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten. She said the ATF and its president ""should own up to the mistakes that they’ve made and the way that they have harmed kids, harmed families across the country, and yet all she is doing is blaming everyone else.""

Teachers' unions across the nation blocked reopenings, some going so far as to seek repeat closures.

Kerry McDonald, writing for the Foundation for Economic Education, noted that even when ordered back to work, certain unions compelled their members to refuse. Frequently, as in the case of the New Jersey's Montclair Education Association and in others, closures became a bargaining chip for more money.

A similar case happened in Chicago, prompting Democrat Mayor Lori Lightfoot to cancel plans for 60,000 elementary school students to return to in-person classes. The New York Times reported that the Chicago teachers' union had voted to authorize a strike if the district prompted educators back into schools.



Although it was Governor Mark DeWine (R) who first closed Ohio's schools, it was the Ohio Federation of Teachers and the Cleveland Teachers Union that leaned on state officials to keep K-12 classes closed when DeWine determined it was time and safe to reopen them.

NY Post columnist Karol Markowicz echoed DeVos' criticism of Weingarten for students' falling test scores, but suggested to Fox Business Network's ""Varney & Co."" that Weingarten and the unions bear only one-third of the blame. What caused the learning loss was ""a trifecta of the teachers' unions with people like Randi Weingarten leading the way, the Democratic Party, and the liberal media that covered for them.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/closures-sought-by-teachers-unions-doomed-kids-academics,2022-09-09
Top Biden official unable to spin her way out of contradiction exposed by CNN host on classified docs scandal,"CNN anchor Victor Blackwell confronted a top Biden administration official on Tuesday over the glaring lack of transparency from the Biden administration on President Joe Biden's classified documents scandal.

On Tuesday, CBS News reported the FBI conducted a search of Biden's private Washington office after his personal attorney made the initial discovery of classified documents on Nov. 2. It's not clear why Biden's attorneys, the White House, and the DOJ previously refused to disclose the search.

What happened on CNN?

After White House communications director Kate Bedingfield claimed the White House has been ""transparent from the onset,"" Blackwell had just one question: How can you be transparent if you aren't forthcoming with basic details?

""You are claiming transparency, but I am bringing this to you, you aren't bringing it to me,"" he said. ""This happened in mid-November. If you are, indeed, being transparent, why the continued trickle of disclosure around these classified documents?""

Unfortunately, Bedingfield completely ignored the question. Instead, she emphasized Biden's cooperation with the Justice Department.

""We have released multiple statements from the White House, and President Biden's personal attorney has released multiple statements over the last month, walking through the process and agreeing to be fully, fully cooperative with the Justice Department,"" she responded. ""This is a process that plays out.

""We have been clear from the outset that the president will cooperate with every request the Justice Department has and we put out multiple statements describing that process,"" she added.

What about the search?

According to CBS News, the FBI searched Biden's private office, the one he used before becoming president, sometime in ""mid-November"" after the initial Nov. 2 discovery.

It's not clear what the FBI found — if agents found additional classified documents — and it's not clear which exact day the FBI conducted its search, whether it was before or after the Nov. 8 midterm election.

The refusal to disclose the search is odd. When the Justice Department searched Biden's private residence in Wilmington, Delaware, last month, the search was announced the next day. Moreover, Biden's personal attorney announced Wednesday that the FBI was searching Biden's vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, the same day of the search.

The refusal to disclose basic timeline facts has led to widespread speculation of non-negligent malfeasance.

CNN reporter leaves WH COVID coordinator stumbling when confronted over Kamala Harris violating CDC guidance,"A CNN reporter grilled White House COVID response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha on Friday over Vice President Kamala Harris skirting CDC guidelines for COVID-19 exposure.

What did Harris do?

After announcing that President Joe Biden had contracted COVID-19, the White House disclosed that Vice President Kamala Harris was a ""close contact"" of the president.

Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise that someone deemed a ""close contact"" wear a well-fitting mask around others for 10 days. But that is not what Harris did.

Instead, Harris removed her face mask and hugged Birmingham, Alabama, Mayor Randall Woodfin on Friday during an event in Washington, D.C. She also spoke without a mask.

What did Jha say?

At the White House press briefing, CNN reporter MJ Lee repeatedly questioned Dr. Jha about Harris violating CDC guidelines. Jha, however, refused to directly address Harris' actions.

""Vice President Harris is a close contact of the president’s, and the CDC guidance says that if you’re a close contact, you want to wear a well-fitting mask when you’re around other people. She just spoke at a conference in D.C. and she hugged someone without a mask on. She was also maskless for most of that conversation. Would you have recommended that she keep her mask on, given that that is the CDC guidance?"" Lee asked.

Jha qualified his response by noting that he had not ""been tracking the vice president's activities,"" then asserted that Harris is following CDC guidelines.

""I guess she isn’t following the CDC guidance though — right? — if she is hugging someone without a mask on?"" Lee pushed back. ""I just wanted your clarification on that.""

07/22/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and Dr. Ashish Jha youtu.be

After acknowledging that ""the CDC guidance is clear,"" Jha refused to offer an additional response, again citing not having seen the incident.

""She took off the mask and she embraced someone. You don’t have to see it. I mean, that’s what happened,"" Lee fired back.

""Yeah, so usually when we think about people having contact, it’s for an extended period of time,"" Jha responded. ""Again, I didn’t see the hug. I don’t know how long the hug lasted. But it’s very hard for me to comment on something I really didn’t see.""

Anything else?

A spokesperson for Harris also declined to address Harris skirting CDC guidance.

"Anderson Lee Aldridge suspected shooter in Club Q shooting, LGBTQ, gay nightclub in Colorado Springs","An armed attacker opened fire at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado late Saturday night. The shooting killed five people and injured at least 18 others. Patrons at the gay nightclub were able to subdue the shooter.

Authorities started to receive ""numerous"" 911 calls at 11:56 p.m. on Saturday about a shooting at Club Q – a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs. Police reportedly responded to the emergency calls in three minutes.

Colorado Springs Police deputy chief Adrian Vasquez said, ""The suspect entered Club Q and immediately began shooting people inside.""

He noted, ""At least two heroic people inside the club confronted and fought with the suspect and were able to stop the suspect from continuing to kill and harm others.""

The shooter was reportedly armed with two guns, including a long rifle.



The suspect was taken into custody at 12:02 a.m., according to Lt. Pamela Castro of the Colorado Springs Police Department. The shooter was taken to the hospital for medical treatment.

FBI is on the crime scene and assisting in the investigation.

During a Sunday morning press conference, authorities identified the shooter as 22-year-old Anderson Lee Aldridge.

Law enforcement did not comment on a possible motive for the deadly mass shooting.

However, Club Q issued a statement that labeled the shooting as a ""hate attack.""

""Club Q is devastated by the senseless attack on our community. Our prays and thoughts are with all the victims and their families and friends. We thank the quick reactions of heroic customers that subdued the gunman and ended this hate attack,"" Club Q posted on its Facebook page.

Club Q is an LGBTQ nightclub that features a ""Drag Diva Drag Show"" on Saturdays, according to its website.

The club was set to hold an ""all ages brunch musical drag brunch"" on Sunday, according to the club's Facebook page.

The club promoted the event, ""Doors open at 11am for our noon ALL AGES DRAG BRUNCH!!! Join us for a fantastic drink special and even more amazing drag show! Then stick around for an all stars cast of our freshest faces! We’re celebrating Transgender Day of Remembrance with a variety of gender identities and performance styles! Show starts at 8pm!”



Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued a statement:

The Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs was horrific, sickening, and devastating news to wake up to. My heart breaks for the family and friends of those lost, injured, and traumatized in this horrific shooting. I have spoken with Mayor Suthers and clarified that every state resource is available to local law enforcement in Colorado Springs. We are eternally grateful for the brave individuals who blocked the gunman, likely saving lives in the process, and for the first responders who responded swiftly to this horrific shooting. Colorado stands with our LGTBQ Community and everyone impacted by this tragedy as we mourn.

Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) said, ""The news out of Colorado Springs is absolutely awful. This morning the victims & their families are in my prayers. This lawless violence needs to end and end quickly.""

During the press conference, a reporter asked Vasquez if Aldrich was the same individual involved in a bomb threat in 2021. The deputy chief would not comment on the question.

In June 2021, police responded to a bomb threat in Lorson Ranch about 18 miles from Colorado Springs. The mother of the suspect called police and said her son was threatening to cause harm to her with a ""homemade bomb, multiple weapons, and ammunition.""

KXRM-TV reported, ""Deputies responded to the home and after further investigation realized the suspect, 21-year-old Anderson Lee Aldrich was in the 6300 block of Pilgrimage Road (which is approximately 1 mile away from the address on Rubicon Drive). Our deputies contacted the suspect by phone and he refused to comply with orders to surrender.""

Aldrich was arrested and charged with two counts of felony meaning and three counts of first-degree kidnapping.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/colorado-gay-club-shootinganderson-lee-aldridge,2022-11-20
"Virginia Democrat torches own party for not taking action on banning Congress from trading stocks, calls for new leadership: 'This moment marks a failure'","A Virginia Democrat called for new leadership in her party after plans to vote on legislation banning lawmakers from trading stocks were scrapped.

Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) lashed out at her own Democrat Party for engaging in ""delay tactics"" when it comes to banning members of Congress, their spouses, and their dependent children from buying, selling, and trading individual stocks.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said a bill prohibiting lawmakers from trading stocks would ""probably"" not get a vote this week. The delay would cause the bill not to be voted on before Congress leaves to campaign ahead of the 2022 midterms.

The text of the proposed ""Combatting Financial Conflicts of Interest in Government Act"" was released on Tuesday night. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) directed Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) to draft the bill in February.

However, Pelosi scoffed at a reporter who asked if Congress members and their spouses should be banned from trading stocks in December 2021. Pelosi defended Congress members trading stocks, ""This is a free market and people — we are a free market economy. They should be able to participate in that.""

Hoyer told CNN, ""I haven’t read it, it's a complicated issue, as you can imagine, as a new rule for members they have to follow, and their families as I understand, so I think it deserves careful study to make sure if we do something, we do it right.""

Spanberger was vexed by her party not taking action on legislation that would prevent lawmakers from possibly profiting from being privy to information that some have deemed to be akin to ""insider trading.""

""Our job as elected officials is to serve the people — not ourselves,"" Spanberger said in a statement released on Friday. ""That’s why I’ve been proud to lead the charge on legislation to ban Members of Congress and their immediate families from trading individual stocks — not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because the Virginians I represent overwhelmingly support it and want us to get it done.""

On Jan. 15, 2021, Spanberger introduced her ""Transparent Representation Upholding Service and Trust (TRUST) in Congress Act"" to prohibit trading stocks by members of Congress and their spouses. Spanberger said her bill had received bipartisan support.

""For months, momentum grew in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate to finally take a step towards prohibiting Members of Congress from day trading while on the job,"" she said. ""We saw remarkable progress towards rectifying glaring examples of conflicts of interest.""

""And after first signaling her opposition to these reforms, the Speaker purportedly reversed her position. However, our bipartisan reform coalition was then subjected to repeated delay tactics, hand-waving gestures, and blatant instances of Lucy pulling the football,"" she said, making a reference to ""Charlie Brown.""



“This moment marks a failure of House leadership — and it’s yet another example of why I believe that the Democratic Party needs new leaders in the halls of Capitol Hill, as I have long made known,"" Spanberger proclaimed. ""Rather than bring Members of Congress together who are passionate about this issue, leadership chose to ignore these voices, push them aside, and look for new ways they could string the media and the public along — and evade public criticism.""

She slammed the Combatting Financial Conflicts of Interest in Government Act, ""As part of their diversionary tactics, the House Administration Committee was tasked with creating a new piece of legislation — and they ultimately introduced a kitchen-sink package that they knew would immediately crash upon arrival, with only days remaining before the end of the legislative session and no time to fix it.""

“It’s apparent that House leadership does not have its heart in this effort, because the package released earlier this week was designed to fail,"" the Virginia Democrat declared. ""It was written to create confusion surrounding reform efforts and complicate a straightforward reform priority — banning Members of Congress from buying and selling individual stocks — all while creating the appearance that House Leadership wanted to take action.""

""In the months ahead, I will be dogged in my efforts to ban Members of Congress from using the privilege of their position to profit,"" she concluded. ""I look forward to working with both my Democratic and Republican colleagues to get these reforms done.""

During a press conference on Friday, Pelosi responded to Spanberger bashing the leadership of the Democratic Party, ""Her bill is in the bill, others had ideas too. And that’s what the committee put forth. But it’s good press because you asked a question.""

This isn't the first time that Spanberger has criticized her own party.

In November 2020, Spanberger blasted progressive Democrats pushing the defund the police agenda and socialism before the 2020 elections.

""We need to be pretty clear. It was a failure. It was not a success. We lost incredible members of Congress,"" she reportedly said during a caucus phone conference. ""We have to commit to not saying the words 'defund the police' ever again. We need to not ever use the words socialist or socialism ever again. It does matter, and we have lost good members because of that.""

""If we run this race again we will get f***ing torn apart again in 2022,"" she declared.

In June, Spanberger made an appearance on Fox News where the Democrat explained that she didn't want help from President Joe Biden in her election campaign.

""I intend to do the campaigning myself. I am the candidate. It is my name on the ballot,"" Spanberger told host Dana Perino. ""Certainly when I first ran, I ran in an R +7 district. And I won in that seat by getting out, speaking to voters, making sure that they know who I am and what it is that I intended to do for them.""

""In 2020, [I] ran for re-election and certainly outperformed the president on the ballot by telling the people what I had done and what I was going to continue to do,"" she boasted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/congress-trading-stocks-ban-spanberger-pelosi,2022-10-01
Congressional Republicans submit a bill to define what a woman is,"Republicans in Congress have introduced a bill to define what a woman is.

Republican Representative Debbie Lesko from Arizona sponsored a “Women’s Bill of Rights” to provide additional legal protections to women under federal law, RedState reported.

Noting that establishing a standard for identifying people on the basis of their sex is crucial to societal stability, H. Res. 1136 states: “[T]here are important reasons to distinguish between the sexes with respect to athletics, prisons, domestic violence shelters, restrooms, and other areas, particularly where biology, safety, and privacy are implicated.”

The proposed legislation states that “males and females possess unique and immutable biological difference that manifest prior to birth and increase as they age and experience puberty” and that “biological differences between the sexes can expose females to more harm than males from specific forms of violence, including sexual violence.”

It even defies current leftwing orthodoxy by declaring that only women are able to get pregnant. The bill states “biological difference between the sexes mean that only females may get pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed children.”

The bill also indicates that motherhood and fatherhood are reserved for women and men respectively. The bill states “for purposes of Federal law, the word ‘mother’ means a parent of the female sex and ‘father’ is defined as a parent of the male sex.”

Republican Reps.

Banks, who also serves as the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, argued that this legislation is critical in order to protect the rights of women from leftist attacks.

He said, “The modern Democrat party has put the Left’s woke agenda before the rights of women. These days, Democrats refuse to even admit women exist or recognize them as unique beings, with unique abilities. While radical liberals strip away the progress and protections that generations of women fought to achieve. Republicans must fight back and acknowledge these basic biological truths. AS the father of three daughters, I’m proud to co-lead this resolution reaffirming the legal protections afforded to them under federal law.”

Res. 1136 is also supported by several outside women’s interest organizations such as the Independent Women’s Law Center, Concerned Women for America LAC, Women’s Liberation Front, and the Eagle Forum.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/congressional-republicans-submit-a-bill-to-define-what-a-woman-is,2022-05-29
Dem staffers claim they put their 'bodies on the line' by protesting in Chuck Schumer's air-conditioned office,"Congressional staffers claimed they put their ""bodies on the line"" Monday by staging a protest to bring attention to climate change.



The dangerous location of the protest that required risk to life and limb? The air-conditioned office of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).

What happened?

Saul Levin, a staffer for Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), announced on Twitter that 17 congressional staffers had staged a sit-in protest to demand Congress take action and pass ""climate justice policy.""

""We are putting our bodies on the line because we have no other choice,"" Levin said.

Unfortunately for the staffers, their protest did not last long.

U.S. Capitol police officers quickly ended their demonstration by arresting them. The entire demonstration lasted only half an hour, according to journalist Andrew Marantz.

Ultimately, Capitol police officers arrested six staffers for refusing to leave Schumer's office. Those staffers are:

Saul Levin, who works for Bush.

Aria Kovalovich, who works for Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).

Rajiv Sicora, who works for Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.).

Courtney Koelbel, who works for Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.).

Philip Bennett, who works for Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.).

Emma Preston, who also works for Khanna.

The staffers were reportedly arrested for violating D.C. Code §22-3302 Unlawful Entry.

The purpose of the protest, Levin later told an NBC News reporter, is to force Schumer to restart negotiations with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to force through a reconciliation bill on climate policy.

When asked why they protested Schumer's office and not Manchin's, Levin said, ""Because there's always going to be a sheep that strays away from the herd. It's the job of leadership to get the party together.""

Ironically, Levin's father is Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.). One thus wonders why Levin is not petitioning his father to do more to act on climate policy.

Levin, in fact, comes from family of political pedigree.

Not only is Levin's father a congressional representative, but his grandfather Sander Levin, served in the House for nearly three decades and his great uncle, Carl Levin, served in the U.S. Senate for 36 years.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/congressional-staffers-arrested-schumer-climate-protest,2022-07-25
Control of the US Senate remains unknown,"So far, Republicans have underperformed in many races across the country, and now which party will control the United States Senate for the next two years remains unclear.

Senators serve six-year terms, and a third of the Senate — approximately 33 senators — is up for reelection during every election cycle. Since January 2021, the Senate has been evenly split with 50 Republicans, 48 Democrats, and 2 independents who caucus with Democrats, leaving Vice President Kamala Harris (D) to cast more than two dozen deciding votes in less than two years.

No major outlet has yet projected which party will control the U.S. Senate. However, the following races will likely play a key role in the outcome.

Pennsylvania



This race is particularly important for Democrats, as Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz were competing for a seat vacated by retiring Republican incumbent Pat Toomey. A Fetterman win will increase the chances that Democrats maintain or perhaps increase their Senate majority.

Unfortunately, Fetterman suffered a debilitating stroke back in May, which severely affected his ability to give speeches, dialogue with voters, and participate in debates. Because of his impaired physical and mental fitness, Oz attempted to offer a stable, reliable alternative to Fetterman, who did not make many appearances without closed-captioning and has a very liberal track record as the lieutenant governor of the state.

So far though, Pennsylvania voters do not seem as concerned about Fetterman's health. As of early Wednesday morning, he holds a narrow lead of just under one point with 88% of votes reported.









Arizona



In Arizona, Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat incumbent, has faced a strong challenge from venture capitalist Blake Masters. Masters hammered Kelly's record of voting to approve President Joe Biden's liberal agenda, and in particular, his seemingly indifferent attitude toward illegal immigration.

""If this is the result of Senator Kelly being 'focused on the border,' my gosh, he's the most ineffective and worst senator of all time,"" Masters quipped during their debate in early October.

Voting irregularities in Maricopa County, the most populous county in the state, will make this race difficult to call.

Georgia

Political junkies and college football fans across the country paid close attention to this race between Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, who won a special election against Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler in 2020, and former Heisman Trophy winner and University of Georgia legend Herschel Walker.

Running as a Republican, Walker was able to capitalize on his folksy mannerisms and southern drawl to convince many voters to trust him, despite allegations that he had paid for a former girlfriend to abort his child in 2009. In his debate against Warnock, Walker leaned in on his pro-life stance and his friendship with former President Donald Trump, both topics which he was then able to turn into attacks against Warnock.

""[I]f black lives matter,"" Walker rhetorically asked Warnock, who is also a Christian minister, ""why are you not protecting those babies? And instead of aborting those babies, why are you not baptizing those babies?""

Warnock and Walker remain neck and neck, at 49.1% and 48.8%, respectively. If neither candidate reaches the 50% threshold once all ballots have been counted, the race will head for a runoff.

Nevada

Democrat incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto has looked vulnerable for months against Republican challenger Adam Laxalt. Since mid-September, Laxalt has shown a steady lead in the polls , and Cortez Masto has struggled to demonstrate solidarity with her party while also distancing herself from Biden, who is deeply unpopular with many Nevadans . On Oct. 25, the New York Times dubbed her ""the Senate's most at-risk Democrat.""

The two did not have a debate this election season.





Clark and Washoe Counties, the two most populous counties in the state, may not announce vote tallies until Thursday, according to Jon Ralston of the Nevada Independent and Ben Margiott of KRNV. So, we have very little data about this race.

New Hampshire

This state was not supposed to be in play for Republicans, and it turns out, it never really was. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D) won by just 0.6% of the vote in 2016, New Hampshire then trended leftward in the next two election cycles. Biden won the state handily in 2020 , 52.7% to Trump's 45.4%.

During the primary this year, Democrats then threw considerable money at Republican Don Bolduc because they thought he would be easiest candidate to defeat in the November election. A PAC affiliated with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) obviously agreed, since it pulled money out of the race in mid- October

Though Bolduc took a slight lead in some polls in the final days , Hassan held a comfortable lead all night. She has been projected to win reelection safely

"Cop responding to high-priority call strikes, kills young grad student in crosswalk","A young woman attending graduate school in Seattle, Washington, died recently after a marked cop cruiser struck her while she was crossing the street.

At around 8 p.m. on January 23, 23-year-old Jaahnavi Kandula was attempting to cross Dexter Avenue North at Thomas Street, just a few blocks east of the Space Needle. As she was traversing the designated crosswalk, an officer with the Seattle Police Department driving northbound on Dexter Avenue in a marked patrol SUV struck her.

Fellow officers and members of the fire department soon afterwards arrived on the scene and began to perform CPR on Kandula, who was then transported to Harborview Medical Center with ""life-threatening injuries."" Shortly before 2 p.m. the following day, Seattle PD had announced that Kandula had died.

So far, details about the events leading up to the collision remain scarce. Police have confirmed that the officer involved has been with the force since November 2019 and was said to be responding to a ""priority one call,"" which is the most urgent. KING-TV has reported that the call may have been related to a man who refused to go to the hospital.

A witness told reporters that the officer involved in the incident appeared distraught afterward. ""I feel bad for the officer,"" the witness stated. ""I can’t imagine how he feels. And I saw the emotion from him, and he seemed pretty bent out of shape about it.""



Seattle police have issued a statement to express their condolences as well as to request patience as their investigation into the crash continues:

We want to acknowledge the many questions we are receiving regarding the collision Monday night between an SPD officer and a pedestrian. As is the case with any serious motor vehicle collision, this incident is under investigation by SPD’s Traffic Collision Investigation Squad, consistent with SPD policy (Manual Section 13.010). We acknowledge that there is understandably tremendous interest in the surrounding facts, but for purposes of both preserving the integrity of the investigation and respecting the family’s right to privacy, will not be putting out information over and beyond what has already been provided. We will provide all publicly releasable information, including the report, once we are able to do so, and in consultation with the family.

We extend our deepest condolences to Ms. Kandula’s family and friends. This incident is a terrible tragedy for everyone involved.





Police have not stated whether the officer in question had been speeding or whether the vehicle's sirens or flashing lights had been on at the time of the incident.

According to a GoFundMe account established on her behalf, Kandula was born and raised by a single mother in Andhra Pradesh, a state located along the eastern coast of India. Kandula moved to the United States two years ago to further her education, and she was working toward a master's degree in engineering at Northeastern University—Seattle when she was killed. She was on track to graduate in December.

Kandula's family has also released a statement, expressing their grief and their hope that they will soon learn more information regarding Kandula's ""tragic and untimely death"":

""We are truly heartbroken,"" the statement read in part. ""Jaahnavi was a brilliant student with a bright future. Jaahnavi's smile was radiant, and her bubbly personality warmed the hearts of every person she came in contact with. She had an innate ability to connect with people from all walks of life. Jaahnavi's tragic and untimely death has left her family and community with a huge hole in their hearts that will never be repaired.""

""Jaahnavi is remembered as a stellar student and a delightful and effervescent human being,"" added David Thurman, the CEO of Northeastern University—Seattle. ""She was a close friend to many and friends shared that they loved her bubbly laugh, sense of humor and infectious personality. Her loss will be felt deeply by students, staff, and faculty across campus.""

Republican lawmaker checkmates Rep. Cori Bush after she blames GOP for 'hate-driven murders' of LGBT people,"Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) tried to blame Republicans for violence against LGBT people on Wednesday, but Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) refused to let her claims go unaddressed.

During a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on alleged violence against LGBT-identifying persons, Bush outright blamed Republicans for fomenting deadly hate against the LGBT community.

Specifically, Bush targeted Republicans for passing what she described as ""anti-LGBTQ+ legislation.""

""They've repeatedly — it's absolutely disgusting — filed library book bans on doctor-recommended care, student organization bans, and sports bans,"" she said.

Then, after asking one of the witnesses a question about such bills, Bush declared, ""Hate drives these Republican bills, which in turn drive dangerous hate and violence towards our LGBTQ+ community. In Missouri, my state, we have seen multiple hate-driven murders of our trans siblings in recent years.""

In another question, Bush condemned the ""Republicans' obsessive attack on trans and gay rights"" and drew an explicit connection between ""the Republican crusade to target the LGBTQ+ community"" and a surge in ""hateful, anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric.""

Club Q shooting survivors testify in house hearing on violence against LGBTQ+ people – watch live youtu.be

In response, Comer noted that St. Louis, which is located in the congressional district that Bush represents, is plagued by violent crime.

So he wondered: If Bush is so concerned about violent crime, what about the crime in her own community?

""You know, I'm not even gonna comment on what Ms. Bush said, but I'll say this: Crime is going to be a top priority for Republicans in this committee in the next Congress, and perhaps Ms. Bush could come give us some pointers on how she's reduced crime in St. Louis since she's been in Congress and what her ideas are to further reduce crime in St. Louis,"" Comer said after Bush's questioning.

""Wait a minute... St. Louis has one of the highest crime rates in America,"" he observed.

Comer will likely become the next chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee once Republicans take control of the Senate in January.

Bush, meanwhile, is one of Congress' most far-left lawmakers. She is an ardent supporter of the defund the police movement — even to the chagrin of her own party.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cori-bush-blames-gop-lgbt-hate,2022-12-15
Cotopaxi store closing in San Francisco due to rampant crime,"Cotopaxi founder and CEO Davis Smith said in a LinkedIn post that the company is closing its San Francisco store due to rampant unchecked crime that has left workers feeling unsafe.

Smith explained that since opening the location a year ago, the store has been subjected to repeated instances of theft and property damage.

""It's sad, but San Francisco appears to have descended into a city of chaos. Many streets and parks are overrun with drugs, criminals, and homelessness, and local leadership and law enforcement enable it through inaction,"" Smith noted.

""We opened a retail store a year ago on Hayes Street, the charming shopping district just blocks away from the famous Full House home. Our first week there, our windows were smashed and thousands of dollars of product was stolen. We replaced the window, and it immediately happened again (four times). We replaced with window with plywood as we waited for a month+ to get a metal security gate installed (demand for those gates is creating huge delays). As of today, we are closing the store due to rampant organized theft and lack of safety for our team. Our store is hit by organized theft rings several times per week. They brazenly enter the store and grab thousands of dollars of product and walk out. We started keeping the door locked and opening it only for customers, but even then, they'll have a woman go to the door, and then hiding individuals rush into the store as soon as the door opens,"" Smith wrote.

""Our team is terrified. They feel unsafe. Security guards don't help because these theft rings know that security guards won't/can't stop them. It's impossible for a retail store to operate in these circumstances, especially when cities refuse to take any action (despite us paying taxes well above any other state we operate in). The city recently announced a reduction of police presence in this neighborhood, despite mass-scale crime,"" he continued.

Smith has indicated in comments on his post that the company has not experienced this type of crime problem at its stores located in other parts of the country.

""To be clear, my post doesn’t say the entire city is like this. That said, I have family living in SF, and I've spent years visiting their home and neighborhood. This is not isolated. This also isn’t the same in other cities. We have 10 stores, including in Seattle and Portland. Not one other store has had a window or door broken. Not one other store has had mass theft. Not other store has been vandalized. Hayes Street didn’t go more than a couple days before it was broken into the first time. There have been dozens and dozens of incidents in the first 12 months,"" the CEO noted in a comment.

In addition to the San Francisco store which is listed as ""Temporarily Closed,"" the Cotopaxi website lists eight other stores that are located in states including Utah, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington — there is also a Boulder, Colorado, location that is listed as ""Coming Soon!""

Smith also noted in the comments on his post that the company hopes to be able to open the San Francisco location again in the future.

""We're working with other businesses on the street to hire security and convince the police and city that we need help. Hopefully we can have the store open again. Fingers crossed,"" he wrote.

In his LinkedIn post, Smith also noted that when he and his wife last visited the city in 2020, someone on drugs shouted obscene remarks at his wife.

""Last time my wife and I went in 2020, a drugged up person ran up to my wife's face and started screaming some of the most obscene things I've ever heard. She was terrified. During a previous trip, my rental car was broken into and everything was stolen out of our trunk. When calling the police to report the theft, they let us know this happens hundreds of times per day in the city and said it was our own fault for parking in the street. I grew up in Latin America and spent much of my adult life there, and I never felt this unsafe there. Something has to change in San Francisco,"" he noted.

The company's website states that, ""Giving is core to who we are. We tie our earnings to impact by allocating a percentage of annual revenues to the Cotopaxi Foundation, which then provides targeted grants to nonprofits dedicated to eradicating extreme poverty.""

""I remain committed to seeing extreme poverty eradicated in my lifetime,"" Smith noted in a video from 2020.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cotopaxi-store-closes-san-francisco,2022-10-19
Yeshiva University ends all student groups after court  orders it to recognize gay activist student group,"When presented with a court order to formally recognize an LGBT student group, the Jewish Yeshiva University in New York City determined it would be optimal to ""hold off on all undergraduate club activities while it takes steps to follow the roadmap provided by the US Supreme Court to protect YU's religious freedom.""

Katie Rosenfeld, the lawyer for the unofficial gay activist group that sued the college for recognition, characterized the college's refusal to back down as a ""shameful tactic,"" likening it to the stratagems of segregationists.

An ongoing battle

In 2018, a gay activist student group was informally created at Yeshiva University. The school is said to have overrode the student council's 2019 approval of the group and to have blocked its recognition again in 2020.

The college, which continues a 136-year commitment to religious identity, explained that the conference of official status to the group would be ""inconsistent with the school's Torah values and the religious environment it seeks to maintain.""

As controversy first began to mount, the university released a statement suggesting ""The message of Torah on this issue is nuanced, both accepting each individual with love and affirming its timeless prescriptions. While students will of course socialize in gatherings they see fit, forming a new club as requested under the auspices of YU will cloud this nuanced message.""

While opposed to formally recognizing a gay student group, the university made explicit its ongoing commitment to support gay students as well as to prohibit discrimination and harassment.

On April 27, 2021, a cadre of former and past students sued Yeshiva University to force the institution to recognize their gay activist group, the Yeshiva University Pride Alliance. The students behind the suit suggested that the college's refusal amounted to a violation of New York's human rights law.

In June, Democratic Judge Lynn Kotler of the New York Supreme Court First Judicial District ruled that Yeshiva University must approve the formation of the gay activist club. Kotler argued that the college did not constitute a ""religious corporation,"" but was instead — according to its own charter — an ""educational corporation,"" meaning the city's anti-discrimination law applied.

A university spokesman took issue with Kotler's insistence that the university was not a religious institution, telling the Commentator: ""As our name indicates, Yeshiva University was founded to instill Torah values in its students while providing a stellar education, allowing them to live with religious conviction as noble citizens and committed Jews.""

The college has reportedly also maintained that its non-sectarian status was based on its non-discriminatory practices in its admissions rather than on its administrative decisions.



The spokesman added that the ""court's ruling violates the religious liberty upon which this country was founded.""

Eric Baxter, vice president and senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, stated, ""When secular authorities try to tell Yeshiva University that it is not religious, you know something has gone terribly wrong ... The First Amendment protects Yeshiva's right to practice its faith.""



The university issued an emergency request to the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking relief from the order, which the justices summarized as ""requiring the University to treat an LGBTQ student group similarly to other student groups in its student club recognition process.""

On September 14, the Supreme Court refused to block the order in a 5-4 decision, with conservatives Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh voting in the majority.



In an unsigned order, the majority wrote that the university should return to the state court to seek quick review and temporary relief while the case continues.

Though set back, not defeated

Rabbi Dr. Ari Berman, the president of the college, issued a statement after the decision was handed down: ""Every faith-based university in the country has the right to work with its students, including its LGBTQ students, to establish the clubs, places and spaces that fit within its tradition.""

He noted ""Yeshiva University simply seeks that same right of self-determination.""

Berman indicated that the college will seek to restore that right by pursuing ""the roadmap"" presented to the college by the Supreme Court.

In the interim, all student clubs and groups will be suspended.

The president of the college's student union, Baruch Lerman, noted that he and his organization ""were not expecting the university to take this drastic measure, and have not received any guidance about how we are to proceed with approving clubs."" He also told the Commentator that they have also not recieved instruction on how to proceed hosting student council events.

Lerman also indicated he would insist that student activity fees ""on every student's tuition bill be prorated for the extent of the time that student activities are suspended.""

A spokesman told Fox News that the school expects ""a quick conclusion in the courts and the start of clubs soon.""

Not fighting alone

Seattle Pacific University, a Christian college in Washington state, filed a lawsuit on July 27 against Bob Ferguson, the attorney general of Washington, claiming he had encroached upon its constitutional rights as they relate to the institution's private religious convictions, communications, and hiring practices.

In its lawsuit, SPU stated it ""expects its faculty, staff and leadership to agree with the University's statement on faith and to live out that faith as a model for others, including by living according to the University's religious teachings on marriage.""

Members of the board of trustees of SPU are now being sued for barring persons in gay relationships from working full-time.

At Brigham Young University, students and gay activists protested earlier this month when the LDS college removed pamphlets promoting gay activism, events, and other resources from new students' welcome bags. BYU's honor code prohibits ""same-sex romantic behavior.""

As part of the protests at BYU, the so called RaYnbow Collective held a drag show for students which was also open to children.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/court-ordered-to-recognize-gay-activist-student-group-yeshiva-university-ends-all-student-groups,2022-09-19
"Appeals court rules against Trump, allows DOJ to restart investigation of documents seized at Mar-a-Lago","A federal appeals court ruled against former President Donald Trump and allowed the Department of Justice to restart its investigation into the documents seized at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida.

A panel of the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a previous order by U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon was incorrect. Cannon had granted Trump's request to appoint a ""special master"" to independently determine whether classified documents were protected by executive privilege or attorney-client privilege. That order also paused the DOJ probe until those documents were properly assessed.

Liberals and other critics decried the ruling because Judge Cannon had been nominated during Trump's term as president.

On Thursday, the appeals court vacated the Cannon ruling.

“The law is clear. We cannot write a rule that allows any subject of a search warrant to block government investigations after the execution of the warrant,” the panel wrote. “Nor can we write a rule that allows only former presidents to do so.""

All three judges on the panel were appointed by Republican presidents.

They went on to write that they ""agree with the government that the district court improperly exercised equitable jurisdiction, and that dismissal of the entire proceeding is required.”

Trump was hit with another court defeat when the Supreme Court refused to block an order allowing the House Ways and Means Committee to obtain six years of his tax returns from the Treasury Department.

Outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) applauded the ruling.

""These documents are vital to meeting the House’s Constitutional mandate: guarding the public interest, defending our national security and holding our public officials to account,"" she wrote in a statement.

"New York City's COVID-19 cases increase, but Mayor Eric Adams says no mask mandates will return","New York City Mayor Eric Adams has said that despite increasing rises in COVID-19 rates, he will not reinstate mask mandates at this time.

New York City health officials said that the city reached a ""high"" COVID-19 confirmed infection level earlier this week, creating what it described as ""substantial pressure on the health care system.""

What are the details?

According to a report from CNN, Adams addressed the skyrocketing coronavirus infections across the city during a Wednesday press conference.

""I'm proud of what we are doing and how we are not allowing COVID to outsmart us,"" Adams said. ""We're staying prepared and not panicking.""

Adams noted that while variants and rising case counts will surely come and go, the city needs to remain functional across the board.

""Variants are going to come,"" he said during the conference and added, ""If every variant that comes, we move into shutdown thoughts, we move into panicking, we're not going to function as a city. We are being extremely strategic and we are fighting COVID with not only the tools that we didn't have before, but we're also fighting COVID using the intelligence we need to win in a COVID environment.""

According to the New York Times, when asked if he planned to reinstate a mandatory mask mandate, Adams responded, ""No.""

Earlier this week, the report continued, Adams said that he would not consider mandates until such time as the city's hospitals are in a state of emergency or that it appears the city is ""trending that way.""

While the city's health department encouraged citizens to wear masks in public settings, Adams has refused to reinstate a mask mandate at this time.

WNBC-TV has reported that while infections are increasing, more than half of patients currently hospitalized for COVID across the state did not have the COVID-19 diagnosis listed as a primary reason for admission, suggesting that the current wave of infections is far milder when compared to previous infections.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/covid-nyc-mask-mandate,2022-05-19
Critically understaffed Canadian hospital network may hire unvaccinated health care workers after thousands were fired during pandemic,"Thousands of health care workers were fired in Canada for their refusal to comply with government vaccine mandates. While most provinces have since dropped their vaccine requirements, many hospitals continue to require continued compliance.

One struggling Ontario hospital network is, however, contemplating prioritizing patient care over vaccine requirements in hopes of attracting more talent.

What are the details?

In March, the province of Ontario, home to the city of Toronto and the nation's capital of Ottawa, lifted the requirement for health care settings and hospitals to enforce COVID-19 vaccination policies.

CTV News reported that notwithstanding this change in tack, Ontario hospitals continue to enforce their own mandates, along with hospitals in British Columbia and Nova Scotia. Accordingly, health care workers still need to be vaccinated.

For the South Bruce Grey Health Centre health network, which serves nearly 44,000 people, this may prove untenable.

SBGHC has been struggling with staffing issues for a long time. In October, the health network announced that one of its rural hospital's emergency rooms would be closing down, adding that health staffing in the province would likely ""remain a challenge for the foreseeable future.""

At the time, SBGHC stated the ""pool of available nurses is very limited.""

This staffing problem has only worsened. The health network's ICUs are flooded with flu cases and vaccinated COVID-19 patients. All four of its rural hospitals have suffered ER closures. COVID-positive health care workers have had to stay on the job.

Ivy Bourgeault, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa, told CTV's ""Your Morning Tuesday"" that ""many people are grasping at straws in order to keep their hospitals open.""

Mandy Dobson, interim director of clinical services at SBGHC, indicated in a memo obtained by CTV News that the health network is now reviewing its COVID-19 vaccination policy. A survey was attached to Dobson's memo asking staff what they thought about the possibility of allowing unvaccinated workers to help restore order and lighten the load.

Anne Laxton, a mother of three and registered nurse with over 12 years' experience, applied to work for SBGHC but was rejected on account of her vaccination status. At a townhall meeting in October, Laxton noted that owing to a dearth of information about the vaccines at the time of their initial roll-out, she was unable to give informed consent.

Despite having worked through the worst of the pandemic, she was barred from returning to work in January on account of her refusal to comply with the vaccine requirement. Laxton went instead to work in a nearby pub.

""I know there are some people who are worried about people like me, but I have worked in the pub without a mask. I have served my [former] coworkers in the pub without a mask and they kept sitting there, eating and drinking ... but I cannot go to work with them,"" said Laxton.

After explaining to a room full of people suffering on account of the health care worker shortage why there was at least one fewer nurse to help them, some began to shout, ""Hire her, hire her!""

SBGHC is reportedly the only hospital network in the province considering hiring unvaccinated workers.

Desperate but stubborn

True North indicated that Ontario fired at least 1,665 health care workers. The number of health care professionals sacked nationwide was close to 10,000.

The Ottawa Citizen reported that when the conservative Ontario government considered forcing 140 hospitals and other public sectors to re-hire unvaccinated workers earlier this year, the Ontario Hospital Association told the government not to interfere.

Anthony Dale, head of the OHA, said, ""Government interference on hospital decisions regarding health-care worker vaccinations would create significant disruption when hospitals are taking extraordinary measures to respond to the fourth wave.""

The vice president of organizational effectiveness at Ottawa's Queensway Carleton Hospital claimed that returning unvaccinated health care workers to the hospital ""may increase the risk of transmission to patients and staff, and would amplify our staffing shortages.""

Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario CEO Doris Grinspun said, ""99 per cent of nurses do not want to work next to a nurse that is not fully vaccinated.""

CTV News noted that studies show vaccination does not stop COVID-19 infections or transmissions and that alleged protection in the vaccinated wanes after three months.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/critically-understaffed-canadian-hospitals-may-try-to-lure-back-the-unvaccinated-healthcare-workers-they-fired,2022-12-15
'Detestable': Critics pummel Biden for racing to visit Buffalo in massacre aftermath despite still refusing to visit Waukesha,"President Joe Biden announced on Monday that he and first lady Jill Biden would be traveling to Buffalo, New York, on Tuesday to grieve with the community following the horrific race-based massacre there that took the lives of ten and injured three others.

At a Tops supermarket in the city Saturday afternoon, the suspected gunman, 18-year-old Payton Gendron of Conklin, New York, opened fire on the store's mostly black clientele, killing several in the parking lot before entering the store and continuing the violent rampage.

Gendron reportedly told police that he had been planning a violent attack on the black community and has allegedly espoused white supremacist and fascist views online.

The vile attack has set the community and the country reeling. After such tragedies, a presidential visit is often a source of comfort and healing. As such, no one appears to be suggesting that Biden should not visit Buffalo.

But critics were quick to point out that Biden's prompt visit to the city reeks of political bias, especially since the president has yet to pay a visit to Waukesha, Wisconsin, where another mass-casualty attack took place late last year.

In that incident, a black convict recently released from jail on questionable terms, Darrell Brooks Jr., allegedly drove his car into a crowd of mostly white people at a Christmas parade, killing six and injuring more than 60 others.

It just so happens that the massacre in Buffalo — in which a white man killed innocent black people using guns — fits Biden's political narrative, while the heinous attack in Waukesha did not, the critics suggested.

In the aftermath of the Waukesha massacre, the White House defended Biden's decision not to personally visit the city by arguing that sending the president to a community ""requires a lot of assets."" Apparently, plentiful assets are not such an impediment this time.

Daily Wire contributor Matt Walsh called Biden's refusal to visit Waukesha ""beyond vile"" in light of his speedy visit to Buffalo.

Larry Elder and RealClearInvestigations senior writer Mark Hemingway also made note of the president's apparent bias. As did Todd Starnes.



Conservative commenter Candace Owens, too, joined the chorus of those criticizing the president and the media, saying, ""Both acts are heinous but they will not earn equal coverage in the media ... they will elevate the Buffalo shooting because white crimes vs. black victims [are] preferred.""

Others on Twitter called Biden's actions ""disgusting"" and claimed that he is only visiting Buffalo because he believes an appearance there can be ""politically advantageous.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/critics-pummel-biden-buffalo-visit,2022-05-16
Critics: Video shows Planned Parenthood volunteer going well out of his way to antagonize pro-life activist and his 12-year-old son prior to shove,"While pro-life activist Mark Houck was found not guilty Monday of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, new information is coming to light that's spurring others to call into question why the Department of Justice ever brought the charges — that could have landed Houck in prison for 11 years — in the first place.

What are the details?

Much has been made of Houck shoving to the ground 72-year-old Brian Love, a volunteer ""escort"" at the Planned Parenthood Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center in Philadelphia.

But critics are saying video of an interaction between Houck and Love in October 2021 shows Love initiated the confrontation — and that he went out of his way to do so:

Fox News' Sean Hannity, narrating the above clip, said it shows Houck and his son ""standing away from the entrance to the clinic when he is approached by the escort, identified as Bruce Love, who repeatedly tried to antagonize Houck."" Indeed, the clip shows father and son standing on the corner of Locust and South 12th Street, which appears to be about 40 to 50 feet from the clinic entrance. Nevertheless, Love was the one approaching them.

Digital strategist Greg Price agreed, noting in the above tweet that the ""escort ... clearly walks down the road to where Houck and his son are praying and counseling to threaten them""

Houck's wife — Ryan-Marie Houck — told LifeSiteNews that a ""pro-abortion protester"" would say awful things to her son such as ""you’re dad’s a fag.""

Houck's wife also claimed Love got into their son's ""personal space"" and refused to stop saying ""crude … inappropriate and disgusting"" things to the father and son, and the shove followed.

The incident went nowhere until President Joe Biden's DOJ charged Houck with violating the FACE Act, which condemns anyone who, with ""force or threat of force or by physical obstruction, intentionally injures, intimidates or interferes with or attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person because that person is or has been, or in order to intimidate such person or any other person or any class of persons from, obtaining or providing reproductive health services.""

Nearly a year after the Houck-Love dust-up, 25 FBI agents with guns drawn showed up to Houck's home and arrested him.

After a look at the video, Red State opined that the DOJ got involved ""for purely political reasons, attempting to discourage pro-life activists via the full weight and power of the U.S. government from non-violently protesting and praying outside abortion facilities. It shows just how compromised the DOJ is.""

The outlet added that ""what makes this situation all the worse, though, is that the punishment was the prosecution. Houck had to spend thousands of dollars and put his life on the line to defend himself from a malicious hit that was only carried out to push the far-left’s radical pro-abortion agenda. Lawfare has become standard fare for the DOJ, and it’s scary stuff.""

Ted Cruz issues direct challenge to Karine Jean-Pierre over 'pants on fire' claim that migrants aren't walking across border,"Republican Sen. Ted Cruz doubled down on his challenge to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday after she refused an invitation to witness the border crisis first-hand.

What is the background?

After Jean-Pierre falsely claimed last month that migrants are not ""walking"" across the border, Cruz invited Jean-Pierre to Texas where migrants pore into the U.S. every day.

Cruz, speaking on his podcast, described Jean-Pierre's claim as an ""11-alarm, pants on fire"" lie. Cruz said she was either ""deliberately lying"" or is ""deliberately ignorant"" about the border crisis.

On Tuesday, a reporter asked Jean-Pierre if she would take up Cruz's invitation, but she immediately rejected it. Jean-Pierre said she has been to the border before (in 2018 before the current border crisis), and used the moment to attack former President Donald Trump.

I’ve been to the border. I went in 2018. I stood outside facilities where the Trump administration was separating families, tearing babies out of their mothers’ arms. Some of those kids still haven’t been reunited with their families. And so, one thing I will say is I certainly don’t need lectures or invitations from Republicans about the border or border policies.

How did Cruz respond?

The Texas senator not only reiterated his original challenge, but upped the ante.

""I’m going to give a challenge, Karine Jean-Pierre, right now,"" Cruz said on Fox News. ""Come to this border. Spend 60 minutes, one hour, with me and the Border Patrol union. We will encounter dozens, if not hundreds, of illegal immigrants coming across.

""And if we don’t, let’s bring the entire White House press corps, and one of two things will happen: If we don’t encounter anyone, I’ll stand up and say, 'I was wrong,'"" he continued.

""But when we encounter hundreds of people crossing, do you have the courage and integrity to stand in front of the press corps you’re lying to and say, ‘I lied to you?’ That’s what an honest White House press secretary would say,"" Cruz asserted.

While top administration officials buck invitations to the southern border, President Joe Biden has not visited the border even one time since becoming president.

However, under his leadership, the U.S. has seen a record-number of migrant encounters. The crisis is so bad, in fact, that migrant encounters for fiscal year 2022 could exceed 2 million by the end of the month.

According to the Washington Post, Biden has only visited the southern border one time. That happened in 2008 when Biden ""briefly drove past the border while on a campaign swing,"" the newspaper explained.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/cruz-challenges-jean-pierre-border-crisis,2022-09-07
"Crypto.com accidentally sent millions to Australian woman, who went on a spending spree. Now, Crypto is suing to get it all back","One Australian woman took the money and ran after a major cryptocurrency exchange accidentally sent her millions of dollars. But now, she could face contempt of court charges after judges ordered her to pay the money back.

In May 2021, Thevamanogari Manivel of Melbourne sent Crypto.com, perhaps the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, a request for a $100 AUD refund. However, when Crypto attempted to honor her request, an agent mistakenly entered the account number in the payment section and inadvertently sent Manivel $10.5 million instead, according to reports.

Last year, Crypto was flush with money. It had recently acquired the naming rights to the arena formerly known as the Staples Center in Los Angeles, home of the L.A. Lakers, L.A. Clippers, and L.A. Kings, among others. It had also recently begun issuing crypto-based credit and debit cards. Likely distracted by these new financial endeavors, Crypto.com did not even notice the Manivel error until an audit conducted in December.

However, by that time, a significant portion of the money was already long gone. According to 7News Australia, Manivel had transferred $10.1 million to a joint account and then purchased a $1.35 million property. Reports suggest that the property was purchased as a gift for her sister, Thilagavathy Gangadory, who has also been named in the Crypto suit.

The Supreme Court of Victoria, the Australian state in which Melbourne is located, put a freeze order on Manivel's accounts back in February and ordered her to sell the property and return all the missing funds, plus the incurred interest. The court likewise ordered Gangadory's account frozen, but officials haven't been able to reach her to serve the suit.

""There’s no doubt that if you saw that in your account, you would know it shouldn’t be there,"" said Justin Lawrence, an attorney with Melbourne law firm Henderson and Ball Lawyers, according to 7News. ""And the onus is actually on you to actually call the sender and to say, 'Look, that shouldn’t have come into my account.'""

""If you’re withholding property of someone else, you’re effectively holding property by deception,"" Lawrence added. ""You’re not entitled to it. You need to give it back.""

It is unclear whether Lawrence is involved in the suit or simply offering his professional opinion.

Should Manivel and Gangadory refuse to sell the property, they could be held in contempt of court and the property turned over to a court-appointed receiver. Neither sister has issued a public comment. Crypto has merely acknowledged that the issue is ""before the courts"" and has declined to comment further.

The court battle is scheduled to resume in October.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/crypto-sent-millions-by-mistake,2022-08-31
"Dartmouth College charges Republican club $3,600 security fee for canceled Andy Ngo event","Three months ago, Dartmouth College in New Hampshire canceled a College Republicans event featuring journalist Andy Ngo in response to violent threats made by Antifa activists and ""concerning information"" the school claimed it received from Hanover police.

Now, the school is insisting that Dartmouth College Republicans pay $3,600 in security fees for the canceled event and warning that failure to pay the fees will result in the club being unable to request further funds from the school.

On Tuesday, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education sent a letter to Dartmouth College demanding that the school ""immediately rescind the security fee charge"" and permit the College Republicans chapter to request funding to host future events.

""Forcing the group to shoulder these security costs — based on detractors' disruption at no fault of the College Republicans — and refusing to fund future College Republicans events until these exorbitant fees are paid, infringes the expressive and associational rights Dartmouth promises to its students,"" FIRE's Sabrina Conza wrote to Dartmouth President Philip J. Hanlon.



The planned event with Ngo in January was moved online after his physical visit to campus was canceled. At the time, Dartmouth College claimed that it had received unspecified ""concerning information"" from Hanover police ""regarding safety issues"" for the event. In response to requests from FIRE for clarification about why the in-person event was canceled, the school said it was ""deeply concerned about the credible threats to participant safety shared by local law enforcement"" before the event with Ngo was scheduled to begin.

However, FIRE also requested clarification from the Hanover police, which shared public records and a letter from the police chief stating that law enforcement ""did not make a recommendation to Dartmouth College regarding the January 20th event.""

The letter from Chief of Police Charles B. Dennis said that ""the information and concerns we had received from student organizers, event organizers, the speaker, open-source information available online referencing the event, and information through law enforcement channels was credible and caused us concern for the safety of those attending the event, protesting the event, as well as our community members.""

""With the information we had, we were operationally prepared as best we could to handle the event and protest,"" Dennis said.

In a statement to Inside Higher Ed, a spokesperson for Dartmouth College affirmed the school's support for ""freedom of expression and dissent.""

The school said that student organizations are responsible for event-related security costs and said that ""leaders of the college Republican club were aware of their responsibility for security fees for the event and received an estimate in advance, with enough time to submit a funding request for these costs. They did not request this funding. The club was also aware of the possibility that the event might need to be adjusted to address safety concerns expressed by the organizers themselves.”

Daughter of Hall of Fame pitcher accused of giving birth in the woods on Christmas and then abandoning her baby in the freezing cold,"Alexandra Eckersley, the 26-year-old adopted daughter of MLB Hall of Fame pitcher Dennis Eckersley, has been accused of giving birth in a wooded area of New Hampshire and then abandoning her newborn baby in freezing cold temperatures.

Just after midnight on December 26, police in Manchester, New Hampshire, received a call from a woman later identified as Eckersley. Initially, Eckersley told officers that she had given birth on an area soccer field, a police report states. As temperatures had already dipped below 20 degrees Fahrenheit, Manchester police, fire, and American medical response quickly sprang into action to find Eckersley's baby boy.

However, after searching unsuccessfully for more than an hour, police said that Eckersley eventually changed her story and redirected rescue teams to the child's correct location: a squalid, makeshift tent in the woods behind the West Side Ice Arena. When they found the boy, they claimed he was ""moving, not crying, and exposed."" Some reports indicate that the boy was found naked in a bloody area of the tent and that the lone propane heater inside the tent had been turned off.

The baby — who, at the time of his rescue, reportedly weighed about 4 lbs — was treated by EMTs at the scene then taken to Catholic Medical Center in Manchester before he was airlifted to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, approximately 75 miles north. Reports indicate that the baby was intubated, though, thankfully, his condition also appears to be improving.



""Had we not collectively located that little boy when we did and rendered the first aid that was rendered, I’m quite confident the child probably would have died in that tent,"" said Manchester police Chief Allen Aldenberg.

When asked why she allegedly misled police about the child's whereabouts, Eckersley claimed that she and ""George,"" the man identified by some reports as her boyfriend and the possible father of the child, feared that authorities might seize their tent and other belongings. She also allegedly told police, ""What do they tell you when a plane goes down? Save yourself first.""



Eckersley's mother, Nancy, indicated to prosecutors that her daughter has a history of drug use and mental illness. She and her husband, Dennis — who spent 23 years as a pitcher in the major leagues, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2004, and who enjoyed a long broadcasting career with the Boston Red Sox after he retired from the mound — had offered their daughter the opportunity to live at home on the condition that she enter a drug treatment program. Eckersley allegedly refused that offer.

Eckersley has been arrested and charged with felony reckless conduct, second-degree assault/extreme indifference, endangering the welfare of a child, and falsifying physical evidence. She has pled not guilty through a telephone court appearance as she continues to recuperate in the hospital.

Eckersley's attorney, Jordan Strand, noted during the court appearance that Eckersley was the one who called 911 to report the premature birth and indicated that Eckersley's subsequent behavior was a cry for help.

""I think that what this affidavit shows is that someone asked for help when they needed it,"" Strand said. ""This is a woman who unexpectedly gave birth while she is being unhoused and living in a tent, and we don't penalize people for being unhoused and living in a tent.""

Outreach worker Carol M. Lizotte, who has known Eckersley for at least five years, expressed sympathy for the situation as well.

""Honestly, it’s breaking me up because she is not what she’s being painted to look like,"" Lizotte stated. ""She has the potential to be a wonderful mother. … It’s not all her fault. She’s actually a victim in this case, just as much as the baby.""

Others, like Aldenberg, have less compassion for Eckersley.

""There’s no excuse for this,"" Aldenberg said.

While Aldenberg acknowledged that adults have the right to live in filthy conditions if they so choose, he stated that no adult has the right to subject a child to danger. ""[Y]ou don’t get to do this, what we’re alleging here,"" he stated. ""You don’t get to do this to a child.""

Judge Diane Nicolosi set Eckersley's bail at $3,000 but stated that Eckersley could be released without posting cash bail as long as she avoids contact with all minors, including her son, and as long as she lives with her parents, in a sober living facility, or in some other residence approved by the court.

Though the little boy is believed to be Eckersley's only child, Eckersley also has an unrelated child endangerment charge still pending against her. Other charges related to this latest incident may still be forthcoming as well. Police are still searching for ""George"" in connection to this case.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/daughter-of-hall-of-fame-pitcher-accused-of-giving-birth-in-the-woods-on-christmas-and-then-abandoning-her-baby-in-the-freezing-cold,2022-12-28
"Dave Chappelle calls out censorious transsexual activists who claim his jokes cause violence, who yet savagely attack his fans: 'They want to be feared'","Comedian Dave Chappelle took LGBT activists to task this week for their apparent hypocrisy and intolerance. On the second episode of his ""The Midnight Miracle"" podcast, Chappelle discussed violent activists' savage attacks on his fans and their success in getting one of his shows cancelled.

What's the background?

In conversation with co-hosts Talib Kweli and Yasiin Bey, Chappelle noted that transsexual activists ""want to be feared. 'If you say this, then we will punish you. We'll come to First Avenue and f*** your show and we'll come to the Varsity Theater and f**** your show up.' And they just don't get to do that.""

Chappelle was scheduled to put on a comedy show in July at an iconic concert venue in Minneapolis, First Avenue. However, the event was cancelled just hours before it was set to begin.

TheBlaze previously reported that First Avenue officials canceled it and that it was subsequently moved to the Varsity Theater, a venue roughly 2.5 miles away.

The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway suggested at the time that this move amounted to ""totalitarian censorship,"" exemplifying ""hatred of free expression.""

First Avenue had evidently caved to activist pressure, saying in a statement, ""We believe in diverse voices and the freedom of artistic expression, but in honoring that, we lost sight of the impact this would have.""

Rolling Stone reported that staffers had complained about Chappelle and threatened to bail out of work.

The staffers and other activists antipathetic to free speech were enraged in part by Chappelle's 2021 stand-up special ""The Closer,"" which had sparked walkouts at Netflix.

Former actress Elliot Page, Jameela Jamil, and one of the former Wachowski brothers behind ""The Matrix"" were among the so-called celebrities who supported the Netflix employees' efforts to silence the black comedian, reported the BBC.

Transsexual activist Ashlee Marie Preston said, ""We are here today not because we don't know how to take a joke. We're here because we're concerned that the jokes are taking lives.""

One of the allegedly homicidal quips Chappelle made in the special was: ""They canceled J.K. Rowling. My God. ... Effectually she said gender was a fact, and then the trans community got mad as s***, they started calling her a TERF.""

The comedian then noted he was on ""Team TERF,"" which stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist — a group that believes only biological females are women.

NBC News indicated the show's cancellation in Minneapolis was also prompted by a Change.org online petition, which claimed, ""Dave Chappelle has a record of being dangerous to trans people, and First Avenue has a duty to protect the community.""

Activists were apparently not satisfied that Chappelle's show had been relocated. They wanted him silenced outright.

Violent activists flocked to the second theater in hopes of a repeat success.



Rainbow coalition's intolerance

On his podcast this week, Chappelle recalled how transsexual activists mobbed his fans lined up outside the Varsity Theater, waiting to get in after the cancellation of the original show.

Chappelle said that these transsexual activists ""and their surrogates always say that my jokes are somehow gonna be the root cause of some impending violence.""

Before a joke was uttered on stage that day, ""people of various genders and gender identities ... threw eggs. They threw eggs at the people who were lined up to see the show,"" said Chappelle.

""One lady was so mad with the protesters, she picked up a police barricade. ... You ever seen one? They look like a bike rack. This b**** picked that barricade up by herself and threw it at the crowd,"" recalled the comedian. ""I gotta tell you, it’s an amazing feat of strength for a woman.""

Chappelle recalled that the violent activists' rallying cry was ""'Go home, transphobe.' They kept saying that: 'Go home, transphobe,' and 'f*** you, transphobe.' It was really confusing, but if you replace the word 'transphobe' for 'n*****,' it makes perfect sense.""

Despite the activists' venom and violence, Chappelle underscored how none of his fans ""beat 'em up. In fact, the people in the crowd would just say, 'We love you. Like what are you talking about?'""

Chappelle has endeavored to take a nuanced approach to LGBT matters in his comedy. Nonetheless, on account of his refusal to subordinate his sense of humor to activists' precepts, he has been physically attacked along with his fans.

Chappelle was attacked on stage at the Hollywood Bowl in May by a man reportedly armed with a knife, who claimed to have been ""triggered"" by the comedian's jokes about the LGBT ""community.""

""Art is a nuanced endeavor,"" Chappelle said this week. ""I have a belief that they are trying to take the nuance out of speech in American culture, that they're making people speak as if they're either on the right or the left. Everything seems absolute, and any opinion I respect is way more nuanced than these binary choices they keep putting in front of us. I don't see the world in red or blue.""

The comedian intimated that activists are going out of their way to find and take offense: ""There's a thing they do where they deliberately obscure what I think they believe is the intent of my work to make a moment of it that I don't know that the work necessarily merits. You know what I mean?""

""I’m not even mad that they take issue with my work, he added. ""Good, fine. Who cares? What I take issue with is the idea that because they don’t like it, I’m not allowed to say it.""

Jeremy Clarkson of ""Grand Tour"" fame, now facing further cancellation, recently expressed a similar sentiment in an op-ed, claiming that leftist malcontents are always ""inventing new rules to ensnare anyone and everyone they deem to be unworthy"" and that there ""really is an army with the ability to remove from public life anyone who disagrees with its increasingly militant viewpoint.""

Dave Chappelle decides to leave his name off of theater at his high school in order to avoid offending anyone,"Comedian Dave Chappelle decided that he would leave his name off of a theater at his high school in order to avoid offending anyone after some liberal students protested against him.

Chappelle made the announcement on Monday at the naming ceremony at Duke Ellington School of the Arts, his alma mater.

Chappelle had donated money and helped raise money for the new theater for the school he says was pivotal in his development as an iconic comedian. The school responded by saying it would name the theater after Chappelle.

That honor was soured when some students at the school protested against the decision based on the controversy surrounding jokes he made that offended some in the transgender and LGBTQ communities.

Chappelle addressed those protests on Monday when he announced the decision.

“These kids didn’t understand that they were instruments of oppression,"" he said according to a Washington Post reporter.

“When you say I can’t say something, the more urgent is it for me to say it. It has nothing to do with what you are saying I can’t say. It has everything to do with my freedom of artistic expression,"" Chappelle argued.

In November, the school said that they would continue with their plan to name the theater after Chappelle and reject the attempt by some students to cancel the comedian.

We recognize that not everyone will accept or welcome a particular artist's point of view, product or craft, but reject the notion that a ""cancel culture"" is a healthy or constructive means to teach our students how society should balance creative freedom with protecting the rights and dignity of all its members.

On Monday, Chappelle refused to concede to the students protesting against him and said that they were just acting in support of someone else's political agenda. But he decided against putting his name on the theater.

“The idea that my name will be turned into an instrument of someone else’s perceived oppression is untenable to me,"" he added.

“The Ellington family is my family,” Chappelle concluded.

The theater will instead be named the Theater for Artistic Freedom and Expression.

Chappelle has given and raised millions of dollars for his high school.

"Hogg does not plan to have kids, would prefer Porsche, dogs","Gun control activist David Hogg declared on Twitter that he does not plan to have any children and would rather get a Porsche and dogs.

Hogg, who was a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in 2018 when an individual perpetrated a mass shooting at the school, also claimed that the U.S. esteems firearms more than kids' lives and he would not want to raise children in America.

""Like yes kids are nice but most people can't afford them so it's nice to have friends with one but not have one yourself. Pets are the affordable version of kids today for Millennials and Gen Z"" he wrote, adding that ""Plants are now the more affordable pets."" He claimed that ""having kids and properly raising them in America has become a luxury for the fortunate few.""

""Like me? I'm never planning on having kids. I would much rather own a Porsche and have a Portuguese water dog and golden doodle. Long term it's cheaper, better for The environment and will never tell you that it hates you or ask you to pay for college,"" Hogg tweeted. ""Also BIG reason I will never have kids in the US- I refuse to raise kids in a country that values f****** guns over children's lives,"" he wrote.

"Day-care owner charged after babies and toddlers allegedly found with bruises, cuts, soiled diapers","A day-care owner in West Fargo, North Dakota, has been charged with nine felony counts after parents and a local physician said that young children left in her care had injuries consistent with physical abuse and neglect.

The case against Miranda Sorlie, 42, actually began back in May as an investigation into whether she was illegally selling the breast milk of other women from her day-care center, which she ran out of her home. Those accusations were determined to be unsubstantiated.

However, at that time, parents also began to complain that they had discovered unexplained cuts and bruises on their children after they picked them up from Sorlie's home. One father claimed that his 1-year-old son had cuts on his ear, scalp, arms, and feet. When questioned, Sorlie told him she was unaware of the injuries and suggested that they might be ""self-inflicted,"" according to reports.

Another family indicated that their young daughter had worn the same soiled diaper all day and that she had bruises on her neck and back. Yet a third family complained that when they arrived to pick their child up, Sorlie refused to open the door. The family eventually resorted to calling the police to arbitrate the situation. When they arrived, Sorlie allegedly told them that she and the children had been napping and did not hear the knocking.

Police had made contact with Sorlie after a Cass County social worker attempted to discuss the unexplained injuries with her, but Sorlie supposedly refused to open the door then as well. Police say she had agreed to speak with them about the injuries on May 11, but the day before, she called and canceled their meeting, claiming she felt uncomfortable ""being quizzed in her own home,"" Law & Crime reported. After that, Sorlie did not respond to police attempts to contact her, they said.

Court documents indicate that local child abuse specialist Dr. Jada Ingalls of Sanford Hospital examined each of the children left in Sorlie's care and determined that ""each child"" exhibited verifiable marks of ""physical abuse and neglect."" Ingalls claimed that one particular girl was ""failing to thrive while they attended Sorlie’s daycare"" because of malnourishment. Once the girl was removed from Sorlie's care, she began growing as normal, Ingalls asserted.



On Monday, Sorlie was arrested by West Fargo Police with the assistance of the U.S. Marshals Service High Plains Fugitive Task Force, though why a federal agency was involved is unclear. Sorlie was charged with three felony counts of child abuse, as well as six felony counts of child neglect.

Prosecutors are focusing on four alleged victims, all under the age of 2. They say that those kids were victimized at various times between January 2020 and May 2022.

""Everybody that’s been around children, that’s raised children recognizes that things happen at times,"" Cass County Assistant State’s Attorney Ryan Younggren said. ""But then when things keep happening and they happen also to others, then you have to stand up and take a look and see, ‘Ok, is there more of a pattern here than just a couple one-off events?’""

""You can’t raise a child on your own,"" Younggren continued. ""In today’s modern world, it’s very difficult to do that. When we drop children off at certain places, we expect them to come back in the condition we left them or at least in an explainable way if they’re not. We don’t expect people to be perfect, that’s for sure, but there’s a responsibility that people bear, and that’s really what this case is about.""

Sorlie has been released after paying 10% of her $5,000 bond. She is scheduled to appear in court again on February 9. Whether her daycare center remains open is unclear.

DC archdiocese mistakenly sends reporter email showing the local archbishop will ignore Pelosi controversy,"The Archdiocese of Washington accidentally emailed a reporter on Monday its internal guidance for addressing concerns about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi receiving Holy Communion.

Pelosi's eligibility to participate in the sacrament became national news after San Fransisco Archbishop Salvatore J. Cordileone barred Pelosi from receiving Holy Communion in the Archdiocese of San Francisco.

Cordileone explained in a ""letter to the faithful"" that he came to the decision due to Pelosi's increasingly ""extreme"" pro-abortion ideology.

What are the details?

On Monday, the Washington Examiner contacted the archdiocese that governs the nation's capital and received a message meant for internal communication showing the archdiocese was ignoring inquiries about Pelosi.

""Just sharing for you to know what comes in,"" the email stated. ""Email since Saturday, when I last checked the comms inbox has just been a couple of random people wanting to tell the Cardinal to bring down the hammer on Pelosi. Aside from Jack Jenkins at RNS, this is the only new media inquiry. It will be ignored, too.""

The email was sent from the archdiocese's communications department.

In follow-up exchanges, a spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Washington said the archdiocese was ignoring media inquiries because the position of the archbishop, Cardinal Wilton Dalton Gregory, has not changed since he last spoke about the issue.

A subsequent email from the spokesperson said:

I apologize for the mistaken email. We have not been responding to inquiries on this topic because Cardinal Gregory's position has not changed from what he has said in the past.



Cardinal Gregory has no new comment about the issue of Catholic politicians receiving Communion. The actions of Archbishop Cordileone are his decision to make in the Archdiocese of San Francisco. Cardinal Gregory has not instructed the priests of The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington to refuse Communion to anyone.

Last September, Gregory implied that he does not support denying Holy Communion to pro-abortion politicians, saying that priests should not act as ""police"" but as ""pastors.""

""We certainly have to teach the faith of the Church, we have to be true to the Church’s heritage of faith, but we also have to bring people along with us. It is not simply a matter of pointing out their errors,"" he said. ""That’s a part of our job, but the other part is welcoming and drawing them closer to the life of the Church, and we need to do that more effectively, more publicly.""



Why is this important?

Gregory's position became relevant after Pelosi reportedly received Holy Communion on Sunday.

Pelosi responded to Cordileone on Tuesday, pointing out what she believes is hypocrisy on his part.

""I wonder about the death penalty, which I’m opposed to. So is the church, but they take no actions against people who may not share their view,"" Pelosi said on MSNBC.

Pelosi also described Cordileone's decision — which is part of a pastor's responsibility — as ""very dangerous in the lives of so many of the American people"" and noted that Cordileone is ""vehemently against LGBTQ rights.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dc-archdiocese-mistakenly-emails-reporter-ignore-media,2022-05-24
Democrat DC deputy mayor for 'public safety and justice' busted for assault and battery,"The office of Washington, D.C., Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser confirmed on Wednesday that Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice Chris Geldart, 53, was suspended for allegedly grabbing a man by the neck outside a gym on October 1. In a statement, Bowser's office downplayed the alleged assault and battery, suggesting it ""sounds like something that happens to a lot of people — a dispute over something minor.""

According to Arlington Police, around 12:25 p.m. on Saturday, outside Gold's Gym in Arlington, Virginia, Geldart got into a verbal confrontation with a smaller man, Dustin Woodard. Woodard works as a trainer at the gym.

The shouting began after the door of the deputy mayor's parked car allegedly struck a vehicle belonging to the victim's girlfriend. The interaction escalated, and Geldart allegedly seized Woodard by the throat.

After the incident, Geldart drove away. He was later informed by telephone of a warrant pertaining to assault and battery charges, at which time he turned himself in. Geldart was ultimately released on a summons.

Woodard told WTTG that Geldart is ""way too big to be trying to be a bully, especially with his position. Something should be done.""



""We've been dealing with him for a while at Gold's,"" said Woodard, alluding to multiple other instances in which the deputy mayor allegedly abused his power at the gym.

Geldart has been charged with assault and battery and placed on administrative leave. He has been the deputy mayor since January 2021.

Geldart was previously director of the Department of Public Works. He resigned from the post shortly after the Office of the Inspector General issued a report claiming he had committed two ethics violations, including having used his government office to benefit a ""close personal acquaintance.""

In 2017, four Bowser-appointed members of the Board of Ethics and Government Accountability dismissed a formal investigation into Geldart regarding potential ethics violations, having found ""there was insufficient evidence to support a reasonable belief that a violation occurred.""

Geldart has also served as director of the D.C. Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency.

Woodard told WUSA9 that while it was prudent to ""show some compassion for him in this matter,"" what Geldart did ""was wrong and shouldn't go unpunished.""



""Do I feel that he should be in the position that he's in now? No, I don't,"" added Woodard.

When a WTTG reporter presented the footage of her deputy allegedly assaulting Woodard, Mayor Bowser refused to look or respond.

According to police, during the incident, Geldart was cursing and shouting, and it was this that prompted Woodward to turn around and tell him to ""shut up."" The alleged choking can be seen in the footage obtained by WTTG.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dc-deputy-mayor-for-public-safety-and-justice-busted-for-assault-and-battery,2022-10-06
DCCC ad seeks to target Latinos,"With Americans facing soaring inflation and sky-high gas prices, it's entirely possible that the Democratic Party could be cruising for a bruising at the ballot box during the 2022 midterm elections — but an ad that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee hopes will appeal to Latino voters may not improve the party's chances of avoiding an embarrassing drubbing during the election.

The DCCC shared an ad in which a woman, who complains of back and neck pain, says that she cannot slow down because she needs to earn more money because of high gas prices and her children's need for daycare. She notes being ""so stressed out,"" and says that she does not ""know what else to do.""

Another character in the ad advises the woman to vote for Democrats, saying, ""These Republican extremists have no plan to help us.""

The overworked woman responds by saying that ""Democrats seem so out of touch.""

""Not true. These MAGA Republicans are only working for rich people. Democrats know firsthand that even small price increases are hard on working families like ours. Democrats are finding solutions, unlike the Republicans,"" the other character replies. ""What you could do is vote for Democrats.""

It seems unlikely that the ad will inspire voters to get excited about voting for Democrats.

One person on Twitter commented, ""this might be the worst ad i've ever heard. woof. without the tag it could be a republican spot.""

""First of all, this ad is terrible. But more importantly, it represents the terrible position in which Democrats find themselves in South Texas and the RGV. The Dem brand is ruined--completely destroyed. They have to attack both parties. This means they are going to lose,"" someone else tweeted.

In a press release, the DCCC announced that it is shelling out a seven-figure sum for digital, print, and radio ads to attract Latino support in ""battleground districts.""

""The first radio advertisements will run in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas, and will spotlight Republicans’ extreme plans for America and highlight the historic accomplishments Democrats have delivered to communities,"" the press release declared.

""Democrats refuse to take Latino voters for granted and this latest investment will join the DCCC’s cycle-long commitment to court, build and expand Democrats’ relationship and commitment to the Latino electorate,"" DCCC Senior Advisor for Latino Engagement Mariafernanda Zacarias said, according to the press release. ""At a time when Republicans lie and try to deceive voters, especially in Latino communities, the DCCC is going to continue making the case that Democrats are the best for our families and our freedoms.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dccc-ad-appeal-to-latinos,2022-07-29
"Deadlocked House speaker bid continues: Kevin McCarthy fails again to secure enough votes in fourth, fifth, sixth rounds","On Wednesday afternoon, the House reconvened to conduct a fourth, fifth, and sixth round of votes for the speaker position after Representative Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) failed three times yesterday to gather enough votes. As a result, Tuesday marked the first time in a century that the House speaker bid went to a multiple-ballot vote.

After hours of negotiations Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, McCarthy again failed to secure the House speaker position before the House adjourned at approximately 4:30 p.m. EST. The House will reconvene Wednesday at 8 p.m. for a seventh vote.

During every round of votes, House Democrats unified behind their nomination of Representative Hakeem Jeffries (D) of New York.

On Wednesday afternoon, ahead of the fourth ballot, Rep. Mike Gallagher (R) of Wisconsin nominated McCarthy. He added that the voting process was ""messy by design"" and referred to it as a ""feature, not a bug of our system.""

Texas Rep. Chip Roy (R) stood up to nominate Florida Rep. Byron Donalds (R). Roy argued that the American people are tired of the status quo and ""want a new face, new vision, and new leadership.""

Donalds used his first two votes yesterday to back McCarthy but switched his vote to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on the third ballot. Then, on Wednesday, Donalds voted for himself during all three rounds.

The 20 Republicans who previously voted for Jordan voted for Donalds in Wednesday's votes. Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana (R), who previously voted for McCarthy three times, voted ""present"" three times on Wednesday, leaving McCarthy with only 201 votes.

""The process should be frustrating, but it's important for us that we have this communication so we actually get it done,"" Spartz told the New York Times. Spartz noted that she supports McCarthy, ""but ultimately, he needs to be able to address the concerns of other people.""

Lawmakers will continue to gather in the House to conduct subsequent votes until a candidate secures a majority and a new speaker is named.

What's the background?

During the first vote on Tuesday, 19 Republicans voted for candidates other than McCarthy, blocking his victory. As a result, McCarthy, who needed 218 votes to secure the position, only obtained 203 of the 434 votes. The second ballot, conducted later that day, produced a similar result.

By the third ballot, 20 Republicans moved to block McCarthy's bid by voting for Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), even though Jordan has consistently supported McCarthy.

Rep. Bob Good (R) of Virginia, who declared ahead of the voting that he would not support McCarthy, stated that a hostile, early Tuesday, closed-door meeting further divided the party's votes.

""The meeting was very hostile, and I don't think it did anything to persuade those who are inclined to vote against Kevin McCarthy,"" Good told Fox News Digital.

Before the House convened on Wednesday, Texas Rep. Chip Roy (R) joined ""The Glenn Beck Program"" to discuss the state of negotiations and why Republican Freedom Caucus members were refusing to support McCarthy.

The vote remains deadlocked, according to Roy, because McCarthy refused to agree to crucial proposals from the Freedom Caucus that would prevent legislation like the $1.7 trillion omnibus bill from being rammed through the House.

He noted that the Freedom Caucus members are committed to stopping bills from being created during closed-door meetings and brought to the floor for a vote without adequate time for review.

When asked if Democrats would be willing to rally behind McCarthy to end the deadlocked voting, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D) of California told the New York Times, ""This is a problem of their own making. This is called leadership. They should be able to work it out. Don't put this at the Democrats' doorstep.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/deadlocked-house-speaker-bid-continues-kevin-mccarthy-fails-again-to-secure-enough-votes-in-fourth-fifth-sixth-rounds,2023-01-04
Dean Obeidallah requests Elon Musk's immigration application,"Leftist Dean Obeidallah said that he has filed a request to obtain Elon Musk's U.S. immigration application and that he will push to have Musk's citizenship stripped if he finds any falsehoods in the documents.

Obeidallah has said that Musk would need to consent in order for the records to be disclosed and that he is trying to troll him.

""As a lawyer Im going to do research to see if @elonmusk in any way lied on his application for US citizenship. I'll be making a FOIA request for his immigration application. If he lied anywhere on application we will move to strip him of US citizenship. Stay tuned,"" tweeted Obeidallah, who hosts a SiriusXM radio show.

""Just so everyone knows the facts, while I did make a FOIA request for Elon Musk's immigration application he has to consent to the request before I can get the docs. If he consents, I will share the file. If he refuses to consent then we must ask: What is Elon hiding?!"" he wrote in another tweet.

""I'm not xenophobic-I'm Elon Musk-ophobic,"" he tweeted.

Musk, a billionaire business magnate who recently acquired Twitter and previously indicated that he wanted the platform to be a forum for free speech, said in a recent note directed toward Twitter advertisers that the platform cannot turn into ""a free-for-all hellscape.""

Obeidallah has called for advertisers to shun the social media platform. ""Dear advertisers: please do not advertise on Twitter. There are plenty of other platforms to reach people. Thx,"" he tweeted.

Obeidallah has indicated that the records request is a way to troll Musk.

""If Musk can troll us I can certainly troll him. Musk’s Morons are really angry at me for doing this. Good,"" Obeidallah tweeted.

""It will be denied in its entirety for privacy reasons absent demonstration of an overriding public interest in disclosure,"" Bradley P. Moss tweeted in response to Obeidallah's announcement that he had made the Musk-related records request.

""It won't be released without his consent. It was never about the document. It was only about the trolling,"" Obeidallah replied.

"Death row inmate cuts off penis, smears feces on wall during 'psychiatric' meltdown over food package","A death row inmate in Tennessee engaged in significant self-harm, including castrating himself and slitting his wrists, during a major meltdown he recently had over a special food package that had been denied him.

Some time earlier this month, Henry Eugene Hodges, 56, became outraged when his request for a special food package at Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville had been refused. According to institutional rules, inmates with a clean record for six months may request such a food package, but Hodges made his request a month early, after only five months of good behavior, and was therefore denied.

The denial supposedly sent Hodges into a rage, and he began smearing feces on his cell wall in protest. Guards then decided to deny him food altogether, likely to minimize the feces he could produce and then spread.

Hodges responded by slitting his wrists with a razor he had hidden. He also asked to be put on suicide watch and was transferred to an infirmary. His attorney, Kelley Henry, claimed that during his stay in the infirmary, a ""high ranking correctional officer"" told the person or persons treating Hodges that Hodges was manipulating them and that Hodges should be kept under suicide watch in his cell.

After he was returned to his cell, Hodges found a glass shard from a broken window and used the shard to cut off his penis during a two-hour standoff with prison guards. Hodges was eventually restrained and taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where medical teams were able to surgically reattach his penis. Whether full function has been restored is unclear.

Ms. Henry has railed against prison officials, suggesting that they had neglected her client's mental health.

""He needs competent mental health care"" and ""is enduring ongoing psychiatric harm as a result of these conditions,"" she said.

She also claimed that Hodges had been placed in 6-point restraints after 4-point restraints failed to prevent him from removing his catheter. Once he agreed to take medication, he was placed back in 4-point restraints but was still left naked on a thin mattress for reportedly as long as a week.

""Surely the prison can find a place to put him where he is not a danger to himself or others and does not have to be tied down like an animal,"" Henry asserted. She said she intends to file a complaint with the state, claiming that the prison had violated Hodges' constitutional rights.

In 1992, Hodges was convicted of the 1990 robbery and murder of Ronald Bassett, a phone repairman, and sentenced to death. He is also serving a life sentence for murdering Michael Whisnant, a chemical engineer from North Carolina, in an Atlanta hotel room and another life sentence for stabbing to death Barry McDonald, an Inglewood nurse, in 1989.

During the late 80s, Hodges participated in homosexual prostitution, though he denies that he is homosexual. He also claimed that he had suffered sexual abuse as an adolescent and that he feared telling his father about the abuse because of his father's homophobia. There are multiple reports that he engaged in homosexual relationships.

Ms. Henry claimed that Hodges has been diagnosed as bipolar and is susceptible to psychotic episodes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/death-row-inmate-cuts-off-penis-smears-feces-on-wall-during-psychiatric-meltdown-over-food-package,2022-10-28
Death sentence upheld for Arizona woman charged with the murder of 10-year-old left inside locked box – child suffered repeated abuse from multiple family members,"Sammantha Allen's murder conviction and death sentence were upheld by the Arizona Supreme Court this week. Allen was charged with murder and child abuse of her 10-year-old cousin, Ame Deal.

In 2011, the child was forced by Sammantha Allen and her husband, John Allen, to spend the night in a small storage container, where she ultimately suffocated. The box was less than 3 feet long and less than 1 foot wide. The couple stated that it was punishment for stealing a popsicle.

Sammantha Allen attempted to appeal the death sentence, solely blaming her husband for the child's death. However, authorities stated that this was not the first time the child had been forced into the box and that she frequently suffered abuse at the hands of multiple relatives.

The justices wrote, ""To characterize Sammantha's actions as mere presence or a simple failure to render aid in a life-threatening situation mischaracterizes the facts.""

The court concluded that Allen failed to provide aid to Ame and refused to release her from the container, making her directly responsible for her death.

John Allen was also sentenced to death in the murder of Ame Deal in 2020.

Several other family members pleaded guilty to child abuse and were convicted in 2013 – Ame's aunt and legal guardian, Cynthia Stoltzmann, was sentenced to 24 years in prison; her father, David Deal, received 14 years; and her grandmother, Judith Deal, received ten years.

Ame's mother previously fled the state after also suffering abuse from the family, leaving behind her young child.

Throughout investigations, authorities discovered the child had been forced to eat dog feces and smash aluminum soda cans with her bare feet. Ame had reportedly been chained up outside overnight by a dog collar, kicked in the face, and suffered beatings with a wooden paddle.

While Ame was not the only child in the home, authorities said she was treated more brutally than others because her family thought of her as a liar and thief.

Despite the long history of familial abuse, law enforcement stated they never received any reports that Ame was being mistreated. However, before the family moved to Arizona, they resided in Utah, where authorities had records of the child's abuse.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/death-sentence-upheld-for-arizona-woman-charged-with-the-murder-of-10-year-old-left-inside-locked-box-child-suffered-repeated-abuse-from-multiple-family-members,2022-07-28
Dem mayor rejects far left's calls to defund police: 'Loudest' minority has 'hijacked the term progressive',"New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) rejected ""woke"" strategies to defund the New York Police Department on Thursday. He claimed that the ""loudest"" minority has ""hijacked the term progressive,"" the New York Post reported.



On Thursday, Adams attacked the ""Progressive Caucus"" for attempting to ""reduce the size and scope of the NYPD."" According to the mayor, the caucus threatened to remove members who refused to sign a pledge to defund law enforcement.

Adams told CNN that a ""numerical minority"" of Democrats ""have hijacked the term progressive."" He vowed to continue to support ""pro-public safety"" and ""pro-proper policing"" policies.

""I have been progressive all my life,"" Adams stated. ""Look at the issues I fought for, from police reform, housing, education. But we've allowed a small number that are the loudest, and they've hijacked the true meaning of the Democratic Party.""

He criticized the ""small number on the fringe ends of our party.""

""We're not for defunding the police. We're not for attacking businesses. We're for jobs, we're for growth,"" Adams added.

During an MSNBC interview on Wednesday, the NYC mayor blamed ""woke"" individuals in the party for driving away minority voters.

""There's a hemorrhaging of our Latino community, our [Asian American and Pacific Islander] communities, that's leaving the traditional Democratic base, because we've allowed the loudest and those who consider themselves to be 'woke,'"" Adams explained.

""Some of us never went to sleep, and we hear and speak directly to people, and I think the party is now understanding that we have to speak at those issues that are important: Jobs, public safety, educating our children, good health care, just these common kitchen-table issues that we run away from,"" he continued.

Adams applauded President Joe Biden's State of the Union address for avoiding ""woke"" rhetoric and returning his focus to ""working people.""

""This president's focus on working people is exactly what the nation needs, and his focus on helping Americans care for their children, provide for their families, and put money in their wallets will resonate from coast to coast,"" Adams stated. ""The agenda he laid out goes hand in hand with what we are doing in New York City — this is a blue-collar president, I'm a blue-collar mayor, and we're both pursuing a blue-collar agenda for working people in New York and across the rest of the nation.""

"Dem mayor who used taxpayer money to purchase first-class plane tickets to Europe is under fire again for spending $225,000 on security services and personal stylist","Democratic New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell is being criticized for spending more than $50,000 in taxpayer money on security services and another $175,000 in campaign funds on a personal stylist and shopper.



According to WWL-TV, at least two stores in the New Orleans area have received subpoenas from a federal grand jury and have been questioned by the FBI about purchases made by Cantrell's personal shopper, Tanya Blunt-Haynes.

Cantrell's communications director, Gregory Joseph, told NOLA.com, ""Our office has not received nor has any knowledge of a federal investigation into Mayor Cantrell. However, in the event that this changes, our office will, as always, fully cooperate with any and all agency inquiries.""

Cantrell's campaign manager would not comment on the matter, the news outlet reported.

This controversy comes one month after Cantrell came under fire for using taxpayer money to purchase first-class plane tickets to Europe in January 2021. The mayor, who earns $188,000 annually, initially refused to reimburse the city for the $29,000 upgrade but eventually caved.

She claimed that her expensive travel accommodations were ""a matter of safety, not of luxury.""

""Anyone who wants to question how I protect myself just doesn't understand the world Black women walk in,"" Cantrell stated.

Cantrell, who had not hired security services from 2019 to the beginning of 2021, is stirring up controversy for recently spending more than $50,000 this year on bodyguard services only after bringing Officer Jeffrey Vappie onto her executive protection team in May 2021.

According to WVUE-DT, five months after hiring Vappie, Cantrell brought an officer with her for the first time on a trip to Scotland. For another trip, Cantrell brought Vappie as her security to Los Angeles, where the two attended a fundraising dinner with Brad Pitt at a Beverly Hills mansion.

""The timeline doesn't really make any sense,"" political analyst Robert Collins told WVUE-DT. ""So, the taxpayers are going to ask, 'OK, well, if you really need protection, why didn't you have protection on the earlier trips? Why don't you have protection when you're walking by yourself in the French Quarter? Why are you selectively choosing when to have a protective detail and when not to have a protective detail?'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dem-mayor-who-used-taxpayer-money-to-purchase-first-class-plane-tickets-to-europe-is-under-fire-again-for-spending-225000-on-security-services-and-personal-stylist,2022-11-18
Democracy doomsdayism: Rep. Clyburn repeats his usual election-cycle claim that the Democratic Party's failure means the end of democracy,"Every election cycle, House Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) becomes acutely aware that Democrats' failure to hold on to power might mean the end of democracy. On schedule, Clyburn has announced that ""democracy will be ended"" if Democrats do not secure a resounding victory on Tuesday.

A very German doomsday

Clyburn, the third highest-ranked Democrat in the House, previously stated that a Republican victory would be tantamount to the ""end of the world.""

Over the weekend, Clyburn told ""Fox News Sunday"" that he didn't mean to suggest a world-ending apocalypse was imminent, but rather that ""Democracy will be ending. The world would continue to exist.""

Democrat Rep Jim Clyburn Confronted Over Saying Republican Wins Mean ""End Of The World"" youtu.be

""The world was here before Hitler, the world was here after Hitler,"" Clyburn said, convinced there are parallels between the present political climate and German democracy ahead of the Hitlerian state socialists' rise to power.

Clyburn, on the ballot in South Carolina on November 8, added, ""The country is on track to repeat what happened in Germany, when it was the greatest democracy going, when it elected a chancellor that then co-opted the media.""

Clyburn favors the German parallels when denigrating his political rivals.

In July 2020, Clyburn accused the Trump administration of imposing ""Gestapo activities"" via federal police in Portland, Oregon, when cracking down on leftist terrorists. Clyburn suggested that the restoration of law and order sought by Trump was ""the beginning of the ending of this democracy.""

In 2019, Clyburn compared Trump to Hitler, claiming the former was one of ""the greatest threats to democracy in my lifetime.""

Although Democrats have long suggested their political misfortunes could only mean democracy is either broken or on its way out, the hyperbolic claim has been used extensively in recent weeks.

The Democrats' go-to conspiracy theory

Sky News host Rita Panahi noted over the weekend that while Democrats castigate Republicans and conservatives for advancing so-called (and often confirmed) ""conspiracy theories,"" they themselves peddle an incredibly destructive notion: that voters have but one choice, lest they intend to destroy American democracy.

Panahi said, ""It's clear that the Democrats from the president down are not interested in campaigning on consequential issues. ... No, they want to pretend that it's democracy itself that is on the ballot this election.""

'Democrats' propaganda arm' mimicking 'absurd narrative' that democracy is at stake youtu.be

Even Democrats find this rhetoric hollow.

Longtime Democratic consultant Hilary Rosen told CNN, ""We did not listen to voters in this election. And I think we're going to have a bad night. ... When voters tell you over and over and over again that they care mostly about the economy, listen to them. Stop talking about democracy being at stake.""

This round of democracy doomsayers



On Oct. 30 in Milwaukee, former President Barack Obama said that ""democracy is at stake in this election"" and threatened that if Republicans win on Nov. 8, ""there's no telling what might happen.""

Obama repeated this claim in Cleveland (""Democracy itself is on the ballot right now"") and in Laveen, Arizona.



Accordingly, it's not enough to vote on the issues or on the basis of individual candidates' platforms, but strictly on the basis of party affiliation.

Katie Dobbs, the Arizona Democrat gubernatorial candidate who refused to debate Kari Lake, made sure to clarify what the former president and other Democrats meant by democracy: ""Democracy is the system that sent Barack Obama to the White House, and democracy is the system that will send Kari Lake back to whatever dark corner of the internet she came from.""

Democracy, according to Hobbs, is that system by which Democrats attain and retain power.

On Nov. 1, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton appeared on MSNBC's ""The ReidOut"" with Joy Reid. Clinton did not use her air time to continue denying election results, but instead to suggest that entrusting power to Republicans ""is a real threat to the heart of democracy.""

According to Clinton, the way to surmount the nation's problems and to protect democracy is one-party control.

President Joe Biden similarly urged voters to ""preserve democracy [by voting Democrat] or put it at risk.""

Biden, who previously called Republicans a ""threat"" to the nation, claimed, ""American democracy is under attack ... We must vote knowing who we have been and what we're at risk of becoming. We must vote knowing what's at stake and not just the policy of the moment — but institutions that have held us together, as we've sought a more perfect union, are also at stake.""

On Sunday, the borderline octogenarian told an audience at St. Lawrence University that ""this is your generation's moment to defend [democracy]. To preserve it. To choose it.""

Washington Post columnist and Council on Foreign Relations fellow Max Boot wrote on Oct. 24 that the midterm elections ""are actually a referendum on whether you favor the continuation of democracy in America.""



Boot decried anyone who questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election while suggesting that there is only one morally legitimate outcome of the 2022 elections.

In an October interview with NBC News' Andrea Mitchell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated, ""Our democracy is at stake when you define democracy as integrity of the vote."" Pelosi used this line before.

When seeking to impeach former President Donald Trump, Pelosi said, ""Our democracy is what is at stake. The president leaves us no choice but to act.""

Previous rounds of democracy alarmism

The Hill reported that ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, former GOP mega-donor Seth Klarman told voters that they had to vote Democrat, stressing that ""democracy is at stake.""

According to Klarman, a failure to ""turn the House and Senate as a check on Donald Trump and his runaway presidency"" might amount to the end of democracy. The Republicans held the Senate, yet American democracy survived.

In August 2020, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) stressed that a failure to vote out former President Donald Trump could prove to be world-ending: ""The future of our democracy is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake. The future of our planet is at stake.""

That same month, Obama suggested that America couldn't withstand another four years of Trump, saying, ""Embrace your own responsibility as citizens – to make sure that the basic tenets of our democracy endure. Because that’s what is at stake right now. Our democracy.""

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in 2019 that Trump's rally jokes at Democrats' expense made it ""very clearer than ever that, literally, our democracy is at stake, our democracy at stake.""

When it came to Trump nominating a replacement for former Justice Anthony Kennedy, Pelosi said that Kennedy's successor ""could radically alter the course of American justice for decades. ... The future of our democracy is at stake.""

It's not just elections, judicial appointments, and jokes that Democrats claim put democracy at risk. Other perceived challenges to Democrats' hold on power are similarly democratic risks, such as a failure to regulate speech on social media.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democracy-doomsdayism-rep-clyburn-the-latest-democrat-to-suggest-that-his-partys-failure-means-the-end-of-democracy,2022-11-07
Democrat candidate in Arkansas arrested for allegedly making 'terroristic' threats,"A Democrat candidate for statewide office in Arkansas has been arrested for allegedly making terroristic threats.

On Friday, Diamond Arnold-Johnson, 32, who is currently running to be the state auditor of Arkansas, was arrested while she was conducting a Facebook Live stream. According to reports, she had an outstanding warrant for first-degree terroristic threatening, a Class D felony.

Max Brantley of the Arkansas Times reported that, two months ago, Arnold-Johnson's husband, Arick Johnson, 36, went on trial for terroristic threatening based on some unidentified Facebook messages that had been attributed to him. During court proceedings, his wife testified that she had been the one to make the threats, not her husband, resulting in his acquittal.

Her open court admission then prompted further investigation into the threats. Police obtained a warrant for her arrest and attempted to serve her on October 13, but Arnold-Johnson supposedly refused. Rather than ""escalate a non-violent situation"" for ""a non-violent warrant,"" several officers from the Little Rock Police Department decided to serve her again on Friday, when she briefly locked herself in a bathroom before eventually opening the door and cooperating with officers.

Arnold-Johnson was then booked in the Pulaski County jail on a $30,000 bond. It is unclear when she is expected appear in court.

Though accusations of a felony cannot prevent Arnold-Johnson from pursuing state office, a felony conviction would likely prevent her from holding office. Should Arnold-Johnson win the election in November and later be convicted of the charges, she would likely be removed from office and a successor would be appointed by the governor. Early voting in Arkansas began four days before her arrest.

The Democratic Party of Arkansas has already attempted to distance itself from Arnold-Johnson.

""Earlier today, we were made aware that Diamond Arnold-Johnson was arrested by Little Rock Police,"" the party said in a statement. ""Everyone has the right to due process; however, our Party firmly believes people must be held accountable for any criminal behavior, especially candidates for public office. The Democratic Party of Arkansas did not recruit her to run for Auditor of State, and we cannot bar her from running for this position. We remain focused on working for a better Arkansas and winning races across the state.""

At least one of Arnold-Johnson's political opponents has even called for her to drop out of the race.

""Anyone who has an active felony warrant for their arrest should not be running for office or handling the state's very important financial business,"" said Republican candidate Dennis Milligan. ""Rather, their time and energy would benefit more from focusing on their's (sic) and their spouse's legal morass.""

Libertarian candidate Simeon Snow, 37, expressed sympathy for Arnold-Johnson's family and friends, as well as confidence that voters will do their research and determine that he is the best candidate for the job.

In 2014, Arnold-Johnson pled guilty to misdemeanor carrying of a weapon and misdemeanor third-degree endangering the welfare of a minor. She was sentenced to probation.

"Democrat elected to Congress will be sworn in on a copy of 'Superman #1,' worth about $5.3 million","A Democrat who was elected to U.S. Congress in 2020 will be sworn in on various documents, including a copy of the first ""Superman"" comic book, which is worth about $5.3 million.

A journalist spotted the classic comic book among the many religious books and other documents over which members of Congress had chosen to take their oaths.

When the journalist inquired about the identity of the member, a congressional aide refused to say.

The mystery was solved when Robert Garcia, a Democrat from Long Beach, California, tweeted that he was the person who would be sworn in on the comic book.

""Will be proudly sworn-in to Congress on the U.S. Constitution. Underneath the Constitution will be 3 items that mean a lot to me personally,"" Garcia tweeted.

""A photo of my parents who I lost to covid, my citizenship certificate & an original Superman #1 from the @librarycongress,"" he added. Garcia has described himself as a comic book nerd.

Garcia is the first openly LGBTQ immigrant to be voted into the U.S. Congress. He was formerly the mayor of Long Beach from 2014 until he was elected for the 42nd district of California.

Both of his parents died from coronavirus complications in 2020. He and his family members immigrated to the U.S. from Lima, Peru, when he was 5 years old.

The comic book was first published in 1939, when it was sold for ten cents a copy. In 2022, a copy of that book sold for $5.3 million according to CGC, a grading company for comics.

""Superman #1"" is not, however, the first appearance of the superhero in comics. That distinction belongs to ""Action Comics #1,"" which was published in 1938. A copy of that comic book sold for $3.18 million in 2021.

Garcia says he plans to display various comic book images in his congressional office.

Democrat-sponsored gun buyback rejects 3D-printed 'ghost guns' despite federal rule,"On July 30 at the Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Houston, Democrat Mayor Sylvester Turner held a gun buyback event, which is said to have taken in around 150 guns. The city awarded gift cards to citizens who turned in their firearms. For a non-functioning firearm, a citizen received a $50 gift card; for a rifle or shotgun, the amount was $100; for a handgun, the amount was $150; and finally, for a fully automatic rifle, a gift card worth $200 was awarded.

Turner touted the exchange as a success and has two similar buyback events planned. However, not all firearms — like 62 of the 150 reportedly exchanged on July 30 — will be accepted at subsequent buybacks. Turner said that 3D-printed guns, also referred to as ""ghost guns,"" will be excluded the next time around.

One unnamed individual turned in 3D-printed guns in exchange for gift cards. He told Fox 26 that he exchanged 62 3D-printed guns, which each cost him approximately $3 to produce, and received $50 per firearm. He noted that ""The goal was not personal profit, but to send [Houston leaders] a message about spending 1 million tax dollars on something that has no evidence of any effect on crime…”

The $1 million figure the person referred to concerns the money Turner has set aside from the city’s $53 million federally funded “One Safe Houston” program for this gun buyback initiative.

Other 3D-printed handguns were, however, rejected.

Cody Wilson, the director of Ghost Guns, brought around 25 3D-printed firearms that each allegedly met the criteria for ""non-functioning firearm"" to the buyback. With the understanding that finished frames are receivers for the purposes of federal law, Wilson and other members of the Ghost Guns team produced and brought such parts, which took them only a few hours and cost ""mere dollars in plastic"" to make. Houston police refused to take them.

Wilson told TheBlaze that such gun buybacks call to mind to ""the apocryphal story of how the English Imperial Office tried to get rid of cobras in India,"" by placing a bounty on them. ""And supposedly people began to farm cobras."" In the case of gun buybacks, he suggested that one way to ""spoil liberal posturing"" would be to breed cobras or in this case 3D-print firearms for buybacks.

Wilson regards both law enforcement's and governments' acceptance of ghost guns and their rejection at these events as a win.

If accepted, entrepreneurial ghost-gun manufacturers can make some money. What's more, changes in definitions and in criteria incentivize innovation. ""If you think about it, it's like a technology challenge ... encouraging the advancement of the state of the art."" For instance, when lawmakers targeted polymer handgun parts, they ""created structural incentives for people to make ghost guns from rifles and rifle parts"" instead. Additionally, the attempt to pass off a 3D-printed firearm in light of the new exclusion forces private printers to improve quality.

If, on the other hand, ""they have to say they don't want 3D guns, then we say, 'well, how big a problem can they really be?'"" Wilson noted the disconnect at the event, where Houston police would have arrested 3D-gun manufacturers who had trunks full of firearms, despite having just been denied gift cards on the basis that the same items were not in fact guns.



On April 11, the Biden administration announced that the U.S. Department of Justice had issued a rule to “rein in the proliferation” of “ghost guns,” then defined as “unserialized, privately-made firearms.” The rule banned the business of manufacturing unserialized “buy build shoot” kits that individuals could use to assemble firearms without background checks. The rule further deems these kits “firearms” under the Gun Control Act.



This rule goes into effect August 24.



Wilson suggests that this rule and related efforts are tantamount to ""pure anarcho-tyranny. We know the only people that have the equipment in the hobby to make guns are good, law-abiding people. And this [rule] is meant to terrorize.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrat-gun-buyback-rejects-3d-printed-ghost-guns-despite-federal-rule,2022-08-08
"Democrat indicted in savage killing of Las Vegas journalist, ousted from office. Victim 'was willing to speak truth to power and it cost him his life.'","A Democrat was indicted for murder Thursday in the grisly slaying last month of a Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter and ousted from office.

What are the details?

Robert Telles, 45, allegedly ambushed and killed Jeff German ""willfully, unlawfully, with malice aforethought"" on Sept. 2 after German penned a series of investigative articles detailing the Democrat's alleged misconduct and unethical behavior as Clark County Public Administrator in Nevada.

Telles, removed from office by court order earlier this month, is said to have lost his primary election in June to fellow Democrat Rita Reid partly as a result of the victim's investigative reporting.

German had written about hostilities, inappropriate relations, and ""turmoil"" inside Telles' county office.

Rita Reid told the Daily Beast that German ""was willing to speak truth to power and it cost him his life.""

Telles responded to German on Twitter, writing via his now-deleted account: ""Typical bully. Can't take a pound of critism [sic] after slinging 100 pounds of BS. Up to article #4 now. You'd think he'd have better things to do.""

Prosecutors indicated that the video and DNA evidence they say implicates Telles in German's murder is overwhelming, suggesting it was the former politician who couldn't take criticism.

Telles, a gun-control advocate who had once written to U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) saying, ""There are folks on the other side that really want us at each other's throats,"" allegedly went to German's home and stabbed him multiple times.

If convicted, Telles may face the death penalty. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson has yet to announce whether or not he will be seeking that sentence.

Denied bail once again on Tuesday, Telles remains in custody at the Clark County Detention Center.

Silencing the press

A murder investigation began Sept. 3 after German's body was found outside his home, six miles away from Telles' residence. The Clark County coroner ruled German's death a homicide resulting from ""multiple sharp force injuries.""

Three days later, the Las Vegas Metro Police Department released images of a possible suspect carrying a bag and wearing a reflective orange shirt and a broad-brimmed straw hat. The LVMPD also revealed images of a maroon GMC Yukon Denali, which had been near the crime scene around the time of the murder.

LVMPD Sheriff Joe Lombardo indicated someone had been seen driving the vehicle ""suspiciously"" around the neighborhood and confirmed the suspect had used it to leave the area. The vehicle depicted was a maroon GMC Yukon Denali.

Cpt. Dori Koren later noted that the vehicle was registered to Telles' wife.

Man Found Deceased Outside of Home - Update-Photo of Suspect Vehicle youtu.be

The LVMP executed a search warrant on Sept. 7 at Telles' home and towed two vehicles, one of which was the GMC observed near the crime scene.

Telles arrived home at 2:20 p.m., hours after police had completed their search of his house.

Ignoring reporters' questions, he shut himself inside his garage wearing ""a white hazmat suit."" When a police officer knocked on the front door, Telles refused to answer.

When Telles wouldn't open the door to police, a Las Vegas Police Department SWAT team was dispatched, which then made the arrest. Telles was taken out of his house on a stretcher.

Misappropriated funds allegation

After his arrest, Telles was stripped of his administrator position by court order. In that position he had handled the funds of people who died without a will, some of which he is alleged to have mishandled or misappropriated, hence the Nevada Supreme Court's recent suspension of his law license.

It's not just clients whose money Telles may have have mishandled.

According to the Review-Journal, taxpayers are on the hook for Telles' legal fees despite the fact that he owns six properties in Nevada and Arkansas with at least $200,000 in equity, along with a Las Vegas home valued around $600,000.

While the accused murderer claimed in court Sept. 20 that he was indigent and was assigned two Clark County public defenders, the AP noted that Telles and his wife were making $20,500 per month prior to his arrest.

'Typical bully'

Telles' arrest in September wasn't his first.

He also was arrested for domestic violence and resisting arrest March 1, 2020. His wife, Mae Ismael, called police asking for help in light of her husband ""going crazy.""

Telles allegedly grabbed his wife by the neck and struck her as they drunkenly made their way home from Bellagio casino.

Bodycam footage of the arrest shows the former office holder in an apparent drunken state. He can be heard telling police, ""You guys just want to take me down because I'm a public official.""

While the domestic battery charge was later dismissed, Telles received a suspended 90-day sentence on the resisting arrest charge.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrat-indicted-in-savage-killing-of-las-vegas-journalist-ousted-from-office,2022-10-22
Democrat Katie Hobbs was a no-show at a Hispanic town hall where Kari Lake thrilled voters,"Arizona gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs (D) was a no-show at a town hall event hosted by Spanish-language media Wednesday, while her Republican opponent Kari Lake not only came to the event but was a hit with the crowd.

Lake spoke for more than an hour addressing questions on K-12 education, public safety, immigration. She received loud applause for her answers, all the while standing next to an empty podium that was reserved for Hobbs. One of the event organizers said that Hobbs, who currently serves as secretary of state for Arizona, declined an invitation to participate. Members of the audience booed upon learning that Hobbs would not appear alongside Lake.

The Democratic candidate has refused to participate in debates, calling her GOP opponent a 2020 election ""conspiracy theorist."" Hobbs campaign manager Nicole DeMont said in September any debate would give Lake the opportunity to ""just create another spectacle"" and that ""you can't debate a conspiracy theorist."" Those comments were made after the Hobbs campaign negotiated with the Citizens Clean Elections Commission to change a potential debate format into separate half-hour interviews with a moderator. The commission turned the campaign down, and since then there has been no agreement to have a debate.



Democratic strategists have begun to worry that Hobbs' refusal to debate and her comparative reluctance to do in-person campaign events will backfire with voters in what's considered a toss-up race. Whereas Lake organizes large rallies and speaks to reporters frequently, often to challenge their questions, Hobbs has run a quieter campaign with smaller gatherings and fewer press conferences.

""There's a lack of charisma,"" one anonymous Democratic strategist told ABC News on Wednesday. ""And I think it's a challenge on their end because they're not confident when they go out, so their response to that is to try and do as little publicly as possible and try to sail to the finish line. And the ramifications of that are not everybody seeing you be visible.""

The strategist, who requested anonymity to discuss the race frankly, said declining to debate Lake was a missed opportunity.

""Missing that was an error. I think a lot of the reasoning around that was 'oh, well, she's just gonna say crazy stuff anyway, let's not give her the platform,'"" the strategist said. ""But what happened with that was … voters missed out on seeing them next to each other, they missed out on seeing Hobbs be the adult in the room and Kari be bombastic.""

Meanwhile, Lake has taken the opportunities Hobbs has given her to accuse her Democratic opponent of ""hiding"" from voters. After Wednesday's town hall, the Lake campaign shared a photo of Hobbs' empty podium with the caption, ""They say a picture is worth a thousand words.""

""She does not have the courage to be on this stage,"" Lake said of Hobbs during the event. ""She says, 'I don't want to be there' and she says 'Kari's a conspiracy theorist.' Well, then, show up and call me out. I'm happy to have a dialogue.""

""I'll be honest. I don't like the idea of being on the stage with a twice-convicted racist, but this job is so important that we need to stand up here and debate these issues and tell the good people of this state what we plan to do for our citizens,"" Lake said, referring to a controversy involving the firing of an African-American policy adviser by the Arizona state Senate in 2015. Hobbs was the Democratic minority leader in the Senate at the time.

Talonya Adams was fired by the state Senate after complaining that she was paid less than her white colleagues. She filed and won two civil lawsuits against the Senate alleging sex and racial discrimination. Hobbs was not named as a defendant, but she and her chief of staff were called to testify in the cases. Adams was paid $300,000 in damages on Sept. 21, 2022.

It was inaccurate for Lake to say Hobbs was ""convicted"" in those civil cases, but Hobbs was not present at the event to defend herself.

""I wish, by the way, that my opponent were here,"" Lake said. ""The people here in the media, some are from national media, they never pin her down on where she stands.""

""The media chases after me,"" Lake continued. ""I always speak to the media, but she won't answer the questions. She won't answer the questions and she didn't have the courage to be here.""







The Hobbs campaign insists that its strategy will prevail in November.

""Arizonans are rejecting Kari Lake's extreme and dangerous positions that are so far outside the mainstream,"" campaign manager Nicole Demont said in a statement to ABC News on Wednesday. ""We're confident that sanity will beat chaos and Sec. Hobbs will be elected in November.""

Democrat county politician arrested in connection with brutal murder of journalist in Vegas,"A Democrat county official in Nevada, Rob Telles, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Wednesday in the grisly Friday slaying of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German. Telles had once written to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) ""There are folks on the other side that really want us at each other's throats.""

After police searched his house and seized his vehicles (one resembling that driven by the suspected killer), Telles reportedly went into his garage dressed in what appeared to be a white hazmat suit and shut the door. When he refused to answer to police, a Las Vegas Police Department SWAT team was dispatched, which then made the arrest. Telles was taken out of his house on a stretcher.

Clark County Public Administrator Robert Telles, an advocate for gun control and an avid Warren supporter, is said to have lost his primary election in June to fellow Democrat Rita Reid, partly as a result of the victim's investigative reporting.

Reid told the Daily Beast that German ""was willing to speak truth to power and it cost him his life.""

In a series of articles investigating allegations of misconduct and unethical behavior, German had detailed hostilities, inappropriate relations, and ""turmoil"" inside Telles' county office, citing ""allegations of emotional stress, bullying and favoritism leading to secret videotaping of the boss and a co-worker outside the office.""

Telles had repeatedly denied the allegations and took to Twitter to repudiate German.

German's body was found outside his home on Saturday, six miles away from Telles' house. The Clark County coroner ruled German's death a homicide resulting from ""multiple sharp force injuries.""



On September 5, the Las Vegas Metro Police Department released images of the suspect and his vehicle, noting they had ""been working non-stop to identify and apprehend"" the person responsible for German's killing. The images showed an individual in a reflective orange shirt and a broad-brimmed straw hat carrying a bag. The vehicle depicted was a maroon GMC Yukon Denali.

An investigation into German's murder prompted Las Vegas police to execute a search warrant at the home of Telles Wednesday morning. When conducting their search, police also shut down nearby roads.

At the Telles residence, police found and towed two vehicles, one of which was similar to the murder suspect's GMC. During their search, police also determined German's killing might have been related to the journalist's work exposing ""public wrongdoing."" German was reportedly planning a post-election follow-up story about Telles before he was cut down.

Telles arrived home at 2:20 p.m., hours after police had searched his house and towed his vehicle. Ignoring reporters' questions, he shut himself inside his garage wearing ""a white hazmat suit."" When an LVMPD police officer knocked on the front door, Telles refused to answer.

Las Vegas SWAT police soon arrived on the scene in armored vehicles. Footage of Telles being carried out of his house and into an ambulance circulated ahead of Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo's announcement d 6:30 p.m. that Telles had been arrested.

The LVMPD tweeted at 9:45 p.m. that the ""suspect in the homicide that occurred on September 2, 2022, has been taken into custody.""

The executive editor of German's paper, Glenn Cook, said, ""The arrest of Robert Telles is at once an enormous relief and an outrage. ... We are relieved Telles is in custody and outraged that a colleague appears to have been killed for reporting on an elected official.""



Cook noted further, ""Journalists can't do the important work our communities require if they are afraid a presentation of facts could lead to violent retribution."" After thanking Las Vegas police for taking swift action, Cook indicated ""the German family and Jeff's many friends can begin the process of mourning and honoring a great man and a brave reporter.""

Democratic Senate candidate has two convicted murderers on his campaign staff,"A Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate currently employs two convicted murderers on his campaign staff, according to government documents.

John Fetterman, the current lieutenant governor of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Democrat candidate vying for the Senate seat that Sen. Pat Toomey (R) will soon vacate, has on his campaign payroll Dennis and Lee Horton, two brothers convicted of murdering Samuel Alamo nearly 30 years ago.

In May 1993, the Horton brothers and co-conspirator Robert Leaf committed armed robbery at Filito's Bar in Philadelphia. During the execution of the robbery, three people were shot: Alamo, Luz Archello, and her daughter Luz Martinez.

After the Hortons and Leaf left the bar, a witness was able to give police a description of their getaway vehicle and a partial plate. The cops located the three men and the vehicle about a mile from the bar. Two guns were retrieved from the car, one of which was determined by forensics to be the rifle used in the shooting.

Alamo died from his injuries, but both Archello and Martinez survived and identified the three men as the robbers who had shot them. A third witness who was not injured in the robbery identified them as well.

The Hortons were convicted of second-degree murder, three counts of robbery, four counts of aggravated assault, conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of a crime and sentenced to life in prison. They served 27 years until December 2020, when the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons, led by Fetterman, voted unanimously to free them.

According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Fetterman had campaigned the board aggressively on behalf of the Hortons in particular, threatening to oppose current Democratic candidate for governor Josh Shapiro in the primary if he refused to vote to release them.

In February 2021, Gov. Tom Wolf (D) gave the Hortons and 11 other convicted murderers clemency and commuted their sentences to time served. Clemency reduces the sentences of convicted criminals, but does not exonerate them.

Dennis and Lee Horton, who have always maintained their innocence, now work for Fetterman's campaign. It is unclear when they joined the team.

Fetterman's Republican opponent, Dr. Mehmet Oz, has called for Fetterman to dismiss the Hortons from his staff because of their violent history.

""John Fetterman consistently puts murderers and other criminals ahead of Pennsylvania communities,"" said Brittany Yanick, a spokesman for Oz. ""John Fetterman’s even trying to hide his record from voters by running TV ads saying he’s tough on crime. His positions – including releasing one-third of inmates onto our streets – says otherwise as does the fact that he hired two convicted murderers on his campaign.

""If John Fetterman cared about Pennsylvania’s crime problem, he’d prove it by firing the convicted murderers he employs on his campaign,"" she added.

On Thursday, Oz issued a tweet thread about Fetterman's soft-on-crime approach and mentioned Samuel Alamo's name specifically.

The Fetterman campaign immediately fired back against the accusations.

""This smear is a sad and desperate attack from Dr. Oz’s shambolic campaign,"" a statement from Fetterman reads. ""Going after two campaign staffers is a new low for Dr. Oz. Dennis and Lee, who were wrongfully convicted, are two of the kindest, hardest working people I know — fighting for their release was one of the proudest moments of my career and I'm honored to have them on this team.""

""Does Dr. Oz believe that the wrongfully convicted should die in prison?"" the statement added. ""Does this man have any compassion? He’s making a predictable and fear mongering attack against two men who spent 27 years in prison for a crime they didn’t commit.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrat-senate-candidate-has-two-convicted-murderers-on-his-campaign-staff,2022-09-01
Democrat Tim Ryan calls for Americans to 'kill and confront' GOP 'extremist' movement,"Ohio Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Tim Ryan said Tuesday that Americans need to ""kill and confront"" what he asserted is an ""extremist"" movement within the Republican Party.

“The Democrats aren’t right on everything. And I’m willing to sit down and have conversations about how we can move out of this age of stupidity and into an age of reconciliation and reform,” Ryan said during an appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

""Some of those answers will come from Republicans, not the extremists that we are dealing with every single day, we’ve got to kill and confront that movement, but working with normal mainstream Republicans, that’s going to be really, really important,” he said.

His comments echo those of President Joe Biden, who came under fire earlier this month after delivering a speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia in which he insisted Donald Trump and ""MAGA Republicans"" are ""a threat to this country.""

""As I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault. We do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise,"" Biden said. ""There’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.""

The president's comments were denounced by Republicans, who accused him of demonizing the 70 million Americans who supported former President Trump in the 2020 presidential election. In the days following his address, Biden clarified that he does not believe most Trump voters are extremists, insisting he was only condemning Republican Party office-holders and elected representatives.

Biden said that those who would use violence for ""political purposes"" or those who refuse to accept the outcome of free and fair elections are the ones who threaten the country.



Ryan made his remarks Tuesday after highlighting his record as ""one of the most bipartisan members of Congress."" He has attempted to portray himself as a centrist in the race against Republican candidate J.D. Vance, a venture capitalist and best-selling author of ""Hillbilly Elegy."" Vance is endorsed by Trump



Polls show a tight race in Ohio, where Vance has led Ryan by an average of 2.3 percentage points over the last 30 days or so, according to RealClearPolitics. A USA Today Network Ohio and Suffolk University poll released Monday found Ryan leading Vance 46.6% to 45.6%, within the poll's 4.4 percentage point margin for error.

According to the poll, 54% of likely voters disapprove of President Joe Biden's job performance, while just 41.8% approve.



Ryan has distanced himself from the unpopular president, suggesting to a local radio station last week that Biden should not run for president in 2024 and that it is ""time for some generational change.""

Democratic whip Katherine Clark's son sprung from jail after allegedly assaulting Boston cop,"The ""non-binary"" son of the No. 2 Democrat in Congress has pleaded not guilty to various charges related to his apparent involvement in a recent bout of violent anti-police extremism.

Jared Dowell, 23, son of House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), was arrested Jan. 21 and charged with assault and battery on a Boston police officer inflicting serious bodily injury, vandalizing a historic monument, damaging property by tagging, and resisting arrest.

On Monday, he was arraigned in Boston Municipal Court and released on a $500 bond.

Dowell and his lawyers scurried out of court after he made his not-guilty plea, refusing to comment except on his preferred name and pronouns, which the court did not bother using, reported the Boston Globe.

TheBlaze previously reported that Boston police had responded to a scene of a leftist disturbance at the Parkman Bandstand Monument in the Boston Common Saturday night, where they allegedly found Democratic Whip Katherine Clark's son vandalizing the monument.

Dowell had allegedly defaced the monument, writing ""NO COP CITY"" and ""ACAB,"" the latter of which stands for ""all cops are bastards.""

The monument, constructed in 1908, was also tagged ""R.I.P. Tortuguita,"" referencing Manuel Teran, the leftist militant who shot a Georgia State Patrol trooper last week in the gut.

According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, officers gave verbal commands to the shooter, who had been trespassing near the new police training center in DeKalb County's South River Forest. Instead of complying, Teran reportedly fired multiple shots at officers without warning.

TheBlaze previously reported that officers answered back with a chorus of gunfire, killing the leftist gunman.

In response to the gunman's demise, the leftist website ""Scenes from the Atlanta Forest,"" whereon local leftists frequently coordinate and celebrate their attacks, published a post demanding retaliation.

""Consider this a call for reciprocal violence to be done to the police and their allies,"" the post said. ""Wherever you are, you are invited to participate in a night of rage in order to honor the memory of our fallen comrade.""

Dowell happened to be in Boston, reportedly in the company of roughly 20 other leftist thugs who were blocking traffic and making a scene.

Police were, however ready for them, having been on high alert ""for the possibility of an anti-law enforcement demonstration"" linked to the violent extremists in Georgia.

Officers intervened to arrest the son of the Democratic whip and restore order but in the process were reportedly swarmed by other leftist violators, some of whom attempted to interfere with Dowell's arrest.



Conservative radio talk-show host Howie Carr obtained a copy of Dowell's offense report, which indicated that police officers approached Dowell and commanded him to stop. As one officer, a former Marine, ""got close to Dowell he attempted to flee by violently flailing his arms, striking the Officer.""



""Officer Roca was observed ... to be bleeding from his nose and mouth due to the initial struggle with Dowell,"" said the report.

Despite Dowell's alleged attack on the police officer and a ""brief struggle,"" other officers were able to place him under arrest.

Clark's son will return to court for a pretrial hearing April 19.

Concerning her son's arrest, Clark, who previously suggested that House Republicans were ""extremists,"" tweeted, ""my daughter was arrested in Boston, Massachusetts. I love Riley, and this is a very difficult time in the cycle of joy and pain in parenting.""

Numerous Democrats call for an end to the filibuster to codify Roe v. Wade,"A chorus of Democratic congressional candidates and incumbent lawmakers are calling for an immediate end to the Senate filibuster and federal legislation that would codify abortion rights following a report that the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade.



On Monday night, Politico published what it said was a draft Supreme Court opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case concerning Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban. “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” the purported draft opinion by Alito states, referring to two landmark abortion rulings that created a constitutional right to kill preborn children in America.

Politico's report caused a political earthquake, with Republicans welcoming the news — but expressing concerns over the unprecedented leak of a Supreme Court majority opinion — and Democrats shrieking their outrage.

“If the report is accurate, the Supreme Court is poised to inflict the greatest restriction of rights in the past fifty years – not just on women but on all Americans,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. ""The Republican-appointed Justices’ reported votes to overturn Roe v. Wade would go down as an abomination, one of the worst and most damaging decisions in modern history.”

Many Democrats, including several candidates for U.S. Senate, called on the Democratic Senate majority to immediately end the legislative filibuster — a 60-vote requirement to end debate and pass major legislation. They also demanded that Congress pass legislation that would codify abortion rights in federal law, which would prevent state governments from enacting new pro-life laws restricting abortion in the post-Roe America.

""Let's be clear: The right to an abortion is sacred. Democrats have to act quickly to get rid of the filibuster to pass the Women's Health Protection Act + finally codify Roe into law,"" said Pennsylvania Lt. Governor John Fetterman, a candidate for Senate.

""Control of the Senate has never been more important: it's time to end the filibuster, pass the Women's Health Protection Act, and fight like hell to make sure all Ohio families are free to make these critical decisions without interference from politicians in Columbus or Washington,"" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), another Senate candidate.

Others echoed these demands, including Senate candidates in Missouri, Wisconsin, and other states, as well as numerous incumbent House lawmakers.

""Democrats need to end the filibuster, codify Roe, and defend reproductive freedom,"" said Wisconsin state treasurer and Democratic Senate candidate Sarah Godlewski.

""Congress must pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade as the law of the land in this country NOW. And if there aren’t 60 votes in the Senate to do it, and there are not, we must end the filibuster to pass it with 50 votes,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

""People elected Democrats precisely so we could lead in perilous moments like these- to codify Roe, hold corruption accountable, & have a President who uses his legal authority to break through Congressional gridlock on items from student debt to climate,"" added Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

But these demands are not realistic. The 50-50 Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate lacks the votes to end the filibuster because Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) are opposed to doing so. And Manchin, a pro-life Democrat, has already voted with Republicans to block legislation that would codify Roe.

There is no reason to believe Manchin is about to reverse his position after he has repeatedly refused to do so under enormous pressure from his colleagues.

President Joe Biden is aware of this, which is why in a statement released Tuesday, the president said that ""if the Court does overturn Roe, it will fall on our nation's elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman's right to choose. And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November.""

""At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice Senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law,"" Biden said.

"House Democrats and exiting impeachment Republicans pass Liz Cheney's bill, which allows voting 5 days after elections","On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed a bill to alter the 1887 Electoral Count Act. The so called ""Presidential Election Reform Act"" revises rules pertaining to the congressional certification of presidential elections, which some contend will benefit Democrats. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who lost her primary race in August and leaves office on January 3, along with Democrat Rep. Zoe Lofgren, both of whom are on the January 6 Committee.

The bill, as characterized by Cheney:

enacts new counting rules;

requires that Congress receive a single certificate from each state;

requires states to select electors under state laws prior to Election Day;

permits elections to be extended in the event of so-called ""catastrophic events""; and

prevents election officials from refusing to certify presidential elections.

Cheney suggested this bill ""will preserve the rule of law and defend election integrity.""

Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) issued a release on September 21, stating the bill does little to address election integrity, but serves instead to help House Democrats ""stack the democratic process in their favor"" as well as a ""partisan messaging bill intended to score cheap political points.""

Tenney suggested that the bill ""creates broad private rights of action in a backdoor effort to empower Democrat election lawyers and partisan operatives. ""

Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) concurred with Tenney and indicated that the bill serves a partisan purpose and has little to do with safeguarding elections. He told Axios earlier this week, ""It's clear that anything Liz Cheney touches is all about whacking Donald Trump and not about making meaningful changes.""



While Cheney has touted the bill as bipartisan, Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) suggested that saying so because she supports it is ""like me saying a bill is bipartisan because [Republican Rep.] Jeff Van Drew, who used to be a Democrat, is on it.""

Davis also noted that Democrats' criticisms of electoral objections were stained by hypocrisy, saying, ""Democrats have objected to every single Republican presidential win in the 21st century.""

The bill insists that the vice president's role in a presidential election is to count votes and that she does not wield the power to unilaterally reject certain state's electors.

Additionally, it requires objections to receive the support of one-third of each chamber to be heard, whereas previously it was sufficient to have only one lawmaker in each chamber support an objection.

According to Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), the bill ""hasn't gone through any committee"" and received no input from Republicans.

Extending elections

Among the changes this bill makes to the 135-year-old law is an extension of time for a presidential election.

In the event of a ""catastrophic event"" that has ""prevented a substantial portion of the State's electorate from casting a ballot on such day, or caused a substantial portion of ballots already cast to be destroyed or rendered unreadable by such event,"" a candidate for president who appears on the ballot of the State can ask for an extension.

One of the criteria that must be met is that ""the ability of that candidate to win the election with respect to one or more presidential electors"" must be shown to be potentially affected.

If the criteria are met, time for voting in the election can be extended, but for ""not later than 5 days after"" Election Day.

A ""catastrophic event"" may include a variety of events or mishaps, from a major glitch in a state's voting machine software to rolling blackouts.

Tenney stated that not only is the bill's definition of ""catastrophic event"" broad, but as a law it would trample ""on the core principle of state sovereignty and directly contradicts the United States Constitution.""

Support only from exiting Republicans

229 voted in favor of Cheney's bill, and 203 voted against it. Every Democrat supported the bill.

The nine (of 212) House Republicans who supported the bill are all leaving Congress after this session. Eight of them supported former President Donald Trump's second impeachment.

Besides Cheney, the Republicans who supported the bill were:

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), who loses his seat on January 3, 2023;

Rep. Peter Meijer (Mich.), who lost in the Republican primary on August 2;

Rep. Tom Rice (S.C.), who lost in the Republican primary on June 14;

Rep. Fred Upton (Wis.), who loses his seat on January 3;

Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (Wash.), who lost in the primary on August 2;

Rep. Chris Jacobs (N.Y.), who loses his seat on January 3;

Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (Ohio), who loses his seat on January 3; and

Rep. John Katko (N.Y.), who loses his seat on January 3.

Though the bill was passed, there is uncertainty over whether it will become law. After all, a comparable reform bill was introduced to the Senate in July, with ten co-sponsors from both parties.

Democrats demand Google purge pro-life pregnancy centers from search results,"Democratic lawmakers are demanding that Google remove pro-life pregnancy centers from search results when a pregnant woman searches online for an abortion clinic.



Thirteen senators and three members of the U.S. House, all Democrats, sent a letter to Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., Friday urging the company to remove ""fake clinics"" and crisis pregnancy centers from search results when people do a Google search for ""abortion clinic"" or ""abortion pill.""

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and Michigan Representative Elissa Slotkin were the top signatories on the letter, which was first reported by Reuters.

""Google should not be displaying anti-abortion fake clinics or crisis pregnancy centers in search results for users that are searching for an 'abortion clinic' or 'abortion pill,'"" the lawmakers wrote.

""If Google must continue showing these misleading results in search results and Google Maps, the results should, at the very least, be appropriately labeled,"" they said.

According to Reuters, the letter cited a recent study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a left-wing nonprofit. The study found that one in 10 Google search results for abortion services in so-called ""Trigger Law"" states led users to pro-life pregnancy centers, which the left-wing group dubbed ""fake clinics.""

Crisis pregnancy centers offer reproductive health services for women that can include free pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, STD testing and treatment, and counseling or therapy for mothers who need emotional support after giving birth or women who have had an abortion. Many of these organizations are operated by faith-based groups that do not provide abortion services.

Abortion rights activists have accused pro-life pregnancy centers of providing women with misinformation about abortions in an attempt to dissuade them from taking the lives of their unborn children. Pro-life groups deny this charge.



The CCDH study said that 11% of search results for ""abortion clinic near me"" and ""abortion pill"" in 13 Republican-led states that have passed laws that would ban abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade directed women to pro-life pregnancy centers instead of abortion clinics. This included 37% of Google Maps results.

""When people search for information or services relating to their sexual and reproductive health, Google is sending them to sites that users might expect contains robust, scientific, evidence-driven healthcare information – but they actually contain ideologically-driven opinion and misinformation,"" said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

“We have a right to expect that safety by design is a key consideration for any tech platform. If Google refuses to guarantee users’ right to good information, it will be up to lawmakers to step in to ensure that people aren’t harmed by Google’s negligence and greed.”

In recent weeks, pro-life pregnancy centers, faith-based groups, and churches across the country have come under attack from radical pro-abortion anarchists who have pledged to escalate violence unless these organizations shut down. The FBI said Friday it has opened investigations into these terrorist threats following at least 16 crimes, including firebombing and vandalism, allegedly committed by a group called Jane's Revenge.

Democrats want to prevent so-called insurrectionists from holding office — silent on whether BLM rioters will get a pass,"Democrat lawmakers across America appear keen to prevent those they have characterized or will one day characterize as insurrectionists from holding public office.

Whereas before, activists sought only to preclude a handful of individuals such as former President Donald Trump and former Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn (N.C.) from running on the basis of untried accusations, lawmakers in New York, Connecticut, and Virginia are now joining others in baking their Jan. 6 narrative into law, reported the Associated Press.

What are the details?

USA Today noted that the fear of sabotage from within government by Confederate remnants in the aftermath of the Civil War prompted Congress to include a disqualification clause in the Constitution.

Section 3 of the 14th Amendment bars rebels or insurrectionists from holding ""any office, civil or military, under the United States."" Congress may, however, per the provision, remove such a prohibition with a two-thirds vote of each House.

Congress did so in 1872, passing the Amnesty Act with more than the two-thirds of the vote, thereby removing ""all political disabilities imposed by the third section of the fourteenth article of amendments ... from all persons whomsoever.""

According to the University of Minnesota Law School's Constitutional Commentary, supermajorities in the Congress removed additional disabilities ""as a gesture of national unity"" in 1898.

Notwithstanding the Reconstruction-era amnesty, Fox 13 reported that Section 3 was invoked in 1919, when Congress barred socialist Victor K. Berger from occupying a seat in the House over his opposition to America's entry into World War 1.

Since this law is already enshrined in the Constitution, New York Republican Assemblyman and minority leader Will Barclay told the AP that Democrats were simply making a ""political statement.""

It is ""more political than it is a concern about public policy,"" Barclay added. The law in place ""should be sufficient.""

Prior to the having their House majority taken away from them by the American people, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and 40 other congressional Democrats introduced a bill in December that would make former President Donald J. Trump ""ineligible to again hold the office of President of the United States or to hold any office, civil or military, under the United States.""



The bill, which cited Section 3, suggested that Trump, who has not been convicted of such a crime, ""did engage in insurrection against the United States by mobilizing, inciting, and aiding those who attacked the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, to disrupt certification of the 2020 Presidential Election.""

Despite a dearth of eligible convicts, Democrats' list of forbidden candidates has outgrown just Trump.



Jordan Boyd, writing in the Federalist, noted, ""If you disagree with Democrats, you're an insurrectionist.""

The Associated Press reported that Republican state Sen. Cris Dush called out his Democratic peer Sen. Amanda Cappelletti for bandying about the accusatory term ""insurrection,"" noting that ""nobody has been charged with that. ... There's not been a single charge against any of those people as insurrectionists. In this committee, we are not using that term.""

Over 840 Jan. 6 protesters were arrested. As of this month, 185 have received their sentences. According to Time magazine, the median sentence has been 45 days. None yet have been charged with insurrection, despite the publication's liberal use of the term. The most serious charge leveled to date has been seditious conspiracy.

Without a conviction in their favor, partisan activists nevertheless attempted to have former Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn (N.C.) disqualified from running for reelection last year. Cawthorn noted in February 2022 that these efforts to chase convictions to further limit voters' choices might have ""major implications down the road.""

Cawthorn told ABC News, ""Running for political office is quintessential First Amendment activity and afforded great protection.""

He added that Section 3 is ""being used as a weapon by liberal Democrats to attempt to defeat our democracy by having state bureaucrats, rather than the People, choose who will represent North Carolina in Congress.""

""If you’ve tried to take down our government through violent means, in no way should you be part of it,"" said New York Sen. Brad Holyman-Sigal, whose state has seen its fair share of BLM and Antifa violence



Holyman-Sigal sponsored state Senate Bill S888, which states, ""No person shall be capable of holding a civil office who shall stand convicted"" of rebellion or insurrection.

The justification for the bill claims that ""at least two new elected representatives have been credibly accused of participating in the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021.""

The bill notes that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment applies to anyone who previously swore an oath to defend the Constitution, ""but it does not address candidates who have not yet taken an oath or affirmation.""

Trump, for instance, had sworn oaths long before telling protesters to ""go home"" and calling for peace, law, and order on Jan. 6. Consequently, he could be prevented from running for office in the state under this bill.

Connecticut state Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff introduced Senate Bill 244 on Jan. 17, which would ""provide that convicts of certain crimes shall permanently (1) forfeit their electoral rights and privileges, and (2) be prohibited from employment by the state or any political subdivision thereof.""



The crimes of concern: ""sedition, insurrection, rebellion or a felony in relation to any such act.""

TheBlaze reached out to state Sens. Holyman-Sigal and Duff inquiring whether, extra to the Jan. 6 protests they reference and have expressed concern about, politically charged BLM and Antifa violence might similarly preclude offenders from serving.

TheBlaze also asked whether the state senators feared their bills could be weaponized by partisan actors on either side of the spectrum to prevent potential political opponents from attaining political office.

Neither provided an answer prior to publication.

Even if such legislation were evenly applied to the Democrats' paramilitary allies as well, prosecutors would first have to be willing to possible convict leftist insurrectionists. If the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office's apparent refusal to try the supermajority of 2020 leftist rioters in Portland is any indication, equitable outcomes may be unlikely.

Democrats' plan to codify abortion through legislation is dead on arrival in Senate,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed Tuesday to bring legislation that legalizes abortion to a vote in the Senate. Unfortunately for pro-abortion lawmakers, the effort is already doomed to fail.

What are the details?

After a leaked opinion draft from Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito showed the Supreme Court has voted to overturn abortion precedents, Democratic lawmakers began calling for abortion to be codified into federal law.

""It is our intention for the Senate to hold a vote on legislation to codify the right to an abortion in law,"" Schumer said from the Senate floor.

However, the purpose of such a vote, Democratic Whip Senator Dick Durbin revealed, is actually more about political theatrics than legalizing abortion. ""More than anything we want to make sure every senator is on the record in terms of their position on Roe and on the decision of the court,"" Durbin admitted, Politico reported.

Still, to pass a law codifying abortion, Democrats would need 60 votes — or just 50 votes if the filibuster is abolished.

But unfortunately for Democrats, the moderate senators who have thus far refused to support abolishing the filibuster reiterated their positions on Tuesday.

What did those senators say?

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said, ""The filibuster is the only protection we have in democracy."" He did not comment specifically on the leaked opinion.

Meanwhile, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) also signaled that she will not support abolishing the filibuster, implicitly referring to the procedure and saying it has protected women's health.

""Protections in the Senate safeguarding against the erosion of women’s access to health care have been used half-a-dozen times in the past ten years, and are more important now than ever,"" Sinema said in a statement.

And a spokeswoman for Republican Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who recently introduced a bill to codify the Supreme Court's abortion precedents, told reporters that Collins' position on the filibuster has not changed in light of the leaked opinion draft.

""Senator Collins’ position on the filibuster is unchanged,"" said Anne Clark, a spokeswoman for Collins.

With a 50-50 split Senate and moderate lawmakers unwilling to abolish the filibuster, Democrats' attempt to save abortion will be dead on arrival.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-plan-codify-abortion-fail-filibuster,2022-05-03
Gov. Ron DeSantis responds to Trump's attack that he is guilty of 'grooming high school girls',"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) made it clear on Wednesday he is not interested in attacking his fellow Republicans.

The comments came in response to a reporter who asked DeSantis about former President Donald Trump's latest attack against him, in which Trump accused DeSantis of once ""grooming high school girls.""

What did DeSantis say?

DeSantis did not mention Trump by name. But he took an implicit shot at Trump by telling the media he is not interested in smearing other Republicans — unlike Trump.

""I spend my time delivering results for the people of Florida and fighting against Joe Biden. That's how I spend my time,"" DeSantis said Wednesday. ""I don't spend my time trying to smear other Republicans.""

The remarks prompted a loud applause from the crowd.

What prompted the response was a question from a reporter who connected Trump's baseless attack to a defamation panel that DeSantis hosted this week. He is advocating for legislation that protects ""Floridians from the life-altering ramifications that defamation from the media can cause for a person who does not have the means or the platform to defend himself.""

It was in that vein that DeSantis said, ""I face defamatory stuff every single day I’ve been governor, that’s just the nature of it.""

""It just goes with the territory. You gotta have a thick skin,"" he said.

What is the background?

While DeSantis has not announced a campaign for president, Trump has increasingly attacked the Florida governor because he knows that DeSantis is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. Polls repeatedly show DeSantis' primary and general election popularity.

But DeSantis has refused to engage in return attacks.

Instead, when reporters ask DeSantis about Trump's attacks, he reminds them that he, not Trump, wins elections — and by significant margins.

Desperate father begs prosecutors to keep underage son in jail after multiple accusations of carjacking. Prosecutors instead consider charging father with neglect.,"A desperate father says he has been ""begging"" the juvenile criminal justice system in Baltimore to keep his son, accused of multiple violent carjackings, in jail for his safety and the safety of others. Not only have his pleas fallen on deaf ears, Baltimore prosecutors even considered charging the father with neglect after he initially refused to pick his son up from jail.

On Tuesday, Santiago Garcia-Diaz joined Todd Piro of ""Fox & Friends First"" to discuss his son's dire situation. In the interview, Garcia-Diaz insisted that his son is a danger to himself and to society and that new laws regarding juvenile offenders may cost his son his life.

""I've been begging for help for my child for two and a half years,"" Garcia-Diaz told Piro. ""I've had petitions signed by judges to have him sent away for mental eval[uation]. I have no idea what else to do. Like, I've tried everything. I'm at the end of my wit. …What else does a father do to save his child's life?""

Bryce Garcia-Diaz, Santiago's 14- or 15-year-old son, was recently charged with a violent carjacking. According to reports, Bryce and a friend stole two cars and went on a high-speed chase, reaching speeds of up to 100 mph and weaving ""in and out of traffic."" Bryce also allegedly ran over two police officer during the incident.

""They was trying to barricade my son in,"" Garcia-Diaz claimed. ""Someone tried to stop and he took the gas and tried to drive right through [the officers], knocked them out of his shoes.""

Of the 19 charges Bryce was facing for the incident, 18 have since been dropped.

Fox News reported that Bryce is ""an accused serial carjacker,"" and Bryce had been arrested for at least one alleged carjacking in nearby Washington, D.C., though the date of that arrest is unknown. Garcia-Diaz said he even took Bryce to the police station himself after he believed his son had stolen a car, but that Bryce was issued only a citation.

Bryce did receive a sentence of six months of probation for another incident, but Garcia-Diaz claimed that Bryce had violated the terms of his probation on ""the first day.""

New Maryland laws regarding juveniles went into effect over the summer, and Garcia-Diaz stated that such laws actually encouraged his son's allegedly criminal behavior.

""As of June 1, they changed the laws for the juvenile justice system to where they can only be charged with certain crimes at certain times, and they got to go through so many steps before they can actually make a move to really do anything against the child now,"" Garcia-Diaz lamented.

""It's ridiculous,"" he added.

In addition to the alleged propensity for theft and violence, Garcia-Diaz claimed that his son suffers from a chronic lung condition and that frequent smoking and marijuana use nearly killed him when he accidentally overused his inhaler, the side effects of which severely affected his heart and lungs.

""The last time he disappeared for over a week, he came home, and we had to rush to the hospital,"" Garcia-Diaz recalled. ""And they said that if we wouldn't have brought him in, he would have been dead.""

Because Garcia-Diaz feared for his son's life and future, he refused to pick him up from jail for the most recent alleged carjacking, but officers threatened to charge him with neglect and abandonment instead if he did not pick Bryce up within six hours.

""I want my son to get some help. I mean, if it's jail that's what it's going to take, then jail,"" Garcia-Diaz insisted, though he also wants his son's mental health assessed. So far, he said, the system has created barriers that have prevented that assessment.

""This isn’t even about my son,"" Garcia-Diaz added. ""This is about Baltimore City's kids. This is about all juvenile delinquents.""

"'It was me or him': Gun owner stands his ground when man allegedly tries to break into home, pulls firearm","A Detroit homeowner fatally shot an armed man who allegedly tried to break into his residence early Tuesday morning.

What are the details?

Maiso Jackson awoke around 4:30 am on Tuesday to a man pounding on his door. According to Jackson, who spoke with WJBK-TV, the man was ""talking about how someone owed him money.""

""I said no one here owes you money,"" Jackson recounted. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

When the man refused to leave, Jackson called police — and that is when the situation escalated. Jackson said that after he dialed 911, the man broke a window in an apparent attempt to enter the property.

A doorbell camera captured the armed man standing outside Jackson's door.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Jackson then grabbed his firearm and confronted the man. Jackson has been a legal gun owner for the past eight years, taking lessons on how to properly use the firearm. Unfortunately, the would-be home-invader forced Jackson to exercise his Second Amendment rights.

""I came outside and said you have to leave, you can’t be doing this,"" Jackson told WJBK. ""So then he reached for his gun and pulled it out. I had to defend myself, I had to shoot him because of that.""

Jackson fired four shots at the man, hitting him in the chest and killing him.

""It was me or him at that point,"" Jackson told WJBK. ""I didn’t want to hurt nobody, but he just wouldn’t quit.

""You can’t help but defend yourself — you have no choice but to,"" he explained.

Was Jackson arrested?

Police detained Jackson and questioned him for several hours after the incident. However, police confirmed they released Jackson without filing criminal charges against him.

Ultimately, a decision regarding criminal charges is the responsibility of the prosecutor's office.

Jackson's actions appear to be legal under Michigan's stand your ground law.

""In Michigan, civilians have the right to stand their ground if they believe they are in grave danger. They can defend themselves and others if they believe that someone is going to cause them serious bodily harm, and they do not have a duty to retreat to safety or avoid conflict,"" explains Michigan attorney Daniel Hajji.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/detroit-homeowner-fatally-shoots-armed-man,2022-06-09
"American diplomats meet with Zelenskyy, agree to send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine","The U.S. agreed to provide the Ukrainian government with millions of dollars in military aid following a secretive meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and top U.S. diplomats on Sunday.

The New York Post reported that the diplomats announced President Joe Biden’s plans to nominate Bridget Brink as the American ambassador to Ukraine and that American diplomats will return to Ukraine this week after evacuating the country before the Russian invasion began.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy and told him that the U.S. would provide his country with more than $300 million in military financing. The American diplomats also approved a $165 million sale of ammunition not made in the U.S. that will be compatible with Ukraine’s Soviet-era weapons.

The U.S. will be providing a total of $713 million for foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries. Of this money, $322 million will go to Ukraine.

The rest of the money will be split between NATO member nations and other countries that have provided military supplies to Ukraine during the Russian invasion.

With this latest aid package, the U.S. government has provided Ukraine with $3.7 billion in assistance since the beginning of the war.

This past Thursday, Biden pledged to give an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine, including heavy artillery and drones.

As part of the $13.6 billion spending package approved by Congress last month to provide aid and relief to Ukraine and the country’s allies, the American legislative branch committed to spending a total of $6.5 billion in military assistance to Ukraine.

Zelenskyy has made repeated pleas for military assistance from the U.S. since the Russian invasion began.

Before meeting with Blinken and Austin, Zelenskyy said, “We will talk about the list of weapons that we need and the pace of its supply. In recent weeks, the pace, the number has all improved. I’m grateful for that.”

Sunday’s meeting was kept very secret, as American officials refused to confirm that Zelenskyy and the American diplomats would be meeting even after the Ukrainian president announced the summit the day before.

Journalists who traveled with the American diplomatic contingent were not permitted to cross the border into Ukraine or disclose the location of the meeting. They were also barred from reporting on the trip until after it had concluded.

Blinken currently plans to return to Washington from Poland, while Austin is planning to meet with NATO leaders in Germany.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/diplomats-blinken-military-aid,2022-04-25
"Disney exec who helped craft company's response to Florida's parental rights law quits after just 3 months, replaced by former political aide of Obama, Clinton, and Biden","The Walt Disney Company's Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Geoff Morrell is quitting the position after just three months, according to several reports.

After discussing the situation with Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Chapek, Morrell told his staff in an email that it has become ""clear"" that he is not the ""right fit"" for the position.

""After three months in this new role, it has become clear to me that for a number of reasons it is not the right fit,"" Morrell wrote to his Disney coworkers on Friday. ""After talking this over with Bob, I have decided to leave the company to pursue other opportunities.""



Taking over for Morrell and reporting directly to Chapek will be Kristina Schake – who was only hired by Disney earlier this month. Previously, Schake had served in the Obama administration as a special assistant to the president and communications director to the first lady. She was also the deputy communications director for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016. Most recently, Schake was appointed by President Joe Biden as the head of the federal government's national COVID-19 vaccine education campaign.

Morrell – who started at Disney on Jan. 24 – threw in the towel after he was thrust into the culture wars. Morrell helped craft the company's response to Disney's public objection to the Parental Rights in Education legislation.

Disney was lambasted by woke liberals for initially staying silent in regards to Florida's Parental Rights in Education legislation. However, the House of Mouse quickly bent the knee to the outrage mob and declared the company had ""disappointment and concern"" for the legislation that prohibits classroom instruction on ""sexual orientation or gender identity"" for grades kindergarten through third grade.

The entertainment behemoth that specializes in content for children went so far as to say the Parental Rights in Education bill ""should never have passed and should never have been signed into law"" by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R). The company vowed that it would attempt to repeal the law.

""Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that,"" the statement from Disney said. ""We are dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.""

DeSantis recently stripped Disney of self-governing privileges and special tax status that the company had enjoyed for 55 years.

Earlier this month, Disney was named ""the worst-performing Dow stock over the past year.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/disney-executive-quits-parental-rights-florida,2022-04-30
"Disturbed woman bites fellow passenger, attempts to open plane door during Southwest flight because 'Jesus told her to': Report","A Southwest flight had to be diverted over the weekend when a disturbed woman allegedly attempted to open an aircraft door mid-flight and then bit a passenger who tried to stop her.

According to reports, Elom Agbegninou, 34, was on a Southwest flight from Houston to Columbus, Ohio, Saturday afternoon when she began exhibiting disturbing behavior. While the plane was at approximately 37,000 feet, Agbegninou supposedly walked to the back of the plane and ""stared"" at an exit door. Flight attendants then instructed her either to use the area restroom or return to her seat, but Agbegninou allegedly refused and instead attempted to open the exit door.

At that moment, a fellow passenger tackled Agbegninou and attempted to restrain her, and Agbegninou reportedly responded by biting the passenger in the right thigh. Court documents indicate that she bit the person with so much force that the passenger ""worked their fingers up to (her) jawline in an attempt to have (her) release the bite, which she eventually did.""

Agbegninou then began hitting her head against the plane floor and insisted that ""Jesus told her to fly to Ohio and Jesus told her to open the door,"" according to court documents.

Southwest passenger claimed ‘Jesus told her’ to open plane door mid-flight, docs say nypost.com

The flight ultimately had to be diverted to Little Rock, Arkansas, where Agbegninou was removed and detained by federal authorities.

The passenger she supposedly bit was likewise removed from the plane and taken to a nearby hospital, where he or she received antibiotics and a hepatitis shot to ward off possible infection. The passenger — whose name, age, and gender have not been released — is said to be a military veteran who has experienced episodes of PTSD and anxiety since the incident and has reached out to a veteran hotline for help as a result.

When questioned, Agbegninou told investigators that she left her home alone, without luggage, and without informing her husband. She said she intended to visit a pastor friend in Maryland. She also supposedly admitted to trying to open the plane door and biting the passenger.

DOD turns down far-left DC mayor's request for help with illegals bused into her sanctuary city,"On August 5, the Department of Defense denied D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's request for the National Guard to help her with the thousands of illegal aliens that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has bused into the city since April.

Kelly Bulliner Holly, the executive secretary of the DOD, responded to Bowser's July 19 letter to the office of Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin, writing: ""After careful consideration the Department has concluded it cannot fulfill your request.""

Holly highlighted the fact that the city already has access to federal funding through SAMU First Response, a non-governmental organization that has itself received funding via the Emergency Food and Shelter Program by FEMA. Responding to the language of Bowser's request that the influx of over 4,000 illegals constitutes a ""humanitarian crisis,"" Holly noted that SAMU First Response ""supplements funding for humanitarian relief efforts by government and social service organizations for the purposes of providing shelter and supportive services to families and individuals.""

In 2016, Bowser asserted that D.C. was a sanctuary city: ""We celebrate our diversity and respect all DC residents no matter their immigration status.""

Bowser's perceived inconsistency now in light of her concern over the recent influx of illegals has been the subject of some ridicule online in recent days.

While Breanna Morello suggested that the request for support by the National Guard might be tantamount to bigotry, Paul Szypula intimated that Bowser might be prejudiced against foreign nationals.

Abbott's office recently suggested to the D.C. mayor that this ""crisis"" is only a fraction of the disaster"" unfolding at the southern border.

In April, Abbott — whom Bowser has since accused of engaging in ""cruel political gamesmanship"" — said of his campaign to send illegals to D.C.: ""What better place for them to go to than ... closer to the people making these policies that are allowing people to come across the border illegally?""

On August 4, one day prior to the DOD's denial of additional help, Abbott warned that there are ""more buses on the way.""



Texas has allegedly sent more than 6,500 immigrants to D.C. and is now in the process of sending illegal aliens from the border to New York City.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dod-turns-down-bowsers-request-for-help-with-illegals,2022-08-05
"DOJ releases picture showing 'top secret' docs on Trump's office floor, says he isn't entitled to special master review","The Justice Department formally asked a federal judge to refuse former President Donald Trump's request to appoint a special master to review the documents that FBI agents seized from Mar-a-Lago.

What did Trump request?

Trump wants a special master to review the seized documents for potentially privileged information.

Over the weekend, U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon signaled that she was leaning toward granting Trump's request by announcing the court's ""preliminary intent to appoint a special master.""

But what did the DOJ say?

Government attorneys argued in a court filing late Tuesday that granting Trump's request would ""significantly harm important governmental interests, including national security interests.""

The filing explains:

In any event, the government’s filter team has already completed its work of segregating any seized materials that are potentially subject to attorney-client privilege, and the government’s investigative team has already reviewed all of the remaining materials, including any that are potentially subject to claims of executive privilege.

Further, a special master review ""would impede the Intelligence Community from conducting its ongoing review of the national security risk that improper storage of these highly sensitive materials may have caused and from identifying measures to rectify or mitigate any damage that improper storage caused,"" the government claimed.

The filing also contained new details, including how many classified documents were found in the search at Mar-a-Lago.

The government claims that multiple classified documents were located in desks inside Trump's office and that more than 100 classified documents in more than one dozen other containers were discovered in the residence.

According to the filing, the classification levels of the seized documents ranged from ""confidential"" to ""top secret."" Some of the documents ""included additional sensitive compartments that signify very limited distribution,"" the court filing said.

In fact, government attorneys explained that some documents were so highly classified that ""even the FBI counterintelligence personnel and DOJ attorneys conducting the review required additional clearances before they were permitted to review certain documents.""

Government attorneys further argued the search of Mar-a-Lago was necessary because of credible evidence that ""efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government’s investigation."" This, the government explained, happened after Trump's legal team certified under oath they had returned all documents the government sought.

What happens now?

Cannon will rule on Trump's request at a hearing on Thursday.

Trump's attorneys will have the opportunity to respond to the Justice Department's filing on Wednesday, ahead of the hearing.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/doj-filing-special-master-response,2022-08-31
Biden's DOJ refuses to cooperate with congressional investigation into classified docs scandal,"The Justice Department is refusing to cooperate with a congressional oversight investigation into President Joe Biden's classified documents scandal.

What is the background?

Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jim Jordan sent the Justice Department a letter on Jan. 13 requesting documents related the scandal.

Jordan announced his probe on Jan. 13, one day after Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed former U.S. attorney Robert Hur as special counsel to investigate Biden. Specifically, Jordan wants all documents and communications related to the investigation.

""It is unclear when the Department first came to learn about the existence of these documents, and whether it actively concealed this information from the public on the eve of the 2022 elections,"" Jordan wrote in his letter. ""It is also unclear what interactions, if any, the Department had with President Biden or his representatives about his mishandling of classified material. The Department’s actions here appear to depart from how it acted in similar circumstances.""

How did the DOJ respond?

In a letter on Monday, Assistant Attorney General Carlos Felipe Uriarte told Jordan the DOJ will not hand over any of the requested materials for congressional oversight.

""Disclosures to Congress about active investigations risk jeopardizing those investigations and creating the appearance that Congress may be exerting improper political pressure or attempting to influence Department decisions in certain cases,"" Uriarte wrote.

""Judgments about whether and how to pursue a matter are, and must remain, the exclusive responsibility of the Department,"" he asserted.

To divulge information related to the DOJ's ongoing special counsel investigation would, according to Uriarte, violate ""longstanding policy.""

""Disclosing non-public information about ongoing investigations could violate statutory requirements or court orders, reveal road maps of our investigations, and interfere with the Department’s ability to gather facts, interview witnesses, and bring criminal prosecutions where warranted,"" he said.

How did Jordan respond?

Russell Dye, a spokesman for Jordan, said the decision indicates the DOJ is ""playing politics.""

""It's concerning, to say the least, that the Department is more interested in playing politics than cooperating,"" Dye said, CNN reported.

Meanwhile, Jordan disclosed last week that he was ""definitely looking at asking for documents via subpoena,"" but said at the time he was only considering it. Perhaps the DOJ's refusal to cooperate with his investigation has made his decision easier.

DOJ asks judge to keep Mar-a-Lago affidavit sealed to preserve its ongoing criminal investigation,"The Department of Justice asked a judge to keep the affidavit sealed for the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago in order to preserve an ongoing criminal investigation.

The development comes during a national debate over whether the FBI search at the residence of former President Donald Trump was a justifiable law enforcement action or if it was inappropriately motivated by politics.

“Disclosure of the government’s affidavit at this stage would also likely chill future cooperation by witnesses whose assistance may be sought as this investigation progresses, as well as in other high-profile investigations,” the Justice Department argued.

“The fact that this investigation implicates highly classified materials further underscores the need to protect the integrity of the investigation and exacerbates the potential harm if information is disclosed to the public prematurely or improperly,” they added.

CNN, the Washington Post, NBC News and various other news organizations have asked for the affidavit to be unsealed.

The Department of Justice added that unsealing the affidavit could “cause significant and irreparable damage to this ongoing criminal investigation.”

Law expert Neal Katyal tweeted his approval of the request from the DOJ.

""DOJ is appropriately resisting disclosure of the Mar A Lago search affidavit because it will compromise their ongoing investigation,"" Katyal wrote. ""This is very standard and right. That said, what they said -- especially about witnesses -- will invariably drive Trump to be even more worried.""

Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, said that the request was a ""cover up"" in a statement on Twitter.

""Biden DOJ refuses @JudicialWatch court request to release affidavit used to justify warrant for sham raid on Trump's home,"" he tweeted.

Trump has blasted the search at his home and accused the Biden administration of corrupting the law enforcement powers of the executive branch for the sake of political expedience.

On Friday, a judge unsealed the search warrant and property receipt for the search and revealed that 11 sets of classified documents had been removed from Mar-a-Lago.

Justice Dept. sues Republican Arizona governor over shipping container border wall,"The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey over his order to pile up shipping containers at the border to create a wall and deter illegal migrant crossings.

Ducey began filling gaps in the border wall with shipping containers stacked on top of each other in August. The Department of Justice objected to the policy, and Ducey filed a lawsuit in October to keep the container wall in place.

“Arizona is taking action to protest on behalf of our citizens,"" he said at the time. ""With this lawsuit, we’re pushing back against efforts by federal bureaucrats to reverse the progress we’ve made. The safety and security of Arizona and its citizens must not be ignored. Arizona is going to do the job that Joe Biden refuses to do — secure the border in any way we can. We’re not backing down.”

On Wednesday, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in an Arizona district court accusing the state government of acting unconstitutionally.

""Officials from Reclamation and the Forest Service have notified Arizona that it is trespassing on federal lands,"" the lawsuit said. ""Not only has Arizona refused to halt its trespasses and remove the shipping containers from federal lands, but it has indicated that it will continue to trespass on federal lands and install additional shipping containers.""

The government also argued that Ducey is violating the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which says that federal laws take precedence over state laws when there's a conflict between the two.

Ducey has said that the state has stacked about 130 shipping containers along 3,820 linear feet.

On Wednesday, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said California was in a fiscal crisis over the number of illegal immigrants who had been sent to the state by the federal government.

"DOJ wants Steve Bannon locked up for 6 months and fined $200,000","Steve Bannon, former Trump adviser and host of the ""War Room"" podcast, was found guilty of two charges of contempt of Congress by a federal jury on July 22. He reportedly refused to comply with a subpoena issued by the Jan. 6 select committee investigating the 2021 Capitol protests. On Monday, the Department of Justice recommended that Bannon be sentenced to prison for six months and hit with a $200,000 fine.

The DOJ's sentencing memorandum, filed on October 17, accused Bannon of pursuing ""a bad-faith strategy of defiance and contempt,"" claiming he ""flouted the [Jan. 6] Committee's authority and ignored the subpoena's demands.""

""For his sustained, bad-faith contempt of Congress, the Defendant should be sentenced to six months' imprisonment—the top end of the Sentencing Guidelines’ range—and fined $200,000—based on his insistence on paying the maximum fine rather than cooperate with the Probation Office’s routine pre-sentencing financial investigation,"" read the recommendation.

The DOJ also accused Bannon of employing ""hyperbolic and sometimes violent rhetoric to disparage the Committee's investigation, personally attack the Committee's members, and ridicule the criminal justice system,"" characterizing the 68-year-old's criticisms of the committee as ""attacks.""

Among Bannon's comments cited as so-called attacks was the statement: ""This is going to be the misdemeanor from hell for Merrick Garland, Nancy Pelosi, and Joe Biden. Joe Biden ordered Merrick Garland to prosecute me from the White House lawn when he got off of Marine One.""

It not clear whether it too qualifies as an ""attack,"" but Bannon's lawyer said at the time: ""There is nothing about this case that reflects the pursuit of the equal justice under the law. This thing was a scam from the beginning. The committee that was convened here was convened exclusively of people who have made pre-judgements and announced them publicly. The chair of the committee sued President Trump personally.""

The memorandum listed a number of instances of ""menacing rhetoric aimed at the Committee's investigation and its membership,"" including Bannon:

urging listeners on a July 12 episode of his podcast to pray for ""our enemies"" because ""we're going medieval on these people"";



calling Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the Jan 6. committee chair, ""gutless,"" insinuating he was not ""man enough"" to appear in court;

referring to Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) as ""Fang Fang Swalwell"" — an allusion to Swalwell's affair with alleged Chinese communist spy Christine Fang; and

deeming the committee's work a ""show trial,"" likening it to ""the Moscow show trial of the 1930s.""

""By flouting the Select Committee's subpoena and its authority, the Defendant exacerbated the assault,"" noted U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves, referencing the protest at the Capitol on January 6.

After hearing his guilty verdict in July, Bannon appeared on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" where he said, ""If I go to jail, I go to jail. I will never back off. ... I support Trump and the Constitution, and I'm not backing off one inch.""

He noted there was also a long appeals process ahead and suggested both that ""the law is with us"" and that his case might be ""adjudicated ... higher than the appellate courts.""

Bannon also warned Carlson's audience that ""they're coming for everybody. ... This is an ideological war and we cannot lose. The fate of the country is over the next couple years.""

Bannon will be sentenced on October 21.

Two-tier justice?

Whereas Bannon may see the inside of a jail cell for defying a subpoena, other high-profile political figures on the left have avoided consequence in the face of far more substantial accusations.

In September 2016, Bryan Pagliano, a State Department IT specialist who was paid off the books to set up former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private server, ignored a subpoena to appear before a House committee hearing concerning the FBI's investigation into Clinton's improper storage of classified material.

Despite every Democrat member on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform voting in opposition, Pagliano was held in contempt for refusing to testify. The contempt charges went nowhere.

When subpoenaed for additional documents pertinent to a congressional investigation of the Benghazi terrorist attacks, Clinton notified the committee she had ""wipe[d] her server clean."" She similarly did not see prison time for defying a subpoena.

Former Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner was held in contempt of Congress after she refused to testify at congressional panel hearings related to the Obama administration's political weaponization of the IRS against conservative groups. Again, all Democrats present voted in opposition.

Then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) indicated the decision whether to arrest Lerner was up to then-Attorney General Eric Holder. The DOJ ultimately did not charge Lerner with criminal contempt and she did not, as a consequence, go to jail.

Holder had himself been previously held in contempt of Congress. He was found to have misled Congress on its investigation of the Obama administration's arming of terroristic Mexican cartels via an operation called ""Fast and Furious."" Holder did not go to jail.

The Obama White House ""all but refused"" to turn over documents subpoenaed by congressional Republicans concerning the bankrupt solar firm Solyndra, which received a half-billion-dollar federal loan. There was little consequence.

Besides the inconsistency in outcomes for persons held in contempt of Congress, ostensibly along partisan lines, others have noted a broader imbalance in the tack taken by the DOJ.

Brigitte Gabriel, the founder of Act for America, noted that the DOJ wanted Bannon in jail but wasn't so keen to incarcerate violent BLM rioters.

Mark Hemingway of RealClearInvestigations suggested that ""justifiable or not ... sending Bannon in jail for refusing to testify to J6 committee seems like something that's going to further cement the growing idea on the right that DOJ is an instrument of political persecution.""

Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) tweeted that the DOJ ""has become politicized and is no longer serving justice in good faith.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/doj-wants-steve-bannon-locked-up-for-6-months-and-fined-for-200000,2022-10-17
"Donations pour in for 6-year-old boy who was severely burned in horrific bullying attack: 'Mommy, they lit me on fire!'","A 6-year-old Connecticut boy has been hospitalized with second- and third-degree burns after a bully reportedly doused a tennis ball with gasoline, lit it on fire, and threw it at his face.

A GoFundMe to benefit the child and his family has received more than $121,000 in donations at the time of this reporting.

What are the details?

According to a Wednesday report from WNBC-TV, 6-year-old Dominick Krankall was playing in his family's backyard when a neighborhood child called him to another area of the yard and around a corner.

Moments later, Dominick was said to come flying around the corner while screaming, ""Mommy, they lit me on fire!""

Dominick's sister, Kayla Deegan, said that the child — an unnamed 8-year-old — attacked Dominick with no warning.

""What he did was pour gasoline on a tennis ball, took a lighter, lit it up, and just chucked it right at my brother's face, and then ran away from him and watched him burn,"" she told the station.

Dominick — who was left with horrific burns to his face and legs — was rushed to a local hospital for treatment. Despite the child's grievous injuries, hospital officials said that the child is expected to recover.

The Bridgeport Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security said that up to four unattended children were seen playing with gasoline and lighting objects on fire the day of the incident.

No arrests have been announced at the time of this reporting, and authorities continue to investigate what led up to the incident.

Deegan said that her brother has tangled with the bully in question once before.

“Two months ago under the bully’s mother’s supervision, he was pushed into a wall and fell to the floor,"" she said. ""And again, the mother refuses to admit her kid did it ... It’s heartbreaking, it’s sickening to know the family. There’s nothing being done about this. This needs to be seen everywhere so everyone knows Dom’s story and what he had to go through.”

Dominick's mother, Maria Rua, suggested that her son is lucky to be alive.

“My son has been bullied by this child for a year,"" Rua told WTNH-TV. ""That day, they purposefully threw a gasoline-saturated ball that they lit on fire at my son’s face. They called his name so he would turn around.""

She added, ""They threw it at Dominick and left him outside alone to die.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dominick-krankall-burned-bullying-attack,2022-04-27
Don Lemon stuns CNN co-hosts when he rejects feminist narrative on soccer athletes' earnings,"CNN host Don Lemon appeared to stun his co-hosts when he refused to toe the line on whether systemic misogyny was the reason for a discrepancy in earnings between members of the male and female U.S. soccer teams.

Lemon was discussing the issue with co-hosts Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins when he said simply that men's sports deserve higher earnings because people are more interested in them than in women's sports.

""If there is more interest in a men's sport, the businesspeople, the people who make money off of sports, will put that on television because we live in a capitalist society,"" Lemon argued.

""And if people were interested in that, then there would be more attention and more money would be paid. So it's about the money,"" he added, referring to women's sports.

Collins disagreed and argued that men's sports were given an advantage over women's sports because they received more marketing and support in the media.

""If they had both started at the exact same point, and they both received the same amount of marketing and promotion and all that stuff, and then we got to where we are today, that would be a different point,"" Collins said.

Lemon pushed back on that point.

""I respect your point, and I hear what you're saying, I don't believe that's accurate,"" he replied.

""We live in a capitalist society, and if people can make money off whatever it is, they are going to exploit it,"" Lemon said. ""And there is a reason, and I'm sure it's part of what you are saying and it's part of what you're saying, and these are conversations that we need to have, but i just think we are lying to ourselves if we believe that someone cannot sit here and speak the truth to what we're talking about.""

Harlow made the argument that there is far more growth in interest in women's sports than there is in men's sports, but Lemon was unimpressed with the point.

CNN is undergoing a massive makeover as CEO Chris Licht has implemented layoffs in an effort to remake the ailing cable news channel.

'Don't make me kill you — because I will': Military vet holds armed police chase suspect at gunpoint until cops arrive,"A military veteran held an armed police chase suspect at gunpoint earlier this week in College Park, Georgia, until cops arrived and told the alleged perp, ""Don't make me kill you — because I will,"" WAGA-TV reported.

What happened?

Security cameras at Feeding GA Families — a food bank — caught the moment Monday evening when a volunteer rushed into the break room and told manager William Joyner that someone had just crossed through the parking lot with a gun, the station said.

Joyner is an Army veteran, and he knew exactly what to do, WAGA said.

The station said he grabbed his gun, chambered it, and went outside.

It wasn't long before he caught up to individual in question.

""I told him to go to the ground, the police are on their way — 'just go to your knees with your hands up,'"" Joyner recounted to WAGA.

Image source: WAGA-TV video screenshot

Joyner said the suspect — later identified by police as 20-year-old Jordan Shelley — refused to show him one of his hands, the station reported.

""The whole time his hand was sliding down toward the gun,"" Joyner explained to WAGA. ""I was telling him, 'Don’t make me kill you, because I will.'""



Fortunately a College Park police officer arrived on the scene before things escalated further, the station said.

What else do we know?

Police told WAGA that Shelley — as well as 21-year-old James Green — fled from police in a stolen car on Roosevelt Highway just before 5 p.m. Monday.

They wrecked the vehicle near Herschel Road, taking out a bus stop in the process, the station said.

Officers quickly got Green, WAGA said, but Shelley took off across train tracks on to West Point Avenue and then into Feeding GA Families’ parking lot.

"Doocy doesn't beat around the bush, bluntly asks press sec whether Biden is 'weaponizing' DOJ: 'That’s a yes or no'","The White House is refusing to answer accusations that the Biden administration has weaponized the Justice Department.

Republicans levied the charge after the FBI raided Mar-a-Lago in search of purportedly classified documents and other items related to the Presidential Records Act.

Trump's attorneys and others, like former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, have postulated the aggressive nature of the raid suggests the Justice Department is after Trump for something else.

What did the WH say?

At the daily press briefing on Tuesday, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre about former President Donald Trump, asking whether President Joe Biden considers him a ""political rival.""

But when Jean-Pierre refused to address Trump, Doocy got right down to brass tacks.

""Is this White House weaponizing the Justice Department and the FBI against political opponents?"" Doocy asked.

Jean-Pierre, however, refused to directly answer the question, so Doocy asked again in unequivocal terms. But Jean-Pierre again refused to provide a direct answer.

""Peter, the president believes in the rule of law. The president believes in the independence of the Department of Justice,"" she responded.

""That’s a yes or no,"" Doocy shot back.

""It's a yes-no for you. I’m answering the question. You may not like it, but I’m answering the question,"" Jean-Pierre responded as she and Doocy talked over one another.

""I’m telling you that we are not going to comment on a criminal investigation,"" she continued. ""The president has been very clear. I laid out what his thoughts were back on Jan. 7 in 2021, about how he saw the Department of Justice. And I’m just going to leave it there. We’re not going to comment from here, from this White House, on a criminal investigation that is currently happening.""

Later in the briefing, Jean-Pierre said Biden and the White House did not have advance notice about the raid.

""[Biden] learned about it, really, like all of us did. I’m sure maybe someone on his team flagged it for him, but he was not aware,"" she said.

""What I can tell you definitively and for sure: He was not aware of this,"" she added. ""He was — we were — nobody in the White House was.

Peter Doocy confronts WH point-blank on allegations that Biden 'lied' about involvement in Hunter's business 'schemes',"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused on Tuesday to answer whether President Joe Biden has ""lied"" about his involvement, or lack thereof, with the various business operations of his family.

Shortly after winning a majority in the House, Republicans promised oversight investigations into Biden and his family.

Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), who will become chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said the inquiry will investigate whether Biden was ""directly involved with Hunter Biden's business deals"" and thus whether he is ""compromised."" House Republicans have previously alleged that Biden ""personally participated in"" Hunter's business dealings.

What did KJP say?

At the White House press briefing, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy wasted no time asking about House Republicans' investigation — and whether Biden is lying.

""[The House Oversight Committee] claim to have evidence that Joe Biden lied to the American people about his involvement in his family's business schemes. Did he?"" Doocy asked.

But instead of answering the question, Jean-Pierre attacked Republicans for conducting oversight.

""I have said this before and I’ll say it again: House Republicans promised that fighting inflation during the midterms was going to be their No. 1 priority,"" she responded. ""But instead, what they're doing is wanting to do an investigation on the president and his family.""

She also claimed the midterm elections demonstrated the American people do not care whether Biden is lying about his involvement.

This, of course, is not true. Multiple polls takenlast yearproved that a bipartisan majority of American voters support an investigation into the Biden family and specifically Hunter Biden. The president's son is currently under federal investigation.



01/03/23: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

But to the question of Biden's honesty? Jean-Pierre refused to answer.

""I'm not going to get into the specifics of any of the oversight here. We have a White House counsel that's going to — my colleagues who are going to deal with this,"" she said.

Anything else?

The White House is already playing hardball with House Republicans.

Politico reported last week:

While the House GOP has spent weeks detailing its planned investigations into the Biden administration now that the party has a majority, the White House has stayed mostly silent on strategy. That changed Thursday morning, when White House Special Counsel Richard Sauber announced he plans to effectively reset the clock come Jan. 3 and ignore the long list of investigative requests already sent by Republican Reps. James Comer of Kentucky and Jim Jordan of Ohio — the incoming chairs for the Oversight and Judiciary Committees, respectively.

"Double amputee, who reportedly lost his legs after encounter with police in Texas, shot and killed by police in California","A suspect in a stabbing in California was shot and killed after police say he threatened to throw a knife at them.

At 3:40 p.m. on January 26, Huntington Park police received a call from a man claiming that he had been stabbed. The victim claimed that ""without provocation,"" a black man in a wheelchair had attacked him ""with a 12-inch butcher knife."" When officers arrived, they discovered Anthony Lowe Jr., a 36-year-old black male in a wheelchair, just a few blocks away from the scene of the crime.

When police confronted Lowe, he was allegedly holding a butcher knife and refusing to cooperate with police commands. At some point, Lowe hopped off his wheelchair, still apparently holding the knife, and attempted to flee police. However, Lowe's escape was hampered by the fact that both of his legs had previously been amputated after an encounter with police in Texas, his family later alleged.

Though, as a double amputee, Lowe was relatively incapacitated, police said they still could not restrain him. They used a taser on him twice, but those attempts ""were ineffective,"" the police report stated. The suspect allegedly continued to threaten police with the butcher knife and even claimed he would soon ""throw the knife at the officers.""

The suspect's continued threats against officers resulted ""in an officer-involved shooting,"" the police report stated. Lowe was shot 10 times, and Los Angeles County Fire Department paramedics later pronounced him dead at the scene.

A bystander filmed most of Lowe's encounter with police, and the video soon went viral on social media. The video footage does not show the fatal shooting, though its contents are disturbing.

The video footage indicates that Lowe was armed with a knife during the incident, but Lowe's family does not believe that the use of fatal force was warranted in this case.



""You guys knew your lives wasn’t in danger,"" said Lowe's cousin, Ellakenyada Gorum. ""He’s running on his limbs. How cold-hearted could they be?""

""They refuse to give everything we need to know what really happened to him,"" she later stated, full of emotion. ""He was not homeless, he was loved. And it’s sad, really sad, that they’re getting away from killing our African American people, just getting away with it. He was in a wheelchair. What more could he do? What more could he do?""

""They murdered my son in a wheelchair with no legs,"" added Lowe's mother, Dorothy Lowe, who also insisted she does not want anyone to riot in her son's name. She wants only justice.

""I just want the truth,"" Dorothy Lowe claimed. ""Nothing but the truth and justice for my son. My son was murdered.""

Huntington Park PD stated that the shooting remains under investigation by fellow members of the force, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department – Homicide Bureau, and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. The officers involved have been placed on paid administrative leave. Their names have not been released.

The man Lowe allegedly stabbed suffered a ""life-threatening"" injury to his chest and was immediately taken to the hospital on the day of the incident. He has been treated for a collapsed lung and internal bleeding, police said. As of Monday, he remained in the hospital in critical condition.

'Had to be real': Intel official who signed infamous letter discrediting Hunter Biden laptop story makes stunning admission,"One of the former intelligence officials who signed the infamous letter used to exonerate Hunter Biden in the court of public perception admitted in a recent interview that he signed the letter despite believing the laptop was mostly authentic.



What is the background?

After the New York Post broke the Hunter Biden laptop story just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, Democrats and the media rushed to claim that the story and its timing were characteristic of a Russian disinformation campaign.

Specifically, the media pushed a letter signed by more more than 50 former intelligence officials to discredit the laptop story. The letter claimed the story had ""all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.""

""If we are right,"" the letter went on to say, ""this is Russia trying to influence how Americans vote in this election, and we believe strongly that Americans need to be aware of this.""

What is happening now?

Douglas Wise, a former senior CIA operations officer and former Defense Intelligence Agency deputy director, admitted that most of the letter's signatories believed a ""significant portion"" of the laptop story was authentic at the time they discredited it.

""All of us figured that a significant portion of that content had to be real to make any Russian disinformation credible,"" Wise told the Australian on Sunday.

Like other intel officials who signed the letter, Wise defended it by claiming it did not necessarily say what the media claimed.

""The letter said it had the earmarks of Russian deceit and we should consider that as a possibility,"" Wise said. ""It did not say Hunter Biden was a good guy, it didn’t say what he did was right and it wasn’t exculpatory, it was just a cautionary letter.""

In fact, Wise refused to display contrition for helping drive a narrative that was false. He told the news outlet, ""I don’t regret signing it"" and pointed to Rudy Giuliani allegedly visiting Ukraine to ""to dig up evidence on the Bidens."" He also said the ""chain of custody"" issues surrounding the laptop hard drive cast some doubt on its authenticity.

""Russians or even ill-intended conservative elements could have planted stuff in there,"" Wise claimed.

Hunter Biden remains under federal investigation for alleged tax crimes and for purportedly lying on a federal form when he purchased a firearm.

"Democrat John Fetterman beats Republican Dr. Oz in hotly contested race for Pennsylvania's US Senate seat, multiple networks project","Democrat John Fetterman beat Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz in the hotly contested race for Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate seat, according to projections from Fox News, NBC News, and other outlets early Wednesday morning.

The tally had been too close to call after midnight, but Fetterman began getting the big check mark just before 1 a.m.

As the projected winner, Fetterman may help shift the balance of power in the Senate, which has been deadlocked at 50-50 since early 2021 — albeit with Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, holding the deciding vote. It's also a pickup for Democrats, as the seat was held by retiring GOP U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey.

The Oz-versus-Fetterman contest received arguably the most attention nationwide, particularly when Oz began to chip away at Fetterman's sizable lead and especially after Fetterman's stroke earlier this year — and its cognitive effects on him — became a major issue.

What happened Tuesday night?

Around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, Fetterman was leading Oz by whopping 17 points with 20% of precincts reporting. But just after an hour, Oz had made significant gains, narrowing the gap to two points with 64% reporting.

At 11 p.m., the only Pennsylvania county that hadn't reported was Bedford, which sits on the southern edge of the state and is heavily conservative. A few minutes later, when Bedford finally reported, Fetterman's lead shrank to 1.1 points.

The Associated Press by 1:12 a.m. had not called the race, which showed Fetterman leading Oz by 1.4 points with 84% of precincts reporting. The vote totals stood at 2,446,089 for Fetterman and 2,380,124 for Oz, according to the AP.

What's the background?

Oz had consistently trailed Fetterman in the polls, but Oz cut into Fetterman's double-digit lead after the Senate primary in May to just a 3.7-point average differential by the end of September.

What's more, Oz attacked Fetterman for refusing to share his medical records with reporters in regard to his stroke and for agreeing to only one debate.

NBC News interviewed Fetterman a little over three weeks prior to Election Day, and he struggled to speak and understand the questions he was asked — even having to read a reporter's questions from a computer.

It was more of the same during Fetterman's late-October debate against Oz, as Fetterman started things off by saying: ""Hi. Good night, everybody.""

Fetterman supports abortion with no limits and has vowed to end the filibuster. What's more, he has attacked Oz for stating that ""abortion is murder"" and claimed the Republican doesn't believe in exceptions for rape or incest.

Anything else?

On the eve of the midterms, Fetterman filed a federal lawsuit arguing that not counting ballots that violate Pennsylvania election law actually violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dr-oz-fetterman-hotly-contested-race-for-pennsylvanias-us-senate-seat-too-close-to-call,2022-11-09
Drag queen says gun control is needed to protect kids,"Drag Queen Story Hour executive director Jonathan Hamilt said that gun control is needed to protect kids.

""You know, 19 students just got shot in Texas, and Texas legislation wants to ban minors from going to drag shows. It makes zero sense. It's a sad, sorry excuse... [for] the lack of gun control, and that's the real issue,"" Hamilt said, according to the Independent.

A school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, last month left 19 children and two teachers dead.

""Drag queens aren't going into schools to shoot kids... when did we decide that it's appropriate to teach kids how to hide under desks and not to talk about LGBT people and histories?"" Hamilt said. ""If people really wanted to protect children, it wouldn't be banning LGBTQ education, it would be banning guns.""

After a bar in Texas held a ""Drag the Kids to Pride"" event last weekend, GOP Texas state Rep. Bryan Slaton said that he would propose legislation to protect children from being exposed ""to drag shows and other inappropriate events.""



Florida state Rep. Anthony Sabatini, also a Republican, tweeted that ""Drag Sex Shows aimed at children have come to Florida"" and announced that he ""will be proposing Legislation to charge w/ a Felony & terminate the parental rights of any adult who brings a child to these perverted sex shows aimed at FL kids.""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said that Florida has ""laws against child endangerment"" and that his administration is examining what actions can be taken ""under existing, ah, statutes.""

Dallas drag show controversy: DeSantis says staff will look at child endangerment laws in Florida www.youtube.com

""Any attempt to criminalise our work is rooted in tired homophobic and transphobic hate and misinformation, and we refuse to give in to politicians who are too bigoted and boring to comprehend our vision for a world in which every child can be safe fully expressing who they are,"" Hamilt said, according to the Independent.

The issue of exposing children to drag is very controversial — many parents consider the topic to be highly inappropriate for kids.

Drag Queen Story Hour events involve drag queens reading to children, but Hamilt contended that there is a world of difference between DQSH events and adult drag shows.



""I'm not going to lie and say drag is never sexualised, because drag is an art form and it can be sexual like anything else can be,"" Hamilt said, according to the Independent. ""Drag with adults in an adult setting could be sexual, sure. Is it sexual at a Drag Queen Story Hour? No! Do you bring your kids to an R-rated movie? I hope not. There are actors in R rated movies, and those same actors can be in a family friendly comedy that's rated G...

""Someone who is bigoted or doesn't want to do the research, they're not going to understand that an adult drag show at an adult bar, in the evening, with alcohol, is different from a Drag Queen Story Hour nonprofit event at 11am at a public library.



""Obviously, all adults act differently when they're around children and when they're not. Every schoolteacher has a private life outside of working with children, and you act appropriately around children. That's just a normal thing that all adults do, no matter who you are – gay or straight, drag queen or not,"" Hamilt said.

A drag queen known as ""Lil Miss Hot Mess"" has authored two children's books that replace the lyrics of well known songs with drag-related themes. A book titled, ""If You're a Drag Queen and You Know It,"" replaces the lyrics of ""If You're Happy and You Know It"" with words such as ""If You're a Drag Queen and You Know It, Blow a Kiss!"" and ""If You're a Drag Queen and You Know It, Strike a Pose!""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/drag-queen-gun-control-kids,2022-06-11
"Drag Story Hour NYC — which sends drag queens into public schools — got over $200,000 from taxpayers since 2018: Report","Drag Story Hour NYC — a nonprofit that sends drag queens into public schools — received $207,000 from taxpayers since 2018, the New York Post reported.

What are the details?

The total dollar amount includes $50,000 from New York State through its Council on the Arts and $157,000 from the city’s Departments of Education, Cultural Affairs, Youth and Community Development, and the Department of Transportation, the paper said, citing city data shows.

The Post added that the outfit — previously known as Drag Queen Story Hour NYC before removing ""Queen"" from its moniker early this year — last month alone earned $46,000 from New York City contracts for appearances at public schools, street festivals, and libraries, according to city records.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

""So far in 2022, we've produced 49 Drag Story Hour programs for 34 individual public schools and special needs schools in English, Spanish, and Cantonese,"" the group's website says. ""In May, we launched Reading with Royalty, our new middle grade and YA book discussion program for middle and high school students, with discussion questions on five of our favorite queer middle grade and YA books.""

State Assembly candidate Helen Qiu — whose 11-year-old son attends a Manhattan public middle school — told the Post she's ""shocked"" by it all: ""I would be furious if he was exposed without my consent. This is not part of the curriculum.”

Republican city council member Vickie Paladino of Queens added to the paper she's ""considering pulling funding to any school in my district that is implementing Drag Queen Story Hour. We are taking hundreds of thousands of dollars out of the pockets of hardworking New York taxpayers … to fund a program teaching little children about their gender fluidity? Not. On. My. Watch.”

The Post said city council members allocated most of the money from their discretionary budgets, setting aside $80,000 for the group in the current fiscal year — which more than triples the $25,000 budgeted in 2020.

Drag Story Hour NYC presentations, which began in public libraries in 2017, added new elements in conjunction with the expansion into New York City schools, the paper said, citing the group's social media posts.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The Post said Harmonica Sunbeam in April ""wore a slinky gown to meet with kindergarteners at STAR Academy in Manhattan and color pages from 'The Dragtivity Book,' which encourages kids to choose their pronouns and invent drag names.""

The paper added that Bella Noche ""wore a scanty mermaid-like bra getup to travel with 2nd graders from Manhattan’s PS 34 on a May field trip, and Flame taught middle schoolers 'of all genders' how to apply drag eye makeup at MS 88 in Park Slope.""

Less than an hour after the Post called Drag Story Hour NYC for comment Friday, some school-related posts disappeared from the internet, the paper noted, adding that one deleted photo showed Professor Lionel Longlegs wearing a T-shirt with “I Don’t Want to Look or Be Cis” while performing for primary-grade kids.

How are parents reacting?

Some city parents told the Post they're in favor of drag queens visiting schools.

“I’m glad to see all types of people included in what students are exposed to and learn in class,” 40-year-old Kristen Williams, whose 11-year-old daughter attends an East Village middle school, told the paper.

However, 26-year-old Storm Neverson told the Post she was concerned about her girls — ages 9 and 6 — being exposed to drag queens at STAR Academy.

“If they were in junior high school or middle school, I would be okay with that because I feel like they would have a little bit more understanding,” Neverson noted to the paper. “At this time, the kids were just a little too young.”

STAR Academy parents were told of the in-school drag session ahead of time, Neverson told the Post, but parents couldn't opt their kids out of it.

“It was mostly just like a heads up, you know, like, ’Hey, this event is coming up. We’re gonna have these people come in.’ And that was that,” she added to the paper.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

At other schools, parents weren't informed at all, the Post said.

“I didn’t get any notice,” Reese Harrington, a parent at PS 191, revealed to the paper. “My daughter actually came home and told me that a drag queen came to the school … I feel like it would have been better for that conversation to happen at home.”

Elana Fishbein, founder and president of conservative group No Left Turn in Education, told the Post that New York City's move to allow drag performers in public schools is an ""abuse of authority for the purpose of sexualizing children.""

What did the city's Department of Education have to say?

The paper said the city's Department of Education didn't respond specifically to its questions about parental notification and refused to say if drag queens must pass background checks. But the Post said the DOE defended the program as “life saving.”

“Last year, 50 transgender or gender-nonconforming people were killed in the United States due to their identity,” DOE spokeswoman Suzan Sumer told the paper. “We believe our schools play a critical role in helping young people learn about and respect people who may be different from them.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/drag-queen-story-hour-200k,2022-06-13
Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey sues Biden admin to keep border barrier made of shipping containers: 'We're not backing down',"Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey announced Friday that the state is suing the Biden administration in order to keep the border barrier of shipping containers it erected.

“Our border communities are overwhelmed by illegal activity as a result of the Biden administration’s failure to secure the southern border,” said Ducey in a statement released on his social media account.

“Arizona is taking action to protest on behalf of our citizens,"" he continued. ""With this lawsuit, we’re pushing back against efforts by federal bureaucrats to reverse the progress we’ve made. The safety and security of Arizona and its citizens must not be ignored. Arizona is going to do the job that Joe Biden refuses to do — secure the border in any way we can. We’re not backing down.”

Arizona began stacking shipping containers to fill gaps at the border in August after the Biden administration failed to fill those gaps. Ducey said that the state had closed about 3,820 linear feet with 130 shipping containers stacked on top of each other and welded together.

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation then demanded on October 14 that Ducey remove the border barrier and claimed that it was built in violation of federal law. The Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs responded by refusing to do so and said in a statement that the state had a right to defend its residents against illegal immigration.

""The myriad of federal agencies that claim jurisdiction on the southern border but do nothing to prevent the public nuisance caused by illegal immigration and criminal activity that exploits the open border is quite frustrating to those that live, work and recreate on that border and in our state,"" said DEMA director Allen Clark on Tuesday.



Ducey's latest statement said that the Tucson sector of the U.S. Border Patrol had documented more than 230,000 migrants crossing illegally into Arizona from October 2021 to August 2022.

Warner Bros. admits to cutting gay dialogue out of latest 'Fantastic Beasts' movie to appease Chinese censors,"Warner Bros. admitted to cutting some scenes with gay dialogue out of the latest ""Fantastic Beasts"" movie in order to appease Chinese censors.

The scenes in ""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore"" related to statements made by the Dumbledore character about his same-sex attraction to/relationship with the character Grindelwald.

The company released a statement to News.com.au confirming that it complied with the censorship request.

“As a studio, we’re committed to safeguarding the integrity of every film we release, and that extends to circumstances that necessitate making nuanced cuts in order to respond sensitively to a variety of in-market factors,"" said the statement from Warner Bros.

“Our hope is to release our features worldwide as released by their creators but historically we have faced small edits made in local markets. In the case of Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, a six-second cut was requested and Warner Bros accepted those changes to comply with local requirements but the spirit of the film remains intact,"" it added.

The company went on to characterize the cuts as ""minor edits.""

J.K. Rowling, the author of the ""Harry Potter"" book series and creator of the spin-off series ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"" revealed in 2009 that the Dumbledore character was gay, but the newest movie is the first to reference the sexual preferences of the character.

Among those filmmakers who refused to cave to demands from Chinese censors was celebrated director Quentin Tarantino who publicly decried the requests in 2019 to censor his movie ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."" The movie was banned in China and lost significant revenue it would have otherwise garnered.

In January, Chinese censors edited the ending of the cult favorite ""Fight Club"" so that the state appears victorious over the protagonists and the main character is sent to a lunatic asylum.

Here's the trailer for the latest 'Fantastic Beasts' movie:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/dumbledore-china-censor-gay-edit,2022-04-13
"EA stands firm against staff pressure to publicly support abortion, trans rights — tells disgruntled employees to make a 'positive impact' by doing their jobs","Famous video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) has reportedly refused to join a flurry of other companies in issuing public statements in support of abortion and transgender rights, telling staff during a company-wide meeting this week that ""being an inclusive company means being inclusive of all those points of view.""

According to gaming outlet Kotaku, EA's chief people officer, Mala Singh, also told employees that the company has determined only to speak out if a public statement will ""actually have a positive impact"" and that such a stance has remained a ""consistent perspective"" for the company.

The May 24 town hall-style meeting reportedly featured wide-ranging discussions between executives and staff, including plans for upcoming games, corporate strategy, and pay raises. But many employees also used the time to call on the company to make public statements in support of abortion and transgender rights.

The political issues apparently were heavy on the minds of some, given recent political developments, including a leaked draft opinion indicating the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade and Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's orders to investigate youth sex-change procedures as child abuse.

But in response to the pressure, EA stood firm and essentially instructed staff to take action — by doing their jobs.

""The thing about the world today is there is a lot of division, we know this, right, we see it every single day, but the thing that unites us is that we’re all here to make amazing games and experiences for our players, and that is how we have the most positive impact on the world,"" Singh said, according to a transcript of the meeting obtained by Kotaku.

She added: ""These things are hard and they’re personal, and we all have our own perspectives, and sometimes we won’t speak, and that will be upsetting, and I understand that, we really do.""

In a subsequent statement, EA's corporate communications director, Lacey Haines, reportedly told the outlet she could not provide further comment about the town hall since it is a ""confidential forum."" But she insisted that EA works hard to ""create an environment where our employees can talk about complex issues"" through company meetings, Slack discussions, group dialogues, surveys, and more.

""From all of that,"" she added, ""We recognize these topics are deeply personal, and we know that there are many strong opinions, and some will be disappointed when we say that we’re not making public statements because we’re focused on the ways we can support our people around the world as their employer.""



Yet, while refusing to issue a public statement on the controversial topics, Haines noted that the company is working — though perhaps out of the public eye — to support employees affected by some of the developments. For example, she said the company is ""making sure that people have access to the health care benefits we provide as a company, even if those aren’t available locally."" That likely means providing stipends for women to travel out of state to have abortions.

Additionally, in March, the company did join dozens of others to sponsor a full-page ad in the Dallas Morning News denouncing Abbott's ""anti-LGBTQ+ efforts"" in Texas.

That said, EA's decision to refrain from taking a more public stance is commendable, and likely wise — especially as many other businesses, such as Disney, rush to the public sphere to declare their stances on controversial matters, perhaps to their detriment.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ea-refuses-to-issue-statement-supporting-abortion-transgender-rights,2022-05-26
Ecuador facing disciplinary action over homophobic chants against Chile during its World Cup opening game against Qatar,"FIFA, the World Cup governing body, began a disciplinary investigation into homophobic chants made by Ecuadorian fans against a country unrelated to the country they were competing against in the opening game.

The chants were made during Ecuador's game against Qatar at Al Bayt Stadium on Sunday. Ecuadorian fans chanted, ""Anyone who doesn't jump is a Chilean [homophobic insult]"" in Spanish.

Ecuador went on to beat Qatar in a score of 2-0.

It was the first time in World Cup that a country hosting the World Cup lost its opening game.

The Ecuadorians mocked Chile because the country is not competing in the World Cup and filed a lawsuit to take Ecuador's place at the international soccer games. They also chanted, ""Chile can watch it on television.""

The Football Federation of Chile demanded that FIFA disqualify Ecuador over one of its players allegedly using a false passport and birth certificate to play. Chileans filed a formal appeal in July after FIFA refused to change what teams would go to the contest. Later, it elected to punish Ecuador with a points reduction for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.

Byron Castillo, the player accused of being ineligible to play, is also not playing on the World Cup team.

Ecuadorian fans also humorously chanted ""we want beer!"" in Spanish during the game to protest Qatar banning alcohol sales during the games in accordance with Islamic religious regulations. Only alcohol-free Bud Zero is being sold at games.

FIFA is also investigating homophobic chants made by fans of Mexico, who are famous for their politically incorrect chants. They have previously been punished with game forfeiture and also with games being played without their fans.

The Mexican team tied Poland in a scoreless game.

"US ski star who competed for China is getting torched by critics for promoting American Olympics bid: 'With this attitude of playing both sides, she is better off as a politician'","Eileen Gu, a U.S.-born and raised ski star who (in)famously competed for China during the Beijing Winter Olympics, is drawing heat from critics yet again — this time for promoting America's bid for hosting the Winter Games.

What are the details?

The 18-year-old skiing sensation has signed on to serve as an ""athlete representative"" for Salt Lake City, Utah's 2030 or 2034 bid for hosting the Olympics, the Associated Press confirmed on Tuesday. Gu earlier announced her participation at the Time100 Summit, calling herself an ""ambassador"" for the U.S. bid.

""I think that’s this beautiful example of globalism and of the capacity that we can use skiing and we can use sport and we can use winter sport to connect people,"" she told Time's senior sports correspondent, Sean Gregory at the New York City event.

""Salt Lake specifically wants to become a global destination for athletes everywhere to come train there and they want to incorporate 15 new countries into the Winter Olympics. I think that’s something that’s really beautiful and I’ve always stood for that and so I’m really honored to be a part of the whole thing,"" she added.

China's Eileen Gu To Serve As Ambassador For United States Olympic Bid www.youtube.com

The ski star — who grew up in California and plans to attend Stanford University in the fall — seemed utterly enthused as she made the announcement, though she declined to divulge which country she would compete for in forthcoming Games.

What has been the response?

Not everyone shared her enthusiasm, however.

According to Vice and the AP, commenters had mixed reactions on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter, where news of Gu's ambassadorship started trending widely.

Some reportedly pointed out that this is not the first time Chinese athletes have supported other countries’ bids and argued it is evidence of Gu's global influence. But others were less understanding. They criticized the teen for what they viewed as opportunism and divided loyalties.

""With this attitude of playing both sides, she is better off as a politician,"" one commenter chided, according to Vice.

Mark Dreyer, founder of the news site China Sports Insider, told the outlet, ""There’s certainly a growing percentage of people who see her as an American that is coming to China for the money. This confirms their suspicions.""

What's the background?

Gu has been slammed for her apparent opportunism before, especially after reports surfaced indicating the global athlete and model raked in eye-popping amounts of cash in endorsements during the Winter Games, a majority of from Chinese companies.

Yahoo Sports reported at the time that Gu was ""laughing all the way to the bank"" amid scrutiny over her allegiance-switching. The skier allegedly pulled in some $42 million in sponsorship and endorsement deals, with at least $31 million of that from more than 20 deals with Chinese companies.

All the while, Gu stayed mum about her citizenship situation, refusing to disclose whether or not she traded out her American passport for a Chinese one since China does not allow dual citizenship.

The athlete has repeatedly dodged questions on the matter, saying only that she feels American when she's in America and Chinese when she's in China.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/eileen-gu-criticized-for-us-olympics-bid-promotion,2022-06-08
Elderly man's face bitten on Portland's Blue Line just days after 3-year-old pushed onto the tracks,"An elderly man lost part of his face and a toddler came close to losing a great deal more in two separate attacks that occurred within a week of one another on the Metropolitan Area Express Blue Line in Portland, Oregon.

New year, same violent city

Korn Kraemer, 25, recently moved to Portland from the state of Georgia. According to police, Kraemer attacked a 78-year-old man on a MAX platform early Tuesday morning.

KPTV reported that the officers dispatched to Cleveland Station in the Portland suburb of Gresham around 2:17 a.m. found the suspect still lying atop and attacking the elderly man.

There was so much blood at the scene, police initially suspected the attack had been a stabbing.

But this was no mere stabbing. Police said that the suspect ""had chewed off the victim's ear and part of his face. The injury was so severe that responders could see the victim's skull.""

The victim was reportedly taken to a hospital, his condition unknown.

When officers detained the suspect, he identified himself as ""El Baker."" Only later, after booking him into the Multnomah County Jail on an assault charge, were they able to fingerprint and thereby identify the suspect as Kraemer.

TriMet, the transit provider behind the Blue Line, issued a statement, intimating that it is inevitable that the violence plaguing Portland would spill onto the transit system.

""What happens in the community will at times happen on or near the transit system. As we work to provide safety system-wide, across our 533 square-mile service district stretching across three counties, we also look to our partners for help addressing larger safety and community issues,"" said the statement. ""Transit Police, which is led by Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office, work closely with other local law enforcement to investigate criminal activity that spills over onto the transit system and may have more.""

KOIN reported that hours after the apparent cannibalistic attack, there was a report of more violence on the Blue Line; however, those involved managed to escape.



One Blue Line rider told KOIN, ""I feel like they could do a little bit better with their security to make sure things like that don’t happen.""

Richard Landers, another Blue Line rider, indicated that the commuting public could benefit from a ""few more transit police security like that, patrolling around and telling people to behave.""

Child sacrifice

It may have taken more than a simple request to practice good behavior to prevent 32-year-old Brianna Lace Workman from allegedly pushing a 3-year-old girl onto the tracks on Dec. 28.

According to the Multnomah County district attorney’s office, a mother and her child were waiting for a train at the Gateway Transit Center MAX platform in northeast Portland.

Workman allegedly shoved the child onto the metal rail below.

TriMet video surveillance captured the moment the suspect pushed the little girl, dressed in a pink coat, over the edge:

The little girl went head-first into the metal rail and rocks.

While Workman reseated herself after the attack, bystanders leaped into action. The bystanders rescued the little girl from the tracks before the next train pulled into the station.

According to the district attorney's office, the child survived, suffering a severe headache and a red mark on her forehead.

Workman was charged with attempted assault in the first degree, assault in the third degree, interfering with public transportation, disorderly conduct in the second degree, and recklessly endangering another person.

Michael Reed, a MAX rider, told KPTV, ""That was really cruel. You know, like people just don't care anymore, they don't have respect.""



Another rider, Blaine Danley, said, ""There’s no excuse for that. Like I don’t understand why someone would do something like that — they belong in jail.""

While such suspects may belong in jail, the likelihood of them ending up there is questionable.

Symptoms of a greater problem

TheBlaze previously reported how leftist Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt announced that hundreds of wife-beaters, sex offenders, burglars, drunk drivers, and berserkers of various intensity will not face justice in Oregon's most populous county. Schmidt, who made a name for himself by refusing to prosecute BLM rioters and other violent suspects, blamed the problem on a lack of public defenders.

Extra to a legal system unable or unwilling to put criminals in jail, Portland and the surrounding area are still reeling from the city's cuts to and vilification of police. The diminished effects of deterrence and responsiveness appear to have had a significant impact.

Portland's Democratic Mayor Ted Wheeler's office revealed this week that there were nearly four times more murders in 2022 than the city's 20-year-average, reported KOIN. Sgt. Kevin Allen said, ""We've had another incredibly violent year in the city.""

Extra to apparent cannibalistic attacks and unprovoked assaults on toddlers, the city saw a record 96 homicides and 1,300 shootings last year. Allen indicated that gangs remain a problem, but 34% of murders involved homeless individuals.

The Democrat-run city scores a three on Neighborhood Scout's crime index, where 100 is safest. The chances of becoming a victim of a violent crime are one in 187. In the Democrat-controlled state of Oregon, the odds are one in 342.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elderly-mans-face-eaten-on-portlands-blue-line-just-days-after-3-year-old-pushed-onto-the-tracks,2023-01-04
"Woman, 74, says she was fired from Circle-K after boss didn't believe that crook she tried to stop was armed. Suspect pleaded guilty to weapons charge — and now she's suing.","An elderly Colorado woman told KCNC-TV she was fired from her job at a Circle-K convenience store after her manager didn't believe her story that a crook she tried to stop one night two years ago was carrying knives.

Moreno, 74, told KCNC she was well-liked during her 16-year stint at the Circle-K in Westminster and went ""beyond what they expected of me.""

But she explained to the station the good vibes ended when new management took over, adding that higher ups treated her badly and often scheduled her to work alone without breaks, which she said put her in danger.

Moreno was working a night shift at the store on Oct. 4, 2020, when a man came in around 7 p.m. holding what she described as two hunting knives, the station reported.

""I was shaking so bad that I couldn't hold myself still,"" she recalled to KCNC. ""I was just wanting to get him out of there.""



Moreno told the station the man asked for cigarettes — but soon it became clear he wasn't intending to pay for them.

""He kept insisting, 'You have to give them to me.' He said, 'You have to give them to me,'"" she noted to KCNC.

After Moreno refused, she told the station the man came behind the counter — after which she put up resistance.

""I pushed his arm, you know?"" Moreno told KCNC. ""And when I pushed his arm, he took off.""

Police later arrested Tyler Darren Wimmer in connection with the incident and charged him with aggravated robbery and menacing with a deadly weapon, the station said. He pleaded guilty to the menacing with a deadly weapon charge, KCNC said, citing a lawsuit filed on Moreno's behalf by the Rathod Mohamedbhi Law Firm.



Trouble only beginning

But Moreno told KCNC trouble was only beginning.

She told the station that despite video of the incident, eyewitness accounts, and Wimmer's arrest, her store manager didn't believe her story.

""He took me in the office, and he said, 'Well, I don't see a knife,' because he watched the video, I guess,"" Moreno recounted to KCNC. ""And I said, 'Well, there was a knife.'""



Moreno's boss even insisted that she apologize, the station said, after which she refused and then was fired.

Lawsuit

Now, she's suing the store, KCNC reported.

""I'm not doing it for money,"" she told the station. ""I'm doing it because of the way they treat their employees.""

Elon Musk drops third set of 'Twitter Files' detailing federal involvement in decision to ban Trump,"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk released a third trove of documents detailing the decision at Twitter to suspend former President Donald Trump permanently and how federal agencies might have been involved.

The thread was posted by journalist Matt Taibbi on his Twitter account.

""We’ll show you what hasn’t been revealed: the erosion of standards within the company in months before J6, decisions by high-ranking executives to violate their own policies, and more, against the backdrop of ongoing, documented interaction with federal agencies,"" wrote Taibbi.

Emails showed ""chaos"" internally as Twitter executives tried to find the rationale for suspending Trump.

""The bulk of the internal debate leading to Trump’s ban took place in those three January days. However, the intellectual framework was laid in the months preceding the Capitol riots,"" Taibbi reported.

""After J6, internal Slacks show Twitter executives getting a kick out of intensified relationships with federal agencies. Here’s Trust and Safety head Yoel Roth, lamenting a lack of 'generic enough' calendar descriptions to concealing his 'very interesting' meeting partners,"" he continued.

Taibbi reported that there was a tension between the small Safety Operations department and ""a smaller, more powerful cadre of senior policy execs.""

He said there was clear interaction with ""federal enforcement and intelligence agencies"" about content moderation during that time. One email showed the FBI expressing concern about two tweets with claims about election fraud that were debunked by Politico.

""Examining the entire election enforcement Slack, we didn’t see one reference to moderation requests from the Trump campaign, the Trump White House, or Republicans generally. We looked. They may exist: we were told they do. However, they were absent here,"" said Taibbi.

He goes on to document a bizarre debate over whether to censor a joke made by former Gov. Mike Huckabee about election fraud.

""This seemingly silly case actually foreshadows serious later issues,"" Taibbi writes.

Meanwhile, tweets in support of President Joe Biden that decried possible voter fraud by Republicans were shown to be approved in some emails.

Taibbi said there would be more documents released on Saturday and Sunday.

Musk promised to reveal documents related to controversial decisions made by the Twitter team before the acquired the social media platform. The first ""Twitter Files"" showed why Twitter employees decided to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story, while a second edition released documents related to the shadow-banning of conservatives on the application.

Musk also ended the ban on Trump's Twitter account, but the former president has so far refused to return and instead is posting on ""Truth Social.""

This is a developing story and may be updated.

Here's more about the Twitter Files revelations:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-feds-trump-ban-files,2022-12-10
"Elon Musk accuses Twitter of 'material breach' of deal, threatens to walk away","Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is accusing Twitter of refusing to turn over information on spam bot and fake accounts and has threatened to back out of his deal to acquire the company for $44 billion.

Musk's lawyers sent a letter to Twitter's chief legal officer Monday stating that the company is ""actively resisting and thwarting his information rights.""

""This is a clear material breach of Twitter’s obligations under the merger agreement and Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement,"" the letter states.

Twitter disclosed the letter in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The letter states that Musk has made repeated requests since May 9 for information that would allow him to evaluate how many spam and fake accounts are on the company's platform. Instead of providing that information, Twitter has offered to provide details on the company's internal testing methodologies, which Musk's lawyers say is ""tantamount to refusing Mr. Musk's data requests.""

""Twitter's effort to characterize it otherwise is merely an attempt to obfuscate and confuse the issue,"" Musk's attorneys said.

Twitter has previously estimated that fewer than 5% of its 229 million accounts are fake or bot accounts, but Musk has rejected that assessment. The billionaire claims the real number could be higher than 20% and has said that the deal made in April to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share and take it private cannot be completed until he receives an accurate count.



""At this point, Mr. Musk believes Twitter is transparently refusing to comply with its obligations under the merger agreement, which is causing further suspicion that the company is withholding the requested data due to concern for what Mr. Musk’s own analysis of that data will uncover,"" the letter states. ""If Twitter is confident in its publicized spam estimates, Mr. Musk does not understand the company’s reluctance to allow Mr. Musk to independently evaluate those estimates.""

Stock prices for Twitter Inc. took a hit Monday, sliding 1.6% after news of Musk's threat broke.

In a statement to the Associated Press, Twitter said it ""has and will continue to cooperatively share information with Mr. Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.”

“We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms,” it added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-accuses-twitter-of-material-breach-of-deal-threatens-to-walk-away,2022-06-06
"Elon Musk quotes Jesus, references the death of his child to defend Alex Jones' Twitter ban: 'I have no mercy for anyone who would use the deaths of children'","Elon Musk has won the hearts and minds of many free speech advocates lately, after he recently purchased Twitter and reinstated several high-profile accounts that had previously been banned. The most notable of those newly reinstated accounts is that of former President Donald Trump. Kathy Griffin, Jordan Peterson, and the Babylon Bee were also welcomed back onto the platform.

But Musk ran afoul of other free speech purists when he adamantly refused to reinstate controversial ""Infowars"" host Alex Jones. Jones infamously denied the horrific massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 and openly discussed his skepticism of police and news reports about the shooting on his radio program shortly after it occurred.

Though Jones later apologized for that denial, he still faced daunting lawsuits from outraged members of the victims' families. Several lawsuits filed on their behalf accused Jones of profiting from the deaths of their loved ones by denying on his popular radio program that they ever occurred. His radio program is supported by lucrative deals from corporate sponsors, so the lawsuits alleged that he had, in essence, monetized their grief. Juries sided with the families in the lawsuits, and Jones has since been ordered to pay the families nearly a billion dollars in restitution.

For his Sandy Hook statements and other controversial arguments, many social media platforms — including Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, and Twitter — banned Jones permanently in 2018. At the time, Facebook claimed that it had banned Jones ""for violating our hate speech and bullying policies.""

Though Facebook, part of Meta, has not yet relented and reinstated Jones or Trump, Musk and Twitter initially appeared interested in restoring even controversial accounts in deference to free speech. With Trump's Twitter account restored, many clamored for Jones' to be restored as well. But last Friday, Musk flatly refused to consider doing so.

Then in a series of tweet replies late Sunday night, Musk finally explained his reasons why Jones will not be restored to Twitter.

When neuroscientist Sam Harris asked why Jones should not be restored, Musk dodged the direct question and instead cleverly referenced the Sandy Hook shooting to Harris, an avid atheist, by quoting Jesus from the Gospel of Matthew: ""Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.""

However, that answer did not satisfy the beleaguered online entrepreneur known as Kim Dotcom, who defended Jones by reminding Musk that Jones has apologized for the Sandy Hooks claims, that Jones' so-called ""conspiracy theories"" have often been proven right, and that other ""serial liars"" are allowed on the platform. For these reasons, Dotcom argued, Jones should be reinstated.

At that point, Musk admitted that the decision to continue the Jones ban is also personal for him: ""My firstborn child died in my arms. I felt his last heartbeat. I have no mercy for anyone who would use the deaths of children for gain, politics or fame.""

In 2002, Musk's first child, Nevada Alexander, died of sudden infant death syndrome at just 10 weeks old. Though medical teams resuscitated the child temporarily, little Nevada spent three days on life support before Musk and his then-wife, Justine Wilson, decided to remove him from the machines.

Wilson and Musk had five more children before they divorced in 2008. Musk also has two children with the singer known as Grimes and twins with Shivon Zilis, one of Musk's business associates.

For his part, Jones said that he understands Musk's reasons for continuing to ban him on Twitter. He also claimed that he has little interest in ever returning to the platform.

""I understand why Musk did this,"" Jones said in a video posted on Sunday. ""He's got the [Anti-Defamation League] and the Democratic Party on him. He's got the EU on him trying to shut him down right now.

""Now, do I blame Elon Musk for this? No, ladies and gentlemen. And quite frankly, I don't care if I get brought back to Twitter,"" Jones continued.

""I'm the most controversial figure in the world,"" Jones added, ""because I'm the most threatening to the new world order. So don't expect him to bring me back day one when he has to first get control of the platform before he can even think about that.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-alex-jones-twitter-ban,2022-11-21
Elon Musk breaks silence on Twitter deal controversy with meme that may reveal his strategy,"After going silent on social media for several days, billionaire Elon Musk responded to the controversy over his decision to pull out of his deal to purchase Twitter early Monday — tweeting out a meme of him laughing after Twitter reportedly lawyered up to enforce the agreement.

News broke Friday that Musk is seeking to terminate his agreement to buy Twitter for $44 billion because he claims Twitter refused to turn over information that would enable him to calculate the number of fake or spam accounts on the platform. Musk's decision was upsetting to many people who had come to believe his prospective takeover of Twitter would make the company less hostile towards free speech and end the censorship of prominent conservative figures, including former Republican President Donald Trump.

It was also upsetting to Twitter Inc., which hired lawyers from a high-powered business firm to sue Musk to complete the deal, Bloomberg reported.



Instead of commenting on the controversy directly, Musk tweeted a meme showing him laughing at different captions.

""They said I couldn’t buy Twitter; Then they wouldn’t disclose bot info,"" the captions read. ""Now they want to force me to buy Twitter in court; Now they have to disclose bot info in court.""

The tweet to his 100.9 million followers quickly went viral, gathering more than 870,000 likes and over 104,000 retweets.



Shortly thereafter, Musk tweeted another meme showing famed martial artist and actor Chuck Norris winning a chess match with only one piece remaining.

""Chuckmate,"" Musk wrote.

The memes were Musk's first public statements since his attorneys sent a letter to Twitter on Friday alleging the company had ""made false and misleading representations"" when the Tesla CEO agreed to purchase the company for $54.20 per share.

Attorney Mike Ringler wrote that Twitter had refused to hand over data and information Musk needed to ""make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter's platform.""

Twitter has claimed that spam accounts comprise fewer than 5% of the users on its website. Musk has claimed the number is much greater and has asserted Twitter will not turn over data that would permit him to make a more accurate assessment.

Twitter chairman of the board Bret Taylor responded to Musk's attorney Friday, tweeting: ""The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.”

Musk's meme suggests he views Twitter's impending lawsuit as an opportunity to finally have his questions about fake Twitter users answered in court.

Elon Musk vs. Twitter drama finally ends with agreement to buy social media company for original price,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk's $44 billion deal to buy Twitter is back on after the multi-billionaire offered to close the deal, which would put an end to pending litigation and a dramatic back-and-forth with the social media company.

Musk made his proposal in a letter to Twitter that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday and first reported by Bloomberg. Twitter issued a statement saying the company has agreed sell at Musk's original offer price of $54.20 per share.

""We received the letter from the Musk parties which they have filed with the SEC. The intention of the Company is to close the transaction at $54.20 per share,"" Twitter said.

Musk's attorneys wrote that deal will close pending a Delaware judge's agreement to stay Twitter's pending lawsuit against Musk and the ability of Musk to secure financing.



“The Musk Parties provide this notice without admission of liability and without waiver of or prejudice to any of their rights, including their right to assert the defenses and counterclaims pending in the Action, including in the event the Action is not stayed, Twitter fails or refuses to comply with its obligations under the April 25, 2022 Merger Agreement or if the transaction contemplated thereby otherwise fails to close,"" the letter said.

The letter brings an end to the drama over Musk's attempt to acquire Twitter. The billionaire businessman purchased a 9.6% stake in the company before rejecting a seat on Twitter's board and threatening a hostile takeover. He offered to buy out Twitter for $44 billion in April but then tried to back out of the deal in July by claiming that Twitter had made false claims about how many fake or bot accounts are on its platform. After Twitter sued Musk to make him follow through with the agreement, he added claims from a whistleblower that Twitter deceived regulators about ""extreme, egregious deficiencies"" in combating hackers and spam to his complaint.

Outside observers had predicted that Musk's effort to back out of the deal was likely to fail. Some analysts suggested that he was trying to negotiate a lower sale price from Twitter.

""Musk proceeding with Twitter deal at $54.30. Writing was on the wall he could not win in Delaware and this saves both sides a long and ugly court battle ahead,"" said Wall Street tech analyst Daniel Ives.

Musk was scheduled to be deposed in the Delaware Chancery Court on Thursday and Friday.



Twitter shares surged as much as 18% on the news that he offered to complete the deal, according to Deadline.

"Elon Musk dissolves Twitter board he called 'a waste of time,' becomes sole director and 'Complaint Hotline Operator'","Elon Musk has dissolved Twitter's board of directors, eliminating all remaining administrative obstacles to the realization of his plans for the social media giant. This comes just days after Musk was reportedly looking at axing ""around 50%"" of Twitter's staff — a claim the African billionaire has denied.

Cleaning house

In April, Twitter announced that Musk, who had then taken a 9.2% stake in Twitter, would be appointed to its 11-person board. Musk refused to join.

Former Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal issued a statement on April 10 saying that Musk's decision not to join the board ""is for the best"" and that Musk ""has to act in the best interests of the company and all our shareholders.""

Instead of joining the board, which Musk said was ""a waste of time,"" the African billionaire elected to eliminate it altogether.

Twitter announced on Monday in a Securities and Exchanges Commission filing that Musk, having finalized his $44 billion acquisition on Oct. 27, had become ""the sole director of Twitter.""

The Wall Street Journal reported that the terms of the purchase agreement made clear this was Musk's intention all along.

Musk had already fired the top three Twitter executives — Agrawal, former chief financial officer Ned Segal, and former top legal and policy executive Vijaya Gadde — within hours of acquiring the company.

Now, Agrawal, board director Bret Taylor, and all other previous members of Twitter's board are off and out.

Although the board is defunct, Musk is not entirely done with it. He indicated that he may soon reveal the nature of certain members' apparent obstructionism and hostility, tweeting, ""Stay tuned.""

Although the board and certain senior executives are gone, Musk is not done cleaning house.

The New York Times reported that Musk and his advisers met with top managers at Twitter's San Francisco headquarters last week, ascertaining what each team and division does, ostensibly looking for efficiencies. Managers were allegedly asked for lists of their ""top performers.""

TheBlaze reported that as of Nov. 1, Twitter employees are scheduled to receive stock grants as part of their compensation. Subsequent terminations may therefore cost Musk a great deal in grants.

Extra to possibly purging redundancies, Musk is considering other Twitter reformations.



Big changes

Musk changed his Twitter bio to reflect the seriousness of his new assumed responsibilities. Whereas previously he referred to himself as ""Chief Twit,"" Musk has now assumed the unofficial title of ""Twitter Complaint Hotline Operator.""

The so-called complaint hotline operator announced that Twitter will establish ""a content moderation council.""

The council will allegedly be composed of persons with ""diverse viewpoints.""

Musk has entertained the possibility of having celebrities, reporters, and others with some modicum of notoriety pay for their blue-checkmark verification statuses.



This proposal has been met by significant opposition, largely from well-off media elites. For instance, multimillionaire storybook writer Stephen King (whose estimated value is $500 million) threatened to leave the platform if required to pay a monthly fee.

Musk responded: ""We need to pay the bills somehow! Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers.""

Twitter co-founder reaffirms support for Musk

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has been a consistent supporter of Musk's acquisition, tweeting in April that ""Elon is the singular solution I trust.""



The BBC reported that Dorsey, undaunted by Musk's talk of seismic change, rolled his 18 million shares, valued at nearly $978 million, into the newly private company, maintaining a 2.4% stake.

The second biggest stakeholder is Saudi Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, who had similarly expressed his support for Musk, tweeting last week, ""Together all the way.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-dissolves-twitter-board-he-called-a-waste-of-time-becomes-sole-director-and-complaint-hotline-operator,2022-11-01
Elon Musk dissolves Twitter's censorship council,"Twitter axed its so-called Trust and Safety Council on Monday night.

Leftist elements of the defunct council have denounced the move and joined the chorus of critics opposed to Twitter's apparent embrace of Elon Musk's ""free speech absolutist"" ideals.

The dissolution of the council comes just days after three of its members, including the niece of Biden official John Podesta, resigned, citing as partial cause their opposition to the restoration of banned accounts belonging to conservatives such as former President Donald Trump.

Thanks but no thanks

Trust and Safety Council members received an email signed ""Twitter"" on Monday that said, ""As Twitter moves into a new phase, we are reevaluating how best to bring external insights into our product and policy development.""

Evidently, the best way forward was without the meddling council's direct involvement.

The letter noted that Twitter will ""continue to welcome your ideas going forward"" and ""will also continue to explore opportunities to provide focused and timely input into our work, whether through bilateral or small group meetings.""

An archived version of the council's now-defunct ""About"" page describes the council as ""a group of independent expert organizations from around the world. Together, they advocate for safety and advise us as we develop our products, programs, and rules.""

The so-called expert groups that provided the council with counsel included the Anti-Defamation League, the LGBT activist group Black Rainbow, Feminist Frequency, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, Muslim Advocates, and the United Nations' Association for Progressive Communications.

The group's purported areas of focus included ""Online Safety and Harassment, Human and Digital Rights, Suicide Prevention and Mental Health, Child Sexual Exploitation, and Dehumanization.""

How dare he!

Alex Holmes, now a former member of the council and a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation advisory board member, took to Twitter to lament, writing, ""Many of us have been in this space for a number of years, each with different expertise, but all with a passion to see healthy and diverse conversations and safety exist on platforms.""

""The way this has unfolded and way members have been treated is unfortunate and unacceptable,"" Holmes added.

The Washington Post reported that the council was set to meet virtually to discuss recent developments when it learned that it had been disbanded.

Larry Magid, chief executive at the Silicon Valley nonprofit ConnectSafely, was on the board as of Monday. He told the Post, ""By disbanding it, we got fired instead of quit.""

Members Eirliani Abdul Rahman, Anne Collier, and Lesley Podesta saved Musk three emails by resigning last week, claiming ""the safety and wellbeing of Twitter's users are on the decline.""

Rahman alleged in a statement that slurs against black Americans and gay men jumped since Musk's takeover and that anti-Semitism was on the rise.

""Another red line for me was when previously banned accounts such as those on the far right, and those who had incited others to violence, such as then US President Donald Trump's, were reinstated,"" said Rahman.

While noting that the readmission of the former president and others amounted to unforgivable actions on the part of Twitter's leadership, the trio of quitters claimed that under Musk, Twitter was in danger of losing its reputation as ""the platform where anyone could be heard.""

In response to these resignations, Musk tweeted, ""It is a crime that they refused to take action on child exploitation for years!""

Twitter founder Jack Dorsey suggested that the allegation that the Trust and Safety Council failed to take appropriate action to protect minors was false.

However, Musk doubled down, writing, ""When Ella Irwin, who now runs Trust & Safety, joined Twitter earlier this year, almost no one was working on child safety. She raised this with Ned & Parag, but they rejected her staffing request.""

Roth on the run



While some council members have gone online to complain, the former council head, Yoel Roth, has reportedly gone on the run.

The Washington Post reported that Roth fled his home on account of Musk drawing attention to his doctoral thesis.

Musk tweeted on Saturday, ""Looks like Yoel is arguing in favor of children being able to access adult Internet services in his PhD thesis,"" adding, ""This explains a lot.""

In addition to erroneously claiming investigative journalists Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss were conservatives and only later making a stealth edit, the Washington Post claimed Musk had ""mischaracterized Roth's academic writing about sexual activity and children.""

Even if the trust and safety council hadn't been disbanded, Roth still wouldn't be able to hit Musk with a misinformation label, given that he resigned back in November.



The 35-year-old penned an op-ed in the New York Times on Nov. 18, stating, ""In my more than seven years at the company, we exposed government-backed troll farms meddling in elections, introduced tools for contextualizing dangerous misinformation, and, yes, banned President Donald Trump from the service.""



Roth, who likened members of the Trump administration to Nazis, embraced the descriptor ""custodians of the internet"" and claimed the ""work of online sanitation is unrelenting and contentious.""

Online sanitation, for Roth, has involved taking input from the FBI and censoring the New York Post's Hunter Biden laptop story, potentially impacting the 2020 election; de-platforming the democratically elected president of the United States; and censoring satire he personally did not find to be amusing.

"Elon Musk under federal investigation, court filing reveals","In a court filing released Thursday, Twitter's attorneys alleged that Elon Musk is under federal investigation regarding his $44 billion deal with the social media platform.



Twitter sued Musk shortly after he announced in July that he wanted to back out of purchasing the social media platform. Musk said he was no longer interested in closing the deal because Twitter refused to disclose information about fake accounts on the social media site.

Twitter's lawsuit was halted on October 6 by Delaware Judge Kathaleen McCormick after Musk reversed his decision and said he would like to go through with purchasing the platform. The judge ruled that Musk has until October 28 by 5 p.m. to close the deal. If the deal is not completed by then, a trial date will be set for November.

That same day, Twitter's attorneys submitted the court filing accusing Musk of being under investigation.

According to Bloomberg, the Thursday filing read, ""Elon Musk is presently under investigation by federal authorities for his conduct in connection with the acquisition of Twitter.""

It did not specify why Musk was being investigated or which federal organization was performing the investigation.

As part of Twitter's complaint, it requested that Musk and his team hand over correspondence they have had with federal authorities. Twitter's attorneys even listed specific dates for communication between the parties that they would like Musk to provide.

Twitter told Judge McCormick that Musk's team refuses to turn over certain documents, citing ""investigative privilege."" The court filing read, ""This game of 'hide the ball' must end.""

""Through counsel, he has exchanged substantive correspondence with those authorities concerning their investigations,"" the company's attorneys wrote.

According to Twitter, Musk's attorneys provided a ""privilege log"" identifying materials to be withheld, including an email on May 13 from Musk's team to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a slide presentation to the Federal Trade Commission.

The SEC previously questioned Musk concerning his comments about the deal with Twitter, including why he indicated he would be a passive shareholder. As a result, Musk refiled a new disclosure stating he would be an active shareholder.

An attorney for Musk, Alex Spiro, told Reuters that the social media company's filing was a ""misdirection."" He noted, ""It is Twitter's executives that are under federal investigation.""

Twitter and the FTC declined to comment on the matter, and the SEC did not immediately respond, Reuters reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-under-federal-investigation-court-filing-reveals,2022-10-14
Reporters are angry at Elon Musk's plan to have them pay for verification: 'Dumb billionaire does dumb thing on impulse',"Many reporters have taken to Twitter to vent their outrage against Elon Musk's plan to reportedly charge them a monthly fee in order to keep their blue checkmark verification.

Twitter verification is one of the platform's strategies to keep fake accounts from spreading false information. When an account is verified, it receives a blue checkmark to let others know that the account is official.

Journalists say that having them pay for verification will hurt journalism and spread more false news.

""Hey @elonmusk, I am not paying $240 a year to stay verified. No one will. It's not a status symbol, it's a security feature. Making it a paid service will hurt a ton of journalists and make fake news spread more easily,"" tweeted Matthew Chapman of Raw Story.

""Charging journalists for a security feature (at a price no one will pay) will make this site less reputable and less attractive for your ACTUAL customers,"" he explained.

""Twitter wouldn't even be this deep in the red if not for Musk's deal to buy it in the first place,"" he added. ""Dumb billionaire does dumb thing on impulse and tries more dumb stuff to fix it.

Others agreed.

""I think it’s possible that charging for verification, which journalists mostly use for identity (but which confers some clout), is actually a thinly veiled attack on journalism,"" read another response.

Reporter Scott Nover of Quartz responded, ""If he thinks anyone will pay $240 a year for a blue check mark, he doesn’t know how much money journalists actually make.""

""What will happen when reputable news orgs refuse to pay the richest man in the world to keep their journalists verified and propaganda networks happily pay up for the 'legitimacy' of a blue check mark?"" tweeted journalist Rachel Dodes.

Others thought it was a great move by Musk to ""troll"" people who covet their blue checkmarks so much.

Elon Musk seeks to back out of Twitter deal,"Billionaire business magnate Elon Musk is seeking to pull out of his deal to purchase Twitter, according to a letter to the social media giant from attorney Mike Ringler. But Twitter plans to wage a legal challenge in a bid to compel Musk to stick to the original plan.

""For nearly two months, Mr. Musk has sought the data and information necessary to 'make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter’s platform,'"" the letter states.



""This information is fundamental to Twitter's business and financial performance and is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement because it is needed to ensure Twitter's satisfaction of the conditions to closing, to facilitate Mr. Musk's financing and financial planning for the transaction, and to engage in transition planning for the business. Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information. Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk's requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information,"" the letter continues.

CNBC reported that per the agreement, Musk had consented to fork over $1 billion if he withdraws.

But Twitter will seek to compel Musk to stand by the deal. Twitter board chair Bret Taylor tweeted, ""The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.""

Musk had previously said that he planned to purchase the social media platform and transform it into a place where people could engage in free speech within the confines of the law.

Many conservatives have become fed up with Twitter's censorship of certain types of speech, such as speech that deviates from the dogmas of radical leftist gender ideology or that questions the mainstream narrative on COVID-19 vaccines.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/elon-musk-withdrawal-twitter-deal,2022-07-08
Emails show the Biden administration met with big tech companies to discuss censorship of COVID-19 'misinformation',"Newly released emails shed light on how social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter coordinated with Biden administration officials to censor COVID-19 claims that ran counter to the administration's position.

The emails were obtained by Republican attorneys general Erich Schmitt of Missouri and Jeff Landry of Louisiana, who have filed a lawsuit to compel the Department of Justice to turn over communications between high-ranking government officials and leaders at major social media companies.

The Republicans allege that Twitter and Facebook parent company Meta coordinated with multiple government agencies in a ""Censorship Enterprise"" that quashed free and open discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic on their platforms. These companies developed sweeping misinformation policies during the pandemic that led to the bans and suspensions of accounts or pages deemed to have spread ""misinformation"" about the virus, vaccines, or alternative treatments that were not approved by government health authorities.



Documents already turned over to the Republican attorneys general reveal that officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the White House met with Facebook and Twitter management throughout 2021 and 2022 to discuss misinformation claims. Emails show these social media companies requested and received information from the government that guided their content moderation policies on COVID-19, though the names of specific individuals in these email chains are redacted.



For example, on Feb. 11, 2022, Meta requested information from the CDC regarding certain claims about the COVID-19 vaccine for young children, asking the agency to ""indicate if the claim is 1) false and 2) if believed, could contribute to vaccine refusals.""

A Meta employee requested that CDC officials provide a statement verifying that claims such as ""the COVID vaccine would give children cancer"" are false and could contribute to imminent physical harm if believed so that Facebook could proceed to remove those claims once the vaccine received FDA-approval for those age groups.



An April 7, 2022 response from the CDC gave Meta the requested statement that ""All the claims below are false EXCEPT the note directly below. Also, it is reasonable to assume these statements may lead to vaccine refusal.""

The excepted claim was that COVID-19 vaccines are not effective in preventing severe illness and death in children younger than 5, which the CDC could not speak to at the time because it was waiting for data from vaccine manufacturers.

""Wow, this is amazing, thank you so much [redacted]!! We'll get moving now to be able to remove all but that one claim as soon as the announcement and authorization happens,"" Facebook wrote back to the CDC.

This email exchange was one of several the Republican attorneys general said show how Facebook ""wouldn’t proceed with censoring freedom of speech on their platform until they had input, or a 'debunking' from the CDC.""

An April 16, 2021 email from a Twitter.com address shows that Twitter made similar requests for ""regular chats"" with the CDC to identify ""examples of problematic content"" the company should remove from its platform.

Other emails show the CDC proposed what the attorneys general called a ""monthly pre-debunking meeting with Facebook to help them censor free speech.""

""I have been talking about in addition to our weekly meetings, doing a monthly misinfo/debunking meeting, with maybe claim topics communicated a few days prior so that you can bring in the matching experts and chat casually for 30 minutes or so. Is that something you'd be interested in?"" a Facebook employee wrote to the CDC on July 28, 2021.

""Yes, we would love to do that,"" a CDC official responded.

The Biden White House has repeatedly denounced health misinformation spread on social media platforms. In July 2021, the U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy sounded the alarm on ""disinformation"" on social media and said the Biden administration would ask technology companies to ""monitor misinformation more closely"" and ""take action against misinformation super-spreaders on their platforms.""

A July 23, 2021 email shows that after Murthy made that announcement, Meta responded by removing accounts tied to the so-called ""disinfo dozen,"" a group of individuals that Democratic lawmakers had identified as the chief spreaders of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. Among them were Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Dr. Joseph Mercola, and Ty and Charlene Bollinger.



Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt accused the Biden administration of colluding with social media companies to ""censor freedom of speech.""



""We have already received a number of documents that clearly prove that the federal government has an incestuous relationship with social media companies and clearly coordinate to censor freedom of speech, but we’re not done,"" Schmitt said in a statement Thursday.

""The Department of Justice is cowering behind executive privilege and has refused to turn over communications between the highest-ranking Biden Administration officials and social media companies. That’s why, yesterday, we asked the Court to compel the Department of Justice to produce those records. We’re just getting started – stay tuned,” he added.



Meta and Twitter were reached for comment but did not respond before publication.

TheBlaze also contacted the CDC and Department of Health and Human Services but did not receive an immediate response.

Empty streets & air raids in northern Japan after North Korea fires a ballistic missile overhead,"On October 3, just days after Vice President Kamala Harris' visit to the Korean Peninsula's Demilitarized Zone, North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan — the first time it has done so in five years.

The missile, believed to be the Hwasong-12, proved capable of reaching Guam. It was airborne for 20 minutes, reached an altitude of 620 miles (over twice as high as the International Space Station) and ultimately traveled 2,800 miles before smashing into the Pacific Ocean.

Upon detecting the launch, Japanese officials halted trains in the northern Hokkaido and Aomori regions and urged citizens to take shelter.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's office indicated that a missile was ""believed to have been launched from North Korea"" and that citizens should ""evacuate to the inside of a building or go to the basement.""

The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo reportedly cautioned Americans in the area that there was a possibility the missile was headed toward Japan.

Later, Japanese officials acknowledged that ""the aforementioned missile is believed to have passed through the Pacific Ocean.""

Condemnation

The U.S., Japanese, and South Korean governments quickly condemned the attacks.

Kishida stated that the ""firing, which followed a recent series of launches by North Korea, is a reckless act and I strongly condemn it.""

The Japanese prime minister was referencing several earlier launches of short-range ballistic missiles by the communist regime into the East Sea, including two fired just hours after the U.S. vice president's departure from South Korea last week.

South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol indicated that the regime's ""reckless nuclear provocations"" would be met by a stern response.

Adrienne Watson, the spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, stated that ""the United States strongly condemns the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) dangerous and reckless decision to launch a long-range missile over Japan.""

Watson added that the act was ""destabilizing"" to the region and in contravention of United Nations Security Council resolutions.

The Security Council previously called on the communist regime to ""cease its illicit activity"" and voted 15-0 to sanction the rogue nation.

In response to the imposition of parallel U.S. sanctions against North Korea in 2017, Pyongyang responded: ""The U.S. mainland will sink into an unimaginable sea of fire on the day when it dares to touch our country by stupidly causing mischief and brandishing its nuclear and sanctions clubs.""

The regime also threatened to hit U.S. military bases in Guam with the same type of missile believed to have been fired this week.

Responding to these threats to the U.S. homeland in a speech to the U.N., on September 19, 2017, former President Donald Trump stated: ""The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.""

North Korea withdrew from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003, after the U.S. alleged the regime was pursuing an illegal uranium enrichment program. It refuses to return to nuclear diplomacy with the U.S.

This latest missile launch is reportedly another step toward the regime's test of a nuclear weapon, expected to occur after China's communist party congress starting on October 16.

Adrienne Watson emphasized that the U.S. ""will continue its efforts to limit [North Korea's] ability to advance its prohibited ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction programs, including with allies and U.N. partners.""

Military response

The U.S. and South Korea quickly responded to the communist regime's first missile launch with what the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff characterized as a ""combined attack squadron flight and precision bombing drill.""

Four U.S. F-16 fighter jets and four South Korean F-15s fired on an uninhabited island in the Yellow Sea. The drill evidenced the allies' ability to accurately obliterate communist targets with ""overwhelming force"" and ""to respond resolutely to any provocation from North Korea.""



Last week, the two countries also conducted joint military exercises, in which the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan participated. The North Korean regime allegedly regarded these exercises as invasion rehearsals.

On October 1, the 7th Fleet conducted exercises with Canada and Japan, reiterating its ""commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.""

In response to the latest missile launch, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command stated: ""The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts,"" noting further that while ""the event does not pose a threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we will continue to monitor the situation.""

USINDOPACOM added that the ""U.S. commitments to the defense of Japan and the [Republic of Korea] remain ironclad.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/empty-streets-air-raids-in-northern-japan-after-north-korea-fires-a-ballistic-missile-overhead,2022-10-04
"EPA-associated agency testing air for toxins allegedly got hundreds of locals near site of Norfolk Southern chemical inferno to sign contract to 'indemnify, release and hold harmless' testing groups","A resident of the Ohio village where derailed Norfolk Southern train cars were altogether transformed into a toxic inferno told nationally syndicated radio host and co-founder of Blaze Media Glenn Beck that U.S. Environmental Protection Agency affiliates were pushing contracts on locals, purportedly looking to minimize liability around air monitoring tests.

What's the background?



Katlyn Schwarzwaelder is a resident of East Palestine, Ohio, the epicenter of Norfolk Southern Railways' recent ecological disaster, which reportedly killed countless animals in the area and has left a number of locals complaining of bleary eyes and breathing difficulties.

Schwarzwaelder also operates the Von Schwarz Doberman Kennel in nearby Darlington, Pennsylvania, a little over a mile away from the blast site.

Chemical and Engineering News reported that Schwarzwaelder, who managed to get her dogs and horse out of the area, has taken calls from locals who have observed fish, chickens, foxes, dogs, and other animals dying without warning in the aftermath of the derailment and controlled breach.

""I got a call yesterday from a person who lives 1.5 miles away from the derailment area,” she said. “They let their 2-year-old healthy dog out to go to the bathroom, and the dog never returned inside. He was dead in the yard.""

While Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R), Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and other officials have announced that evacuated residents in and around East Palestine can now safely return home, Schwarzwaelder isn't so sure, particularly when at least one gas used as a weapon of mass slaughter in World War One was released overhead.

TheBlaze previously reported that the thick column of smoke that darkened the sky above East Palestine after the derailment contained fumes from the toxic chemicals stored in the wrecked cars, such as vinyl chloride, hydrogen chloride, and phosgene.

The EPA also cautioned Norfolk Southern that an additional three chemicals were aboard the breached and derailed trains: ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylhexyl acrylate, and isobutylene.

Silverado Caggiano, a hazardous materials specialist, told WKBN that ethylhexyl acrylate is a carcinogen that can cause burning and irritation in the skin and eyes, as well as breathing problems. He noted that isobutylene can also cause dizziness and drowsiness if inhaled.

Phosgene, used in warfare at the turn of the 20th century, can result in chest constriction and choking.

Some of the other toxins released can have similarly debilitating and deadly consequences.

After residents were coaxed into returning home to East Palestine, Norfolk Southern- and EPA-associated groups reportedly continued to test the air for potentially harmful toxins.

Broad contracts

In conversation with Glenn Beck Wednesday, Schwarzwaelder indicated that East Palestine residents were told by Norfolk [Southern Railway] personnel ""that the agencies that were coming to our homes to test were from independent laboratories.""

Despite this suggestion, Schwarzwaelder noted that an individual with the environmental consulting firm CTEH LLC had been camped out front of her house on the night of the derailment, who told her, ""We follow around the railroad when they make mistakes and they are happy to have us here.""

Those testing Schwarzwaelder's air reportedly handed her a release form authorizing ""Norfolk Southern, its affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, contractors, associated environmental professionals, and assisting local, state, and federal agencies, including but not limited to CTEH LLC and any of their personnel (collectively, 'Monitoring Team') to access the Property for air monitoring or environmental sampling.""

""Landowner agrees to indemnify, release, and hold harmless Unified Command from and against any and all legal claims, including for personal injury or property damage, arising from Monitoring Team's performance of air monitoring or environmental sampling at the Property on the date of signature below,"" the contract added.

While the contracts appear specific to the ""Monitoring Team's performance of air monitoring or environmental sampling,"" it is presently unclear whether the legalese may be broad enough to cover injuries resulting from inaccurate measurements.

Furthermore, it is unclear whether lawyers for the railway or others named as members of the ""Monitoring Team"" could at some later stage suggest that inaccurate measurements for which their affiliates would be indemnified — contra the derailment and subsequent controlled breach of dangerous fumes — were ultimately responsible for potential injuries and damages (e.g., carcinomas, breathing issues, and crop failures).

Schwarzwaelder refused to sign the release form, but indicated 340 other residents did sign the document.

""My heart just breaks for these people. We don't know the long-term repercussions of what these chemicals can do in our air, to our environment, to our homes, to our businesses. And they signed their rights away in the hopes that they're getting help and the right answers from these organizations,"" Schwarzwaelder told Beck.

""What I can tell you first hand is that CTEH, the affiliate of Norfolk that came to test the air, was followed by the EPA. ... We said, 'Can the EPA by themselves come into our kennel? We do not sign this paper,' and 'Can they test themselves because they are a government organization that has the ability, they have the testing equipment with them?' And the answer was, 'Absolutely not.'""

Contamination and liability

The EPA sent Norfolk Southern a general notice of potential liability over the weekend, outlining EPA cleanup actions and the possibility that the railway will have to foot the bill, reported CBS News.

With schools of fish floating belly-up down nearby streams and rivers, residents are now especially concerned about possible water contamination.



CBS News reported that this fear has been exacerbated by a 2019 drinking water source assessment conducted by the Ohio EPA that indicated East Palestine's source of drinking water has a ""high susceptibility to contamination"" because of a lack of clay helping protect the aquifer and ""the presence of significant potential contaminant sources in the protection area.""

The assessment notes, ""This susceptibility means that under currently existing conditions, the likelihood of the aquifer becoming contaminated is relatively high.""

WKBN reported that the EPA recently castigated Norfolk Southern for simply covering up contaminated soil in the aftermath of the derailment.

""Five railcar tankers of vinyl chloride were intentionally breached; the vinyl chloride was diverted to an excavated trench and then burned off. Areas of contaminated soil and free liquids were observed and potentially covered and/or filled during reconstruction of the rail line including portions of the trench /burn pit that was used for the open burn off of vinyl chloride,"" said the letter.

According to an EPA fact sheet, vinyl chloride — one of the primary toxins spilled and burned up over East Palestine — ""will be expected to be highly mobile in soil and it may leach to the groundwater. It may be subject to biodegradation under anaerobic conditions such as exists in flooded soil and groundwater.""

""Based on epidemiological and animal studies, vinyl chloride is carcinogenic in humans when inhaled, and it is considered to be a human carcinogen from oral exposure,"" the fact sheet added.

NYC Democratic Mayor Eric Adams' aide mugged in broad daylight while scouting location for mayoral event: Report,"An aide for New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams was mugged in broad daylight Tuesday while scouting a Brooklyn location for a planned Adams visit, law enforcement sources told the New York Post.

What are the details?

The victim — a member of Adam’s advance team — even warned the crooks their actions were a bad idea since he's an Adams guy, a high-ranking police source added to the paper.

“You don’t want to do this. I work for the mayor,” he told the two muggers, the Post reported.

The response? One of the crooks simply lifted his shirt, which revealed the butt of a gun tucked in his waistband, the source added to the paper.

When the victim refused to turn over his wallet and cellphone, the robbers pushed him to the ground, sources told the Post, after which they grabbed the items and fled.

One of the muggers was described as a black male wearing a blue and white sweatshirt who hightailed it from the scene on a Citi Bike, sources added to the paper. The other suspect was described as a black male wearing sunglasses and a blue mask, the Post noted.

The mugging took place around 10:30 a.m. on a traffic island at the intersection of Navy and York Streets, sources told the paper, adding that the victim walked one block south to an entrance at the former Navy Yard, found a security guard, and called 911.

More from the Post:

Tuesday’s mugging came amid a surge in crime since Adams, a former NYPD cop, was elected last year after running on a pledge to restore law and order to Gotham.



As of June 26, major crimes across the five boroughs were up 37.8% this year compared to the same period in 2021, with robberies rising an even higher 39.4 %, according to official NYPD CompStat data.



The victim was identified by sources as a Manhattan resident who was hired by former Mayor Bill de Blasio last year. [...]



He’s been spotted by The Post among Adams’ official entourage at recent events and a former City Hall colleague described him as a “hard worker” and all-around “good guy.”

"Texas, Arizona set the record straight after NYC mayor accuses them of bussing migrants to Big Apple","New York City Mayor Eric Adams is begging for the federal government's help over an influx of asylum-seekers in the Big Apple, using the opportunity to take shots at Texas and Arizona.

What is Adams saying?

Adams released a statement on Tuesday demanding ""federal resources immediately"" to address the influx of migrants.

The statement said New York City has experienced a ""sharp increase"" of migrants heading to the city, with more than 2,800 entering the city's shelter system. By city law, individuals without a home are obligated to a bed provided by the city.

Currently, New York City is experiencing a marked increase in the number of asylum seekers who are arriving from Latin America and other regions. In some instances, families are arriving on buses sent by the Texas and Arizona governments, while in other cases, it appears that individuals are being sent by the federal government.



In order to both meet the legal mandate as a right-to-shelter city and provide high-quality shelter and services for those who enter our system, New York City needs additional federal resources immediately.

Politico reported the number of people sleeping in New York City homeless shelters has risen more than 3,000 people over the last three months, with the majority of that increase coming over the past six weeks.

How did Texas and Arizona respond?

Both states denied transporting migrants to New York City. However, they have been sending them to Washington, D.C.

""Mayor Adams needs to get his facts straight and pay closer attention to what’s really occurring because our nation’s security depends on it. The State of Arizona is providing voluntary transportation for asylum seekers only to Washington, D.C., not NY,"" Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey responded.

""President Biden created the crisis at the border — he’s failed to respond to calls for action and refuses to even visit the border, so we’re bringing the issue a little closer to home for him,"" he added. ""The President’s policies have placed overwhelming burdens on Arizona communities. It’s convenient that these liberal mayors are finally speaking up on this humanitarian crisis once it affects their communities, even though our program does not charter to New York City.""

Meanwhile, Renae Eze, a spokesperson for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), described Adams' claims as ""baseless political accusations.""

""If these Democrat mayors are now that concerned about having migrants in their cities, they should call on President Biden to do his job and secure the border, instead of attacking Texas with baseless political accusations,"" Eze said, according to Politico.

In response, a spokesman for the mayor's office did not address the fact that Texas and Arizona disputed Adam's claims, but instead said Abbott and Ducey ""should have more compassion for those seeking asylum in this country.""

""If they need financial help, they should ask for it instead of heartlessly sending asylum seekers on their way with a one-way ticket,"" the spokesman added, WNBC-TV reported.

"Eric Trump speaks out about Mar-a-Lago raid, accuses FBI agents of shady behavior: 'Turn off all security cameras'","Eric Trump, son of former President Donald Trump, disclosed new details Wednesday about the FBI's raid on Mar-a-Lago.

What did Eric Trump say?

Speaking with the Daily Mail, Eric Trump revealed that FBI agents initially refused to show Trump's attorneys a copy of the search warrant that authorized them to raid Mar-a-Lago for allegedly classified documents that were purportedly being stored at the south Florida resort.

According to Eric, FBI agents forced Trump attorney Christina Bobb to wait at the end of the Mar-a-Lago driveway while FBI agents searched the property.

""There's 30 agents there,"" Eric recalled. ""They told our lawyer, 'You have to leave the property right now. Turn off all security cameras.'

""They would not give her the search warrant, so they showed it to her from about 10 feet away,"" Eric alleged. ""They would not give her a copy of the search warrant.""

Eric said that Mar-a-Lago staff refused to comply with the demand to shut off surveillance cameras. Thus, Eric alleged, there is footage showing FBI agents searching areas of the property they ""shouldn't have been.""

What did Bobb say?

Bobb has corroborated Eric Trump's claims.

She explained in an interview on Tuesday that FBI agents initially refused to show her the search warrant, but they eventually did so. However, investigators did not disclose the probable cause that led a federal magistrate judge to approve the warrant.

Still, Bobb described the warrant as ""thin"" and suggested federal authorities used the raid for nefarious purposes.

""I think this is clearly a situation where they're looking for a way that they can easily prosecute President Trump,"" Bobb claimed. ""They want to do it under a national security-type guise because they can hide things from the public and they can say, 'Oh, we can't tell you. We can't give you the details because it's confidential information, subject to national security concerns, so we can't tell you, but we're just going to prosecute [Trump].""

Speculation is running rampant because the Justice Department has refused to speak publicly about the raid. The narrative is thus being steered by law enforcement leaks.

One DOJ source who spoke to Newsweek, for example, described the raid as a ""spectacular backfire,"" because the FBI hoped for it to be low-key, but instead it has energized Republicans and triggered accusations of a weaponized Justice Department.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/eric-trump-mar-a-lago-raid,2022-08-11
"ESPN commentator Sarah Spain blasts 'bigoted' Tampa Bay Rays players who refused to wear Pride Month rainbow patches, rips their 'religious exemption BS'","ESPN commentator Sarah Spain on Monday blasted Tampa Bay Rays baseball players who refused to wear Pride Month rainbow patches on their uniforms as ""bigoted"" toward LBGTQ people and said they're full of ""religious exemption BS.""

What are the details?

During the ""Around the Horn"" segment, host Tony Reali read part of a statement from one of the players who decided against wearing the rainbow-colored patches — pitcher Jason Adam, who called it a ""faith-based decision"":

So it’s a hard decision. Because ultimately we all said what we want is them to know that all are welcome and loved here. But when we put it on our bodies, I think a lot of guys decided that it’s just a lifestyle that maybe — not that they look down on anybody or think differently — it’s just that maybe we don’t want to encourage it if we believe in Jesus, who’s encouraged us to live a lifestyle that would abstain from that behavior ...

The rest of Adams' statement — which Reali didn't read — added: ""... just like [Jesus] encourages me as a heterosexual male to abstain from sex outside of the confines of marriage. It’s no different. It’s not judgmental. It’s not looking down. It’s just what we believe the lifestyle he’s encouraged us to live, for our good, not to withhold. But again, we love these men and women, we care about them, and we want them to feel safe and welcome here.”

What did Spain say?

When Reali asked Spain for her take on the controversy, she replied — as if reading from a prepared statement — that ""Pride is about inclusion, so you don't love them, and you don't welcome them if you're not willing to wear the patch. And calling it a 'lifestyle' reveals to me that you've done not even a modicum of research or understanding on this topic. It's what tends to happen when a privileged class isn’t affected by things. This is not just about baseball. That religious exemption BS which is used in sport and otherwise also allows for people to be denied health care, jobs, apartments, children, prescriptions, all sorts of rights.""

Spain followed that up with some rather hard-to-follow declarations: ""And so we have to stop tiptoeing around it because we’re trying to protect people who are trying to be bigoted from asking for them to be exempt from it, when the very people that they are bigoted against are suffering the consequences.""

Huh?

Reali apparently was looking for some clarification when he replied, ""When you say 'trying to be bigoted'"" before Spain jumped back in: ""They're trying to use religious exemptions to affect the opportunities, services, available resources for people who are LGBTQ+.""

She added that the Rays players are ""double talking if they're saying 'you're welcome' while also saying that 'we don't encourage' or 'we disagree with it,' especially when they're devout people of every single religion that also welcome and are open to people who are born gay.""

AROUND THE AROUND 6/6/22 Draymond Green's foul is a dirty foul as Warriors beat Celtics in G2 youtu.be

Anything else?

Others on the left were equally incensed at the Rays' players who chose not to wear the Pride colors on their jerseys. LBGTQ sportswriter Cyd Zeigler tweeted, ""Will someone please show me the Bible passage that says 'Thou shalt not wear a rainbow on thou's clothing'..."" Zeigler also tweeted that ""players don't get to just choose what uniform they wear. That's the point of the word 'uniform.' Welcome to sports.""

Outkick opined that the ""Around the Horn"" program ""has become the go-to ESPN show to spread woke talking points without an ounce of pushback,"" and that Reali ""handpicked the wokest 'talents' on ESPN’s roster to make up the show’s rotation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/espn-spain-rips-bigoted-rays,2022-06-07
Evacuation area extended: Black smoke billows as crews release toxic chemicals from derailed tankers in Ohio,"Plumes of black smoke billowed over an Ohio neighborhood Monday as crews released toxic chemicals from derailed train cars in danger of exploding, multiple outlets reported.

“You need to leave, you just need to leave. This is a matter of life and death,” Gov. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) said in a press conference earlier.



""Anyone who remains"" in the impacted area faces ""grave danger of death,"" according to a statement released by Governors Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) and Josh Shapiro (D-Pa.) Monday.

Officials in the area were ""knocking on doors"" urging people to leave in the days since the derailment. Those with children who refuse to leave, DeWine said at a press conference, would be ""subject to arrest.""

No injuries were reported in the derailment of the 50-car Norfolk Southern train last Friday, WTAE reported. The train, going from Madison, Illinois, to Conway, Pennsylvania, derailed near the Pennsylvania state line.



Ohio's and Pennsylvania's governors ordered an extension of the evacuation area Monday ahead of the controlled release, which officials estimated could burn for one to three hours.

DeWine, faced with ""no good choices,"" opted for a controlled release of the chemicals and ordered an evacuation of an area one mile by two miles surrounding East Palestine, Ohio. The evacuation area includes both Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Vinyl chloride, the deadly chemical reportedly carried in five of the derailed train's cars, is unstable. If it were to explode, the ensuing disbursement of shrapnel and toxic fumes could be deadly.

""[The railroad] describes an explosion [with one or more of the cars] as potentially catastrophic,"" DeWine said in a press conference.

Vinyl chloride is potentially deadly if inhaled, making a controlled release risky as well.

""The controlled breach of several rail cars has been completed successfully under the supervision of experts and first responders,"" Norfolk Southern said in an update. ""We have been, and will continue, monitoring air quality with the Ohio EPA.""

""The NTSB is the lead, federal investigative agency for this derailment,"" NTSB board member Michael Graham said at a media briefing Saturday.

The NTSB released footage of the smoldering wreckage, seen below.



National Transportation Safety Board

""Our team methodically and systematically reviews all evidence and considers all potential factors to determine the probable cause and make any necessary safety recommendations.""

Ohio's Emergency Management Agency continues to provide public updates on the situation.

"Ex-Media Matters employee alleges colleagues covered up sexual misconduct, refuses to retract claims after lawsuit threat","A former employee of the left-wing watchdog group Media Matters for America accused his ex-colleagues of covering up a sexual misconduct incident in social media posts Monday.

Timothy Johnson, formerly a senior writer at Media Matters, was threatened with a lawsuit from his former employer over a Twitter thread in which Johnson said that an editorial director at the group ""covered up for a man who preyed on our colleagues.""

The thread began with Johnson announcing, ""After about 10 years, I no longer work at Media Matters.""

In a lengthy and at times vague series of tweets, Johnson alleged that Media Matters editorial director Ben Dimiero covered up sexual misconduct by another unnamed employee who is no longer working for the group.

""I am very very fortunate in my circumstances that I did not end up on the street the next day as a consequence of what my former boss @bendimiero did. I bet a lot of people would have,"" Johnson wrote.

""My experience has been that the vast, vast majority of past colleagues at the @mmfa, even including most executives and managers, were wonderful, kind people to work with.

""But you two clowns? I don’t think so. Do either of you want to talk about April 4? I doubt it,"" he continued, referencing an unknown incident.



""Ben: Do you want to talk about how you covered up for a man who preyed on our colleagues?"" Johnson wrote, addressing Dimiero.

He continued:

This man suddenly resigned. And to my shame, I went out with him after work that day and we all got really drunk. He told me a sob story, I bought it, and the night ended with him being carried up to his apartment.



Not too long later, I learned the truth of why he 'resigned.' He was dismissed because of his sexual misconduct. But only after years of people in authority positions knowing about what he was doing.



He apparently was still allowed to come into the office (to participate in a poker game). I ran into him on the street, just outside the office, a month or two later after I learned this. He gave me a friendly hello.



I didn’t reciprocate. I hope (I am no stranger to beating the fuck out of a predator) that I put the fear of god into him. The smirk on his face didn’t last long. I heard he didn’t come back to the office after that. I never saw him again, I hope he never did come by again.



I am ashamed that I did not share this publicly until now. It most likely makes me a clown myself. But brass tacks, I didn’t, and I’m sorry.

Later on Monday morning, Johnson posted screenshots of a letter he received from Media Matters attorney Ben Stafford informing him that he had breached a contract negotiating the end of his employment. The letter stated that Johnson was fired for cause. Media Matters demanded that he ""immediately remove the Twitter thread you posted this morning about MMFA and your former manager.""

Stafford wrote that Johnson had been fired for ""abandoning work shifts"" without proper notice and ""insubordinate and bullying communications"" sent to his coworkers. As part of the agreement ending Johnson's employment, he was not to ""directly or indirectly, disparage MMFA, its officers, directors, or employees, or MMFA's business, and will not encourage any third parties to do so.""

""You have unquestionably violated this obligation,"" the letter states. It called the accusation against Dimiero ""false and defamatory"" and said Johnson's tweets ""indisputably disparage both MMFA and a current MMFA employee in clear breach of the Agreement.""

The letter states that Media Matters reserves the right to sue Johnson for monetary damages if he did not delete his tweets by close of business Monday.

Johnson's thread is still on Twitter as of Tuesday. He maintains ""every statement within the thread is true.""

Multiple media outlets and fact-checkers falsely claim that Clarence Thomas repeated a 'debunked' COVID-19 vaccine claim,"Headlines at multiple news outlets misled readers on Thursday by claiming that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas repeated a ""debunked"" claim about COVID-19 vaccines in a dissenting opinion.

At least three mainstream news organizations falsely stated that Thomas claimed COVID-19 vaccines contain the cells of aborted babies in an opinion dissenting from the Supreme Court's refusal to take up a religious liberty case challenging New York's COVID-19 vaccine mandate launched by 16 health care workers.



""Clarence Thomas claimed in a dissenting opinion that Covid vaccines are derived from the cells of 'aborted children,'"" Politico tweeted Thursday, sharing an article with the headline, ""Clarence Thomas suggests Covid vaccines are developed using cells of ‘aborted children.’""

Similar headlines appeared at Axios and at NBC News, and the misleading claim was spread by Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler and others.

These headlines are wrong. Thomas was not making a claim about the COVID-19 vaccines. He was quoting the petitioners' stated beliefs about how taking the vaccine would violate their religious conscience.



In 2021, a group of anonymous health care workers sued New York, arguing that the state's vaccine mandate violated their religious conscience rights. The state requires that all health care workers show proof of vaccination to continue in their employment.

“They object on religious grounds to all available COVID–19 vaccines because they were developed using cell lines derived from aborted children,” Thomas wrote in a dissenting opinion after the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

Although Thomas was clearly citing the argument of the petitioners, reporters asserted he was himself claiming that COVID-19 vaccines contain cells from aborted children.

Paradoxically, the facts in some of these reports support what Thomas wrote even though the sensational headlines suggest he was wrong.

In Politico's article, for example, breaking news reporter Kelly Hooper writes, ""None of the Covid-19 vaccines in the United States contain the cells of aborted fetuses. Cells obtained from elective abortions decades ago were used in testing during the Covid vaccine development process, a practice that is common in vaccine testing — including for the rubella and chickenpox vaccinations."" (Emphasis added.)

If it's the case that cell lines obtained from abortions decades ago were used in vaccine testing, then the petitioner's assertion that the vaccines ""were developed using cell lines derived from aborted children,"" which Thomas quoted, is a factual statement.

Ed Whelan, a senior fellow with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, observed that NBC News twisted Thomas' words to make it look like he was repeating a debunked claim, then later appeared to agree with what the justice actually wrote.

""Perhaps authors are claiming that Thomas's phrasing somehow means that the cell lines used now must have been immediately, rather than ultimately, derived from aborted children. But that's a bad-faith reading of what he wrote,"" Whelan said.

Clarence Thomas' dissenting opinion quoted the arguments made by petitioners to the Supreme Court for a case concerning whether New York's vaccine mandate violated religious liberty rights. He did not advance a claim for himself that COVID-19 vaccines were made using cells from ""aborted children.""

Headlines suggesting that he did are false.

Report: Dem county chairman who refused to boost security at SCOTUS justices' homes ordered police to guard his own home shortly after,"The Democratic Virginia official who refused to boost security outside the homes of U.S. Supreme Court justices amid pro-abortion protests last week turned around and ordered police protection around his own home shortly after, the Washington Free Beacon reported on Friday.

Citing sources, the news outlet claimed that Jeff McKay, who serves as chairman of Fairfax County's Board of Supervisors, ordered patrol officers to stand guard outside his home for a week after the protests after he allegedly received threats.

McKay's decision to order protection around his own home stands in stark contrast to his refusal to grant Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin's request to block protests around the justices' homes last week.

Hundreds of pro-abortion activists descended on the homes of conservative justices earlier this month following the leaked draft opinion showing that a majority of the bench had decided to overturn Roe v. Wade, a decision that would end the federal right to an abortion.

The angry protesters shouted and waved signs near the homes of Justices Brett Kavanaugh and John Roberts in Montgomery County, Maryland, as well as the homes of Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett in Fairfax County, Virginia.

But McKay did nothing to prevent the picketing and protesting despite the fact that such activity appears to be considered illegal under both Virginia and U.S. law. In a Washington Post op-ed, the chairman said he opted against setting up a security perimeter outsides the justices' homes because the Virginia law that prohibits ""picketing"" a ""residence or dwelling place"" would ""not hold up in court and is likely unconstitutional.""

He added that the U.S. law that prohibits protesting with the intent to sway a judicial decision should be enforced by federal authorities and argued in a letter that setting up a security perimeter would violate neighborhood residents' Fourth Amendment rights and protesters' First Amendment rights.

However, such careful thought didn't seem to influence his decision to order police protection outside his own home shortly thereafter. In response to questioning from the Free Beacon, a McKay spokesman said only that he ""has full faith in the professionals of the [Fairfax County Police Department] to carry out their mission of ensuring public safety and protecting people's constitutional rights.""

The Justice Department's U.S. Marshals Service has since ""accelerated the provision of around-the-clock security at the homes of all Justices"" upon request from Youngkin and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R).",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fairfax-official-refused-security-at-scotus-justice-homes,2022-05-20
"Fauci and other top scientists had another secret COVID-19 origins call, records reveal","A group of the world's top virologists held secretive private discussions in February 2020 on ""all theories"" of the origins of COVID-19 days after they began drafting an influential article that would attempt to debunk the lab-leak theory, newly reported emails reveal.



The group was led by Wellcome Trust Director Jeremy Farrar and University of Sydney virologist Edward Holmes. Members of these discussions included then-National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins and the U.S. government's top pandemic spokesman, Dr. Anthony Fauci.

A Freedom of Information Act request by U.S. Right to Know reveals that their discussions on the pandemic's origins continued on Feb. 7, 2020, three days after an article purporting to show the virus ""is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus"" was drafted and a week after a previously reported conference call on Feb. 1.



“Eddie Holmes and a small group have been looking extensively at the origins and evolution of n-CoV including all theories,” Farrar wrote to National Academy of Medicine President Victor Dzau on Feb. 8, 2020, using an abbreviation for ""novel coronavirus"" in reference to the emerging SARS-Cov-2 virus.

“This is the latest summary, written as part of a series of [teleconference] discussions we set up and included [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci] and [National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins] as well as a small group from USA, UK, Europe and Australia,” Farrar wrote.

The records obtained by U.S. Right to Know included six pages of notes from the Feb. 7 discussion, but the material is fully redacted.

The newly unearthed records reveal that scientists continued to consider the lab-leak origins theory of COVID-19 in private while working to dismiss the theory in public. But exactly what they discussed remains unknown, hidden behind redacted records and repeated refusals to comment.



There are two competing theories of the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. The first is that the virus has natural origins — that it was carried by an animal host and evolved to be contagious among human beings. This is the view widely accepted by most scientists.

The second theory is that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a Chinese lab that studies coronaviruses, may have genetically manipulated one of their virus samples, creating SARS-CoV-2, and somehow that engineered virus leaked from the lab. This theory was maligned as a crackpot conspiracy theory by most public health officials.

Neither hypothesis of the pandemic's origins has been definitively proven or ruled out. An intelligence review by President Joe Biden's administration determined the theories were ""equally plausible"" and that the lab-leak hypothesis was ""a credible line of inquiry.""



In previously reported email chains, Farrar, Fauci, and other public health officials were shown to have discussed the possibility that the Wuhan coronavirus was ""engineered."" But after holding private conference calls on the matter, many of those involved waged a vigorous public campaign to discredit the lab-leak theory, apparently with no outstanding scientific reasons for doing so.

That public campaign began with a Feb. 19, 2020, statement signed by Farrar and other top health and medical professionals that strongly condemned ""conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin"". It continued with various public statements from Fauci and others that the lab-leak theory was a ""conspiracy,"" which led social media companies to censor any discussion of the possible lab origins of COVID-19.

Perhaps the most significant blow to the credibility of the lab-leak theory came on March 17, 2020, with the publication of a letter titled, ""The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2."" This letter sought to definitively squash the idea that COVID-19 came from a laboratory setting. ""We do not believe any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,"" the authors wrote, words that were seized by the national media and used to attack President Donald Trump because he had made statements supportive of the lab-leak theory.

Yet just one month before the ""proximal origins"" letter was published, three of its five authors had privately concluded that aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were ""inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory"" and that ""some of the features (potentially) look engineered."" Their opinion was revealed in a Feb. 1 email to Fauci, first published by BuzzFeed News.

A subsequent Feb. 4 email from Farrar to Fauci and Collins revealed he was split ""50-50"" between the natural origins and lab-leak theories and that Holmes was ""60-40"" in favor of the lab origin.



Emails transcribed by Republican staff on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform show that on the same day Farrar sent a draft of the ""proximal origins"" paper with Fauci.

Farrar, Fauci, and the rest have stated that while they were initially open to all theories of the virus' origins, their change of opinion and embrace of the natural origins theory reflected the weight of scientific evidence.



However, there is a potential conflict of interest in how Fauci and Collins shaped the narrative that the lab-leak theory of COVID-19's origins was a ""conspiracy theory."" The nonprofit group EcoHealth Alliance had received federal grants from Fauci's agency to study coronaviruses and had sub-awarded nearly $600,000 to the Wuhan lab in the years preceding the pandemic.

Whether the Wuhan lab used that grant money to conduct risky gain-of-function research to create new artificially enhanced viruses is a hotly contested claim, with Fauci and others denying it and Republican lawmakers like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) accusing them of lying.



The truth is likely redacted.

Dr. Fauci defends China from blame for COVID-19 pandemic — but takes shot at Trump for 'anti-China approach',"Dr. Anthony Fauci was confronted on Sunday about communist China's alleged cover-up of the COVID-19 pandemic origins.

The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden responded by taking a shot at the Trump administration.

What did Fauci say?

Speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Fauci seemingly defended China's refusal to be transparent, even apparently justifying it because the Chinese are ""suspicious"" of anyone trying to blame them for the pandemic.

""The Chinese — not necessarily the scientists that we know and we have dealt with and collaborated with productively for decades — but the whole establishment ... even when there's nothing at all to hide, they act secretive, which absolutely triggers an appropriate suspicion,"" Fauci said.

But he quickly dismissed the possibility that COVID-19 was anything but a ""natural occurrence.""

""If you look at the examination by highly qualified international scientists, with no political agendas, they've published in peer-reviewed journals that the evidence is quite strong that this is a natural occurrence,"" Fauci said.

To uncover the origins of COVID-19, then, Fauci said there must be collaboration between China and the rest of the world in a ""non-accusatory way,"" which was a clear shot at former President Donald Trump, who vocally blamed China for the pandemic.

""What happens is that if you look at the anti-China approach that clearly the Trump administration had right from the very beginning, and the accusatory nature,"" Fauci said, ""the Chinese, they're going to flinch back and say, 'No, I'm sorry, we're not going to talk to you about it,' which is not correct.""

When host Margaret Brennan noted the Chinese are not cooperating with the Biden administration either — thus suggesting their lack of transparency is not rooted in Trump's ""accusatory nature"" — Fauci doubled down on his claims.

""I think that horse is out of the barn and they're very suspicious of anybody trying to accuse them,"" he said.

What else did he say?

In another interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Fauci was more explicit in denying that China is to blame.

""I don't mean this in a broad pejorative way, but in anything that we've had to do over decades — whether it's bird flu, H5N1, H7N9, or the original SARS in 2002 — even when there's nothing to hide, [the Chinese government] act in a suspicious, non-transparent way just probably because they don't want to make it look like there's a blame,"" Fauci said.

""When the reality is, if something evolves in your country, it’s not to blame, but let's find out what went on so we can be transparent about it and prevent it for the next time happening,"" he added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-blasts-trump-covid-anti-china,2022-11-28
Fauci denies responsibility for school closures in interview after recommending lockdown policies,"Outgoing White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci denied responsibility for school closures during the pandemic, insisting in an interview on Sunday he had ""nothing to do"" with it.



Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the government's chief spokesman during the COVID-19 pandemic, was asked by ABC News' Jonathan Karl whether it was a ""mistake"" to keep schools closed for as long as they were.

""I don’t want to use the word ‘mistake,’ Jon, because if I do, it gets taken out of the context that you’re asking me the question on,"" Fauci replied. ""And I don't want to do that because that's just happened too many times over the last years with me.""

Asked if the country paid ""too high a price"" with the government's pandemic response, Fauci said, ""We should realize, and have realized, that there will be deleterious collateral consequences when you do something like that.""

Fauci noted that nearly 1,500 children were killed by the coronavirus and said that public officials needed to balance safety with keeping schools open.

""You shouldn't discount that it does afflict children, so it isn't without consequence,"" Fauci said. ""If you go back, and I ask anybody to go back over the number of times that I've said we've got to do everything we can to keep the schools open; no one plays that clip. They always come back and say, 'Fauci was responsible for closing schools.' I had nothing to do [with it]— I mean, let's get down to the facts.""

""You're not the head of a school board,"" Karl suggested.

""Exactly,"" Fauci said.

Prolonged school closures and the associated learning loss and mental health impact on children have become a source of lingering resentment for concerned parents. The reluctance of many school districts to reopen in 2020 and 2021, citing guidance from public health officials like Fauci, was politically divisive and at times led to contentious showdowns between parents and school boards.

A study from the Department of Education published in September found that average reading scores for 9-year-olds fell seven points in 2022 compared to scores in 2020, Fox News reported. The decline in reading scores was the largest drop in over three decades, and the study found the first recorded decline in math scores.



While it is true that Fauci never had direct authority to close schools, his words were influential on policymakers, and his various recommendations to keep schools closed were heeded.

In April 2020, Fauci reportedly ""gave his blessing"" to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's plan to close schools citywide. He also criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) for attempting to open schools, warning that doing so would lead to an increase in infections.

Fauci also repeatedly advised through 2020 that schools in areas of high viral transmission should remain closed and children participate in virtual learning.

Sunday's interview was not the first time Fauci has been disingenuous about his policy recommendations. In an August interview with Fox News host Neil Cavuto, Fauci asserted, ""I didn't shut down anything,"" in response to a question about COVID-19 lockdowns.

He also deflected responsibility for public health guidance to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in another interview in July.

However, in October 2020 Fauci said that he recommended to President Donald Trump that ""we shut the country down"" in response to the pandemic.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-denies-responsibility-for-school-closures-in-interview-after-recommending-lockdown-policies,2022-10-17
"As Republicans prepare to launch investigations, Fauci says he will retire before end of Biden's current term","Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the White House and leading spokesman for the government on the COVID-19 pandemic, says he will retire before the end of President Joe Biden's first term.

Fauci, 81, is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, a position he has held since 1984. In an interview published Monday, he told Politico he is planning to step down after more than five decades of public service under seven presidents.

He announced his plan to retire shortly after congressional Republicans, emboldened by widespread expectations they will reclaim a majority in the House of Representatives after the election in November, have declared their intention to investigate his actions at NIAID leading up to and during the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans want to determine what role Fauci played in downplaying the lab-leak origins theory of the virus and whether his agency within the National Institute of Health funded controversial gain-of-function research.



Fauci became the face of the federal government's COVID-19 response after President Donald Trump appointed him to the White House coronavirus task force in 2020. He has served on both Trump and Biden's pandemic response teams, making regular appearances on cable news, talk shows, and podcasts to promote the government's recommendations on mask wearing and vaccination.

In these media appearances, Fauci has been a proponent of politically divisive lockdowns and mask and vaccine mandates. His critics have accused him of making contradictory statements — such as initially saying masks were useless before reversing his position — and shifting goal posts on when the country would reach herd immunity from COVID-19.



Fauci in turn has accused his critics of refusing to ""follow the science."" He has also strongly dismissed the hypothesis that COVID-19 leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China — calling it a ""conspiracy theory"" — though international investigators have since determined the lab-leak theory is a plausible hypothesis for the origins of the coronavirus.

His reasons for downplaying the lab-leak theory would be the subject of congressional investigations should Republicans gain control of Congress. Emails unearthed by GOP lawmakers revealed that in early 2020, Fauci had conferred with scientists studying the emerging coronavirus who believed it was possible the virus was ""engineered."" Despite those private admissions, Fauci and other top health officials went on to publicly denounce the lab-leak theory.

Republicans have accused Fauci of a ""cover up"" — asserting that the NIAID director intentionally cast doubts on the lab-leak theory because his agency had funded research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology through awards to the non-profit group EcoHealth Alliance. EcoHealth has been accused of funding gain-of-function experiments at the Wuhan lab — risky research that involves artificially manipulating pathogens — which some have suggested could be a possible origin for the virus that causes COVID-19.

Fauci told Politico he is preparing for inquiries from Republicans challenging his record but that they aren't a factor in his plans for retirement.

“They’re going to try and come after me, anyway. I mean, probably less so if I’m not in the job,” he said, speaking from his NIH office in Bethesda, Maryland. “I don’t make that a consideration in my career decision.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fauci-says-he-will-retire-before-end-of-biden-s-current-term-as-republicans-prepare-to-launch-investigations,2022-07-18
Washington Post anonymous sources: FBI raided former President Trump's residence in search of nuclear weapon documents. Trump: 'Hoax.',"In an article published early August 12, Washington Post reporters Devlin Barrett, Josh Dawsey, and Shane Harris claimed that anonymous sources familiar with the investigation into former President Donald Trump told them that among the items FBI agents hoped to find in their raid of Mar-a-Lago were ""classified documents relating to nuclear weapons.""

The anonymous sources cited in the piece did not provide any detail as to the nature of the information, including whether the supposed nuclear documents pertained to American capabilities and weapons or to those of other nations. The sources also did not disclose whether any such documents were discovered in the August 8 raid.

Neither the Department of Justice (DOJ) nor the FBI have commented on these allegations, advanced in part by Devlin Barrett, who was a member of the team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for coverage of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.



Trump responded to the allegations, claiming that the ""nuclear weapons issue is a Hoax, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was a hoax, two Impeachments were a Hoax, the Mueller investigation was a hoax, and much more."" He also said that ""some sleazy people are involved"" and questioned why the FBI allegedly refused to permit his lawyers and others to be present during the raid: ""Planting information anyone?""

Writer Miranda Devine and others took to Twitter to lambaste those speculating about what else may have been found in Trump's possession.

While former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani noted that the ""Biden Secret Police"" could apparently wait a weekend before searching for the alleged classified nuclear information, commentator Lisa Boothe pointed out that the DOJ had in fact waited over a year-and-a-half to do so.

Despite the suggestion that the documents sought by the DOJ had something to do with nuclear intelligence, others have suggested that they may instead pertain to alleged efforts to ""disrupt the electoral vote count on January 6.""



Some light may soon be shed on the nature of the documents sought by the FBI, given the requests by both Trump and Attorney General Merrick Garland to release the search warrant, which the latter has admitted to having personally approved in the first place.



Garland indicated on Thursday that the DOJ asked a federal court in Florida to unseal the search warrant, which was issued on August 5 by U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart and used by the FBI for its raid.

Later on August 11, Trump similarly called for the release of the documents. He wrote on TruthSocial: ""Not only will I not oppose the release of documents related to the unAmerican, unwarranted, and unnecessary raid and break-in of my home in Palm Beach, Florida, Mar-a-Lago, I am going a step further by ENCOURAGING the immediate release of those documents.""

The former president added that the documents have ""been drawn up by radical left Democrats and possible future political opponents,"" once again insinuating his intention to run in the 2024 presidential election.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbi-insiders-claim-they-sought-nuclear-documents-at-trump-residence,2022-08-12
FBI reportedly delivers subpoenas related to 2020 electors to Republican Pennsylvanian lawmakers,"The FBI reportedly delivered subpoenas related to the controversy surrounding alternate electors in the 2020 election to several Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania on Wednesday.

The action comes after the FBI served a search warrant at the Mar-a-Lago residence of former President Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida, prompting his supporters to accuse the Bureau of being politically motivated.

Various sources spoke to Pennlive about the FBI delivering subpoenas or speaking with Pennsylvania Republicans as a part of the investigation into the effort to send alternate electors to the U.S. Capitol to elect Trump rather than President Joe Biden.



Some of the lawmakers who received subpoenas were told they were not themselves the subject of the investigation, the sources told Pennlive.

On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania said that the FBI had confiscated his cell phone as part of the same investigation.

""They made no attempt to contact my lawyer, who would have made arrangements for them to have my phone if that was their wish. I'm outraged — though not surprised — that the FBI under the direction of Merrick Garland’s DOJ, would seize the phone of a sitting Member of Congress,"" Perry said in a statement.

Trump revealed the FBI raid in a scathing statement issued Monday evening and later suggested that the FBI agents were planting evidence. The warrant was served as a part of an investigation into whether Trump illegally destroyed or removed White House documents after leaving office.

Critics of the Biden administration have accused the FBI of being politically motivated in the raid on Trump's residence. The White House refused to comment on the incident except to say that they were not notified beforehand about the Mar-a-Lago raid.

"Carefully worded statement reveals FBI seized more documents from Biden property, this time his vacation home","The FBI seized an unknown number of documents from President Joe Biden's vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Wednesday.

Beginning at 8:30 a.m., FBI agents searched the property for, presumably, classified documents and other materials improperly in Biden's possession. The president's personal attorney, Bob Bauer, described the operation as a ""planned search.""

The search lasted approximately three and a half hours, according to Bauer. Though FBI agents discovered no classified documents, they seized materials dated from Biden's tenure as vice president.

""The DOJ’s planned search of the President’s Rehoboth residences, conducted in coordination and cooperation with the President’s attorneys, has concluded,"" Bauer said. ""The search was conducted from 8:30 AM to noon.

""No documents with classified markings were found,"" he added. ""Consistent with the process in Wilmington, the DOJ took for further review some materials and handwritten notes that appear to relate to his time as Vice President.""

The carefully worded statement, emphasizing that agents found nothing with classified markings, does not exclude the possibility that what agents seized was classified. Indeed, not every document or parcel with classified information, such as handwritten notes, carry the proper markings indicating that it contains classified information.

What is the background?

The search is at least the third time the DOJ has searched one of Biden's properties.

Last month, the Justice Department searched Biden's private residence in Wilmington, Delaware, turning up additional classified documents. At the time, it was believed to have been the first search.

But CBS News reported on Tuesday that FBI agents conducted a search of the Washington office where classified documents were first discovered on Nov. 2. That search was conducted sometime in ""mid-November."" It's not clear if the FBI found classified documents in that search.

It's also unclear why the Biden administration and Justice Department refused to previously disclose the search.

"FBI-SWAT veteran suspended after refusing to participate in allegedly politicized raid, claims FBI is exaggerating extremist threats","FBI Special Agent Steve Friend, a 12-year veteran of the agency and a SWAT team member, was reportedly suspended on Monday, stripped of his gun and badge, and marched out of the FBI field office in Daytona Beach, Florida. He had neither conspired against a national security adviser nor tampered with evidence, but rather refused to participate in an allegedly politicized and excessive raid or take actions he believed to contravene agency policy and trample citizens' rights.

This 37-year-old father of two is among 20 FBI whistleblowers who recently have come forward alleging that the FBI has become significantly politicized and engaged in various abuses, malpractices, and questionable tactics.

The whistleblower complaint



On Wednesday, Friend filed a whistleblower complaint with DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz. The New York Post, which obtained a copy of the complaint, reported that Friend outlined how investigations with which he was involved, related to the January 6 protests, had allegedly violated numerous FBI policies.

Some of these claims were echoed in a September 19 letter from Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), ranking member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, to FBI Dir. Christopher Wray.

Friend had allegedly been told that so-called ""domestic terrorism was a higher priority"" than preventing the victimization of children and was taken off of active investigations into child sexual exploitation and human trafficking so that he could work on J6 cases forwarded from Washington, D.C..

In the investigations he subsequently participated in, he claimed that the D.C. field office was ""manipulating"" FBI case-management protocol.

""Cases are ordinarily characterized and labeled by the originating field office,"" noted Jordan, ""with leads 'cut' to other field offices for specific assistance in that geographic location."" The FBI was, however, said to have been engaged in a ""manipulative casefile practice"" whereby it disseminated J6 cases to local field offices around the country to generate ""false and misleading crime statistics.""

According to Friend's complaint cited by Jordan, ""Instead of hundreds of investigations stemming from a single, black swan incident at the Capitol, FBI and [Department of Justice] officials point to significant increases in domestic violent extremism and terrorism around the United States.""

Jordan wrote that ""the FBI's case categorization creates the illusion that threats from [""domestic violent extremism"" or DVE] are present in jurisdictions across the nation, when in reality they all stem from the same related investigation concerning the actions at the Capitol on Jan 6.""

A potential result of this alleged ""artificial case categorization scheme"" is that the FBI leadership could ""misleadingly point to 'significant' increases in DVE threats nationwide.""

Last year, the FBI indicated that it expected ""anti-government, anti-authority violent extremists"" would ""likely pose the greatest domestic terrorism threats throughout 2021, and in fact leading into 2022.""

Citing the doubling of domestic terror investigations launched by the FBI since March 2020, earlier this year, the DOJ launched a unit specifically assigned to tackle domestic terrorism. Matthew Olsen, the assistant attorney general for national security, reiterated previous claims that there was ""a growing threat"" from those ""who ascribe to extremist anti-government and anti-authority ideologies.""

In 2021, Wray had also suggested, on the basis of what Friend has suggested are altered statistics, that investigations into DVE had increased ""significantly"" — that it ""has been metastasizing across the country for a long time now.""

Friend claimed that, as part of this scheme, he had consequently been listed as lead agent in cases with which he had little to no involvement as an investigator. Also in contravention of FBI policy, Friend said that while he had been listed as lead agent, his supervisor had not signed off on his cases.



Besides allegedly cooking statistics to exaggerate a supposed threat, Friend claimed that the agency opened domestic terrorism cases on innocent American citizens who were nowhere near the Capitol on January 6, 2021.

FBI software, he reported in his complaint, collated ""guardians,"" which are investigative tools resulting from anonymous tips sent to an FBI tip line as well as from data shared from Facebook, which the social media platform allegedly scrapes from private conversations and messages.

The Post reported that the complaint also alleges that the FBI, sometime after January 6, designated an area outside the Capitol as a restricted zone in order to justify additional prosecutions.

Friend's complaint suggested that the FBI is not content just to add distant innocents and peaceful protesters to its roster of prospective suspects. It is allegedly keen to prosecute everyone even remotely linked to the protest. Friend claimed that those identified are referred to the FBI's Daytona Beach office for ""investigation and arrest.""

Additionally, at least one office is said to have conducted surveillance and home visits to persons who had neither been in Washington, D.C., nor inside the Capitol on the day of the protests.

On the basis of Friend's complaint and dozens of others, Jordan stated, ""It appears instead that the FBI is more focused on classifying investigations to meet a woke left-wing agenda"" and that the ""FBI is not immune to oversight or accountability.""

Keeping his oath



The Post reported that on August 19, Friend told his boss, Supervisory Senior Resident Agent Greg Federico, that he reckoned ""it was inappropriate to use an FBI SWAT team to arrest a subject for misdemeanor offenses and opined that the subject will likely face extended detainment and biased jury pools in Washington D.C.""

After Friend advocated for nonviolent and practical alternatives, Federico allegedly told him he'd be best off calling in sick before threatening ""reprisal indirectly by asking how long I saw myself continuing to work for the FBI.""

Friend claimed he was called in by more senior bosses in Jacksonville on August 23, namely Assistant Special Agents in Charge Coult Markovsky and Sean Ryan. They allegedly grilled Friend over his refusal to participate in the raid on alleged offenders wanted for misdemeanor offenses.

When Friend ⁠— who the Post indicated did not vote for former President Donald Trump in 2020 ⁠— said he did not believe all present near the Capitol on January 6 were guilty and that he ""believed some innocent individuals had been unjustly prosecuted, convicted and sentenced,"" Markovsky allegedly repeated false claims about the murder of police officers at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and deemed Friend a ""bad teammate.""

Friend claimed he was again threatened with reprisal.

When he refused to take part in the August 24 raid, Friend said that he was deemed away without leave and then docked pay.

Friend suspected he might be facing an ouster on the basis of subsequent conversations with supervisors.

Special Agent in Charge Sherri Onks, in Jacksonville, allegedly told Friend his ""views represented an extremely small minority of the FBI workforce.""

Friend, reportedly marched out of the FBI field office in Daytona Beach on September 19, regards himself as a ""conscientious objector"" and noted his refusal to participate in the August 24 raid was informed by his ""oath to uphold the Constitution.""

Keeping the FBI accountable

In his September 19 letter, Jordan demanded that the FBI turn over documentation and information relevant to Friend's complaint by October 3, such as ""the number of arrest and search warrants sworn out by agents from the [Washington Field Office], but executed in the geographic area of another FBI field office.""

He also emphasized that ""whistleblower disclosures to Congress are protected by law"" and that the House Committee on the Judiciary would ""not tolerate any effort to retaliate against whistleblowers for their disclosures.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbi-veteran-suspended-politicized-raid,2022-09-22
FBI's investigation into hundreds of attacks by pro-abortion terror group yields zero arrests so far,"The pro-abortion terror group ""Jane's Revenge"" began targeting pro-life institutions ahead of the Supreme Court's June 24 ruling, which overturned Roe v. Wade. A post attributed to the group and published by so-called Abolition Media on June 14 stated ""Through attacking, we find joy."" To date, the violent collective has taken credit for at least 18 of 100 attacks, some of which involved firebombings and resulted in injuries.

In June, the FBI launched a domestic violent extremism investigation into these leftist attacks committed not only against pro-life organizations and crisis pregnancy centers across the nation, but against pro-life individuals and churches as well.

Despite the group's ISIS-style assumption of credit, there have reportedly been no arrests made so far.

Fox News Digital reported that, according to police, there have been no arrests made in connection with the attacks perpetrated against:

Numerous other pro-life centers, churches, memorials, and persons were targeted by the terror group, yet those contacted by Fox News Digital indicated they too have not been informed of any arrests.

The FBI wrote to CBN News earlier this month stating that it was still ""investigating a series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers, faith-based organizations, and reproductive health clinics across the country, as well as to judicial buildings, including the US Supreme Court.""

""The incidents are being investigated as potential acts of domestic violent extremism, FACE Act violations, or violent crime matters,"" the letter continued, ""depending on the facts of each case.""

While no member of ""Jane's Revenge"" has reportedly been arrested, the U.S. Attorney' Office for the Western District of Michigan announced on August 4 that 25-year-old Joshua Brereton had been charged with setting a fire to the bushes outside a Planned Parenthood in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Jim Harden, the CEO of CompassCare, whose center was attacked by ""Jane's Revenge"" on June 7, suggested to the National Review that swift arrests of those antipathetic to the pro-abortion movement, like Brereton's, demonstrate a double standard on the part of law enforcement. ""Compare that with what happened to us,"" he said. ""We had an arson attack, which in criminal code is just below murder, and nobody has been arrested.""

Pressure and promises

On Jun 15, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) wrote to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, criticizing the Department of Justice for not having been ""faithful to its promise of ensuring the public's safety against these violent, radical activists."" Then, just as is the case now, Rubio noted that ""To date, there has not been a single charge brought against any individual or group despite the countless pro-life centers in America that have been firebombed and vandalized in recent months.""

The following day, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton (Ark.) similarly wrote to Garland demanding that the DOJ take action — to ""bring charges against the perpetrators ... and investigate 'Jane's Revenge' as a domestic terrorist organization."" Failing to do so, wrote Cotton, Garland should resign.

120 House Republicans also urged the DOJ to investigate and prosecute the attacks.

On June 17, the FBI told Fox News that it was ""investigating a series of attacks and threats targeting pregnancy resource centers and faith-based organizations across the country."" It noted further that ""The FBI takes all threats seriously and we continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners and will remain vigilant to protect our communities.""

In an August 4 judiciary committee meeting, FBI Director Christopher Wray told Republican Sen. Mike Lee (Utah) that those investigations were well underway.

Notwithstanding the suggestion that those responsible might be brought to justice, over a month later, there is at present only an indication from a Blue Ridge spokesperson that ""The FBI is continuing to follow leads.""

Counter-terrorism

Republican Rep. Jody Hice (Ga.) tweeted on Wednesday that ""Jane's Revenge"" was a far-left domestic terror group, and highlighted the pro-abortion group's original threats, which read: ""The leash is off ... We promised to take increasingly drastic measures against oppressive infrastructures. Rest assured that we will, and those measures may not come in the form of something so easily cleaned up as fire and graffiti.""



On June 23, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) introduced the ""Protecting Mothers and Babies from Terrorism Act"" to designate ""Jane's Revenge"" as a terrorist organization, which Reps. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) cosponsored. An additional seven Republican congressmen have since cosponsored the bill.

Se. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced the ""Pregnancy Resource Center Defense Act"" on July 14 to ""provide adequate penalties and remedies for attacks on facilities providing counseling about abortion alternatives and attacks on places of religious worship."" The bill, if enacted, would increase penalties on those carrying out attacks as the proponents of ""Jane's Revenge"" have claimed to, such that misdemeanors would be treated as felonies.

Facebook, too, internally designated ""Jane's Revenge"" as a terrorist organization. An internal memo circulated to moderators within the organization described the pro-abortion group as ""a far-left extremist group ... responsible for multiple arson and vandalism attacks on pro-life institutions.""

Cross purposes

While some Republicans are seeking to bring the violent pro-abortion forces responsible for these attacks to justice, the Justice Department has created a pro-abortion task force to go around the nation achieving what ""Jane's Revenge's"" could only hint at in its graffiti.

The DOJ announced on July 12 that Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta would lead a task force to take action against state and local governments that implement or enforce pro-life laws that affect federal employees' efforts to procure abortions.

Garland issued a statement on August 2 indicating that the DOJ would ""use every tool at our disposal"" to ensure that women could procure abortions.

Not only is the DOJ openly antagonistic to the cause of the pro-life movement, a number of Democrats have employed violent rhetoric and voiced their support for pro-abortion street action.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) called the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision ""illegitimate"" and called for people to get ""into the streets.""

Cortez also tweeted that ""People will die because of this decision. And we will never stop until abortion rights are restored in the United States of America.""

Democrat Rep. Jackie Speier (Ca.) stated in June that ""There is a war out there. And we need to recognize that we've got to armor up.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) suggested that the pro-life centers targeted by ""Jane's Revenge"" need to be shut down ""all around the country."" She tweeted on June 27, ""it's more important than ever to crack down on so-called 'crisis pregnancy centers'.""

When asked whether Democratic rhetoric was prompting or exacerbating violence against pro-life institutions, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded by saying ""politicizing all of this is uniquely American"" and that she wouldn't ""be talking about that anymore.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/fbis-investigation-into-hundreds-of-attacks-by-pro-abortion-terror-group-yields-zero-arrests,2022-09-14
Federal court orders release of imprisoned True the Vote leaders who claimed China-linked Konnech committed the crimes for which it has now been charged,"On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ordered the emergency release of the two leaders of the election integrity group True the Vote who were thrown in jail last month for refusing to give up the name of one of their confidential sources. Their source allegedly provided them with proof that the scandal-plagued election software company Konnech had compromised and stored American data in China.

The newly liberated duo indicated that they will ""continue to protect and defend those who do the vital work of election integrity, and ... will make sure that their findings become a matter of public record.""

Sued

Konnech is an election software company based in Michigan. It licenses election software still utilized by various municipalities and counties across America.

Catherine Engelbrecht, the founder of True the Vote, and Gregg Phillips, a board member, claimed that Konnech was ""owned by the Chinese Communist Party"" and involved in the ""subversion of our elections.""

Eugene Yu, the founder and CEO of Konnech, was arrested on Oct. 4 and charged on suspicion of data theft, having allegedly stored ""critical information that [US election] workers provided on servers in China.""

Yu was also charged with grand theft by embezzlement of funds exceeding $2.6 million.

According to prosecutor Eric Neff, the crimes allegedly committed by Konnech amount to the ""largest data breach in United States history.""

In response to Engelbrecht and Phillips' claims that Konnech had done what it has now been charged with doing, the Michigan-based company filed a defamation lawsuit against True the Vote on Sept. 12, suggesting that the duo's accusations of wrongdoing were damaging.

In the subsequent proceedings, Konnech demanded that the True the Vote leaders provide the names of anyone who may have been involved in their efforts to expose the company for its alleged malfeasance.

Konnech successfully obtained a restraining order to that effect, which Judge Hoyt found the duo in contempt of on Oct. 27.

After being found in contempt, Phillips wrote on Truth Social, ""Doing the right thing isn't always easy but it's always right. We were held in contempt of court because we refused to burn a confidential informant or our researchers. We go to jail on Monday unless we comply.""

In an Oct. 28 post, Phillips complimented Engelbrecht, writing that despite being ridiculed by Konnech's lawyers, ""She answered with confidence and pride in her Country. She didn't buckle. She stood against the abuse and the oppressors. I'm so proud to be her friend, her colleague, and her brother in Christ.""

The True the Vote account posted on the eve of the duo's arrest that if Engelbrecht and Phillips were ultimately arrested, ""We won't be gone forever.""

Imprisoned

Federal Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt had Engelbrecht and Phillips imprisoned on Oct. 31 after both election integrity activists followed through on their refusal the previous week to give up the name of an individual they allege is a confidential FBI informant.

The duo was marched out of court by U.S. Marshals.

Engelbrecht and Phillips were to remain in jail until they ""fully compl[ied],"" providing the court with the identities of their contacts.



On Nov. 3, the duo filed an application for mandamus seeking relief from the order of detention, in which they contended ""the district court's order represents a clear abuse of discretion and a manifest miscarriage of justice.""



The motion characterized Hoyt's order as ""draconian"" and noted that the duo's ""continued detention has caused them personal and professional harm. Continued detention by its very nature is irreparable.""

Liberated

According to court documents obtained by Just the News, a panel of three Republican-appointed Fifth Circuit judges (i.e., Judges Catharina Haynes, Kurt Engelhardt, and Andrew Oldham) ordered Engelbrecht and Phillips to be released.



On Sunday, Engelbrecht issued a statement about her then-forthcoming release from prison: ""Those who thought that imprisoning Gregg and I would weaken our resolve have gravely miscalculated. It is stronger than ever.""

""The right to free and fair elections without interference is more important than our own discomforts and even this detention, now reversed by a higher court,"" wrote Engelbrecht.

Engelbrecht wrote on Truth Social Monday afternoon, ""We're out. Gregg and I are incredibly grateful for everyone’s prayers and support. I’ll say this, what is publicly known is just the tip of the iceberg. Please stay connected. We’re all in this together. Hold the line. Keep the faith. God is good.""

After being sprung from jail, Phillips wrote, ""These are the days of the patriot games.""

Phillips had previously suggested that ""it's 1984 in America.""

The duo is now free, but their fates remain uncertain. Konnech, on the other hand, will have its Chinese links further explored and its CEO appear in court on Nov. 17.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-court-orders-release-of-imprisoned-true-the-vote-leaders-who-claimed-china-linked-konnech-committed-the-crimes-for-which-it-has-now-been-charged,2022-11-07
Federal judge blocks Biden administration's 'unauthorized' federal guidance on abortions in Texas,"U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix ruled on August 23 that the Department of Health and Human Services' guidance pertaining to the enforcement of the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act was ""unauthorized"" in Texas.

Following President Joe Biden's July 8 executive order on reproductive health, HHS issued new ""clarifying guidance"" on the EMTALA. The guidance ""reaffirmed that [the EMTALA] protects providers when offering legally-mandated, life- or health-saving abortion services in emergency situations.""

According to the EMTALA guidance issued by HHS, if a pregnant woman ""presenting at an emergency department is experiencing an emergency medical condition as defined by EMTALA, and that abortion is the stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve that condition, the physician must provide that treatment.""

Refusal by a physician or a hospital to follow HHS' new guidance on the EMTALA could result in fines of $119,942. Additionally, any physician found in violation of the law as clarified in HHS' new guidance could be ""excluded from participation in Medicare and State health care programs,"" as well as exposed to civil suits.

Concerning enforcement, the guidance specifies that any state actions against a physician who performs an abortion ""in order to stabilize an emergency medical condition"" would be pre-empted by the federal EMTALA statute. In Texas, if a doctor performs a prohibited abortion, the doctor could face life in prison or a $100,000 fine.

Judge Hendrix granted a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the EMTALA as interpreted in HHS' July guidance, in Texas as well as against members of both the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists and Christian Medical & Dental Associations.

His decision is in response to a lawsuit filed by Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on July 14.

At the time of filing, Paxton stated: ""This administration has a hard time following the law, and now they are trying to have their appointed bureaucrats mandate that hospitals and emergency medicine physicians perform abortions."" He indicated he was resolved to ""ensure that President Biden will be forced to comply with the Supreme Court's important decision concerning abortion and I will not allow him to undermine and distort existing laws to fit his administration's unlawful agenda.""

The State of Texas' original complaint alleged that the Biden administration, by way of the imposition of this guidance, was attempting ""to use federal law to transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic.""

According to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, the Biden administration expected ""providers to continue offering [abortion] services, and that federal law preempts state abortion bans when needed for emergency care.""



HHS alleged in its July 11 release that stabilizing treatment ""could include medical and/or surgical interventions, including abortion."" It further stated, ""If a state law prohibits abortion and does not include an exception for the health or life of the pregnant person ... that state law is preempted.""

Hendrix asserted that HHS ""guidance goes well beyond EMTALA's text, which protects both mothers and unborn children, is silent as to abortion, and preempts state law only when the two directly conflict. Since the statute is silent on the question, the Guidance cannot answer how doctors should weigh risks to both a mother and her unborn child. Nor can it, in doing so, create a conflict with state law where one does not exist.""



Concerning the nonexistence of such a conflict, Paxton's complaint noted that, as it currently stands, Texas' Human Life Protection Act does not apply ""if the woman on whom the abortion is performed 'has a life-threatening physical condition' arising from a pregnancy that places her 'at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed.'""

Hendrix's ruling was issued ahead of the implementation of Texas' ""trigger law,"" banning most abortions in the state, which goes into effect on August 25.

Paxton called Hendrix's ruling a ""WIN for mothers, babies, & the TX healthcare industry.""

The Biden administration has also sought to intervene in the state of Republican-led Idaho to prevent the enactment of its abortion ""trigger law."" It filed a lawsuit against the state on August 2.

On Monday, U.S. District Senior Judge B. Lynn Winmill said that he would issue a decision on August 24 regarding whether he would temporarily block Idaho's abortion ban while the lawsuit proceeds.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/federal-judge-blocks-biden-administration-from-imposing-abortion-rule-on-texas,2022-08-24
Federal judge locks up True the Vote leaders for refusing to divulge source who allegedly showed them proof of China-linked Konnech's malfeasance,"A pair of election integrity activists were thrown in jail on Monday after being held in contempt of a federal court in Houston.

What are the details?

Federal Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt had True the Vote leaders Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips thrown in jail after they followed through on their refusal last week to give up the name of one of their sources — an individual they allege is a confidential FBI informant.

According to the duo, the unnamed informant helped provide them with proof that the scandal-plagued election software company Konnech had compromised and stored American data in China.

The overarching case in which the duo is embroiled concerns their alleged defamation of Konnech.

True the Vote accused Konnech of colluding with the Chinese communist regime, of storing confidential American data on servers in China, and of other wrongdoings.

Konnech, whose founder and CEO was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of committing some of the very crimes that True the Vote accused him and his company of, wants Engelbrecht and Phillips to provide the names of anyone else who may have been involved in their efforts to expose the company for its alleged malfeasance.

Konnech successfully obtained a restraining order to that effect, which Hoyt found the duo in contempt of on Oct. 27.

The lawsuit

The Texas Tribune reported that there are two primary interpretations of the fight between True the Vote and Konnech: It's either ""a right-wing elections group allegedly defaming a small technology company, or a small technology company whose alleged security flaws were exposed by a right-wing elections group.""

True the Vote had accused Konnech of being both ""owned by the Chinese Communist Party"" and involved in ""subversion of our elections.""



Konnech filed a defamation lawsuit against True the Vote on September 12, suggesting that Engelbrecht's and Phillips' accusations of wrongdoing were damaging and would prove ""particularly problematic in light of the upcoming 2022 midterm elections, for which Konnech has contracts to provide election logistics software for voting districts across the country.""

The suit claimed that True the Vote founder and president Catherine Engelbrecht and board member Gregg Phillips ""have intentionally, repeatedly, and relentlessly attacked Konnech and its founder Eugene Yu with Defendants' unique brand of racism and xenophobia by their completely baseless claims that Konnech, its founder, and employees are 'Chinese operatives' ... spearheading a 'Red Chinese communist op against the United States.'""

The suit also claimed that the defendants' ""false accusations of treason, espionage, bribery, and election fraud ... are completely fabricated and constitute defamation per se.""

Extra to denouncing the duo for alleged racist attacks, the suit emphasized that ""Konnech does not, and has never, stored any actual customer or poll worker data on any server in China as Defendants falsely claim.""

Since the lawsuit was filed, a great deal has occurred that appears to strengthen True the Vote's claims.

Konnech's founder and CEO Eugene Yu was arrested on Oct. 4 and charged on suspicion of data theft, having allegedly stored ""critical information that [US election] workers provided on servers in China.""

Yu was hit with additional charges for grand theft by embezzlement of funds exceeding $2.6 million.

Prosecutor Eric Neff said that the crimes allegedly committed by Konnech amounted to the ""largest data breach in United States history.""

Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón's office suspects the latter is more likely, stating in an Oct. 13 felony complaint that Eugene and other employees at Konnech were servicing Los Angeles County ""using third-party contractors based in China.""

Cloak, dagger, and restraining order

Hoyt granted Konnech's request for a temporary restraining order against the election integrity duo in September, ordering them: not to disclose any information downloaded from Konnech's computers; to return all data, handwritten or otherwise, obtained from Konnech's computers; and to identify all persons with any information or data from Konnech's computers.

To comply with the restraining order, Phillips and Engelbrecht had to name all of the individuals they allegedly met at a Dallas hotel meeting in January 2021. It was at the meeting they had allegedly seen evidence that Konnech was improperly storing U.S. poll workers' sensitive data in China.

The San Antonio Current reported that earlier this month, Engelbrecht and Phillips provided the name of one source, Mike Hasson.

True the Vote attorney Brock Akers told Hoyt on Oct. 6 that Hasson was in ""danger from forces of the Chinese Communist Party"" and that releasing his name could jeopardize his safety.

Konnech's attorneys, convinced Hasson hadn't operated alone, pressed the duo for additional names, suggesting that previous testimony and the language of certain True the Vote social media posts had indicated the existence of additional contacts or ""analyst[s]"" besides Hasson.



Engelbrecht told Konnech's attorney Nathan Richardson of the Houston office of Kasowitz Benson Torres, ""Every name I give you gets doxxed and harassed ... I know what happened to Mike after his name was released."" She then suggested Hasson was rumored to have gone into hiding.

Votebeat Texas reported that the True the Vote duo, when pressed to identify the other unnamed person at their January 2021 meeting, proved unwilling, suggesting that he was a ""confidential informant"" for the FBI whose safety was contingent upon his anonymity.



Hoyt found them in contempt, stating that they had until Oct. 31 at 9 a.m. to divulge the source's name.

'The right thing isn't always easy'

On Thursday evening, Phillips wrote on Truth Social, ""Doing the right thing isn't always easy but it's always right. We were held in contempt of court because we refused to burn a confidential informant or our researchers. We go to jail on Monday unless we comply.""



In a Saturday post, Phillips complimented Engelbrecht, writing that despite being ridiculed by Konnech's lawyers, ""She answered with confidence and pride in her Country. She didn't buckle. She stood against the abuse and the oppressors. I'm so proud to be her friend, her colleague, and her brother in Christ.""

The True the Vote account posted Sunday evening that if Engelbrecht and Phillips were ultimately arrested, ""We won't be gone forever.""

Sure enough, Engelbrecht and Phillips were marched out of the courtroom in Houston and thrown in jail on Monday, where they will remain until they cough up the alleged informant's name.

Engelbrecht and Phillips can be seen on video emptying their pockets and then being walked out of court on Monday by U.S. Marshals:

Federal judge: Visa knowingly helped Pornhub 'monetize child porn',"A federal judge in California has determined that Visa will remain a defendant in a lawsuit filed by 34 women who allege that MindGeek, the Montreal-based parent company of Pornhub and other online porn sites, featured explicit videos of them while they were still minors.

U.S. District Court Judge Cormac Carney of the Central District of California denied Visa's motion to remove the credit card company from the lawsuit.

“When MindGeek decides to monetize child porn, and Visa decides to continue to allow its payment network to be used for that goal despite knowledge of MindGeek’s monetization of child porn, it is entirely foreseeable that victims of child porn like Plaintiff will suffer the harms that Plaintiff alleges,” Judge Carney wrote in his ruling.

The lead litigant in the lawsuit claims that in 2014, when she was just 13 years old, her boyfriend filmed a sexually explicit video of her and shared it on Pornhub. The video, entitled ""13-Year Old Brunette Shows Off For the Camera,"" had more than 400,000 views before it was taken down. It then appeared on other MindGeek sites. It was on at least one of MindGeek's sites as recently as 2020, according to the lawsuit.

The litigant alleges in the lawsuit that, her life spiraled out of control after the video went public. She suffered harassment at school, developed an addiction to heroin, and attempted suicide on several occasions. Though she is now sober, she says she remains estranged from some family members because of the video.

For its part, Visa continues to insist that it should not be listed as a defendant in the lawsuit.

""Visa condemns sex trafficking, sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse materials as repugnant to our values and purpose as a company,"" a statement released by the company reads. ""This pre-trial ruling is disappointing and mischaracterizes Visa’s role and its policies and practices. Visa will not tolerate the use of our network for illegal activity. We continue to believe that Visa is an improper defendant in this case.""

Visa also alleged in court filings that finding Visa liable for facilitating child porn could jeopardize the entire financial industry because credit companies might then be responsible for the billions of transactions made on their credit cards every year.

However, Judge Carney disagreed.

“Visa is not being asked to police ‘the billions of individual transactions it processes each year,’” Carney said. “It is simply being asked to refrain from offering the tool with which a known alleged criminal entity performs its crimes. That is not a tall order and does not spell out an existential threat to the financial industry.”

Visa and MasterCard both broke with Pornhub after a New York Times exposé published in December 2020 revealed that Pornhub featured illegal content, including child porn.

"Feds coordinated with Big Tech to censor social media, met with companies 'monthly' in lead-up to 2020 election: Report","A new, explosive report from the Intercept indicates that, in recent years, federal agents, especially those in the Department of Homeland Security, have closely coordinated with Big Tech firms to police online speech and to censor what they deem to be ""misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation."" The report indicates that this federal regulation of online content may have even affected the outcome of the 2020 election.

In their co-authored piece, Ken Klippenstein and Lee Fang analyze ""[y]ears of internal DHS memos, emails, and documents"" to determine the extent to which federal agencies have pressured social media companies to censor information and speech that may reflect poorly on the U.S. government.



Their conclusions are startling. According to DHS meeting minutes from last March regarding the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force, established to investigate whether Russian influence had interfered with the 2016 presidential election, 80 task force members have been assigned to combat ""subversive data utilized to drive a wedge between the populace and the government.""

The report further indicates that many DHS officials have exerted more and more pressure on social media companies in order to control online content.

""Platforms have got to get comfortable with gov’t,"" former DHS official and current Microsoft executive Matt Masterson texted to Jen Easterly, a DHS director, in February. ""It’s really interesting how hesitant they remain.""

The main concern of these federal agents is curtailing misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation. In January 2021, a ""Misinformation, Disinformation and Malinformation"" team was even added to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, itself a subagency of the DHS established during the Trump administration.

However, despite claims that these federal agencies are merely protecting Americans from foreign and domestic terrorists who have been radicalized by ""misinformation,"" many on the right and left have criticized some of these investigations as, in Klippenstein and Fang's words, ""politically motivated"" and as ""an end run around the First Amendment.""

""There is growing evidence that the legislative and executive branch officials are using social media companies to engage in censorship by surrogate,"" said Jonathan Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University.

""No matter your political allegiances,"" added Adam Goldstein, the vice president of research at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, ""all of us have good reason to be concerned about government efforts to pressure private social media platforms into reaching the government’s preferred decisions about what content we can see online.""

To illustrate the severity of this alleged coordinated effort between federal agencies and Big Tech firms, Klippenstein and Fang point to the Hunter Biden laptop story, first broken by the New York Post in October 2020. After 50 current and former intelligence officials erroneously claimed the story had ""all of the classic earmarks"" of Russian disinformation, many Big Tech platforms censored posts and users who attempted to share it.

On a recent appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that the FBI had contacted Facebook in fall 2020 and warned that ""some kind of dump"" of Russian disinformation was likely to occur, and Facebook officials determined that the laptop story ""fit that pattern."" As a result, Facebook strictly limited sharing the story, and Twitter banned links to the story and even temporarily suspended the verified NYP account because it refused to retract the story. Zuckerberg and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey have both since admitted that the story should not have been censored.

Klippenstein and Fang also alleged that representatives from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Discord, Wikipedia, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Verizon Media, and other companies met ""monthly"" with the FBI, CISA, and other federal agents in 2020 to discuss means of handling online ""disinformation.""

Because of the danger of too much coordination between federal agencies and social media platforms, several Republicans have taken significant action. In fact, many of the primary resources Klippenstein and Fang used to support their report stem from a lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who is currently running for U.S. Senate. The lawsuit contends that both federal agents and Big Tech firms have engaged in ""open collusion"" to censor stories, especially those regarding COVID, vaccines, and elections.

A draft of DHS’s Quadrennial Homeland Security Review indicated that the DHS also intended to root out ""inaccurate information"" about, among other topics, the ""U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan,"" an issue that Republicans have vowed to investigate, should they retake control of Congress after the midterms.

Though censorship may seem to have increased since President Joe Biden assumed office, Klippenstein and Fang noted that federal agencies have been pressuring social media companies for years, in both the Trump and Biden administrations, and indicated that the pressure will continue without further intervention.

""There are no specific legal constraints on the FBI’s use of social media,"" said Faiza Patel, senior director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s liberty and national security program. ""The attorney general guidelines permit agents to look at social media before there is any investigation at all. So it’s kind of a Wild West out there.""

According to Klippenstein and Fang, DHS and Meta did not respond to requests for comment on the story, and the FBI refused to comment. A Twitter spokesperson said in a statement: ""We do not coordinate with other entities when making content moderation decisions, and we independently evaluate content in line with the Twitter Rules.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/feds-coordinated-with-big-tech-to-censor-social-media-met-with-companies-monthly-in-lead-up-to-2020-election-report,2022-10-31
Feds reject Florida surgeon general's warnings about dangers of mRNA vaccinations,"On October 7, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo issued guidance for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, stating that with ""a high level of global immunity to COVID-19, the benefit of vaccination is likely outweighed by this abnormally high risk of cardiac-related death among men"" in the 18-39 age group. The guidance cited analysis that showed an 84% increase in the relative incidence of cardiac-related deaths in this demographic within 28 days following mRNA vaccination.

On Monday, elements of the federal health establishment responded, rejecting Ladapo's guidance and restating their advocacy for Americans of all ages to get vaccinated.

Ladapo's censored guidance

The guidance issued last week by the Florida surgeon general referred to a self-controlled case series wherein ""only individuals who have experienced an event are included and all time invariant confounding is eliminated.""

The analysis found a significant increase in the relative incidence of cardiac-related death among males 18-39 years old within 28 days following mRNA vaccination. Men over 60 were reportedly found to have a 10% increased risk of cardiac-related death within the same time frame.

The guidance also noted that non-mRNA vaccines ""were not found to have these increased risks among any population.""

Ladapo, who previously suggested that healthy young children should not receive the experimental COVID-19 vaccine, recommended that those with preexisting heart conditions, such as myocarditis and pericarditis ""should take particular caution when considering vaccination.""

On Friday, Ladapo tweeted these findings along with his recommendation. Twitter, however, promptly blocked the post.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' (R) press secretary, Bryan Griffin, called the censorship ""an unacceptable and Orwellian move for narrative over fact.""

After receiving significant backlash for taking down the surgeon general's post, Twitter restored it on Sunday morning.

Ladapo told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on October 10 that had it been known ""two years ago or so that this vaccine would increase cardiac deaths in young men by 84%,"" there is no way it would have been approved.



Federal backlash

The Orlando Sentinel reported that U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Sarah Lovenheim characterized Ladapo's guidance as ""flawed and a far cry from the science,"" suggesting that the mRNA vaccines ""have been proven safe and effective.""



Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, stated, ""We've continued to do these benefit-risk assessments, and they continue to be highly favorable, again, across all of the different age ranges ... including males 18-39.""

Marks suggested that the analysis cited by Ladapo shouldn't dissuade Americans from getting a vaccine ""despite the fact that yes, it is true that there could be some side effects.""

Jason Salemi, an associate professor at the University of South Florida, reportedly suggested that ""better-designed studies that are comprehensive and actually seek better data"" should be conducted before potentially lifesaving recommendations are made.

Extra to elements of the federal and medical establishment, others without scientific bona fides have castigated Ladapo.

Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist called Dr. Ladapo a ""quack"" on Twitter.

DeSantis' rapid response director answered back forcefully, suggesting Crist may be out of his depth.

This is not the first time that Ladapo has been met with criticism.

Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said earlier this year that to ""say he's out of the mainstream would be an understatement."" Jha and others have characterized Ladapo's recommendations as ""unorthodox,"" particularly when it came to his 2020 claim that lockdowns ""won't stop the spread.""

Though allegedly ""out of the mainstream,"" Ladapo was ultimately vindicated about lockdowns. A study published in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation found that lockdowns were unlikely to have provided significantly more benefits to slowing the spread of the disease than alternative voluntary measures.

Other studies

In terms of the disproportionate danger posed to young men by the mRNA vaccines, Ladapo's guidance is bolstered by findings from other studies.

An FDA-funded study published in June concluded that an ""increased risk of myocarditis or pericarditis was observed after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and was highest in men aged 18-25 years after a second dose of the vaccine.""



A June 24 Canadian study supported by Public Health Ontario and the Public Health Agency of Canada found ""increased rates of myocarditis or pericarditis following receipt of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines,"" with particularly higher incidences ""among male individuals aged 18 to 24 years.""

Another study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association reached the same conclusion, but suggested that the ""risk should be considered in the context of the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccination.""

Some experts are now reevaluating the benefits and deciding against giving mRNA vaccines to different demographics.

For instance, earlier this year, Sweden decided against recommending the vaccines to children ages 5-11.

Britta Bjorkholm of country's Health Agency stated, ""With the knowledge we have today, with a low risk for serious disease for kids, we don't see any clear benefit with vaccinating them.""

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 15.6 million American children ages 6 months to 4 years old have not been given a single COVID-19 vaccine dose; 17.8 million kids 5-11 have not received a dose; and 8.5 million kids ages 12-17 have not received a dose.

Last month, Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of National Institutes of Health (NIH) working group on vaccines, told CNN that he feared government health agencies might ""say everybody should get it when in fact, the healthy young person is unlikely to benefit from the booster dose, and so I hope they targeted more specifically, to those really who are most likely to benefit.""

Last year, two top FDA vaccine regulators, Marion Gruber and Philip Krause, resigned ahead of the agency's agreement to recommend mRNA boosters. One month later, an FDA advisory panel voted 16-2 against recommending the booster shots for Americans ages 16 years and up.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/feds-reject-florida-surgeon-generals-warnings-about-dangers-of-mrna-vaccinations,2022-10-11
"Three females refuse to leave Philly pool for unruly behavior — then taunt, threaten, attack and injure staff, vandalize cars. Now the pool is shut down for summer.","A Philadelphia pool has been shut down for the summer after three females who refused to leave the pool over their unruly behavior taunted, threatened, then physically attacked staff — injuring five people — and even vandalized vehicles.

What are the details?

About 30 minutes prior to Thursday afternoon's incident, Philadelphia Parks and Recreation tweeted that teens could get lifeguard lessons that evening at the McVeigh Recreation Center pool in the city's Kensington neighborhood.

Around 4:25 p.m., police said pool staff tried to remove three females for apparent unruly behavior, and they refused to leave ""while sitting at the end of the pool taunting and threatening the staff,"" WPVI-TV reported, citing a police department news release.

""Subsequently, the staff shut down the pool, and all other occupants of the pool exited the pool without issue,"" the station said, citing police.

Then things escalated.

Police told WPVI the females followed pool staffers into a recreation center building, and two of them began swinging their arms at staffers who tried to block them from entering the building.

Once staffers got the females outside the recreation center, police added to the station that the suspects vandalized three parked cars. Police told PhillyVoice the cars were left with dents and scratches; one car's windshield was broken.

""During this time, two unknown males gained access to the building and took a bag belonging to one of the employees, which was recovered,"" police added to WPVI.

The station noted that lifeguard stands were dumped into the pool as well:

Image source: WPVI-TV video screenshot

The females fled the area, and no arrests have been made, the station said. PhillyVoice said authorities didn't provide ages or descriptions of the three females or say whether the males who entered the building were connected with them. Police believe the females are juveniles, WPVI said.

Police on Monday didn't immediately respond to questions from TheBlaze regarding whether descriptions of the females or surveillance video will be released.

Anyone with information can call police at 215-686-TIPS, WPVI said.

Anything else?

Five people, ages 17 to 63, suffered minor injuries in the incident, including leg and ankle pain, WPVI reported.

The city said the pool is now closed for the summer due to concerns for the safety of pool staff and visitors, the station said. The pool has been drained.

""We've had other incidents that have happened at McVeigh. In the evenings when pool is closed — almost every night since the pool ... opened [July 5] — people are breaking into the pool, jumping in the pool, vandalizing pool and pool equipment,"" Kathryn Ott Lovell of the Parks and Recreation Department told WPVI. ""We have to make sure that the safety of our staff and the children and families is first and foremost.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/females-attack-philly-pool-staffers,2022-07-25
'Why are you trying to write us out of history?' Feminists and anti-feminists clash over what a 'woman' is,"A group of feminists and anti-feminists took part in a panel that saw heated debate over whether or not transgender women — meaning biological men — should be included in women's feminism, among other topics such as abortion and racism.

""I would never stand between anyone with a uterus from making a decision about their body,"" said Rebecca Faith Quinn regarding abortions, who describes herself as an ""actress, writer, autistic, activist, feminist.""

Another panelist described how she felt abortion access should be as ordinary and easily accessible as a simple doctor's visit:

""It's the same as going into the doctor and getting a routine check,"" remarked the artist who goes by AJ, the One.

""If there's something for your body that you think will not just benefit you, but help you live and also help you sustain an actual good life for your child, then that's what you need to do,"" she added.

For lengthy portions of the debate, the participants were not able to agree to a definition of what a woman actually is, which caused dialogue to turn into drawn-out arguments over how to specifically refer to a man who has become a woman and whether or not that change actually allows him to become a real woman.

""I am a woman ... born and raised a woman,"" said a panelist named Niké, ""Why are you trying to write us out of history?""

Quinn, disagreeing with a biological binary, replied, saying, ""You guys keep saying there's a biological reality of male and female, scientists do not agree with you.""

The argument continued with the panelist's disagreements on definitions stymieing their ability to get through even examples of hypothetical situations.

Panelists were asked by producers to define the patriarchy, fielding vastly differing answers depending on the respondent.

Activist Deja Foxx replied, ""What isn't the patriarchy? I feel like that's the better question!""

Others took a more literal approach, answering that they felt the patriarchy meant a ""systemic ideal"" that favors masculinity and men, or even describing it as a system that ""oppresses not just women, but everyone.""

However, other panelists altogether rejected the colloquial idea that they are living under an oppressive system.

""I don't even know,"" said Isabella Riley Moody, adding that she is ""very happy to live under this so-called patriarchy.""

Jill Simonian, a host for PragerU, replied that the modern definition of patriarchy ""does not make any sense"" to her.

""Women are not oppressed in America,"" she asserted.

The debate ended with an agreement that both sides indeed have a different definition of what a woman is.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/feminist-vs-antifeminist-panel,2023-01-24
Don Lemon presses Fetterman to have his doctors answer media questions before the election and gets a nonresponse,"CNN anchor Don Lemon pressured John Fetterman on whether he would permit his doctors to answer questions from the media before the election, but Fetterman offered a nonresponse to the press.

Lemon had the Democratic candidate for one of Pennsylvania's two U.S. Senate seats on his show Monday and asked him a difficult question about his health. Fetterman suffered a stroke but insists that he is healthy enough to campaign despite often mixing up words and misunderstanding questions put to him.

""Listen, we've heard a little from your doctor, but we haven't heard a lot. You're asking voters to trust you on your word that your health is good without the full story, so in the interest of full transparency for the voters, do you think it would help if you let your doctors brief the press before election night?"" Lemon asked.

""I think we've been pretty transparent, you know, we've had our doctors just be very clear that they're here, that we're able to and fit to serve,"" Fetterman responded.

""And from my point, uh, you know, we've been also been very transparent in terms of showing up at a debate, and very transparent about, you know, having events in front of thousands and thousands of Pennsylvanians for months, and I was again, it was no secret that I was gonna miss some words, I was gonna mush some words together,"" he continued.

""And as we've been very clear, in the debate and during this interview I've been using captioning, it's all true,"" he added. ""I believe we've been very transparent to give all the voters to make it their choice.""

Questions around Fetterman's health gained traction when Fetterman and Republican candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz debated in a public forum, and the Democratic candidate struggled to answer some questions competently. In one embarrassing moment, he was asked to square contradictory statements about fracking, and he simply repeated that he supported the practice.

The Pennsylvania election will help determine whether Democrats maintain their tenuous hold on the U.S. Senate or whether Republicans will take control.

"Off-duty firefighter wrestles felon who pulled gun on him. Felon's girlfriend grabs dropped gun, fatally shoots firefighter — and she's facing no criminal charges.","Warning: graphic content.



An off-duty firefighter in Missouri was shot and killed outside a gas station earlier this month after wrestling with an angry customer who eventually pulled a gun on him. However, prosecutors have declined to charge the customer's girlfriend, who shot the firefighter, claiming that she shot him to defend her boyfriend's life.

At around 2:30 p.m. on October 6, Anthony ""Tony"" Santi, a 41-year-old Kansas City firefighter, was in a gas station in Independence, Missouri, when a fellow customer became irate with the female attendant because the store did not have the brand of cigars he wanted.

The customer, Ja’Von Taylor, 23, then hurled expletives at the unnamed store clerk, causing a disturbance. The clerk asked Taylor to leave the store, but he refused. Santi then intervened and demanded that Taylor leave. Tensions between the two men became heated, and they began fighting inside the store, though they eventually took the scuffle outside.

At some point, Taylor went to his vehicle and took out a firearm. Taylor and Santi then struggled to grab hold of the weapon. Santi eventually managed to get Taylor into a choke hold underneath him. Meanwhile, Taylor's girlfriend, who had been sitting in Taylor's vehicle, had exited the car and begged Santi to stop wrestling with Taylor.

""Stop, sir, stop,"" she yelled. ""Get off! My kids [are] in the car! Stop! [You’re] killing him!""

The woman, whose identity has not been released, picked up the gun, which had fallen to the ground, and then aimed it at Santi. She warned him that she would use it, and she eventually did, firing one round into Santi's back.

A witness filmed the episode, which may have lasted for as long as 10 minutes. Though the video does not show the actual shooting, the content in it is graphic.

The woman shot Santi moments after the conclusion of the video. After the shot, Santi got up off the ground and walked back into the store, where he collapsed and died.

After reviewing the video, Jackson County prosecutors declined to press charges against the woman, arguing that she could reasonably claim self-defense.

""We grieve with the family and community over this tragic loss of life of Mr. Santi,"" the prosecutor’s office wrote in a statement. ""Missouri law governs this case, specifically self-defense and defense of others, leading us to decline charges after a careful review.""

""If a case is declined, it’s just because we don’t believe there’s sufficient evidence to get to that highest burden of proof,"" Jackson County prosecutor Jean Peters Baker explained to reporters.

Kevin Jamison, a Missouri attorney who has practiced law for 40 years and who ""wrote Missouri’s book on weapons and self-defense,"" according to WDAF-TV, also weighed in on why prosecutors may have declined to press charges in this case.

""Technically it's called the defense of justification and your justification is you are saving the life of another person,"" Jamison said.

He added that the woman likely had only limited knowledge about the ""circumstances"" of the fight, causing her to believe that Santi posed a threat to Taylor's life.

""The girlfriend is only constrained by what she reasonably believed to be the circumstances. If she didn’t see the start of the fight, all she knows is her boyfriend is getting strangled,"" he said.

Though the unnamed girlfriend will not face prosecution, Taylor will. He has been charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He had previously been convicted of first-degree robbery, though the date of his conviction and the length of his sentence remain unclear.

Santi joined the Kansas City Fire Department 11 years ago. He loved ""nature and being outdoors"" and his dog, Donnie, and he especially loved his daughter, ""the light of his life,"" according to an obituary.

"Theater bends knee to outrage mob, cancels Dave Chappelle just hours before show: 'Hatred of free expression'","First Avenue, the iconic concert venue in Minneapolis, ignited a firestorm of controversy late Wednesday for abruptly canceling a Dave Chappelle comedy show just hours before it was set to begin.

Trans activists have targeted Chappelle for several years over his refusal to have his jokes and language policed by their woke standards.

What happened?

About three hours before Chappelle's show, First Avenue officials canceled it and moved it to a different theater — Varsity Theater — about 2.5 miles away in a decision described as ""totalitarian censorship and [a] hatred of free expression.""

In a statement, First Avenue acknowledged its woke transgression and promised to ensure its property is a safe space.

To staff, artists, and our community, we hear you and we are sorry. We know we must hold ourselves to the highest standards, and we know we let you down. We are not just a black box with people in it, and we understand that First Avenue is not just a room, but meaningful beyond our walls.



The First Avenue team and you have worked hard to make our venues the safest spaces in the country, and we will continue with that mission.

Ironically, First Avenue also claimed to value ""diverse voices"" and ""the freedom of artistic expression"" — claims diametrically opposed to canceling an artist because some people are merely offended.

""We believe in diverse voices and the freedom of artistic expression, but in honoring that, we lost sight of the impact this would have. We know there are some who will not agree with this decision; you are welcome to send feedback,"" First Avenue said.

According to Rolling Stone, First Avenue staffers had complained to management about Chappelle, even threatening to call out of work on the night of Chappelle's show.

The decision to appease the woke outrage mob is ironic and shows the theater was listening to a minority number of voices.

In fact, Chappelle had sold out the show at First Avenue, and the demand to see the iconic comedian was so great that two additional shows were added at the Varsity Theater for Thursday and Friday.

Still, the decision to cancel Chappelle and move him to a different theater did not deter protesters — about 50, according to the Minneapolis StarTribune — who gathered outside the Varsity Theater.

Chappelle has not publicly responded to the incident. His shows are phone-free.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/first-avenue-cancels-dave-chappelle,2022-07-21
"Florida takes action after transgender student, born male, allegedly assaults girl in school bathroom","The Florida Department of Education will develop rules requiring school districts to notify parents if their children are forced to share bathrooms and locker rooms with students of the opposite sex after an alleged sexual assault of a girl by a transgender student in a Florida public school bathroom was reported.



The incident allegedly occurred on June 20 at Space Coast Jr./Sr. High school in Brevard County, according to a police report shared on Facebook by state Rep. Randy Fine (R). A female student reported that a transgender peer, a male who identifies as female, came into the girls bathroom and ""fondled"" her breasts.

“We find this allegation deeply disturbing and troubling. Clearly, if Brevard Public Schools had commonsense policies that separate bathrooms and locker rooms by biological sex at birth, this incident would not have been possible,” Alex Lanfranconi, director of communications at the Florida Department of Education, said in a statement given to the Daily Wire Thursday.

“Unfortunately, some districts choose wokeness over the safety of their students,” Lanfranconi continued. “The Florida Department of Education will continue to take all steps within its power to protect parental rights and student safety by developing rules that will notify parents if their children are at risk of exposure to these types of situations.”

Fine first publicized the alleged sexual assault last week in a series of posts on social media. He wrote a letter to the Florida Department of Education requesting ""immediate assistance in investigating an alleged sexual assault between a 'transgender girl' and another girl that allegedly took place in the bathroom of Johnson Middle School over the summer.""

Brevard Public Schools officials denied the allegation and said no such incident happened at Johnson Middle School.

“There was no attack. No victim, no witness, no parents coming forward, nothing,” school district spokesman Russell Bruhn told the Orlando Sentinel. “Rep. Fine owes our staff at Johnson Middle School an apology for making this baseless allegation.”

Police officers from the Melbourne police department were assigned to investigate the lawmaker's allegation.



However, Fine later clarified that his letter had incorrectly identified the school where the assault allegedly took place.

""The claim as shared to me by parents was correct in all respects, save one: as things went through the game of telephone, it happened at a different school,"" Fine wrote in an Aug. 18 Facebook post.

""It is with no joy that I share that we now have proof there was a 'transgender' sexual assault incident this summer in Brevard Government Schools,"" Fine wrote, sharing a case report from the Brevard County sheriff's office.

Names of the students involved in the alleged incident were redacted because they are minors.



According to the report, a female student told the Brevard County sheriff's office that at around 11:45 am on June 20, she went to the girls' bathroom and a transgender student, a male who identifies as female, walked into the bathroom shortly after her. The transgender student began talking to her and then ""fondled her breasts against her will and without her permission,"" the police report said.

The girl informed the sheriff's office she had previously told this transgender student to stop touching her and said she wanted to press charges because she felt ""violated."" She also said she does not feel comfortable using the same bathroom with the transgender student, according to police.

The transgender student denied touching the girls breasts but admitted to being in the bathroom with her, the report said.

The girl reported the incident to police on June 21. The case report said Space Coast Jr./Sr. High school Vice Principle Andy Papczynski was present when the the transgender student was interviewed by police and knew about the allegations.

School spokesman Russell Bruhn confirmed to the Daily Wire that ""the incident at Space Coast Jr./Sr. High School was reported by the school to the Sheriff’s Office, Florida DCF and our Title IX partner.”

“All three investigated the claims and all three closed their cases with no action,” he said. “What was described in the Sheriff’s Office report is an incident that lead to no charges being filed. My quotes were in reference to a false allegation that a student had been raped at a different school.”

Bruhn also told the Daily Wire that school officials were aware of the incident at the time he denied a sexual assault took place at Johnson Middle School, but said they could not discuss the case without ""violating FERPA, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.""

“And again, the actual case and the fabricated cases are different,” he said.

Fine blasted school officials for having knowledge of the alleged incident while denying that any sexual assaults took place in school bathrooms.



""We should be able to trust Brevard Government Schools to put our children first. To not hide criminal activity that hurts our children. Brevard Government Schools should have openly and transparently addressed the concerns of these parents. But they refused, and even worse, gaslighted the public when I brought the issue to light,"" he wrote on Facebook.

""We should not be surprised,"" he added, ""they believe boys should use the girls' bathroom.""

Florida man arrested for alleged neglect and abuse of his 'extremely emaciated' elderly mother and father,"A Florida man was arrested for neglect and abuse of his 82-year-old mother after police performed a wellness check at his home.

Palm Beach County Deputies said that they were called to the home in Royal Palm Beach on Thursday after his 91-year-old father had been admitted to a hospital with brain bleeding.

Christopher Gissoni initially refused to bring his mother to the door, according to the charging document, but eventually, he grabbed her by the shoulders and dragged her to the window.

Investigators said that she was “extremely emaciated"" and weighed between 75 to 80 pounds.

Police asker her questions to determine her mental state, and when she was asked when she remembered eating last, she said that she didn't know.

Police said they found two loaded Smith and Wesson .40 caliber handguns but very little food in the home. They saw signs of violence, including ""fist marks"" in the doors and the walls. Prescription medicine was strewn on the floor. Investigators said a recliner used by one of the elderly adults had mold on it.

Neighbors to Gissoni said they were not surprised by the accusations. One neighbor who didn't want to be identified spoke to WPEC-TV said the man would often make a scene in public.

""Screaming at his mom, cursing at his mother,"" said the neighbor. ""And then all of a sudden I didn’t see her, I thought maybe she passed.”

Gissoni faces 12 charges related to the incident, including kidnapping, elderly neglect and abuse, and carrying a firearm during a felony.

""Now that I know his demeanor and everything, it doesn’t surprise me,"" said the neighbor.

He was booked on a bond of $121,000 into Palm Beach County Jail.

"Florida father sues school district because LGBTQ pride flags hung in son's middle school classroom, teacher promoted 'homosexual lifestyles,' lawsuit claims","A Florida father is suing a school district for allegedly hanging LGBTQ pride flags in his son's middle school classroom. The lawsuit also accuses a teacher of promoting ""homosexual lifestyles.""

Dr. Francisco Deliu launched a lawsuit against the School District of Palm Beach County on Oct. 12. The lawsuit also names Emerald Cove Middle School, its principal, Dr. Eugina Smith Feaman, and teacher Rachel Raos.

The lawsuit stems from accusations that the teacher of Deliu's son hung two LGBTQ pride flags in a classroom.

Deliu claims to have confronted the principal of Emerald Cove Middle School about the LGBTQ flags, but the concerns were allegedly ""dismissed.""

""He asked for reasons, but the Principal refused to justify her decision,"" the lawsuit says. The principal reportedly said the matter would be discussed with the school board.

Deliu's lawsuit claims the computer science teacher ""used a search engine to find websites about homosexual lifestyles and proselytized to the students in class"" on Sept. 16.

The lawsuit accuses Raos and Emerald Cove Middle School of attempting to ""mold his child’s mind without his consent."" The suit says Deliu found out ""from his child that his school is expressly and/or implicitly advocating for homosexuality as an alternative way of life.""

The lawsuit alleges, ""There is no lawful authority that permits the Teacher, Principal, School, District and/or Board to teach, discuss or otherwise educate the students, including Dr. Deliu’s son, about gay pride, homosexuality or the like.""

The father – who is originally from Romania – said he and his family are Orthodox Christians, and they believe that being gay is a sin and is ""not in accordance with their Bible.""

Deliu demanded that his son be removed from the computer science class ""pending anticipated legal action."" The school purportedly said it would examine the possibility of transferring the boy to another computer science class.

However, the lawsuit alleges, ""The school did not keep its promise and, instead, unilaterally and without notice to Dr. Deliu moved his son into an art class.""

The father objected to the move because the art class has nothing to do with the student's ""career.""

Deliu believes that the school's conduct violates Florida's Parents' Bill of Rights law, which was signed into law last year by Gov. Ron DeSantis. The legislation affirms that each parent has ""the right to direct the education and care of his or her minor child"" and ""the right to direct the upbringing and the moral or religious training of his or her minor child.""

Deliu wants a jury trial in circuit court, for the court to declare the teacher's discussion about homosexuality illegal, for the LGBTQ flags to be removed from the classroom, and for a public apology from the school district.

""The main reason I filed this case was because I believe the school has violated the law and want to stop them before they go further,"" Deliu told Fox News. ""An interesting byproduct of my case is that it has made parents aware and so may just yet turn into a political movement as well. We have to protect our children from overreach by the unelected bureaucrats.""

The lawsuit states, ""Dr. Deliu is a libertarian who lives by a 'live and let live' creed. He respects the rights of others, but also demands they not encroach upon his rights.""

""Our schools are spending time, money, and resources on gay pride and homosexuality. This will not end well,"" Deliu stated. ""Parents are responsible for cultural, moral, political, and social education. Schools are responsible for that which the parents are unable to teach due to lack of skills or abilities, i.e., physics or calculus. We need to ensure those lines are not crossed, and I hope my case helps set this clear precedent.""

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis easily wins reelection,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis easily won reelection Tuesday, as multiple news outlets called the race with unexpected ease as the night's vote-counting began.

DeSantis, who was initially elected in 2018 by an extremely narrow margin over Andrew Gillum, had a much easier time in 2022 against Democrat Charlie Crist, who has formerly lost statewide races as a Republican, an independent, and a Democrat and who is widely unpopular statewide due to his transparent political opportunism.

DeSantis' reelection campaign was viewed by many as a trial balloon for a potential 2024 presidential campaign after DeSantis established himself as a national figure by bucking restrictive federal COVID guidance issued by former President Donald Trump's COVID czar, Dr. Anthony Fauci. Under DeSantis' guidance, Florida was among the first states to insist on sending children back to public schools for in-person learning and to reject vaccine and mask mandates.

These policies, which have since been adopted virtually nationwide, earned him the ire of the vast majority of the national media, who frequently invited Fauci on television to rebuke him. However, they made him a national celebrity with conservatives who chafed under Fauci's policies and contradictory messages.

DeSantis also garnered national attention by championing legislation that prevented sexually explicit instruction for children grades K-3, which was falsely labeled the ""Don't Say Gay"" law by Democrats and their allies in the media. DeSantis made parental rights in education a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, repeatedly hitting on the issue on the stump and in debates.

DeSantis' easy victory also broke the trend of Republican candidates underperforming some expectations on election night.

DeSantis' victory elevates the chance of a potential 2024 primary matchup with former President Trump, who appeared to take a swipe at DeSantis at a recent campaign event, calling him ""DeSanctimonious."" DeSantis, who has thus far refused to criticize or comment upon the former president's remarks, is said to be seriously considering the possibility of a challenge to Trump, who initially appointed Fauci to head his coronavirus task force and who kept him in that position until the end of his presidency.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-governor-ron-desantis-easily-wins-reelection,2022-11-09
Florida IG report says Rebekah Jones' accusations against Gov. DeSantis on COVID-19 response are completely baseless,"An inspector general's report concluded that the accusations against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and his response to the COVID-19 pandemic were completely baseless.

Rebekah Jones was a frequent guest on MSNBC and CNN because of her claims that she was fired for whistleblowing against the DeSantis administration about allegedly faked pandemic statistics.

Those claims were found to be unsubstantiated and without evidence by a 27-page report from the Florida Department of Health’s Office of the Inspector General.

Jones claimed that she refused to publish false pandemic numbers on the state's COVID-19 dashboard in order to make Florida's lockdown policies appear to be working. Her home was later raided by law enforcement officials, an incident she compared to acts committed by the Nazis in Germany.

The report said that her colleagues accused her of not knowing what she was talking about.

“Complainant was not an epidemiologist and did not have system access to underlying COVID-19 data in Merlin and ESSENCE,” the report read, referring to the state pandemic dashboard.

The report also said that her accusations made little sense, because even if officials sought to falsify statistics in the dashboard, they would be quickly and easily discovered through standard processes meant to confirm the numbers.

Jones faces a felony charge for downloading confidential health department data after she was fired. She also faces an unrelated charge of misdemeanor stalking over an affair she had with a former student when she was a Florida State University teacher. She was also fired from that job.

She is now running to unseat Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz from his office in the U.S. House representing Florida.

A spokesperson for DeSantis called Jones a ""discredited conspiracy theorist.""

"Florida mom arrested for bomb threat at high school after student was refused more food at cafeteria, police say","A mom in Florida says she is innocent of charges from police that she allegedly called a bomb threat into a high school after a student got into an argument over the food portions in the cafeteria.

The Brevard County Sheriff's Office said Anaya Smith was charged with one count of making a false bomb threat.

According to police, someone called the Cocoa High School in Cocoa and left an epithet-filled message with a threat on Feb. 3.

""If you don't start feeding my mother f***ing children better at that b**** I'm gonna come round that b**** and blow that mother f****er up,"" the caller said.

Officials evacuated the school as a precaution and called the police who found in their investigation that the phone number of the caller matched the cellphone for Smith. An officer also said that he had previous run-ins with the woman and that her voice matched that of the one left on the recording.

Police arrested Smith, 41, on Wednesday months after the incident. She denied the allegations in an interview with WOFL-TV.

""I don’t even talk like that,"" Smith said. ""Anybody who knows me knows I don’t talk that way.""

She said that the phone number didn't belong to her and that she didn't recognize the name of the student in the arrest report.

Police claimed that she was the legal guardian of a student that had gotten into an argument with cafeteria workers about not getting enough food.

""Simple fact checking could have eliminated all of this. One arrest could ruin somebody’s life. Not her life. I will make sure,"" said Andrea Johnson, Anaya's sister.

WOFL reporter Connor Hansen said they tried to call the number in the report but that it was out of service.

No explosives were found at the school during the investigation.

President of a Florida NAACP branch resigns after allegedly being 'maliciously racistly oppressed' by members of the organization's executive committee,"Dr. Vanessa Toolsie, president of the NAACP's Orange County branch, announced her resignation this week after she claimed to have experienced ""harassment and racist marginalization"" from members of the executive board of the nonprofit civil rights organization.



Born in Trinidad of Indian descent, Toolsie was the first female South Asian leader on the organization's board. She was elected vice president of the Orange County branch and later became president in March after her predecessor resigned.

The Orlando Sentinel reported that Toolsie posted her resignation letter on Facebook but then replaced it with a shorter statement that read, ""I will NO LONGER tolerate ANY racism against me for being a #ProudBrownWoman of #SouthAsian and #Caribbean descent.""

She stated, ""The fact that I have consistently been made to endure this hateful racism in anti-racist spaces is abhorrently shameful, and in moving forward, let it be widely known that I have #ZEROtolerance for any further anti-Brown racism against me or anyone else. More to come. #STOPAAPIhate #BROWNandPROUD.”

During a virtual meeting with the board on Monday, Toolsie read her resignation letter. During the meeting, board members asked if Toolsie could provide evidence of the harassment and racism she encountered.

Toolsie alleged that someone from the executive board deliberately excluded her from the NAACP's gala by ignoring her emails and refusing to provide her with accurate and timely meeting announcements. She accused the member of intentionally interfering with her effectiveness and attempting to sabotage her.

Some members on the call responded with concern and asked how the organization could ensure similar treatment would not happen in the future. One board member expressed skepticism about Toolsie's claims and stated she was making ""false allegations against the executive committee.""

John Cummins, a spokesperson for the group, told the Orlando Sentinel that he is ""concerned about this person and the charges that were made. We don't want to overlook or dehumanize or, in any way, cause anybody problems or concern intentionally or unintentionally.""

Toolsie claimed that she tried to internally resolve the issue for months but that ""no action to curb the harassment and racist marginalization was taken by superiors prior to my resignation announcement.""

She wrote, ""It would be hypocritical of me to continue to stand at the helm of an organization branch 'for the equality of all persons' that is against racism and oppression, while I continue to be treated with such bold disproportionate inequality, maliciously racistly oppressed as the first AAPI President of the branch to a disproportionate blatant level that I have not yet seen in any organization.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/florida-naacp-president-resigns-racism,2022-08-25
"Florida woman rescued from storm drain for third time has history of drug use, mental illness","A Florida woman who has been rescued from a storm drain at least three times in as many years has a history of drug abuse and mental illness, family members claim.

Last week, Delray Beach police and fire teams had to rescue Lyndsey Jane Kennedy from a storm drain — again. Around noon on January 18, firefighters received a call about a swimmer who might be in distress in a canal near Lindell Boulevard. When they located the woman, they asked her if she needed help, but she ""ignored"" them and instead ""climbed into a storm drain pipe,"" the police report said.

Kennedy, who is approximately 45 years old, reportedly refused to cooperate with requests that she climb out of the storm drain on her own, so police eventually confined her to a limited area of the drain pipe, fashioned a harness, and climbed down a ladder to fetch her. When Kennedy resurfaced, she appeared to have minor injuries. She was taken to a nearby hospital as a precaution.

That marks at least the third time Kennedy has been rescued from a storm drain in recent years. On March 23, 2021, Delray Beach police received a call from a bystander who claimed she saw a naked woman down in a ""sewer"" and that she was yelling for help. When first responders arrived, they used a ladder to pull Kennedy from the storm drain. She then told them that she had gone for a swim several weeks prior but had gotten lost. She insisted she had survived in the storm drain system on a single can of ginger ale. Her boyfriend had reported her missing from his home, which was nearly 30 miles away, on March 3, though police expressed some skepticism that she had been in the storm drain the entire time.

""I don’t know how much longer she would have been OK down there,"" Delray Beach Fire Rescue spokesperson Dani Moschella said at the time.

""It’s dirty, dangerous, there’s snakes, rats, garbage, dirt and leaves, anything that’s on the street that washes into a sewer, and it smells terrible,"" she added.

At the time, police claimed Kennedy was ""coherent"" and therefore did not need to be institutionalized involuntarily. They did, however, contact her mother, who claimed that Kennedy has suffered from mental illness and has a history of narcotics abuse.

By May 2021, Kennedy had entered a rehab facility in Grand Prairie, Texas, but had wandered off shortly after checking in. She was spotted swimming in a nearby creek but then ducked into a storm drain to evade police. While teams continued to search for her, friends and family used a tracking app on her phone and repeatedly dropped food and Gatorade down manholes until Kennedy could be located. They found her in a canal four days later.

A Florida deputy indicated in a report that Kennedy had also gone missing in April 2020, though whether she had disappeared while swimming and whether she had been rescued in a storm drain are both unclear.

In 2021, Kennedy was arrested for a hit-and-run accident after she allegedly stole beer from a gas station. Her license was suspended 17 times between 2007 and 2020, the New York Post reported.

"Former Hooters waitress, charged with first-degree murder, offers to pay bond with money she earned on OnlyFans","A former Hooters waitress in Texas, charged with first-degree murder, has requested a judge lower her bond amount so that she can try and cover the cost with the money she has earned on OnlyFans.

On Friday, Ashley Esselborn, 21, asked 30th District Judge Jeff McKnight to reduce her bond from $100,000 to $50,000, claiming she could probably cover that threshold using money she has amassed on her X-rated OnlyFans account. Reports claim that Esselborn charged subscribers $12 a month for her content and has $8,000 currently in her account. OnlyFans has frozen those assets, but Esselborn told Judge McKnight that she has been in touch with the OnlyFans corporate office to have those assets released to her.

McKnight ultimately refused the request for reduced bond. He had already reduced Esselborn's bond once before, dropping it by 90% — from $1 million down to $100,000 — back in July.

The accusations leveled at Esselborn are horrific. According to prosecutors, Esselborn actively cheered as her boyfriend, William Bell, and associates Payton Collier and Ronnie Lang brutally beat 23-year-old Zachary Wood to death inside his Wichita Falls home back in May. The assailants supposedly used their fists, feet, and even a baseball bat in the attack, reports claim, because they believed that Wood had stolen drugs and cash from them while they were staying at his residence. Prosecutors have characterized Wood's death as ""a massive bloodletting event."" All four suspects were charged with first-degree murder.





Esselborn has admitted to disposing of various ""bloody items"" in connection to the case, but she denied ever physically striking Wood, police said. Collier seemed to corroborate Esselborn's story, allegedly telling police that, while Esselborn was present during the attack and taunted Wood and demanded he tell them where he put the stash of drugs and money he stole, she did not actually participate in the beating itself. However, another witness claimed that, after the alleged murder, she overheard Esselborn bragging on the phone that she had not been arrested, even though she ""put hands"" on Wood that night.



In September, Lang,18, pled guilty to murder and was sentenced to 50 years behind bars. Bell, 28, is currently free on $200,000 bond, while both Collier, 27, and Esselborn remain in custody pending trial. Collier's bond has been set at $500,000.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-hooters-waitress-charged-with-first-degree-murder-offers-to-pay-bond-with-money-she-earned-on-onlyfans,2022-12-13
"Former Kansas teacher to receive $95,000 from district that disciplined her for refusing to use preferred pronouns, lie to parents","A former Kansas middle school math teacher will soon receive a settlement of nearly $100,000 after a school district attempted to force her to violate her religious beliefs and call students by their preferred names and pronouns — and then withhold those same preferred names and pronouns from parents.

Pamela Ricard, 58, sued Geary School District, located about an hour west of Topeka, after she was disciplined in March 2021 for refusing to use male pronouns to refer to a biologically female student.

Ricard is a practicing Christian who believes that God creates human beings as either male or female and that gender is a fixed characteristic determined at conception, the lawsuit argued. Therefore, asking her to address the female student as a male ""actively violated her religious beliefs.""

As an alternative, Ricard began addressing the student in question as ""Miss (last name)"" to avoid using the student's preferred male first name. However, the district suspended Ricard for three days under the district's bullying and diversity and inclusion policies. The district also threatened to discipline Ricard further if she continued to misgender students.

Despite the insistence that Ricard and other teachers abide by so-called ""preferred pronouns"" and new first names, the district also demanded that teachers use a student's legal name and biological pronouns during parent-teacher conferences, if the student so wished. The district refused to grant Ricard the policy exemption she repeatedly requested, a fact that apparently did not sit well with the court.

""The Geary County School District unsuccessfully tried to convince a federal court that a teacher should completely avoid using a child’s name during a parent-teacher conference in order to hide new names and genders being used by the school for a child in a classroom,"" said attorney Joshua Ney of Alliance Defending Freedom, the group that provided Ricard with legal counsel.

In May, the court denounced the district policy, which attempted to compel teachers to conceal from parents the names and pronouns that their students used in school. The district has since abandoned that policy, though it is unclear whether the district has a policy regarding preferred pronouns in general.

Ultimately, Ricard and GCSD settled their differences out of court. GCSD agreed to pay Ricard $95,000 in compensation and release a public statement that she retired from the district in May in good standing with no disciplinary infractions. The district has not commented on the settlement.

""I’m glad the case clarifies the financial stakes for school boards if they attempt to force teachers to lie to parents about their students,"" Ney added.

Former Missouri high school teacher sentenced to 30 years for sexually exploiting minors — 11 child victims confirmed,"On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge M. Douglas Harpool sentenced Brandon Lane McCullough, a 31-year-old former high school teacher, to 30 years in federal prison without the possibility of parole. McCullough coerced young children into sending him pornographic images and videos of themselves.



Authorities seized a hard drive from McCullough’s home which contained thousands of explicit photos and videos of children. Police discovered that he had been exploiting minors since November 2018. He was a business teacher at a local Missouri high school when he committed the crimes.

McCullough pleaded guilty in 2021 to three counts of sexual exploitation of a minor and two counts of coercing and enticing a minor to engage in illicit sexual activity. Police were able to identify 11 underage victims that McCullough blackmailed and tricked into sending explicit images and videos.

After McCullough has completed his sentence, he will be forced to spend the remainder of his life on supervised release. He was also ordered to pay one of his victims $204,199 in restitution.

U.S. Attorney Teresa Moore stated, “He victimized 11 children who have been identified, and many more who have not yet been identified, in a horrific sexploitation scheme. He enticed countless child victims to send him explicit images of themselves, then threatened to share those images with their families and friends over social media unless they continued to send him even more explicit images and videos.”



A federal investigation was initiated in 2020 thanks to a New Jersey mother who reported that her 14-year-old daughter was having sexually explicit conversations and sending pornographic images to McCullough through a messaging application. McCullough told the young girl that he was a 15-year-old boy. He threatened to send her explicit pictures and videos to her family if she refused to send more.

Special agent in charge of the Kansas City area for Homeland Security Investigations Katherine Greer stated, “We, alongside our law enforcement partners, are committed to the eradication of sextortion from our communities, but we need the public’s help. HSI asks parents, guardians, teachers, caregivers — anyone who interacts with a child — to be on the lookout for, and report, suspicious online behavior to the proper authorities, regardless of whether the individual is in a position of public trust, like McCullough.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-missouri-high-school-teacher-sentenced-to-30-years-for-sexual-exploitation-of-a-minor-11-child-victims-confirmed,2022-08-04
Former NFL star found asleep on highway shoulder near 2 wrecked vehicles: 'You almost killed somebody',"A former star cornerback in the NFL was arrested for DUI after police say he lost control of his vehicle and smashed into a disabled truck, causing major damage to both vehicles and minor injuries to a nearby pedestrian.

Around 7 a.m. on Saturday, members of the Florida Highway Patrol arrived at the scene of a horrific-looking crash. A black Toyota truck with a flat tire had been parked along the shoulder of State Road 821 in Broward County when a black Tesla suddenly smashed into the back end of it.

The crash caused catastrophic damage to both vehicles, and a pedestrian was also hurt in the incident after the force of the collision caused the truck to strike a 59-year-old man, who was standing nearby. That man was taken to the hospital and treated for ""multiple"" minor injuries.



The man behind the wheel of the Tesla is believed to have been Vontae Davis, a 34-year-old who spent a decade playing professional football. While police and first responders were tending to victims and investigating the wreckage, Davis was spotted curled up and fast asleep near the highway wall.

Police cam footage obtained by TMZ indicates that Davis was likely under the influence. Even after police placed Davis in the back seat of a cop car, Davis had difficulty staying awake, and his speech was often difficult to understand. For example, when officers asked him where he had come from and where he had been headed, he mumbled a seemingly unintelligible answer that even confused the cops, but that Alejandro Avila of OutKick deciphered as ""shookum.""

During his conversation with police, Davis eventually admitted that he had been at a club earlier that morning and that he had consumed ""two mixed drinks."" He said he did not remember getting into a crash, and he refused several requests that he take a field sobriety test.

Despite the circumstances and his apparent condition, Davis still expressed surprise when police told him that they were arresting him for suspected DUI. But the cops kept their patience and remained firm with him.

""Your eyes are bloodshot. Your speech is slurred. You can barely stay awake,"" one cop noted. ""You almost killed somebody,"" he added.

Davis was arrested and charged with DUI, drugs or alcohol. He pled not guilty and was released on $500 bond.

Davis had a solid, 10-year career in the NFL. He was selected by the Dolphins in the first round of the 2009 draft and spent three seasons in Miami. He was then traded to the Indianapolis Colts in 2012 and stayed for five seasons. During that time, he notched 13 total interceptions and was selected to play in two Pro Bowl games. He then signed a one-year contract with the Bills in 2018, but lasted only a couple of weeks. In mid-September that year, Davis abruptly retired in the middle of a game and never played another down again.

Former pop singer opens up about abortion regret and her Christian faith in candid interview: 'Listen to God and be bold',"Amid a culture that emphasizes secular values, Kaya Jones — a former member of the Grammy-nominated girl band the Pussycat Dolls — has decided to speak out about her Christian faith. Now a pro-life advocate, Jones recently went on a pro-life podcast to speak openly for the first time about her three abortion experiences and to encourage women to surrender to God's plan for them and embrace the call to marriage and motherhood rather than simply pursue worldly success.

In a video posted on January 4, Jones, whose real name is Chrystal Neria, appeared on the ""Speak Out with Christine Yeargin"" podcast. According to her website, Yeargin ""became passionate about the pro-life movement"" at a very young age when she found herself pregnant out of wedlock. She and her son's father ultimately chose life and continue to ""co-parent,"" even though she is now married to someone else.

Jones took a different path when confronted with an unplanned pregnancy. At age 16 or 17, before she ever joined the Pussycat Dolls, Jones became pregnant, even though she had been using birth control. She immediately decided to have an abortion, a choice that she said then desensitized her to abortion and other destructive decisions.

""After the first one,"" Jones said, ""you don't think you've done anything wrong. It’s been normalized. And what is a line until you’ve crossed it? … Once you’ve crossed that line, it’s a very slippery slope to continue to cross those lines.""

That first abortion prompted her to have a second abortion a few years later, when she was performing on stage in front of thousands of fans, many of whom looked up to her as a role model. She then underwent a third abortion when she was about 30, a child she conceived after she was raped by a man with whom she had had a previous relationship.

She called her abortion experiences ""painful beyond measure"" and stated that, at that point in her life, she was ""in bondage to the devil"" and suffering from drug abuse and eating disorders. ""Nothing can make that go away but God himself,"" she asserted.

Jones told Yeargin that many artists her age endured the same pressure to ""get rid"" of their unborn children and to continue to present themselves as sex symbols. She even alleged that some female artists and celebrities, whom she did not name, had been ""fired"" when they refused to have an abortion.

Despite her ""damaging"" experiences with abortion and what she described as a sensationalized ""prostitution ring,"" Jones indicated that the culture in Hollywood may be changing and may soon be more receptive to women as traditional wives and mothers. She mentioned that there are ""good people"" in the music industry, and she also pointed to the Kardashians and women like Gwen Stefani to show that famous women have already managed to become mothers without sacrificing their careers.

Though Jones bucked the trend to ""shout"" her abortion and instead revealed her pro-life beliefs in a tweet thread nearly four years ago, she had not opened up about her own experiences with abortion until now. ""The Holy Spirit put on my heart to share my story"" and ""to speak on this issue,"" she told Yeargin.

Jones was formally baptized in a televised ceremony in 2021. Now 38, she said she hopes one day to be a wife and a mother and stated that she is currently staying celibate as she continues to follow God's law as dictated in scripture. ""If you know better, you do better,"" she said.

When Yeargin asked her to give one piece of advice to young people today, Jones replied, ""Be fearless and be bold because God is with you.""



""Listen to God and be bold,"" she added.

His race was 'an albatross around his neck': Former city employee sues Seattle and its mayor over CRT-based anti-white discrimination,"A former municipal employee is taking the City of Seattle and its Democrat mayor to task for allegedly creating a ""racially hostile work environment"" and for advancing an identitarian ideology that openly discriminates on the basis of race.

Joshua Diemert, who worked as a program intake representative in the city's Human Services Department from 2013 to 2021, is not only seeking redress in the form of declaratory relief and $300,000 in lost earnings, but fighting to ensure that other workers are not similarly mistreated by the City of Seattle on account of their race.

Racialism alive and well in the Emerald City

Diemert filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on Nov. 16 against both the City of Seattle and its Democrat mayor, Bruce Harrell.

The suit states that the city's acts, policies, practices, and procedures violated Diemert's rights as secured by the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.



Despite having received the HSD's ""maximum achievement"" award in 2014 and reportedly developing good relationships across several city departments, Diemert, a white man, ""began to understand that his race would negatively impact not only his day-to-day work life, but his opportunities for career advancement.""

The suit alleges that Diemert's race was ""an albatross around his neck"" as the consequence of the ""City's Race and Social Justice Initiative (RSJI) ... a city-wide program that requires race-based thinking and decision-making in an effort to end 'structural racism.'""

According to the complaint and evident from the initiative's documentation, RSJI holds that ""white male individuals like Mr. Diemert 'are bolstered by racism,' that they 'internalize it,' and that 'individuals, institutions, and communities are often unconsciously and habitually rewarded for supporting white privilege and power.'""

Had the ideology been contained or it assumption optional, Diemert may have been able to continue in the role without suffering ""a significantly negative impact"" on his mental and physical health. However, the suit claims that the ""discrimination at HSD became increasingly pervasive and hostile"" and altogether unavoidable.

For refusing to be party to the identitarian agenda, Diemert was allegedly ""chastised and punished.""

The City's Office for Civil Rights has segregated training sessions on the basis of Critical Race Theory claims. In one instance, Diemert was invited to a training session on ""Internalized Racial Superiority"" that was ""specifically targeted for White employees.""

This session accused white employees of being complicit ""in the system of white supremacy"" and accused white employees of internalizing and reinforcing racism.

Even outside these segregated anti-white seminars, Diemert ""was forced to continue looking at degrading and racist material disseminated in the office that labeled him a white supremacist,"" said the suit.

Regardless of his participation, Diemert allegedly was denied opportunities for advancement on the basis of his racial and ethnic identity and told he could not be a victim of racism or discrimination because he ""possessed 'white privilege.'""

According to the the firm representing Diemert, the Pacific Legal Foundation, Diemert was allegedly pressured to resign from a position rather than take family and medical leave because ""he was told that taking FMLA leave would be an exercise of his 'white privilege' and would deny a 'person of color' an opportunity for promotion.""

Extra to allegedly being edged out of existing positions because of the color of his skin, Diemert was told that new positions, particularly senior roles, should similarly be staffed on the basis of race.

Diemert's attorney Laura D'Agostino said in a release, ""Instead of supporting its employees and providing them with opportunities, the City of Seattle is encouraging racial discrimination and harassment through its Race and Social Justice Initiative.""

""Seattle employees should be treated as individuals with dignity and evaluated by the content of their character, not the color of their skin,"" D'Agostino added.

The communications director of the Seattle City Attorney's Office, Anthony Derrick, told Fox News Digital, ""Our office has is [sic] aware of this complaint and we are currently reviewing the allegations against the City.""

Race and Social Justice Initiative

In one document hosted on the City of Seattle's website, the RSJI explicitly states, ""We 'lead with race'.""

Seattle's RSJI defines racism as a ""form of oppression based on race"" to which only certain groups can be subjected. ""People who identify as Black, Indigenous and People of Color are targets of racism.""

The so-called ""truths"" the RSJI holds dear, in addition to the notion that white people cannot experience racism, include:

""Colonialism is at the root of white supremacy"";

""Race matters"";

""Racism is based on the legal and social construction of whiteness""; and

""As city employees it is our responsibility to understand, challenge and work to dismantle racism and replace it with an anti-racist reality in which we all can thrive.""

According to the RSJI, the ""culture that has been internalized and normalized by organizations throughout our U.S. society ... was created by white, wealthy, Christian, cis-gender, straight, nondisabled men coming from Europe who wanted to protect their place within hierarchy and empire.""

Since American culture is allegedly the product of healthy white Christian men, the RSJI stated that ""particular patterns in our organizational cultures are rooted in white supremacy, colonialism, classism, Christian hegemony, sexism, heterosexism, physical ableism, mental health oppression, all of the above or other systems of oppression.""

City workers are called to ""interrupt these patterns.""

Angry Democrats vent their frustrations with Biden as red wave prepares to hit Dems: 'Our house is on fire',"Democrats are increasingly voicing their frustrations with President Joe Biden over what they believe is his inability to impose the Democratic agenda.

What are they saying?

After three mass killings — in Buffalo, Uvalde, and now Highland Park — Democrats are calling out Biden for what they believe is a ""flat"" response, Politico reported.

Biden has repeatedly demanded reforms be made, but has done little to make gun reform a reality, his intra-party critics say.

""He’s missing the boat here. This is our time to dig in and be absolutely furious because these one-half measures are not working. He’s got a real excitability problem,"" Democratic strategist Camille Rivera told Politico. ""I really don’t understand where this passivity comes from in this situation.""

Rivera added that Biden is ""not meeting the moment. He has to meet the moment.""

One anonymous Democratic strategist even told The Hill that Biden's supposedly muted response and failure to enact more progressive policies is ""infuriating.""

""Our house is on fire and it seems like they’re doing nothing to put the fire out,"" that strategist said. ""They’re just watching it with the rest of us.""

Even a Democratic congressman, who refused to disclose his name, told NBC News that Biden must change his approach, pointing to Biden's dismal approval numbers that most political experts believe precipitates a red wave in the 2022 midterm elections.

""He has to change course. His numbers are in the toilet. Whatever he’s doing is not working,"" the congressman said. ""There’s a benefit to having the president out there every day using his executive power to show the country you’re fighting for them. And it’s almost like he’s hiding. He has the bully pulpit, and he’s either hiding behind it or under it. I don’t know where he is.""

If not Biden, then who?

The Washington Post reported that Democrats could turn to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker to fill what Adam Jentleson, a former top adviser to Harry Reid, called a ""leadership vacuum""

Both Democratic leaders are more directly confronting Republicans, which Democratic strategists believe is an effective strategy.

Newsom, for example, is running ads in Florida directly challenging Gov. Ron DeSantis (R). Pritzker, meanwhile, directly appealed to politics and gun control after the Highland Park massacre.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/frustrated-democrats-vent-over-bidens-performance,2022-07-06
'Bold hypocrisy': Gavin Newsom caught vacationing in red state on California's travel ban list,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) is defending himself after he was caught vacationing in Montana.

What is the problem?

Newsom left California with his family last month, but did not initially disclose the location of his travels. Officials did not immediately answer why the information was not shared, which is unusual for Newsom's out-of-state trips, Cal Matters reported.

But on Tuesday, Cal Matters reporter Emily Hoeven discovered that Newsom traveled to Montana, where his in-laws own a ranch, according to the Associated Press.

The problem is that Montana is among other states on a travel ban list imposed by the state of California. The prohibition bars ""state-funded"" or ""state-sponsored"" travel to states that California officials claimed have adopted policies that discriminate against LGBT people.

News of the governor's travels are leading to new charges of ""bold hypocrisy."" Newsom was accused of hypocrisy throughout the COVID-19 pandemic when he was caught caught skirting rules that Californians otherwise had to follow.

What is Newsom saying?

Now, Newsom is on the defensive, arguing his vacation does not violate the travel ban.

""We don’t legislate where people vacation. Never have. The travel ban applies to expending state funds. The Governor’s travel is not being paid for by the state,"" Anthony York, a senior adviser to the governor, told Cal Matters.

However, when asked whether taxpayer funds are paying for Newsom's security while out-of-state, York refused to answer. ""We don’t comment or provide details on the governor’s security,"" he said.

The question is important because California's state law enforcement agency, the California Highway Patrol, is tasked with dignitary protection.

The CHP's website states:

Dignitary Protection Section (DPS) operates from both Los Angeles and Sacramento and is responsible for the protection of state constitutional officers including: the Governor, First Lady, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, State Controller, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the State Insurance Commissioner.

Politico reported that, in the past, California governors have traveled out-of-state with CHP agents serving as security. If that is true now, then Newsom would appear to be skirting the travel ban, since the CHP is funded through taxpayer dollars.

Newsom is expected to return to California over the weekend, Hoeven reported.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gavin-newsom-montana-vacation-hypocrisy-accusations,2022-07-07
Gavin Newsom signs potentially unconstitutional bill to make California a sanctuary for trans kids,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Thursday signed into law a bill designating his state as a sanctuary for gender-dysphoric children and teens seeking so-called ""gender-affirming care.""

Senate Bill 107, introduced by left-wing state Sen. Scott Wiener (D), offers a wide range of legal protections for transgender youths and their parents who come to California seeking hormone prescriptions or sex-reassignment surgeries that have been made illegal in other states.

In a signing statement, Newsom called policies restricting gender transition for minors hateful and accused conservative states of attempting to ""demonize"" transgender youths.

“In California we believe in equality and acceptance. We believe that no one should be prosecuted or persecuted for getting the care they need — including gender-affirming care,” Newsom said. “Parents know what’s best for their kids, and they should be able to make decisions around the health of their children without fear. We must take a stand for parental choice.”

The new law instructs California courts and attorneys to refuse to comply with out-of-state subpoenas, warrants, and child custody orders issued for individual minors or families seeking sex-change surgeries or cross-sex hormones.

The legislation also ""prohibits the arrest or recognition of any demand for extradition of an individual that criminalizes allowing a person to receive or provide gender-affirming health care where that conduct would not be unlawful under California’s law,"" according to Wiener's press office. An out-of-state criminal arrest warrant for someone who violated another state's laws against providing gender transition services to children will be given ""the lowest priority for law enforcement in California.""

Wiener introduced the bill in response to at least 20 Republican-led states that have introduced legislation that would ban gender transition services for minors and penalize parents and health care providers who try to transition children.

Many of these attempts by Republican legislators to restrict gender transition for minors have been stalled in courts. In August, a federal appeals court blocked Arkansas from enforcing its ban on ""gender-affirming care"" for minors.

The California transgender sanctuary law may face similar legal challenges, according to the Los Angeles Times. Federal laws that require states to recognize out-of-state laws when residents travel could make the sanctuary law unconstitutional.

“We may have limits under the U.S. Constitution, but we are going to go right up to the edge of what we’re able to do to protect them and say, ‘Unless we are absolutely forced to send you back, we are not going to send you back,’” Wiener told the L.A. Times.

“We can’t solve everything in one bill. We’re making sure that people who are being criminalized have a place to go,” he added. “This bill is about giving people refuge.”

Conservative groups slammed the new law. The California Family Council said it encourages ""medical child abuse.""

""SB 107 endangers every young person in the nation who experiences gender dysphoria,"" CFC President Jonathan Keller said in a statement. ""By signing this extreme bill, Gavin Newsom is telling all parents across the country that he knows what’s best for their children. Mothers and fathers in every state should demand their elected representatives push back against this unconstitutional assault on parental rights. Governors and legislators must defend their citizens from this out-of-control government in Sacramento.”

Insurance company ordered to pay woman $5.2 million after claim she caught STD from male partner during sex in his car,"Insurance company Geico has been ordered to fork over $5.2 million to a Missouri woman on the heels of her claim she caught an STD after having sex with a male partner in his car, which was insured by Geico.

Say what?

A Missouri court on Tuesday upheld a judgment awarding the money to the woman —referred to as ""M.O."" in court documents — who claimed she caught the human papillomavirus after having sex in 2017 with a male partner in his 2014 Hyundai Genesis, CBS News reported, citing a 2021 complaint.



The woman learned in 2018 she had HPV and claimed the man also knew he had it but failed to tell her, leaving her with ""past and future medical expenses"" and ""mental and physical pain and suffering,"" CBS News added.

The woman told Geico she was pursuing legal action against the man, claiming she was negligently infected in the vehicle and that the car insurance policy should provide coverage for her injuries and losses, the network reported.

M.O. asked Geico for $1 million, CBS News said, citing the complaint — and she wrote, ""Let me know.""

Uh, no

Geico denied the coverage and rejected her claim, the network said. With that, the woman and man entered arbitration, and the arbitrator found the man negligently infected her and awarded damages of $5.2 million to M.O. to be paid by Geico, CBS News added.

Geico appealed the arbitrator's decision, but the Missouri court ruled that Geico had no legal grounds to appeal on several points, the network said. While Geico claimed it was ""denied the right to litigate its interests before judgment was entered against its insured,"" CBS News reported that the court said Geico had a chance to do so when the woman contacted the insurance company claiming it should cover her injury and losses.

""Geico did not take advantage of this opportunity, and instead denied coverage and refused to defend Insured,"" the court noted, according to the network.

CBS News said Geico didn't immediately respond to its request for comment.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/geico-5-million-std-car,2022-06-09
Biden adviser melts down when challenged by Fox News hosts on inflation and the economy: 'You know the answer to that!',"An interview with Gene Sperling, a senior advisor to President Joe Biden, devolved into a shouting match on Fox News when he was challenged to defend the president's plan on inflation and the economy.

Sperling shouted at co-hosts John Roberts and Sandra Smith who challenged him to explain the missteps of the Biden administration that led to soaring inflation on ""America Reports"" Tuesday.

""If he has been obsessed with bringing gas prices down,"" asked Smith in reference to Biden, ""why are we at a brand new record high today, why are we seeing $4.62 a gallon at the pump if this president's been obsessed with tackling gas prices and inflation?""

""You know the, you know the answer to that!"" Sperling responded.

""You know that this is global, you read the papers today, you know that the Euro just said that inflation is 8.1%, you read the papers last week that the UK was at 9%, you know that this is a global issue,"" he continued, appearing frustrated.

""So there's nothing we can do about it? There's nothing we can do as a country to bring prices down?"" Smith interjected.

""I've explicitly, I've explicitly said the opposite!"" answered Sperling, who went on to say that the Biden administration will back the independent actions of the Federal Reserve to bring inflation down.

Smith went on to ask Sperling to forecast the future prices of gasoline, but he refused and instead cited economic statistics favorable to the administration.

Later in the segment, Sperling angrily berated the hosts for asking for Biden's economic plan.

""Gene, we appreciate you joining us, these are pretty simple questions, and you know we appreciate you joining us but, people just want to know what the plan is, I mean, gas prices all-time high, inflation at a 40 year high, the president in his speech makes the case that the economy is thriving!"" Smith said.

""You know what? I just, you know what? Here's the deal, I just go through the plan, and you just pretend that I didn't say it, you just ignore and you just ask the same questions,"" Sperling responded, raising his voice.

""It's your show, if that's what you want to do, but when I'm going though this and you just interrupt, I don't see how that's helping your viewers. Now you can say that you disagree with the plan,"" he continued.



""We gave you quite a bit of time to explain!"" Smith protested.

""By the way! By the way!"" he shouted. ""Last time I was on this show, you were upset because I was talking about the Rick Scott plan!""

Sperling went on to argue that Republicans didn't have a plan to address the economy while angrily claiming he had tried to present Biden's economic plan but was being interrupted by Smith and Roberts.

Elsewhere in the interview, he touted the administration's track record on job recovery while admitting that they needed to transition towards battling inflation.

Polling shows that most Americans blame Biden and his high spending policies for damaging inflation and the state of the economy.

George Soros refuses to accept responsibility for crime waves in cities controlled by Democrats,"On July 31, billionaire and leftwing philanthropist George Soros penned an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal wherein he defended his support for “reform prosecutors.” In the piece, he rejected the suggestion that the liberal district attorneys, prosecutors, and politicians he has financially backed — along with their unifying agenda — are responsible for the recent increase in crime.

Soros' defense comes in response to criticism by ""politicians and pundits,"" but likely also to the recent June 2022 report issued by the non-profit Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund (LELDF).

The LELDF report detailed the impact made by the 75 Soros-backed ""social justice prosecutors"" who now represent ""1 in 5 Americans or more than 72 million people,"" alleging that ""in 2021, more than 40% (9,000+) of the approximately 22,500 homicides in the US occurred in areas overseen by these DAs."" It further alleged that ""these prosecutors' charging and plea deal decisions, sentencing recommendations, and trial strategies"" have been a major part of the perpetuation of and rise in crime in the cities they oversee.

Confronted with such claims about the fallout that his investments have produced, Soros suggested that the agenda advanced by the “reform-minded prosecutors and other law-enforcement officials” whom he financially backs is both “popular” and “effective.”

The increasing crime rates in Democrat-controlled cities are to blame, argues Soros, on “a disturbing rise in mental illness among young people ... a pullback in policing in the wake of public criminal justice reform protests, and increases in gun trafficking.”

Among the “reform-minded” individuals supported by Soros are:

L.A. District Attorney George Gascon, given $4.7 million for his election campaign in 2020 via Soros' California Justice and Safety PAC;

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, given $1.3 million via Soros' Color of Change;

Cook County, Illinois state's attorney Kim Foxx, who received $2 million for her campaign in 2020 and $708,000;

Baltimore state's attorney Marilyn Mosby; and

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who allegedly received $1,070,000 in 2021 through two of Soros' PACs.

In their respective cities, crime is in fact on the rise.

Fox News recently reported that Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York City were on their ways to breaking 2021 levels of violent crime by midyear.

Compared with 2021, this year violent crime has increased by: 25.8% under Bragg; 6.1% under Mosby; 7% under Krasner; and 8.6% under Gascon. Kim Foxx's Cook County had 1,002 gun-related homicides in 2021 alone

Soros' displacement of blame has not been well-received online.

Jesse Kelly joined former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani in rejecting Soros' rationalizations.

According to Open Secrets, George Soros, whose worth has been estimated by Forbes to be $8.6 billion, is the “top individual super PAC donor for the 2022 midterm election,” having contributed “$126 million of the $155 million angel donors have given to liberal super PACs so far this election cycle.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/george-soros-refuses-responsibility,2022-08-02
Georgia Democrats speak out against Stacey Abrams after she loses second consecutive election in landslide,"Democrat Stacey Abrams implied in her concession speech that persecution is one reason among many why she lost her second consecutive campaign to become governor of Georgia.

But Georgia Democrats say Abrams must take responsibility for her convincing defeat.

What are they saying?

After her 2018 defeat, Abrams infamously refused to concede and for years attributed her loss to factors outside her control. Still, she quickly rose to stardom in the Democratic Party and became a national force who raised significant sums of money for Democrats.

But Abrams' second loss to Republican Brian Kemp — this time by a margin of 7.5% — has Democrats second-guessing her political prowess.

State Rep. Derrick Jackson (D) told the New York Times that black organizations urged Abrams to meet with them earlier this year, but she didn't because of her schedule. But when her poll numbers began dropping, she finally did.

""Stacey must own some of this,"" Jackson said. ""If you’re running a statewide race, if you venture off and you nationalize it, then that’s problematic.""

Moreover, David Brand, whom the Times described as ""a veteran Atlanta Democratic strategist,"" said that many times Abrams was meeting with people virtually while her opponent was meeting them face to face.

""She’s having Zoom meetings with black businesspeople,"" Brand said. ""Brian Kemp’s having cocktails with them.

Democrat Jason Carter, who lost the 2014 Georgia gubernatorial election, said that Abrams' national profile came with consequences, like twice losing an election in her home state.

""She had spent an enormous amount of time being a national figure on really crucially important issues,"" Carter told the Times. ""That national profile is really important and has enormous value, but it also has consequences.""

Anything else?

During her concession speech, Abrams quoted a famous Bible verse describing persecution in the early church, thus implying her circumstances are similar.

""I am ... reminded of what Scripture tells us,"" Abrams said before reciting 2 Corinthians 4:8, ""We are troubled on every side yet not distressed. We are perplexed, but not in despair. Persecuted, but not forsaken. Cast dead on but not destroyed.""

""I know the results aren't what we hoped for tonight, and I understand that you are hurting and you are disappointed — I am too,"" she continued. ""We may not have made it to the finish line. But we ran that race. And we know this path and we know that running is what matters. That standing is what matters. That defending is what matters.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/georgia-democrats-stacey-abrams-loss,2022-11-11
'Get out before I kill you!' Carjacker presses gun against Uber driver's head — but victim doesn't allow things to go down without a fight,"Video captured inside a vehicle in Houston shows a carjacker pressing a gun against an Uber driver's head and ordering him to ""get out before I kill you!""

However, KRIV-TV reported that the driver wasn't about to let the crime proceed without a fight.

What are the details?

While the crime took place Oct. 18 last year, Houston Police Robbery released video of the terrifying encounter Tuesday.

KRIV said the driver — named Dovran — picked up two riders around 4 p.m. near Westheimer and South Voss Roads. The station said that during the ride, the pair changed their drop-off location to an apartment complex on Dunvale Road.

But when the driver reached that location, things turned violent, KRIV said.

One of the suspects — who wasn't wearing a mask over his face — reached forward and tried to grab Dovran's phone.

Then the second suspect — who was wearing blue surgical mask — took things further.

""The second one put a gun to my head,"" Dovran recalled to the station.

Image source: Twitter video screenshot via @hpdrobbery

At that point, the first rider is seen exiting the vehicle — and Dovran told KRIV that the first rider ""pulled the driver's door, and tried to pull me out, but I was holding tight.""

Despite a gun being held to his head, Dovran battled back.

The station said a struggle ensued, and Dovran managed to drive off — except the gunman was still in the back seat.

""He was holding a gun to my head, he was screaming, 'Stop the car, or I'll shoot you,'"" Dovran recounted to the station. ""I didn't stop, and then lucky for me, he decided to jump out.""

Here's video of what unfolded in the car. Content warning: Language:

KRIV said Dovran sustained only a few scratches, and a station reporter asked him how he managed to fight back and refuse the carjacker's orders with a gun pressed against his head.

""I don't know, I didn't think about it,"" he told the station, adding that it still was ""scary.""

Image source: KRIV-TV video screenshot

Asked if he'd do anything differently with hindsight, Dovran told KRIV, ""No.""

Dovran still drives for Uber but told KRIV he's being more cautious about whom he picks up and where he does it.

Crime Stoppers is offering $5,000 for any tips leading to the suspects' arrests, the station said.

Anything else?

The station said Uber issued the following statement: ""The actions of the riders shown in the video were chilling to watch, and we are grateful the driver wasn’t injured. We removed the rider’s [sic] access and have reached out to the driver to offer support. We look forward to assisting police in identifying those responsible.""

KRIV noted that Uber recently rolled out a rider verification feature to add an extra layer of protection for drivers, saying that if a driver feels unsafe, the driver can end the ride immediately.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/get-out-before-i-kill-you-carjacker-presses-gun-against-uber-drivers-head-but-victim-isnt-about-to-let-things-go-down-without-a-fight,2023-01-05
Top military commander confirms key detail that Pentagon official omitted to incite criticism against Trump,"A top military commander admitted Monday there had been a ""domain awareness gap"" during the Trump administration, allowing three Chinese spy balloons to gather intelligence on the U.S. undetected.

""Every day as a NORAD commander, it's my responsibility to detect threats to North America. I will tell you that we did not detect those threats,"" said Gen. Glen VanHerck, commander of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command.

""And that's a domain awareness gap that we have to figure out, but I don’t want to go into further detail,"" he added.

What is the background?

The shocking disclosure comes after an unnamed senior defense official claimed on Saturday that three Chinese ""government surveillance balloons transited the continental United States briefly"" under former President Donald Trump's watch.

Democrats immediately used the allegation to defend President Joe Biden from criticism stemming from his response to the spy balloon recently seen in American air space and subsequently criticize Trump.

But a score of senior Trump administration officials, those who led the national security apparatus, quickly pushed back on the allegation and publicly disputed it. None of them had recollection of any such event occurring under Trump.

Gen. VanHerck confirmed what the Wall Street Journal and Fox News reported earlier — that Chinese spy balloons did cross over the U.S., but they somehow went undetected.

Unfortunately, it's not clear exactly who told the media about the Chinese spy balloon incursions under Trump only to mislead reporters by conveniently omitting the fact that the incursions were not discovered until after Trump left office. The Washington Free Beacon noted the identity of the ""senior defense official"" could help inform the public ""whether the Pentagon is also helping Biden combat the public relations crisis over the balloon.""

The Pentagon, however, refused to identify the ""senior defense official"" because Saturday's media briefing was conducted on ""background"" and thus was not officially on the record.

"Watch: Democrat refuses to provide definitive response about whether she supports biological males playing in women's sports, calls it 'a nuanced question'","When asked whether she supports biological males playing in women's sports, Democratic congressional candidate Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez declined to provide a definitive answer and instead argued that it is ""a nuanced question"" and would depend on the situation.

Gluesenkamp Pérez is running against Republican candidate Joe Kent for the opportunity to represent Washington's 3rd Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Gluesenkamp Pérez indicated that her position would depend on factors such as when an individual transitioned and what the person's hormone levels are. ""Athletes have all different natural hormone levels,"" she said, claiming that the matter represents ""a nuanced question.""

When asked if she supports gender-affirming care for individuals younger than 18, Gluesenkamp Pérez said that she needed to know what the questioner meant.

After the person mentioned puberty blockers and sterilization, the Democratic candidate said that the issue is a decision that should be made by the family, not the government.

The issues of whether biological males should be permitted to compete in women's sports and whether minors should be able to get gender transition services both represent areas of raging cultural debate as some people promote the reality-defying dogmas of radical leftist gender ideology and others stand for truth and objective biology.

Democrats currently control both chambers of Congress, but Republicans could potentially change that if they perform well during the midterm elections. Election Day is next week, and some Americans have already cast their ballots. President Joe Biden, who is not on the ballot, has been underwater in job approval polling for quite some time. And the election comes as Americans have been enduring roaring inflation month after month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gluesenkamp-perez-democrat-transgender-sports,2022-11-04
"'Good boy, get him': Woman who assaulted her roommate with the help of a pit bull pleads guilty to murder","A Kentucky woman has pled guilty to murder after a brutal attack involving her pit bull resulted in a man's death.

In the wee hours of the morning on January 10, 2020, police were called to the Conway, Kentucky, residence of Melissa Wolke after an unnamed neighbor became alarmed by the sound of vicious fighting. When the neighbor came over to assess the situation, he saw Wolke sitting on top of her roommate, a 55-year-old auto mechanic named Donald Abner, and assaulting him physically.

The neighbor also overheard Wolke encouraging her pit bull to attack. ""Good boy, get him,"" the neighbor heard Wolke tell her pit bull, Denali.

When police arrived, they found Wolke and Denali still attacking Abner. They eventually had to shoot and kill the dog because Wolke refused to call him off or otherwise subdue him. She later told police that Denali had once been trained for fighting, but had been friendly and obedient since she had adopted him.

""[Wolke] appeared to have blood on her hands and feet and had a large clump of hair in her hands that was consistent with the victim's hair,"" a police report at the time claimed.

The neighbor also reportedly filmed the attack on his phone, but quickly deleted the video of it because it made him ""sick to watch."" Police were never able to recover the video from his phone.

An investigation of the crime scene showed no signs of a struggle and no drugs, though there was an empty liquor bottle.









When police attempted to question Wolke seven hours after they had brought her to the detention center, she was still too intoxicated to speak with them, Kentucky State Police Detective Ryan Loudermilk later testified in court. After she revived, she admitted that she struggled with alcohol abuse and that she sometimes blacked out after consuming too much alcohol.

She also appeared distraught about the incident, crying and repeating the phrase, ""Oh my God! I went 'redneck' on"" Abner, a man she claimed had been a longtime friend and who had been living with her at the residence for three months before his death.

A coroner determined that Abner died of asphyxiation at the scene. He also had several facial lacerations and a broken bone in his neck, but the coroner did not believe Abner sustained those injuries from a dog bite.

Last month, Wolke, now 40, pled guilty to murder in the death of Abner, and on Monday, she received a sentence of 20 years in prison.

Wolke will appear in court once again in March on unrelated misdemeanor charges.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/good-boy-get-him-woman-who-assaulted-her-roommate-with-the-help-of-a-pit-bull-pleads-guilty-to-murder,2022-11-09
Google bars Truth Social from its Play store,"Google notified Truth Social on August 19 that former President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social, as it now stands and operates, is inadmissible to the Google Play store.

What is Truth Social?



Truth Social is a social media platform created by Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), an American company founded in October 2021 by former President Donald Trump.

Trump announced on October 20, 2021, his intention to publicly list TMTG with the aim of ""creat[ing] a rival to the liberal media consortium and fight[ing] back against the 'Big Tech' companies of Silicon Valley, which have used their unilateral power to silence opposing voices in America.""

It launched on February 21. On the day of its release, it was #1 in the App Store.

Truth Social's U.S. ranking as of August 30 in Apple's App Store was #148 overall and #25 in the social networking category.

The former president stated: ""I created TRUTH Social and TMTG to stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech. We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favorite American President has been silenced.""

Why specifically did Google bar it from the Google Play store?



The reason for this rejection, according to the tech giant, is that Truth Social's current app submission violates the Google market's standard policies and lacks ""effective systems for moderating user-generated content.""

Axios first reported that Google's concerns relate to unmoderated content such as physical threats and incitements to violence. Unlike other approved platforms, Truth Social does not apply ""sensitive content"" banners on or before posts that some might find objectionable, violence-inciting, or misleading. It also is alleged not to have as stringent an approach to moderation as other approved apps.

An example of a reply on Truth Social that would constitute infringement, cited by Axios, read: ""It's be nice if you people weren't just okay with the military and police stage a rebellion and framing civilians. Zero people trust the police and if the military comes in, we'll kill them. Someone admit this nation needs to be nuked because it's satanic.""

The post, by Google's standards, would have at least required a label such as ""This content may not be suitable for all audiences.""

Truth Social acknowledged Google's grievances and reportedly indicated it would work to address these issues. TMTG is working with a San Francisco-based company called Hive to develop AI-based content moderation tools to flag pornographic content along with hate speech and violent rhetoric.

Parler, another free speech-oriented social media app, was banned from the Google Play store in 2021 for reasons similar to those now being cited by Google for barring Truth Social.



Does the same standard of moderation apply to Facebook and Twitter?

In May 2022, the video filmed by the gunman who perpetrated a ghastly mass shooting in Buffalo was widely circulated on Twitter and Facebook, despite the company's moderation teams and policies. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul condemned the social media platforms responsible, without naming any one in particular: ""They can be in a sense an accomplice to a crime like this. Perhaps not legally, but morally. They created the platform to allow this hate to be spewed.""

Elon Musk suggested earlier this year that Twitter was biased in its moderation, permitting what some have characterized as terroristic incitements and hate speech from leftist accounts.

Twitter also remained in the Google Play store despite permitting Taliban accounts on its platform.

Politico Europe reported last year that Islamic extremists manage to stay on Facebook, spreading extremist propaganda, photos of beheadings, and violent hate speech. Nevertheless, Facebook remains in the Google Play store.

What will the impact be?



Google's barring of the app from its store may have financial and political consequences.

This setback could affect the platform's momentum as TMTG is simultaneously being bogged down elsewhere.

Fox Business reported that one of TMTG's vendors, RightForge, is pressing the company for $1.6 million for hosting services, which it allegedly has been due in installments since March.

Truth Social's parent company, which filed a $6.5 million loss with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the first half of 2022, opens voting Tuesday on a potential yearlong delay for the merger between TMTG and the SPAC Digital World Acquisition Corp., which if successful, would have taken it public on September 8.

The platform also had its application for a trademark turned down earlier this month.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned issues, the company has suggested that dire pronouncements on Truth Social's wellbeing are ""knowingly false bar talk,"" and that it has raised over $15 million and boasts enough operating capital to operate into the first quarter of 2023.

As for being denied access to the Play store, Truth Social may lose out on a massive influx of users. Approximately 44% of U.S. smartphone users won't be able to download the app as a result of Google's decision. Android users can, however, still access Truth Social directly through the platform's website.

In 2021, Trump was banned from Twitter, where he had roughly 88 million followers, and was suspended from Facebook, where he has 34 million followers. He was also banned from Google's YouTube, where he had over 2.77 million subscribers, on January 12, 2021. All three companies insinuated Trump had a role in the January 6 Capitol protests.

Trump presently has approximately 4 million followers on Truth Social.

Google's decision may greatly contain the former president's reach and influence ahead of the 2022 midterm and 2024 presidential elections.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/google-bars-truth-social-from-play-store,2022-08-30
Justice Gorsuch corners Colorado solicitor general into admission about what state did to cake baker Jack Phillips,"Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch got Colorado Solicitor General Eric Olson to essentially admit on Monday that cake baker Jack Phillips went through a reeducation program.

The admission happened as Gorsuch grilled Olson during oral arguments for 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, a case about whether public accommodation laws that compel artists to violate their personal beliefs violate the First Amendment.

What happened?

After an intense back-and-forth, Gorsuch questioned Olson about the legal remedy that Colorado imposed against Phillips for not having baked a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. Though Olson denied it was a ""reeducation"" program per se, what he described was a reeduction program.

""Mr. Phillips did go through a reeducation training program pursuant to Colorado law, did he not?"" Gorsuch asked.

""He went through a process that ensured he was familiar with —"" Olson responded.

""It was a reeducation program, right?"" Gorsuch interjected.

""It was not a reeducation program,"" Olson fired back.

""What do you call it?"" the justice followed up.

""It was a process to make sure he was familiar with Colorado law,"" Olson admitted.

""Someone might be excused for calling that a reeducation program,"" the justice then quipped. Olson responded by saying, ""I strongly disagree.""

The exchange came after minutes of interrogation from Gorsuch in which the justice sought to draw out the difference between a freelance writer and a website designer who both refuse to provide services that contradict their sincerely held religious beliefs.



The writer, Olson explained, would have his religious beliefs protected, but the website designer in this particular case would not. He failed to explain why and even admitted the state can neither change someone's sincerely held religious beliefs nor allegedly make a practice of compelling people to express ideas or speech that violate those beliefs.

How will the court rule?



While the decision is not expected until sometime next year, the court is sympathetic toward the plaintiff, the website developer who sued Colorado because she argues the state's public accommodation law would force her to violate her religious beliefs if she designed wedding websites.

In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in favor of Phillips.

The court, however, did not rule on the broader questions related to public accommodation laws, answers the present case will likely provide.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gorsuch-olson-jack-phillips-reducation,2022-12-06
Gov. Abbott appoints 'border czar' who intends to make Texas 'least desirable place for illegal immigration',"On Monday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R) appointed a recently retired Border Patrol agent as the state's new ""border czar,"" the Texas Tribune reported.



Michael Banks, who retired from Border Patrol this month after more than 20 years on the job, was appointed by Abbott to ""tap his expertise to deploy strategies that reduce illegal immigration and keep our community safe.""

According to Banks, his top priority ""is to make the state of Texas the least desirable place for illegal immigration to cross. I don't think it's going to be that difficult. ... We just need to be more aggressive.""

During his Monday announcement, Abbott explained that he created the new border czar position because the immigration crisis ""requires a leader whose only focus is responding"" to the Biden administration's failing policies.

The Texas governor accused the president's administration of being ""missing in action on the border."" He noted that ""combating illegal immigration in Texas is a full-time job.""

""For nearly two years, the State of Texas has taken unprecedented, historic action under Operation Lone Star in response to the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border,"" Abbott stated. ""To continue doing what no other state in the history of our country has done to secure the border, I hired Mike Banks as the State of Texas' first-ever Border Czar.""

Abbott explained that Banks ""is the perfect choice to oversee Texas' fight against the surge of illegal immigration, lethal drugs, and deadly weapons flowing into our state and nation.""

Banks, who will report directly to Abbott, will partner with the Texas National Guard, state troopers, and the Texas Facilities Commission to secure agreements with landowners to close gaps in the U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Abbott stated that Texas is paying $25 million per mile to finish constructing the wall.

El Paso remains the busiest border crossing in the country. According to Customs and Border Protection reporting, within the first three months of fiscal year 2023, 162,603 migrants were encountered at the El Paso border, a 232% increase from the same period the previous year.

In total, there were more than 717,000 migrant encounters at the southern border from October through December 2022. Of those encounters, nearly 480,000 were single adults, 200,000 were family units, and 37,000 were single minors.

"Texas Governor Greg Abbott increases reward amount up to $5,000 for reporting criminal stash houses","In a Wednesday press release, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and his office announced an increase in the reward amount for reporting information that leads to the identification of criminal stash houses.



The Public Safety Office and the Texas Department of Public Safety increased the reward amount to $5,000, the press release stated. The state hopes to crack down on stash houses that facilitate drug and human trafficking and illegal border crossings.

""As President Biden's dangerous open border policies continue to allow cartels and other criminal organizations to operate freely in our communities, it is more important than ever that Texans step up and report suspicious activity,"" said Governor Abbott.

The Texas governor launched Operation Lone Star in March 2021. The operation integrated the Texas Department of Public Safety with the Texas National Guard to monitor smugglers and cartels attempting to sneak drugs and people into the state. The mission deployed air, ground, marine, and tactical border security efforts to fill gaps the federal government left open.

A couple of weeks after announcing the launch of Operation Lone Star, Abbott expanded it to include anti-human trafficking efforts.

Abbott's office reported that since Operation Lone State launched, officers have identified 170 stash houses that led to the discovery of over 1,900 illegal immigrants.

The operation has resulted in nearly 300,000 migrant apprehensions and more than 18,700 criminal arrests, the governor's office reported in August.

The first tipster to take advantage of the new $5,000 reward resulted in the seizure of 19 kilograms of methamphetamine, 20 pounds of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, LSD, other illegal drugs, four weapons, and $6,000 in gold and silver.

Abbott stated, ""DPS and local law enforcement partners are working around the clock to prevent transnational crimes from being committed in communities around the state. These stash houses contain people or drugs that may have otherwise made their way across Texas and the nation because of the dangerous gaps left by the Biden administration's refusal to secure the border. With the help of Texans across the state, we can bring criminals to justice, destroy their illegal enterprises, and keep our communities safe.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/gov-abbott-increases-reward-tipsters,2022-09-01
"Gov declares state of emergency after rioters set police cars ablaze, shattered storefront windows in Atlanta","Following a destructive riot and arson over the weekend in Atlanta, Georgia, Governor Brian Kemp (R) declared a state of emergency on Thursday, according to an executive order.

The order was issued ""due to unlawful assemblage, overt threats of violence, disruption of the peace, and danger existing to persons and property.""

On Saturday, a small group of protesters lit fireworks and threw rocks at the Atlanta Police Foundation and local businesses. The masked perpetrators chanted ""no justice, no peace, no killer police"" before setting two police cruisers on fire and hurling bricks at the officers.

Rioters organized the protest to oppose the fatal police shooting of 26-year-old Manuel Esteban Paez Teran. On January 18, Teran was protesting in southeast Atlanta. After allegedly refusing to comply with law enforcement and shooting at a Georgia State Patrol trooper, officers returned fire. Teran was struck and killed.

Authorities reported that no officers, protestors, or bystanders were hurt during the Saturday riot. Law enforcement confiscated explosive devices and arrested at least six individuals in connection with the demonstration.

Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens described the protesters as ""outsiders who have come here for their own political aims.""

""They want to scare and disrupt. But Atlanta is stronger than them,"" Dickens stated. ""But we do not tolerate violence or property destruction.""

In response to the rioters' actions, Kemp stated, ""While the state continues to respect peaceful protest, acts of violence against person or property will NOT be tolerated. Those committing such unlawful acts will be arrested and prosecuted fully.""

According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Kemp's aides stated that the emergency order was also issued as a precautionary measure as the city braces for more potential riots following recent grand jury indictments charging five former Memphis officers with second-degree murder in the death of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols earlier this month.

Memphis police plan to release bodycam footage of the incident Friday evening.

Kemp's executive order grants him the authority to deploy up to 1,000 Georgia National Guard troops until February 19, who would respond to manage ""unlawful assemblage, overt threats of violence, disruption of the peace, and danger existing to persons and property.""

""We understand the executive order is purely precautionary based on possible unrest following the release of the videos from Memphis,"" an official told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""There are no immediate intentions to deploy the Guard.""

'Serving strongly as freedom's linchpin': Gov. DeSantis wants to permanently ban coercive COVID restrictions in Florida,"Florida, under the leadership of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, was among the first states in America to put pandemic protocols in the rearview mirror. The governor, whose past actions were commended via an overwhelming reelection victory, announced legislation this week that would keep the state from driving backward.

DeSantis noted on Tuesday that he seeks to permanently ban coercive COVID-era health protocols in the state.

""When the world lost its mind, Florida was a refuge of sanity, serving strongly as freedom's linchpin,"" DeSantis said in a statement. ""These measures will ensure Florida remains this way and will provide landmark protections for free speech for medical practitioners.""

Characterized as a ""strong pro-freedom, anti-mandate action,"" the so-called ""Prescribe Freedom"" action would ""permanently protect Floridians from losing their jobs due to COVID-19 vaccine mandates, protects parents' rights, and institutes additional protections that prevent discrimination based on COVID-19 vaccine status.""

Additionally, the action would again prohibit schools from imposing vaccine and mask requirements and preclude employers from hiring on the basis of mRNA vaccinations.

In November 2021, DeSantis ratified similar legislation prohibiting private employer, school, and state government vaccine mandates, as well as the quarantine of healthy students.

Some of these previous anti-mandate provisions are set to expire in June, hence the perceived need for more lasting measures.

Extra to maintaining these bans on coercive policies, the new legislation would protect medical professionals' freedom of speech; protect the ""right to disagree with the preferred narrative of the medical community""; and protect the religious views of medical professionals.

Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo noted that he has ""personally witnessed accomplished scientists receive threats due to their unorthodox positions.

Ladapo added that ""many of these positions have proven to be correct, as we’ve all seen over the past few years. All medical professionals should be encouraged to engage in scientific discourse without fearing for their livelihoods or their careers.""

The Miami Herald reported that as part of this ""pro-freedom"" push, DeSantis plans to revive two measures that fizzled out in 2022, namely Senate Bill 1184 and House Bill 687. Accordingly, doctors cannot be sanctioned by regulatory boards for medical views unless their speech can be proven to have ""led to the direct physical harm"" of one of their recent patients.

Despite having secured the support of nearly 60% of voters, there are holdouts in the medical establishment and business community and those who would prefer to keep COVID emergency measures on hand despite President Joe Biden's unequivocal declaration last year that the pandemic was over.



The Herald noted that hundreds of big companies — including Disney, Starbucks, Walmart, Delta, and Live Nation — adopted vaccine mandates, firing those who refused to surrender their bodily autonomy.

Florida Democrats appear similarly aggrieved over this loss of coercive power.



State Rep. Fentrice Driskell (D) called DeSantis and his administration ""the No. 1 peddler of misinformation from the anti-vax establishment.""

She added the governor's pro-freedom stance ""is a fake ideology with real consequences.""

DeSantis said on Tuesday, ""The Free State of Florida did not happen by accident. ... It required us over these last few years to stand against major institutions in our society — the bureaucracy, the medical establishment, legacy media and even the president of the United States — who together were working to impose a bio medical security state on society.""

Gov. Greg Abbott declares an 'invasion' at the southern border,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) declared an ""invasion"" at the southern border on Tuesday and indicated that he would be taking a series of ""unprecedented measures ... to keep our state & country safe.""

What are the details?

On Monday, Abbott wrote a letter to county judges along the Texas-Mexico border, claiming, ""President Biden has abandoned his responsibility to enforce immigration laws, and Congress has refused to hold the President accountable and has abandoned its own responsibility to use the immigration power given to it in Article I, § 8 of the U.S. Constitution.""

The Republican governor invoked Article 4, Section 7 of the Texas Constitution, which states that the governor ""shall have power to call forth the militia to execute the laws of the State, to suppress insurrections, and to repel invasions.""

Accordingly, Abbott stated that he would use his constitutional authority, as well as other authorization and executive orders, to:

""Deploy the National Guard to safeguard our border & to repel & turn back immigrants trying to cross the border illegally"";

""Deploy the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) to arrest & return the border immigrants who crossed illegally & deploy DPS to arrest illegal immigrants for criminal activity"";

""Build a border wall in multiple counties on the border"";

""Deploy gun boats to secure the border"";

""Designate Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations"";

""Enter into a compact with other states to secure the border"";

""Enter into agreements with foreign powers to enhance border security""; and

""Provide resources for border counties to increase their efforts to respond to the border invasion.""

On Tuesday, Abbott announced via social media that he had ""invoked the Invasion Clauses of the U.S. & Texas Constitutions to fully authorize Texas to take unprecedented measures to defend our state against an invasion.""

This announcement came just hours after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told the House Committee on Homeland Security that the border was secure.

Fox News reported that FBI Director Christopher Wray painted a different picture of the situation at the border than had Mayorkas, saying on Tuesday: ""What I would say is that we see significant criminal threats coming from south of the border — whether it's guns, drugs, money, violence.""

Hopkins County declared first

Abbott's public, statewide declaration of an invasion was both preceded and implored by citizens of Hopkins County, Texas.

KETK reported that the Hopkins County commissioners court approved the declaration of a local state of disaster in the county on Monday.

The declaration stated that the ""health, safety and welfare of Hopkins County residents are under an imminent threat of disaster from the unprecedented levels of illegal immigration, human trafficking and drug smuggling coming across the U.S. border from Mexico.""

The Hopkins County declaration said the ""ongoing immigration crisis on the Texas border is not acceptable and has resulted in a security threat and humanitarian disaster with overwhelming consequences to the residents of Hopkins County.""

Over 2.76 million illegal aliens stole over the southern border into the United States during fiscal year 2022.

So far this year, there have been 1,142 criminal noncitizens convicted of assault; 1,614 convicted of driving under the influence; 62 convicted of homicide; 365 convicted of sexual offenses; and thousands more convicted of other crimes.

The Hopkins County declaration requested that Abbott, ""as Commander-in-Chief of the military forces of the State, declare the existence of an invasion on its border with Mexico and take necessary actions to preserve and protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Texas.""

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker says he does not think America's founders 'would've said that you have a Constitutional right to an assault weapon with a high-capacity magazine',"In the wake of a deadly mass shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, on Monday, Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, said that he does not believe America's Founding Fathers would have said that citizens have a Constitutional right to own an assault weapon.

""A day dedicated to freedom has put into stark relief the one freedom we as a nation refuse to uphold: The freedom of our fellow citizens to live without the daily fear of gun violence,"" Pritzker said.

""Our founders carried muskets, not assault weapons. And I don't think a single one of them would've said that you have a Constitutional right to an assault weapon with a high-capacity magazine, or that that is more important than the right of the people who attended this parade today to live,"" he declared.

Full press conference: Pritzker, Duckworth speak following Highland Park parade shooting youtu.be

So far, seven of the shooting victims have died. Many others were injured during the heinous attack. A 21-year-old man has been charged with seven counts of first-degree murder.

While Americans on both sides of the political aisle want to address the problem of mass shootings in the U.S., leftists continue to push gun control as a way to tackle the issue, while conservatives contend that gun control measures would infringe on the constitutionally guaranteed right to keep and bear arms.

The text of the Second Amendment reads, ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California has tweeted, ""We cannot stop working until we ban and buy-back assault weapons, require background checks, and have red flag laws.""

Swalwell has claimed that GOP lawmakers ""keep voting against our kids and voting for their killers.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/governor-pritzker-founders-assault-weapons,2022-07-06
"Goya Foods CEO Bob Unanue defends value of work, says 'evil' is to blame for inflationary policies","Goya Foods CEO Bob Unanue blamed ""evil"" for the high prices facing Americans in this inflationary economy, calling out the Biden administration for pursuing policies he said intentionally disincentivize work.

Unanue was interviewed on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Thursday when he said that the government is fueling inflation with policies that discourage able people from reentering the workforce.

""At the core of inflation, and it's out of control, especially in food, is evil. Our desire to control us,"" he told host Tucker Carlson. ""When I was a child, my parents said, never take candy from a stranger. And they're giving out candy, incentivizing people not to work. They're taking away our purpose, our spirit, our reason to get up every day. And they're doing it without their own candy. They're taking our candy, and using it to incentivize us not to, that's very inflationary.""

Data from August showed that inflation grew 8.3% year over year as the economy exited the COVID-19 pandemic. The White House celebrated that the 8.3% number was lower than the 8.5% inflation reported in July, but for Americans struggling to buy groceries, the top-line inflation numbers make little difference.

Food prices have soared to record-breaking levels, with grocery costs expected to rise an average of 11% by the end of the year. That would be the largest year-on-year increase since 1974, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Labor Department data shows that since last year, Americans are paying substantially more for staples like eggs (38%), chicken (16.6%), milk (15.6%), potatoes (13.3%), rice (12.7%) and fresh fruits and vegetables (8.2%), Fox News reported.

On top of rising prices, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says there is a labor shortage caused by hiring rates being outpaced by the number of people quitting their jobs since November 2020. Durable goods manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and education and health services industries are each facing worker shortages.

Though both the Trump and Biden administrations spent billions of dollars on COVID-19 relief payments to people who lost their jobs or refused to work during the pandemic, Unanue described how Goya Foods ""never stopped working"" and defended the value of work.

""Work is essential. It gives us our reason,"" he said.

He went on to praise the new presumptive prime minister of Italy, Giorgia Meloni, who in 2019 gave a speech decrying how global ""financial speculators"" have sought to undermine national and religious identity to make people ""the perfect consumer.""



""You know, God -- I love this gal Meloni from Italy, you know she has this 'fascist' speak, God, family, country. You know, you need to have a purpose. She says we all have our genetic code. Each one of us is made in the likeness of God with our own identity. So we all have a purpose,"" Unanue said. ""Now, you take that purpose away by the very few who want to own us, enslave us, control us, for their own greed and power.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/goya-foods-ceo-inflation-groceries,2022-09-30
Far-left Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer calls women 'menstruating people' — and her Republican challengers go off: 'Has the left gone insane?',"Far-left Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer used the term ""menstruating people"" in a recent state Democratic Party online event, and her Republican challengers had a field day over the controversial Democrat's refusal to say the word ""women.""

What are the details?

Whitmer said ""menstruating people"" after being asked about a proposed amendment to the Michigan state constitution protecting abortion access should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade — and what the governor could do if that proposed amendment fails, Fox News said.

“Number one: I have the constitutional ability to bring a lawsuit to protect constitutional rights of people of Michigan,” she told a Zoom event hosted by the state Democratic Party. “So I brought a lawsuit on behalf of all the menstruating people in Michigan — 2.2 million. And another tool I have is to go straight to our state Supreme Court.”

A group called Reproductive Freedom for All is leading the push for the Michigan constitutional amendment, and Fox News said it will only appear on the ballot if the board of state canvassers obtains and certifies by July 11 a minimum number of petition signatures required by state law.

How are Whitmer's GOP challengers reacting?

Whitmer's Republican challengers blasted her reference to ""menstruating people"" and said it's yet another result of the Democratic Party's continuing leftward push.

""Has the left gone insane? I mean really. Menstruating people? Drag queens in every school? This is not normal behavior. Someone needs to check the Democratic Party. It's starting to seem like COVID was more like mad cow disease,"" businesswoman Tudor Dixon told Fox News Digital, adding a reference to Democratic Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's recent statement that there should be a ""drag queen for every school.""

Pastor Ralph Rebandt told Fox News Digital that ""our Declaration of Independence addresses ‘the Laws of Nature and Nature’s God.’ Gov. Whitmer’s use of politically correct LGBTQ+ language is evidence of a moral collapse in our society.""

Rebandt added to the outlet that ""a culture that rejects ‘Nature’s God,’ as we did 60 years ago, will eventually reject the ‘Laws of Nature.’ When that happens, God help us, because there’s no line that can’t be crossed.""

A spokesperson for businessman Kevin Rinke told Fox News Digital that Whitmer ""and her entire administration have shown they are on the extreme, fringe left when it comes to every issue. Between the AG calling for a drag queen in every classroom to the governor making up her own anatomy course, this administration has lost sight of the fact that Michiganders are suffering under their failed leadership.""

Fox News said the campaigns of chiropractor Garrett Soldano and real estate broker Ryan Kelley didn't respond to the cable network's request for comment.

The Michigan primaries will be held Aug. 2, Fox News added.

Jury finds Steve Bannon guilty on contempt of Congress charges for defying subpoena from Jan. 6 committee,"A federal jury found Steve Bannon guilty of two charges of contempt of Congress for refusing a subpoena from the committee investigating the Jan. 6 rioting at the U.S. Capitol.

The 68-year-old former Trump advisor lambasted the committee in a statement to the media after the court hearing.

""I only have one disappointment and that is the gutless members of that show trial committee, the J6 Committee didn't have the guts to come down here and testify in open court,"" said Bannon, who also thanked the jury and the judge.

Bannon had vowed to fight the ""misdemeanor from hell"" and ""go medieval on these people"" ahead of the contempt trial. Instead, his lawyers called no witnesses and opted to present no defense in the case.

“We didn’t feel the need to put on a defense,” said attorney Evan Corcoran to the jury.

The jury deliberated for only about three hours.

Each charge of contempt of Congress carries a sentence of between 30 days and one year in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced on October 21.

Bannon had argued that he was protected from testifying under the executive privilege invoked by former President Donald Trump about his role in the Jan. 6 rioting.

His lawyers vowed to appeal the ruling and complained that the judge didn't allow certain arguments to be made on behalf of their client.

“This is a bulletproof appeal,” said attorney David Schoen. “The overreaching by the government in this case has been extraordinary at every level.”

U.S. Attorney for D.C. Matthew Graves praised the jury for the ruling.

“The subpoena to Stephen Bannon was not an invitation that could be rejected or ignored,” Graves said. “Mr. Bannon had an obligation to appear before the House Select Committee to give testimony and provide documents. His refusal to do so was deliberate and now a jury has found that he must pay the consequences.”

Good guy with a gun takes lethal action after man pulls weapon from car and threatens to 'shoot up the crowd' at family gathering,"A good guy with a gun took lethal action when a man pulled a weapon from a car and threatened to ""shoot up the crowd"" at a family gathering in Florida over the weekend.

What are the details?

A fight broke out between two women at a family gathering on Division Avenue and 4th Street in West Palm Beach on Sunday night, and the fight turned into a brawl involving around 20 people, detectives told WPEC-TV.

Police were dispatched to the scene after reports of gunshots at 10:42 p.m., the station said.

The 911 caller said someone had been shot, WPEC said, and the caller also said the person who was shot took a short-barreled shotgun out of a car and threatened to ""shoot up the crowd.""

The police department said the 22-year-old who made the threat refused to drop his weapon after multiple people confronted him, and the station said that's when a 32-year-old man fired his gun and hit the man who made the threat.

The man who shot the 22-year-old had a concealed weapon license and remained on the scene with police and cooperated with the investigation, WPEC said.

Detectives told the station the armed man who made the threat was pronounced dead at the scene, and they are treating the case as an isolated incident and aren't seeking other suspects. WPEC added that no charges are pending.

The station added that the deceased man was from West Palm Beach, and his name has not been released. The Palm Beach County medical examiner will determine the cause of death, WPEC said.

George Washington University shoots down demands from students to drop Clarence Thomas over Dobbs opinion,"George Washington University rejected demands from some students that they fire Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas over his opinion in the Dobbs decision, which overruled Roe v. Wade.

The university released a statement about the student demands on Tuesday.

""Since the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade, we have heard from members of our community who have expressed feelings of deep disagreement with this decision,"" read the statement.

The statement went on to address demands from students that Thomas be terminated as an adjunct professor.

""Justice Thomas has been a consistent critic of the Court's legal philosophy on substantive due process for many years,"" the statement continued. ""Because we steadfastly support the robust exchange of ideas and deliberation, and because debate is an essential part of our university's academic and educational mission to train future leaders who are prepared to address the world's most urgently problems, the university will neither terminate Justice Thomas' employment nor cancel his class in response to his legal opinions.""

The statement went on to give students a lesson about free speech.

""[I]t is not the proper role of the University attempt to shield individuals within or outside the University from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive,"" the statement concluded.

Protests erupted across the nation when conservatives on the court overturned the landmark decision from 1973 that established federal protection of abortion rights. Many on the left have called on President Joe Biden to take drastic steps to re-establish abortion rights, including packing the court with liberal justices and even outright ""dissolving"" the court.

Democrats are likely to lose control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the midterm elections, while Biden continues to suffer historically low approval ratings.

Dem lawmaker floats conspiracy theory that classified docs were 'planted' to damage Biden: 'I'm suspicious',"Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson (Ga.) floated a wild conspiracy theory on Thursday, suggesting the classified documents that President Joe Biden improperly retained were planted.

Johnson told Fox News reporter Hillary Vaughn that he is ""suspicious"" of the timing of the discoveries, and thus he is not ""ruling out"" the possibility that the documents were ""planted"" to damage Biden.

""My response to it all is that alleged classified documents showing up allegedly in the possession of Joseph Biden, you know, I mean, there's so much that needs to be investigated,"" he said. ""And that's, that's what I called for, is for everything to be investigated, but I'm suspicious of the timing of it.""



""I'm also aware of the fact that things can be planted on people — places and things can be planted — things can be planted in places and then discovered conveniently, that may be what has occurred here,"" Johnson claimed. ""I'm not ruling that out.""

However, Biden himself appeared to discredit Johnson's suggestion when he admitted the classified materials discovered at his private home in Wilmington, Delaware, were kept inside his locked garage next to his prized Corvette.

The problem, of course, is the government has released only vague details about the discoveries.

Whereas the affidavit used to raid Mar-a-Lago was publicized, the White House is refusing to answer basic questions. For example, the White House is not saying why officials refused to tell the public about the classified documents until two months after the midterm elections. The White House, moreover, only admitted to the second batch of documents after NBC News reported on their existence.

Additionally, Biden says he was ""surprised"" by the discovery of classified documents in his private office and residence and claims he does not know what classified material the documents contained.

The president's claims lead to even bigger questions. Who, having access to highly classified information, could have put the documents in Biden's office and residence without him knowing about them?

Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed former U.S. Attorney Robert Hur to investigate the discoveries.

Harry Styles being accused of 'queerbaiting' means gender ambiguity is no longer enough for the LGBT movement. People must pick sides and be 'loud and proud.',"In a strange departure from the left's typical support for gender ambiguity, flamboyant pop star Harry Styles is reportedly under fire from some progressive critics for refusing to say publicly whether or not he is bisexual.

The backlash apparently stems from a recent interview he conducted with Better Homes & Garden, published on Tuesday, in which the former boy band singer turned solo act offered a controversially dodgy answer on the subject.

Citing his desire for personal privacy, Styles rebutted the media's frequent attempts to find clarity regarding his sexual orientation, calling the concept ""outdated,"" anyways.

""I've been really open with it with my friends, but that's my personal experience; it's mine,"" he told the magazine. ""The whole point of where we should be heading, which is toward accepting everybody and being more open, is that it doesn't matter, and it's about not having to label everything, not having to clarify what boxes you're checking.""

Some evidently found his reasons for not disclosing who he's slept with to be fair enough. But according to EuroNews, others were left dissatisfied.

The outlet reported that some critics on social media ""critiqued his privilege as an ostensibly straight man to be able to remove himself from discussions while still embracing a queer aesthetic.""

The concept is reportedly known as ""queerbaiting,"" and it loosely describes a scenario in which someone adopts the aesthetics of queer culture without committing to identifying with LGBT culture at large.

""To critics, queerbaiting allows people a free ride on the aesthetic without the personal difficulties associated with openly identifying as queer in a heteronormative world,"" EuroNews reported.

In Styles' case, queer critics charge that he is benefitting from LGBTQ+ support without publicly coming out as bisexual.

One might think that Styles' increasingly outward embrace of the LGBTQ+ movement would be celebrated by those in the camp.

But it seems the pop star's Pride flag-waving and extravagant dress-wearing are not enough in the new transgender-crazed world. He needs to reject the heteronormative lifestyle in full or go back to being a normal masculine male.

""Translation: I’m a straight man that wants to keep my queerbait marketing strategy,"" one critic charged.

They added: ""If he is actually queer it would be more important for him to voice that than keep it ambiguous. People in our community (especially black people) are constantly at risk for showing who they are and doing it flamboyantly, and that’s the reason we’re at the place we are now.""

""Ding ding ding!!!"" one person replied in approval of the message.

Another critic wrote: ""That would be nice if that was the case, but queerness is under attack constantly. Especially in some states where u can't even say gay. We can't all live in 2050 where ambiguous sexuality is the norm. We are living in 2022 and we need allies who will be loud and stand with us.""

""No hate but it seems more like a marketing strategy than anything else, he is benefiting from the sexual ambiguity around him, if he comes out as gay or bi....he'll be less relevant cuz there is nothing new about a queer person wearing a dress or painting his nails,"" added another.

Still another commenter voiced a similar rebuke, saying, ""I respect that he wants to preserve his own experiences, but then, he shouldn't sell it like it doesn't matter, especially when people die in the middle of these speeches, I believe we need and must talk it out loud and proud, today more than ever.""

And the list went on. It's a strange new world.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/harry-styles-accused-of-queerbaiting,2022-04-28
Hawaii man refuses to surrender FCK BLM license plate,"A man from Hawaii refuses to surrender his vanity license plate that reads: ""FCK BLM."" The man has defied the city government's orders to stop driving around the vehicle with the anti-Black Lives Matter gesture.

Last August, KITV reporter Tom George highlighted a ""FCK BLM"" vanity license plate after a viewer brought it to his attention. The reporter found that the license plate with the abbreviation for ""f*** Black Lives Matter"" was an actual license plate after searching the Honolulu database.

George shared the license plate in a Twitter post that asked, ""Racism on the road?""

The license plate appears to have been spotted on a red Pontiac Trans Am. The driver also had a sign that read: ""Trump 2024 Because F*** You.""

George contacted the Honolulu government about the ""FCK BLM"" license plate, which admitted that it was an ""ill-advised oversight during the review process.""

Personalized license plates with the abbreviations ""FCK"" and ""FKN"" are prohibited.

The license plate was recalled and the owner was ordered to surrender it.

However, the driver is still allegedly driving with the same personalized license plate nearly a year later despite warnings from the city.

Viewers of the TV station claimed that they had seen the car driving around Oahu despite the driver's registration and inspection sticker reportedly being expired.

The Department of Customer Services (CDS) ordered the driver to forfeit the anti-BLM license plate.

The CDS said it sent three notices to the man to surrender the ""FCK BLM"" license plate, but the motorist has refused to do so.

""CSD has placed a hold on further renewals of his vehicle registration and his registration is now expired,"" the CDS told KITV. ""HPD [Honolulu Police Department] is able to cite the vehicle if it is being operated on the roads.""

"'Hello. Good night, everybody': Fetterman delivers incoherent debate performance highlighting health concerns and sending betting odds on Dr. Oz skyrocketing","John Fetterman, the Democratic candidate for a U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania, met with Republican Dr. Mehmet Oz on Tuesday night to debate the issues. Among the issues tackled, including abortion, immigration, and crime, the greatest issue Fetterman faced was assembling coherent sentences.

While the impact of Fetterman's disastrous performance in the debate will not be fully realized until November 8, one online prediction market has indicated it may be game over.

The debate



Fetterman began Tuesday's debate in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, with an awkward salutation: ""Hi. Good night, everybody.""



After branding Oz a liar in his opening statement, Fetterman suggested that his opponent wouldn't let him forget that he had a stroke in May, for which he required a pacemaker implant along with a defibrillator.

The Democrat noted that he ""might miss some words during this debate, mush two words together, but it knocked me down, and I am going to keep coming back up.""

While Fetterman made sure to address ""the elephant in the room,"" it still managed to trample the Democrat throughout the remainder of the debate.

On a number of occasions, Fetterman either contradicted himself or struggled to find a point.

One of his more challenging moments was when the moderator asked about his shifting stance on fracking.

The New York Post reported that Pennsylvania could lose up to 600,000 jobs if fracking is banned and take a GDP hit of nearly $261 billion. In 2016, Fetterman reportedly supported a moratorium on fracking, stating, ""There's no such thing as a green fracker."" Newsweek indicated he had also referred to fracking as a ""stain.""

Given his historic antipathy for fracking, the debate moderator pressed Fetterman on his apparent Tuesday-night pivot on the issue, saying, ""You're saying tonight that you support fracking, that you've always supported fracking, but there is that 2018 interview that you said, quote, 'I don't support fracking at all,' so how do you square the two?""

Fetterman answered, ""I do support fracking. And I don't, I don't. I support fracking, and I stand and I do support fracking.""

When asked about whether the Biden administration has spent too much money, Fetterman responded, ""Here's what I think we have to fight about inflation here right now. That's we need to fight about: inflation right now."" He then proceeded to attack Oz for owning multiple homes and having merchandise allegedly manufactured in China.



The moderator asked Fetterman why he has refused to release his stroke-related medical records. The Democrat answered, ""My doctors believe I am ready to be served.""

'The elephant in the room'



USA Today reported that Fetterman's campaign advisers had attempted to lower expectations on Monday, claiming, ""This isn't John's format."" After the debate, some are left wondering whether the U.S. Senate is Fetterman's format.

""Why the hell did Fetterman agree to this?"" asked one Democrat lawmaker and Fetterman supporter, who told Axios, ""This will obviously raise more questions than answers about John's health.""

Republican Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) reportedly told CNN, ""It's sad to see John Fetterman struggling so much. He should take more time to allow himself to fully recover.""

Donald Trump Jr. tweeted, ""It's worse than any of us could have ever imagined. At this point the moderator is filibustering to make sure he doesn't get any more Qs. ... Even today's partisan hack media can't cover for Fetterman being brain dead!""

Ann Coulter quipped, at President Joe Biden's expense: ""At least give Fetterman this: In 2022, a debate performance like that can accurately be called 'presidential'.""



Glenn Greenwald intimated it is not ""ableist"" to admit that Fetterman might have a considerable problem.

Dire predictions



PredictIt is an online prediction market owned by Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. It enables people to make predictions on political races by buying shares via a continuous double auction.

Share price corresponds to the market’s estimate of the probability of an event taking place. According the site, users should ""Buy ‘Yes’ shares when the price is too low, when you think your fellow traders are underestimating this likelihood. Buy ‘No’ shares when you think they are too optimistic.""

In this instance, the question posed was: ""Which party will win the U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania in 2022?""

On Sept. 28, it was 65 cents to bet ""Yes"" on Fetterman to win and only 37 cents to bet ""Yes"" on Oz.



This prediction market turned on Fetterman in a big way on Tuesday.

Although he had been ascribed higher value until October 18, confidence appears to have tanked on Oct. 25. A ""Yes"" buy for Oz went up from 53 cents to 65 cents. A ""Yes"" buy for Fetterman dropped from 50 cents the previous day to 39 cents.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hello-goodnight-everybody-fetterman-delivers-incoherent-debate-performance-highlighting-health-concerns-and-sending-betting-odds-on-dr-oz-skyrocketing,2022-10-26
Hero dog Eva dies after mountain lion attack,"A hero dog has passed away after protecting her owner from a mountain lion attack in Northern California.

Erin Wilson was hiking in Trinity County last month with her 2 1/2-year-old Belgian Malinois named Eva. The pair encountered a mountain lion during their hike.

The mountain lion lunged at Wilson and scratched her left shoulder.

While in pain from the mountain lion attack, Wilson called for her dog – who was a few feet ahead, off-leash.

""I yelled 'Eva!' and she came running,"" Wilson told the Sacramento Bee on Wednesday. ""And she hit that cat really hard.""

However, the 55-pound dog was overpowered by the big cat.

""They fought for a couple seconds, and then I heard her start crying,"" Wilson explained. ""That’s when the cat latched on to her skull.""

Wilson did everything she could to attempt to stop the cougar from harming her dog – hitting the mountain lion with rocks, sticks, and her fist. She then tried to choke the cougar with her arms and tried to gouge its eyes. The big cat fought back and used its rear paws to kick Wilson away.

The mountain lion refused to let go of the dog, so Wilson ran to her truck to retrieve a tire iron. Wilson also flagged down a passing female motorist – who grabbed a 4-foot-long PVC pipe and pepper spray to help save Eva. The two women beat the cougar and used pepper spray until it finally released the dog and retreated.

Wilson said of Eva, ""At first I was like, ‘Wow, she’s OK.' But when I looked at her closer, I realized she had a couple of puncture wounds in her face. And she just had a lot of blood coming out of her mouth.""

The owner raced her dog to an emergency veterinarian clinic that was an hour-and-a-half drive away.

Wilson’s husband – Connor Kenny – told SFGate that Eva suffered two fractures to her skull, a punctured sinus cavity, severe damage to her left eye, and seizures.



Facing mounting vet bills, Wilson launched a GoFundMe campaign.

""My dog is my hero,"" Wilson wrote on the crowdfunding listing. ""And I owe her my life.""

Wilson posted an update on Tuesday, ""Eva went for CT before MRI, and it has been found that her skull fracture was pretty severe and her brain tissue is inflamed. Her brain is now pushing through the openings in the skull.""

On Thursday, Wilson announced that Eva had died.



""We said goodbye at 9:20 this morning,"" Wilson wrote on Instagram. ""There were no changes to her condition overnight. Goodbye my beautiful sweet girl. You are my world, my light, my best friend. The world is a much darker place.""



The California Department of Fish and Wildlife said it was working on trapping the mountain lion involved in the attack.

The wildlife agency advised, ""People should always be vigilant when recreating in mountain lion habitat.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hero-dog-eva-mountain-lion,2022-06-09
Alleged carjacker threads oncoming traffic at 100 mph ahead of shootout with police,"On August 11, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department dispatched investigators to conduct covert surveillance of 40-year-old Justin Venegas, suspected of having perpetrated a violent carjacking on May 20. Around 7 p.m., officers saw Venegas drive away from his home, at which point, they alerted an Air Patrol unit to maintain surveillance on his vehicle.

According to Clark County Assistant Sheriff Andrew Walsh, at the corner of North Pecos Road and Cheyenne Avenue, Venegas exited his vehicle at a red light and then hijacked a white Chevrolet Avalanche pickup at gunpoint. It was at that moment the mayhem that ultimately involved two officer-involved-shootings, a head-on collision and a 41-mile chase began in earnest.

Police first tried to pull Venegas over, but he refused to stop. When officers then attempted a PIT maneuver, Venegas allegedly fired at them with a 9mm handgun.

Walsh said that Officer Brendan Burbrink fired back at the suspect through their windshield, which can be seen catching at least one bullet from the suspect a moment earlier.

Driving over 100 mph, the suspect was seen weaving through dense traffic and even driving on the wrong side of the road.

Venegas allegedly led police to a parking lot near West Desert Inn Road and South Decatur Boulevard, where he attempted to hijack another vehicle.

Media Briefing: OIS #7 2022 YouTube

The woman driving the vehicle did not, however, comply. She backed away from Venegas, who then fired upon her twice.

Walsh noted that the woman, although injured in the foiled carjacking — either grazed by a bullet or injured by broken glass — is alright.

Venegas was precluded from trying again, as Officers Burbrink, Mojarro, Montero, Montalto, and Sayas reportedly opened fire on the suspect. While the stolen Chevrolet Avalanche was struck multiple times in the shootout, Venegas managed to escape uninjured, but only momentarily.

Walsh claimed that Venegas then intentionally rammed a police K-9 vehicle at 67 mph. (This collision occurs at 14:05 in the footage provided by the LVMPD.)

Boris, the K-9, was reportedly uninjured in the crash, and the unnamed driver of the K-9 vehicle was released from the University Medical Center hospital after being treated for minor injuries.



After the collision, which ended the chase, Venegas was treated at a local hospital for minor injuries and then remanded to police custody on August 12.



Venegas has been charged with attempted murder, six counts of attempted robbery, robbery, battery, and discharging a gun into an occupied vehicle. The Las Vegas Sun reported that he also faces charges related to the May 20 incident, where he allegedly carjacked a 73-year-old woman, including assault with a deadly weapon with a victim over 60 and grand larceny. He will appear in Las Vegas Justice Court on August 23.



Walsh suggested that ""the community was very lucky in this incident,"" granted that no bystanders were struck by stray bullets. He also lauded police for their bravery. They ""suit up every day and this is what they deal with.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/high-speed-chase-ends-in-shootout-and-collision,2022-08-19
"Hillary Clinton pivots from denying past elections to rejecting future results, claiming Republicans plan to 'steal the next presidential election'","Failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has preemptively accused Republicans of stealing the 2024 presidential election. By once again sowing doubt about the legitimacy of American democracy, Clinton hopes to raise money and help Democrats take over strategic state legislatures.

Preemptive election denial

For years, Democrats have expressed concerns about how ""planting seeds of doubt"" undermines democracy. In fact, Democrats continue to denounce some Republicans as ""election deniers"" for questioning the legitimacy of the 2020 election, which Clinton had told then-candidate Joe Biden not to concede ""under any circumstances.""

Notwithstanding the left's apparent sensitivity to so-called election denial, Clinton — who has repeatedly suggested the 2016 election was ""stolen"" from her despite having lost to former President Donald Trump by 77 electoral votes (304-227) — alleged last week that a ""coup"" was imminent.

In a video posted to Twitter on Oct. 21 by the radical leftist organization Indivisible, Clinton claimed that ""right-wing extremists already have a plan to literally steal the next presidential election. And they're not making a secret of it.""

In her fundraising video for Indivisible, an activist group started by former Democrat staffers, Clinton said the ""steal"" would be achieved by Republican-led state legislatures.

Clinton explained how the alleged steal would be achieved: ""The right-wing-controlled Supreme Court may be poised to rule on giving state legislatures, yes, you heard me that correctly, state legislatures the power to overturn presidential elections,""

""Just think: If that happens, the 2024 presidential election could be decided, not by the popular vote or even by the anachronistic Electoral College, but by state legislatures, many of them Republican-controlled,"" she added.



After calling into question the legitimacy of American elections, Clinton revealed the true purpose of her wild claims: ""Indivisible has launched Crush the Coup to make sure we're ready to defend democracy in 2024. They have put together a list of critical races in six key states and how you can get involved."" Clinton then suggested viewers donate.

Moore v. Harper

Indivisible's Crush the Coup identified ""the 29 most critical races in 6 states that we need to win to defeat the MAGA coup."" The six battleground states are allegedly Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

CTC named a number of Democrats the group wants bankrolled and elected to power this November. Extra to providing the Democrats with leverage over strategic legislatures, CTC intends for these candidates to mitigate what it perceives would be the fallout of Moore v. Harper, an election redistricting case that will be heard this fall by the Supreme Court.

The case concerns whether ""a State's judicial branch may nullify the regulations governing the 'Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives ... prescribed ... by the Legislature thereof,' ... and replace them with regulations of the state courts' own devising.""

CTC has restated the claim made by others on the left that by adopting ""an extremist and fringe legal doctrine,"" the court will give states the power to overturn elections.

""The nightmare scenario,"" according to CTC, ""is that a legislature, displeased with how an election official on the ground has interpreted her state's election laws, would invoke the [independent state legislature doctrine] as a pretext to refuse to certify the results of a presidential election and instead select its own slate of electors.""

Carrie Campbell Severino, head of the Judicial Crisis Network, recently indicated in National Review that the ""alarmism around Moore v. Harper comes from liberals who cherry-pick their grievances in states whose constituents favor Republicans and selectively use liberal activist state courts to give Democrats advantages they cannot democratically.""

Whereas Clinton and CTC allege they are fighting to protect democracy, they are, according to Severino, hoping to help Democrats keep undermining it.

""Their rhetoric about democracy is part of a con job, and the Left's disinformation campaign serves as a subterfuge to distract from the reality that their true grievance is not on behalf of the people,"" wrote Severino. ""It is that their strategy of jerry-rigging otherwise lost elections through renegade courts might soon come to an end.""

Clinton v. the democratic will of the people

Like Georgia's gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams (D), Clinton routinely warns of threats to democracy.

In June, Clinton said that ""Donald Trump, his allies, and supporters are a clear and present danger to American democracy."" She also tweeted, ""The people involved in the criminal conspiracy to overturn the will of America's voters ... must be held accountable.""

Despite speaking highly of democracy and the need to defend it, Clinton has repeatedly rejected the results of democratically decided elections.

In 2019, Clinton called Trump an ""illegitimate president"" and suggested ""he knows"" he stole the 2016 election.

Hillary Clinton: ""Trump knows he's an illegitimate president"" youtu.be

In 2020, Clinton said on the Atlantic's ""The Ticket"" podcast that ""There was a widespread understanding that this election [in 2016] was not on the level. ... We still don't know what really happened.""

Clinton has not only contested the results of the 2016 election. She claimed that Stacey Abrams would have beaten Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2018 ""if she'd had a fair election.""

In 2002, Clinton publicly claimed former President George W. Bush had been ""selected"" president, not elected.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hillary-clinton-claims-republicans-plan-steal-election,2022-10-25
Virginia Tech Hokies soccer player lawsuit for kneeling,"A judge ruled that a former Virginia Tech women's soccer player can go forward with her lawsuit against her ex-coach for allegedly punishing her after she refused to kneel during a social justice protest.

Kiersten Hening was a starting defender and midfielder for the Hokies from 2018 to 2020. As a freshman, Hening appeared in all 22 games and started in 19 of them. As a sophomore, she appeared in all 19 matches, was a starter in the last 18 contests, and had the second-most minutes played among field players, according to the Hokies women's soccer website.

However, Hening claims that the relationship with her coach changed after she refused to participate in a social justice demonstration. Hening refused to kneel before the team's season-opening game against the Virginia Cavaliers on Sept. 12, 2020.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported, ""While her teammates knelt during the pregame reading of the Atlantic Coast Conference's unity pledge — a show of support for the social justice movement and Black Lives Matter — Hening and one other unidentified player remained standing.""

Hening accused Hokies head coach Charles ""Chugger"" Adair of launching a ""campaign of abuse and retaliation"" after she refused to participate in the pregame social justice demonstration.

The lawsuit – which was filed in the Roanoke Division of the United States District Court's Western District of Virginia on March 3, 2021 – alleges Adair ""benched her, subjected her to repeated verbal abuse, and forced her off the team.""

The lawsuit claims, ""He singled her out and verbally attacked her, pointing a finger directly in her face. He denounced Hening for 'bitching and moaning,' for being selfish and individualistic, and for 'doing her own thing.'""

The lawsuit alleges that Adair's actions violated Hening's First Amendment rights.

Federal Judge Thomas Cullen ruled on Dec. 2 that the case can proceed to trial, according to Fox News. Cullen noted that Adair slashed her playing time.

""As a freshman, Hening averaged 76 minutes of playing time; as a sophomore, nearly 88,"" Cullen wrote in the ruling. ""But during the Clemson game [the next game after the kneeling incident], Hening only played 29 minutes, and, at the UNC game, just 5.""

""Ultimately, Adair may convince a jury that this coaching decision was based solely on Hening’s poor play during the UVA game, but the court, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hening, cannot reach that conclusion as a matter of law,"" Cullen stated.

Hening resigned from the team after the third game of the season.

Adair claims that two other players refused to kneel and they did not have reduced playing time.

""While the U.S. Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit may not have addressed the novel factual circumstances presented here—i.e., a college coach allegedly retaliating against a player for refusing to kneel with her coaches and teammates in support of perceived unity and social justice—the core constitutional principle is both clearly established and fundamental to a free society, and especially to an institution of higher education,"" Cullen wrote.

The lawsuit stated that Hening ""supports social justice and believes that black lives matter,"" but she ""does not support BLM the organization,"" because of its ""tactics and core tenets of its mission statement, including defunding the police.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hokies-soccer-player-lawsuit-kneeling,2022-12-12
Judge awards Home Depot victory after employee fired for wearing Black Lives Matter messaging,"A government judge ruled on Friday in favor of Home Depot, dismissing a case brought by a former employee who was fired for refusing to remove a Black Lives Matter slogan from his work uniform.

What is the background?

The National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against Home Depot last August after a Minnesota employee was fired for wearing a BLM slogan on his apron.

The NLRB complaint accused Home Depot of having ""discriminated"" against the employee ""for raising issues of racial harassment with coworkers and managers and displaying a Black Lives Matter slogan on his apron,"" conduct the agency says is protected under the National Labor Relations Act.

Home Depot prohibits employees from wearing anything — whether on their Home Depot apron or otherwise — that promotes ""causes or political messages unrelated to workplace matters.""

The NLRB argued that messages related to BLM should not fall under the policy. In fact, the agency claimed the employee was engaging in ""protected concerted activity,"" which the NLRB defines as discussing with co-workers how to improve work conditions and compensation, petitioning for better work hours, and discussing work-related problems with the employer, government, or media.

What happened now?

Administrative law Judge Paul Bogas has dismissed the case.

In his ruling, Bogas explained that ""BLM messaging is not inherently concerted,"" and that BLM rhetoric lacks ""an objective, and sufficiently direct, relationship to terms and conditions of employment.""

""BLM messaging originated, and is primarily used, to address the unjustified killings of black individuals by law enforcement and vigilantes,"" Bogas explained. ""To the extent the message is being used for reasons beyond that, it operates as a political umbrella for societal concerns and relates to the workplace only in the sense that workplaces are part of society.""

In a statement provided to TheBlaze, a spokesperson for Home Depot praised the ruling:

We don’t tolerate workplace harassment of any kind and take all reports of discrimination or harassment extremely seriously. We’re pleased with the judge’s decision and believe it affirms our value of respect for all people.

Rulings by NLRB agency judges can be appealed to the full NLRB in Washington, D.C., which is currently composed of three Democrats and two Republicans. From there, the matter can be settled in federal court.

"Intruder enters home wielding large stick, locks door, orders homeowner and child to get on floor. But homeowner grabs gun, and the tables quickly turn.","A stick-wielding intruder entered a home in Gainesville, Georgia, on Thursday morning and threatened the homeowner and a child, authorities told the Gainesville Times, adding that the homeowner grabbed a gun and told the intruder he'd shoot if he didn't get out.

The intruder left the house but wouldn't leave the yard — so the homeowner fired a shot into the ground, after which the intruder ran into the woods, authorities added to the paper.

What are the details?

The homeowner and his 12-year-old stepdaughter were getting ready for school around 7 a.m. in their Joe Chandler Road home, Hall County sheriff’s office spokeswoman B.J. Williams told the paper.

Miguel Villapando-Gomez, who's believed to be homeless, hit the glass storm door of the residence with a 6-foot tree branch, Williams noted to the Times.

“The suspect opened the storm door and entered the house, closed the main door behind him and locked it,” Williams added to the paper. “He then told both occupants to get on the ground.”

With that, the homeowner grabbed a gun from his bedroom and ordered the 48-year-old intruder out of the house, the Times said.

But Villapando-Gomez continued waving the stick around and refused to leave, Williams explained to the paper — that is, util the homeowner threatened to shoot.

The intruder got out, but Williams told the Times he then refused to leave the yard.

“The homeowner says he stepped into the doorway of the home and fired a shot into the ground,” Williams added to the paper, which convinced the suspect the best course of action was to run into the woods.

What happened next?

The homeowner called 911, the Times said, and shortly afterward deputies found Villapando-Gomez hiding under a truck in an area near the home.

The suspect was charged with felony home invasion, two counts of simple assault, possession of methamphetamine, and possession of drug-related objects, the paper said, adding that no attorney information was available Friday.

Villapando-Gomez was booked in to the Hall County Jail, where he remained Friday without bond on the home invasion charge, the Times reported.

Williams added to the paper that no one was hurt, but the homeowner and his stepdaughter were “shaken up.”

"House Democrat calls out Biden for sending American oil overseas, only to beg Saudi Arabia for more oil","Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna paraded himself on Fox News Thursday to bash President Joe Biden for sending American oil overseas.



American oil exports have increased in recent months, Reuters reported, driven by Biden's decision to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

In fact, even some of the oil released from the SPR is being sent overseas. More than 5 million barrels were shipped to countries in Europe and Asia last month. Destinations included France, the Netherlands, India, and even China, according to Reuters.

What did Khanna say?

Speaking on “America Reports,” the California Democrat admitted he does “not understand” why the Biden administration has refused to stop oil exports as Americans face record-high prices at the gas pump.

According to Khan, U.S. energy producers are exporting 3.44 million barrels of oil per day.

“I don’t understand why we’re allowing the oil to be exported to countries like China when we need it here in the United States,” Khan said.

“I don’t get that why a country that has a shortage right now of oil is allowing 3.44 million barrels every day to be sold,"" the congressman added. ""Before 2015 that was not allowed. And if you stopped that, you would have a dramatic decease in price.""

Ro Khanna on America Reports on Fox News discussing how Congress can tackle rising gas prices www.youtube.com

Later in the interview, Khanna also criticized Biden over his forthcoming trip to Saudi Arabia, during which Biden is expected to ask the Saudis to increase their oil production, which is reportedly already near maximum capacity.

""It's wrong,"" Khanna said. ""The president ran saying he would make Saudi Arabia a pariah state, that he was not going to engage [Mohammed bin Salman]. They're still engaged in a brutal war in Yemen, and I don't think that he should go meet with MbS until MbS takes some accountability for the murder of [Jamal Khashoggi] and until they bring the war in Yemen to an end.

""Look at the irony: We're going to beg Saudi Arabia for oil while we're exporting our own oil around the world,"" Khanna added. ""It makes no sense — and the Saudis are going to play us.""

At the end of the interview, Khanna suggested, like many polls indicate, that Biden is not focusing on the issues that matter most to Americans.

""I do think we have to be doing more. People in my district, they’re talking to me about gas prices, about higher food prices, they’re talking to me about the airlines getting canceled,"" Khanna said. ""Those are the issues front and center.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-democrat-biden-exporting-oil,2022-07-08
House Democrats block Republican effort to crack down on fentanyl traffickers and save lives,"On Wednesday, 220 House Democrats blocked a bill that would have put fentanyl-related substances, including precursors, in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Doing so would have enabled the government to crack down on those driving the opioid crisis and profiting off the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans. The bill expires on September 31.

Fentanyl is the leading killer of adults ages 18-45. Last year, opioids killed an estimated 80,816 Americans. 10% of the significant drop in U.S. life expectancy, now at its lowest point in over two decades, is attributable to such overdoses.

China is reportedly the principal source of the fentanyl flooding America's illicit drug market. Mexican cartels, partnered with the Chinese and using Chinese-sourced materials, manufacture and then traffic much of the killer drug over the U.S. border.

The ""Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act"" (H.R. 6184), sponsored by Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) and introduced with Rep. Bob Latta (R-Ohio) on December 8, 2021, had 88 cosponsors, all of whom were Republicans.

Griffith stated earlier this week that the bill would ""strengthen law enforcement's ability to prosecute fentanyl traffickers and act as a deterrent.""

He previously indicated that it will also help ""curb overdose deaths.""

In addition to making it easier to target traffickers of what some, including Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, have called a ""weapon of mass destruction,"" the bill would have removed barriers to research, said to be necessary for ""as many as 4,800 analogues"" to fentanyl. Of the thousands of analogues, ""experts at the NIH, FDA and other agencies have studied roughly 30.""

""If this law expires and doesn't become permanent,"" said Griffith, ""those 4,800 analogues are arguably legal ... and we have to pass a law on each one of them. The HALT Fentanyl act makes it so we don't have to do that.""

Latta stressed the urgency of the bill's passage and the need for Congress to take action, saying that the ""havoc these substances wreak on our communities is devastating.""

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who introduced companion legislation in the U.S. Senate with Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), emphasized that to ""ensure law enforcement has the tools to combat this trend, we cannot let this Schedule 1 classification lapse.""

The Democrats appear keen for just that to happen. In fact, this is not the first time that Democrats have blocked the bill. They blocked it on February 2 and on April 1.

It was suggested in a statement from Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee that ""Democrats in the House are blocking action on this bill ... [b]ecause they want to weaken criminal penalties on traffickers who move fentanyl-related substances.""

Despite Democrats' refusal to tackle the opioid crisis with this and other proposed legislative remedies, some members have nevertheless recognized the cost of doing nothing.

Rep. David Trone (D-Md.), who sits on the Congressional Join Economic Committee, compared the deaths resultant of the opioid epidemic to ""one 737 (jet) every day going down, no survivors. It's a mind-boggling number of deaths.""

New analysis released by the JEC on September 28 indicated that the opioid epidemic cost the U.S. a record of nearly $1.5 trillion in 2020. That cost is expected to rise.

The Republican Study Committee recently highlighted several other legislative endeavors to combat the scourge of fentanyl trafficking, addiction, and overdoses, including:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-democrats-block-republican-effort-to-crack-down-on-fentanyl-trafficking-and-save-lives,2022-09-30
House Democrats want to probe role Border Patrol played in Uvalde response: 'This tragedy raises questions',"House Democrats revealed Thursday they want to investigate the Border Patrol over the role its agents played in the Uvalde school massacre response.

What is the background?

Members of the Border Patrol tactical unit, known as BORTAC, arrived at Robb Elementary School about an hour after the gunman began his rampage inside. Local officers told the operators to help assist with evacuating children from the school, NBC News reported.

But after local police refused to enter the school to confront the gunman, the Border Patrol agents led a group of law enforcement inside the school, where they finally confronted the killer. A BORTAC agent is credited with neutralizing the killer.

Agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations were also on scene.

What did House Dems say?

House Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas asking him to explain the Border Patrol's role in the Uvalde response.

""While details surrounding the horrific shooting at Robb Elementary School are still emerging, it has been reported that U.S. Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) agents and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents brought this deadly incident to an end when they contravened local law enforcement’s decision not to engage and entered the classroom and killed the shooter,"" the letter stated.

The Democrats claimed they ""commend"" the law enforcement agents who responded to end the massacre and prevented further loss of life, but they also noted what they believe is an issue that needs to be addressed.

They explained:

At the same time, this tragedy raises questions about what authorities and responsibilities DHS personnel have in such situations, what agreements are in place related to the Department’s law enforcement personnel providing support to State and local law enforcement agencies, and whether the Department intends to bolster its school security efforts beyond existing initiatives like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s School Safety and Security resources and the U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center’s work on targeted school violence.

"House GOP taking hard look at congressional ethics chief ⁠— a Democrat charged with a DUI, previously accused of assaulting women","The Democrat congressional ethics chief may have dodged a criminal penalty after allegedly driving into a Pennsylvania home while intoxicated in September, but he will not altogether escape scrutiny by Republicans on the Hill.

A group of House Republicans have taken to questioning the judgment and ethics of the chief of the Congressional Ethics Office, Omar Ashmawy, who has been in his role for the past 12 years.

One lawmaker, provided with greater insights into both the Democrat's September 2022 DUI incident and at least one other significant ""lapse of judgment,"" told Just the News that Ashmawy and his office may soon be held accountable.

Who watches the watchmen?



Just the News reported that senior Republicans on the House Administration, Ethics, and Rules committees were recently briefed on Ashmawy's 2015 bar brawl — a fight the Democrat apparently tried to use his political clout to win after the fact — as well as on the Democrat's drunk driving incident in September.

Reps. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) on House Administration, Tom Cole (R-Okla.) on House Rules, and Michael Guest (R-Miss.) learned that just as Ashmawy was not ultimately disciplined years ago amid accusations of misusing his office and assaulting women, he is now poised to continue unscathed in his position after going off-roading in a residential neighborhood.



Davis suggested Thursday that Ashmawy ""should be embarrassed enough to resign. Nobody in that type of position should have multiple instances like he's had.""

""I've got to believe there are a lot of people in America with better standards, less of a record than Mr. Ashmawy who could clearly do a better job of gauging which investigations should come to the House Ethics Committee and which should not,"" added Davis.

The Office of Congressional Ethics, in which Ashmawy serves as staff director and chief counsel, is an independent, purportedly nonpartisan entity tasked with reviewing allegations of misconduct against members, officers, and staff in Congress.

According to the office's website, the OCE's mission ""is to assist the House in upholding high standards of ethical conduct for its Members, officers, and staff and, in so doing, to serve the American people.""

The OCE was created in 2008 by the then-Democratic majority led by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, reported NBC News.

It is governed by an eight-person board of directors, all of whom are private citizens and cannot serve as members of Congress. Accordingly, lawmakers do not have oversight of the OCE.

Republicans sought to bring the OCE under congressional oversight in 2017 but killed the initiative after it was criticized by then-President Donald Trump.

In an Oct. 19, 2022, letter to OCE co-chairmen Paul Vinovich and Mike Barnes, Republican Reps. Davis, Guest, and Cole expressed concern ""about recent reports of potentially criminal activity"" by Ashmawy, noting that the mission of the OCE — ""to assist the House in upholding high standards of ethical conduct"" — must be applied internally as well as externally.

The Republican members flagged Ashmawy's ""unacceptable pattern of behavior"" and asked about what actions had been taken in response.

Whatever actions the board took were evidently not career-killing. Ashmawy reportedly returned to duty Dec. 1, to resume applying a high standard to members of Congress that he might not himself meet.

'Unacceptable pattern of behavior'

Yahoo News reported that Ashmawy was arrested on Sept. 10 and charged with driving under the influence, careless driving, driving on roadways laned for traffic, and restrictions on alcohol in a vehicle.

Ashmawy had reportedly veered off the road, toppled a stop sign, smashed into a parked car, and then collided with the front porch of a Pennsylvania house.

The owner of the house, Hector Fernandez, said the collision shook his house. In the crash, Ashmawy reportedly knocked the victim's car back nine feet and damaged it to the point of inoperability.

Exiting his smoking vehicle, appearing ""highly intoxicated,"" Ashmawy allegedly told Fernandez not to call the police.

According to the victim, Ashmawy said, ""Don’t do that. Don’t don't call the police. Come on. Don’t do that.""

Fernandez called the police anyway.

When police arrived, Ashmawy refused to take field sobriety tests and was arrested.

Yahoo News reported that an arresting police officer spotted ""two bottles of Fireball whiskey, one empty, one full, a six-pack beer box, and a can of unopened beer"" inside the car belonging to the Democrat ethics czar.

The Democrat ethics chief told Yahoo News his drunken crash was a ""wake-up call,"" alerting him to his ""problem with alcohol dependency.""

Vinovich and Barnes issued a statement saying, ""We take this matter very seriously and the Board will be reviewing the circumstances surrounding it. ... In the meantime, Mr. Ashmawy has been placed on leave to deal with the issues that contributed to this incident. Helen Eisner will serve as the Acting Staff Director during his absence.""

Just the News indicated that the Republican members were informed that unlike other American citizens who might have ended up in jail or with a criminal record, Ashmawy would likely avoid a criminal penalty for the DUI charges by entering an alcohol abuse treatment program called Accelerated Rehabilitation Disposition.

Vinovich and Barnes indicated that ""upon successful completion of the ARD program, any pending charges against Mr. Ashmawy will be dismissed and his record will be expunged. ... In light of this, the Board has directed Mr. Ashmawy to return to his prior position.""

Using political capital to retroactively win fights

Davis, Cole, and Guest summarized the Feb. 14, 2015, incident as follows: ""Multiple witness statements to police detailed Mr. Ashmawy’s drunken and harassing behavior towards women during an altercation in which two people pled guilty to charges and Mr. Ashmawy was sued and settled out of court.""



The Daily Mail reported that Ashmawy was accused of harassing the inn's female bartender and a server, after which he was allegedly dragged outside for a fight.

After getting roughed up, Ashmawy allegedly used his political pull and office to pressure police to charge the others involved.



According to Just the News, an independent counsel dispatched by the House to look into the matter found that Ashmawy ""attempted to improperly exert pressure"" on local police.

The ethics chief reportedly used his official congressional emails in correspondences with the police and claimed that people in Washington, D.C., ""have taken an interest in this matter and are concerned.""

Ashmawy later settled out of court with another man in the fight who claimed that the Democrat ethics chief had improperly tried to get him fired from his Transportation Security Administration job and criminally charged. The man was indeed fired.

""Though it did not condone Mr. Ashmawy's use of his official account in this manner, the Board did not discipline him for it,"" the OCE board told Republican lawmakers in October.

Davis, who retires in four weeks, hopes to ""hold this board and the Office of Congressional Ethics accountable for their actions"" on his way out.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-gop-taking-hard-look-at-congressional-ethics-chief-a-democrat-charged-with-a-dui-previously-accused-of-assaulting-women,2022-12-09
'He has violated the law and it is time for him to go': House Republican files articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Mayorkas,"Texas Republican Rep. Pat Fallon filed articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas Monday evening, accusing the Biden pick of ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""



The articles have been referred to the House Judiciary Committee, now chaired by Republican Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), which will determine how and whether to proceed.



Fallon summarized the rationale behind the action, which House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other Republicans have threatened for months: ""Secretary Mayorkas's willful actions have eroded our immigration system, undermined border patrol morale, and jeopardized American national security. He has violated the law and it is time for him to go.""

What are the details?

The articles of impeachment accuse Mayorkas of violating his constitutional oath and engaging in a pattern of conduct incompatible with his duties as an officer of the United States.

“It is unfortunate that we have gotten to this point, but it is necessary,"" Fallon said in a statement. ""Secretary Mayorkas’s potential impeachment is not an accident. He has willfully abdicated his duties as Secretary of Homeland Security and actively misled Congress and the American people. To make any progress at our southern border, he must go.”



In the impeachment documents, Fallon cited the Secure the Fence Act of 2006, which requires the DHS secretary to ""maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States,"" noting that operational control is defined as ""the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.""

Fallon noted that Mayorkas, who previously helped implement the DACA program during the Obama administration, has ""presided over a 180-percent increase in encounters at the southern border compared to the previous administration"" and stood by while over 5.5 million criminal noncitizens stole into the United States.

Extra to an unprecedented number of illegal aliens crossing the border and 1 million known ""gotaways"" escaping into the United States, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that 98 persons with records in the Terrorist Screening Data Set crossed America's southwestern border in fiscal year 2022. Fifteen crossed last year, five times more than in the previous year. There were zero reported in 2019.

The articles of impeachment further note that ""more fentanyl has crossed the border in the last 2 months than in all of fiscal year 2019 under President Trump's leadership. In fiscal year 2022, over 14,000 pounds of poisonous fentanyl was seized at the southern border. Fentanyl overdoses are the number one cause of death for individuals ages 18 to 45 nationwide.""

In addition to facing accusations that he failed to uphold his oath, Mayorkas is accused of violating the Immigration and Nationality Act, which requires the DHS to detain inadmissible and uninspected illegal aliens in or entering the U.S. until processed.

""Secretary Mayorkas has violated the law and gravely endangered the national security of the United States,"" the articles claim, for these reasons and for:

""Terminating contracts for additional border wall construction, in contradiction of Congressional appropriations"";

""Ending the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as 'Remain in Mexico', which was an indispensable tool to address the border crisis and restore integrity to the immigration system""; and

""Attempting to eliminate title 42 authority, a critical tool enabling the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to quickly expel illegal aliens.""

Fallon further contends that Mayorkas both lied to Congress, having claimed in recent testimony that the southern border is secure, and ""slandered his own hardworking Border Patrol agents,"" having knowingly advanced a bogus narrative that agents whipped Haitian migrants.

Ahead of Fallon's filing, Mayorkas, who maintains the border is ""secure,"" told ABC's ""This Week"" that he has no intention of resigning.



""I've got a lot of work to do,"" Mayorkas said Sunday night, adding that he entertained hopes that a ""regional solution"" might come out of this week's North American Leaders' Summit in Mexico.

In lieu of solutions, at the summit in Mexico City, leftist Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador celebrated President Joe Biden's refusal to build ""even one meter of wall"" and called for Mayorkas' boss to confer amnesty on millions of illegal aliens.

Mayorkas also told ""This Week"" that he was prepared for possible investigations by House Republicans and that he would ""work throughout them.""

The Texas Tribune reported that Fallon originally filed the articles of impeachment on Jan. 3, but they were delayed on account of the protracted House speaker vote.

Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) introduced a similar resolution to impeach, try, and remove Mayorkas from office on Aug. 10, 2021, which Fallon and over a dozen other Republicans cosponsored.

The previous resolution claimed that the DHS secretary presided ""over a reckless abandonment of border security and immigration enforcement, at the expense of the Constitution and the security of the United States.""

"House Republicans release 'Commitment to America,' finalizing midterm messaging","House Republicans are readying for midterm elections in November. Media buys in the intervening months will only be as effective as the messages they permit politicians to transmit to voters. For this reason, and in hopes of achieving cohesion in the party's communications, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will officially unveil a four-piece ""Commitment to America"" on September 19 in Pittsburgh.

This package of commitments will indicate to voters not only what the GOP intends to combat in the way of Democrat policies, pernicious trends, and perceived corruption, but what it intends to deliver instead to the electorate. The latter is regarded by some as more important — communicating a positive message along with solutions rather than negative messaging.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) told Axios: ""If you're just running on anti-Biden, well, that's not going to get you over the finish line.""

When responding to President Joe Biden's claim that the Republican philosophy is ""semi-fascist,"" McCarthy hinted at the party's forward-looking thematics: ""Our best days are ahead of us, not behind us. Our nation can flourish again, and under a new historic Republic majority, it will.""

Axios reported that McCarthy's latest iteration of the House Republicans' ""Commitment to America"" is the product of the work of seven issue-specific task forces assigned to identify and develop policy solutions to the problems confronting the American people.

The issues tackled by the task forces were: jobs and the economy; big tech censorship and data; the future of American freedoms; energy, climate, and conservation; American security; a healthy future; and China accountability.

A communications kit disseminated by McCarthy last month hinted at the contents of the September 19 release as well as the task forces' determinations. The kit divided Republicans' commitment to America into four documents, detailed below.

""An economy that is strong""

The first document attributed an estimated 550% increase in inflation to Democrat spending and noted the impact of a 12% spike in food prices. It also emphasized American energy dependence, the high price of gasoline, and U.S. reliance on a hostile supply of critical goods (i.e. particularly on communist China).

The proposed remedies:

eliminate wasteful government spending;

reduce the cost of living and boost business with ""pro-growth tax policies"";

reconnect workers with jobs while also disincentivizing remote work;

end Biden's ""anti-energy policies"" and increase the production of American-made energy;

onshore supply lines and manufacturing; and

strengthen and modernize the U.S. stockpile of supplies and medicines.

""A nation that is safe""

The second document pointed to the fallout of the Biden administration's border policies, including the crime and drug deaths resulting from unchecked illegal immigration. It also noted the connections between ""Defund the Police"" initiatives and skyrocketing murders and between failed border policies and the unprecedented number of opioid overdoses.

The southern border and Democrat deference to criminals were not the only focuses, however; foreign policy concerns were also raised. The document stressed the geopolitical threat of communist China amid waning confidence in the U.S. military, particularly after Biden's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

The proposed remedies:

require proof of legal status when applying for a job;

restrict welfare benefits that incentivize illegal immigration;

end catch-and-release at the southern border;

finish building the border wall while also fully funding Border Patrol;

make violent crime against police officers a federal offense;

fully fund hiring bonuses to recruit more cops;

deny funding to ""woke district attorneys"" and prosecutors who refuse to prosecute crimes;

invest in the lethality of the U.S. military;

hold the Biden administration responsible for the botched Afghanistan withdrawal;

stand with Israel against Iran and terrorism; and

counter communist Chinese aggression.

""A future that is free""

The third document homed in on three fronts: education, health care, and free speech. On the first front, it underlined a dearth (28%) of confidence in public schools, the Department of Justice's efforts to target parents, and the pandemic's deleterious impact on children's academics. For health care, the document noted Americans' decreasing life expectancy and the possible negative impact of an increasingly socialized approach to medicine. Finally, the document touched both on the addictive and censorious nature of social media.

The proposed remedies:

take action to protect parental rights and expand school choice;

ensure that transsexuals do not ruin girls' school sports;

invest in lifesaving cures;

modernize personal health care and expand access to telemedicine;

scrap Section 230 protections for big tech companies;

provide greater data security protections for citizens; and

counter the cartelization of and collusion between big tech organizations.

""A government that is accountable""

The final document in the communication kit suggests the Democrats have: been opaque in their dealings; worked to silence their critics; applied the law unevenly; and run roughshod over the liberties of conservatives.

The proposed remedies:

promote government transparency and accountability;

uphold free speech and religious liberty;

defend the unborn and protect pro-lifers targeted by bad actors;

safeguard the Second Amendment; and

ensure safe and free elections.

House Republicans previously issued a ""Commitment to America"" in 2020. The 2020 commitment was more geared toward helping then-President Trump continue to execute his mandate and to helping America gain its footing after the pandemic, hence the language of ""restore,"" ""rebuild,"" and ""renew.""

Since Afghanistan had not yet been withdrawn from in a botched manner and nearly 2 million illegals had not yet stolen into the country, geostrategy and the border were not top priorities as they are now. Policing was, however a concern, considering that year the ""Defund the Police"" rhetoric had kicked off, along with the BLM riots.

In March, former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich likened McCarthy's recent efforts and his forthcoming ""Commitment to America"" to past Republican efforts, particularly former President Ronald Regan's successful work in 1980 and the GOP's game-changing 1994 Contract.

Gingrich suggested that the House Republicans, by following up on these commitments, will ""replace Pelosi's despotic perversion of the House of Representatives and turn it once again into the 'people's House.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/house-republicans-midterm-agenda-crystallized,2022-09-07
Houston man arrested for abducting a 3-year-old girl from an apartment complex and checking into a motel,"On Sunday, Houston police arrested 50-year-old Holman Hernandez for the alleged abduction of a 3-year-old girl, Lincy Guity.

Yesterday morning, Guity's parents called the police and reported that their daughter was nowhere to be found. They stated that they had gone to bed around 11 p.m. When they woke up, their daughter was missing and the front door to their apartment was left ajar.

The parents attempted to locate the child in the apartment complex but could not find her.

According to KPRC-TV, the child left the apartment in the middle of the night and walked to a neighbor's home, where a gathering was taking place.



When police arrived on the scene, they talked to neighbors and canvassed the area. One witness recalled seeing the child leaving with a man the witness recognized from the gathering. The witness was able to identify the suspect as Homan Hernandez.

Authorities responded by putting out an Amber Alert for Guity and the suspect. Hernandez's vehicle, a Nissan Sentra, was observed in the parking lot of a nearby hotel.

Hernandez's wife contacted the police and told them that her husband had called her to tell her that his vehicle had been stolen. The wife informed authorities that she could hear a little girl's voice in the background during the call.

When police arrived at the hotel, the suspect refused to answer the door. Authorities forced their way into the hotel room. Inside they found Hernandez and the child.

""Officers spoke to management. Management informed officers that they rented a room at approximately 7:30 to the suspect,"" stated Police Chief Troy Finner.

Finner stated that Lincy appeared to be okay. She was taken to a local hospital to be evaluated.

Oneida Hernandez, Guity's mother, stated that she saw a video of the suspect luring Guity into his vehicle with a cat, reported KPRC-TV. She stated, ""Give him the maximum time for taking my daughter.""

""The suspect is in custody. I want to say that he did put up a little bit of a resistance before they took him into custody,"" said Finner.

At this time, authorities do not believe that there is a connection between Hernandez and the child.

Hernandez has been arrested and booked into jail. He was charged with aggravated kidnapping, super aggravated sexual assault of a child, intent to inflict bodily injury, and intent to terrorize. The state recommended that Hernandez's bond be set at $1 million.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/houston-man-arrested-for-abducting-a-3-year-old-girl-from-an-apartment-complex-and-checking-into-a-motel,2022-08-22
HS football coach suspended 7 years ago for praying with players after games to be reinstated,"Joseph Kennedy, the Washington state public high school football coach who was suspended seven years ago for praying with players after games — and who won a U.S. Supreme Court case on the matter this summer — is to be reinstated, ABC News reported, citing court documents.

""Kennedy is to be reinstated to his previous position as assistant coach of the Bremerton High School football team on or before March 15, 2023,"" according to a joint stipulation filed in Washington state district court Tuesday by attorneys representing Kennedy and lawyers for the Bremerton School District, the network said.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

ABC News added that it reached out to both sides for comment.

What's the background?

Kennedy had been praying at the 50-yard line after games for years until Bremerton School District in 2015 told him to stop. When he refused, Kennedy said the district suspended him and then fired him.

In 2019, the court declined to take up Kennedy's case, the the Associated Press said — but only four conservative justices were on the court at that time. Amid a new conservative majority, Kennedy's lawyers in January announced that his case finally would be heard. The high court heard arguments in late April, and the words of some justices signaled that the court would side with Kennedy.

This SCOTUS Case Will Decide if America Is Still a Free Country | The Glenn Beck Podcast | Ep 142 youtu.be

In June, the high court ruled 6-3 for Kennedy, the AP said, adding that the conservative justices voted in favor of Kennedy, while the liberal justices voted against him.

“The Constitution and the best of our traditions counsel mutual respect and tolerance, not censorship and suppression, for religious and nonreligious views alike,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority, the outlet noted.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion that the court's decision in favor of Kennedy “sets us further down a perilous path in forcing states to entangle themselves with religion,” the AP said, adding that she was joined in her dissent by Justice Stephen Breyer and Justice Elena Kagan.

Kennedy didn't see it that way.

""This is a right for everybody. It doesn't matter if you're this religion or that religion or have no faith whatsoever,"" Kennedy told ABC News during an interview earlier this year, the network said. ""Everybody has the same rights in America.""

Players often joined Kennedy in prayer despite not being asked to do so, but the school district still asked him to stop, as it considered him still “on duty” as a coach after the game, the AP said.

""Just hours before what would be my last game as coach, the school district gave me an ultimatum: If I prayed after that night’s game, they would suspend me,"" Kennedy wrote last year in a Fox News op-ed. ""As a proudly retired U.S. Marine, something inside me stirred. I would have given my life defending the religious freedom of any American, and yet that very right was denied to me. That just seemed wrong and unjust.""

He added, ""I did pray on that chilly October night, leading to my suspension and termination. My only recourse at that point was to seek legal action to vindicate my rights of free speech and free exercise of my religious beliefs.""

Democrats outraged because Hulu refused to air their far-left ads: 'Another step down a dangerous path for our country',"Video streaming platform Hulu provoked outrage from Democrats after refusing to run political advertisements promoting the liberal agenda.

What are the details?

Earlier this month, three Democratic Party campaign organizations — the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Democratic Governors Association — tried to purchase an ad campaign on Hulu, the Washington Post reported.

The video ads promoted the Democratic Party's position on gun control, abortion, and climate change.

But those advertisements never ran, provoking fury from Democrats. The organizations, in fact, accused Hulu of ""censorship.""

""Hulu’s censorship of the truth is outrageous, offensive, and another step down a dangerous path for our country,"" said the executive directors of the three organizations in a statement to the Washington Post.

""Voters have the right to know the facts about MAGA Republicans' agenda on issues like abortion — and Hulu is doing a huge disservice to the American people by blocking voters from learning the truth about the GOP record or denying these issues from even being discussed,"" the statement added.

According to Suraj Patel, a Democrat running for Congress in New York, a Hulu representative told his campaign the streaming platform utilizes an ""unwritten"" policy that prohibits ""sensitive"" advertisements.

This was after Hulu rejected airing one of his advertisements, which also focused on gun control, abortion, and climate change. The decision was later reversed.

More from the Washington Post:

A person familiar with Hulu’s policies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about internal matters, said the decision to approve Patel’s ad had been made before Monday, though it was not immediately communicated to his campaign. This person said that the company does not publicly disclose its advertising guidelines but that they prohibit advertising that takes a position on a controversial issue, regardless of whether it is a political ad. The ads are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, with edits sometimes recommended to the advertisers.

Indeed, Hulu's advertisement policies clearly state, ""Hulu does not accept issue, electoral, or political Ads through the Ad Manager Tool.""

Even though outrage from Democrats may have led some supporters to call for a boycott of Hulu, even some liberals voiced disagreement with the complaints.

""Sorry guys, I’m usually with you but… unless they are running conservative ads and NOT the others, I have no problem with them choosing not to run political ads. This is a bad take,"" responded a self-identified ""liberal.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hulu-rejects-democrat-advertisements,2022-07-26
President Joe Biden sold nearly 1 million barrels of oil to Chinese state-owned company that Hunter Biden invested in,"While Americans suffer through high gas prices, President Joe Biden sent more than 5 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserves to foreign countries, Reuters reported. There were 950,000 barrels of U.S. oil sold to a Chinese state-owned gas company that has financial ties to a private equity firm that was co-founded by Hunter Biden, according to a new report.

In April, the U.S. Department of Energy announced that it was releasing 30 million barrels of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The ""emergency sale"" was ""conducted as part of a coordinated action with our international allies and partners to provide a wartime bridge that will support American consumers and the global economy in response to Vladimir Putin’s war of choice against Ukraine.""

Despite the Strategic Petroleum Reserve being at its lowest mark since 1986, the Biden administration sold oil to foreign nations last month.

The Department of Energy received 126 bids from 16 companies for the ""price-competitive sale of 30 million barrels of SPR crude oil."" The Department of Energy awarded ""price-competitive"" oil to 12 companies – one of which was Unipec America, Inc.

Unipec is the trading division of China Petrochemical Corporation – which is also known as the Sinopec Corp. The Biden administration sold nearly 1 million barrels of ""price-competitive"" oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to Sinopec – which is wholly owned by the Chinese Communist Party.

BHR Partners – a private equity firm Hunter Biden co-founded in 2013 – bought a $1.7 billion stake in Sinopec Marketing in 2015, according to the Washington Free Beacon.

The New York Post reported, ""BHR is primarily owned by Chinese investors, including the state-controlled Bank of China."" BHR claimed to have managed the equivalent of $2.4 billion.

Chris Clark, Hunter Biden's lawyer, told the New York Times in December that his client ""no longer holds any interest, directly or indirectly, in either BHR or Skaneateles."" Skaneateles LLC is Biden's personal company.

However, the Washington Examiner reported in March that Hunter was still listed as a part-owner of the firm.

""But business records from China's National Credit Information Publicity System accessed Tuesday continue to identify Skaneateles as a 10% owner in BHR, and Washington, D.C., business records continue to list Biden as the only beneficial owner of Skaneateles,"" the report stated.



The outlet noted, ""It’s possible that China’s business registry hasn’t yet been updated to reflect a potential transfer or sale of Skaneateles’s 10% stake in BHR to another party.""

In October 2019, Hunter vowed ""not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies"" if his father was elected president.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) reacted to the report of Biden shipping oil to the CCP on Twitter.



""Pres Biden reportedly sold oil [from] American reserves to China's Sinopec which Hunter Biden may still [be] tied to via his financial ventures in China. If report [is] correct that’s OUTRAGEOUS. Sen Johnson & I highlighted these connections to communist regime in our 2020 report + bank records,"" Grassley tweeted.

""At a time when Americans must pay record price$ at pump Pres Biden should NOT [be] selling our strategic oil reserves to communist China,"" he added. ""This misguided/harmful action is latest example of Biden's failed energy policies + Needs further scrutiny -[especially] if his son's China biz could benefit.""

In September 2020, Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) released a report titled: ""Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Corruption: The Impact on U.S. Government Policy and Related Concerns.""

The White House has continuously dodged questions about Hunter Biden's business dealings.

On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to comment on an alleged voicemail from President Biden to his son that discussed a New York Times article about Hunter's business associations with a Chinese oil tycoon.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-business-china-oil,2022-07-08
Hunter Biden wants to pay less in child support for the 4-year-old daughter he has never visited,"President Joe Biden's 52-year-old son Hunter has asked a judge in Independence County, Arkansas, to recalculate his child support payments to former stripper Lunden Roberts, a former employee and the mother of the 4-year-old child he sired out of wedlock in 2018.

According to a court filing obtained by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Biden cited ""a substantial material change"" in his ""financial circumstances, including but not limited to his income,"" as justification to lower the amount to be paid in support.

Biden similarly suggested he was hard up for cash in November 2019, when he stated in an affidavit: ""I am unemployed and have had no monthly income since May 2019."" Debts and obligations resulting from his divorce, he alleged, had proved ""significant.""

The first son moved out of a $5.4 million mansion in Venice Beach in 2021, out front of which he would park his six-figure-priced Porsche Panamera, and into a $20,000-a-month rental home in Malibu. Biden converted the three-car garage in his palatial new home into an art studio where he made some of the prints he sold last year for $75,000 each.

The court order setting Biden's monetary obligations to the Arkansas child and mother were filed under seal on March 12, 2020, approximately one year after he reportedly resigned from the board of Burisma, the energy exploration holding company based in Ukraine, where he was making roughly $50,000 per month.

As the order is under seal, it is unclear whether the calculation took into account the $4.8 million sent by the communist Chinese-affiliated CEFC China Energy company to a entity controlled by Biden and his uncle James Biden.

Roberts' lawyer, Clint Lancaster, suggested that Biden's efforts to pay less might prove costly. ""Ultimately, this is going to require us to look deeply, more deeply, into Hunter's finances.""



Before Biden's fight to pay less, he fought not to pay at all

Biden reportedly first met Roberts at the Mpire Gentlemen's Club in Washington, D.C., where she worked as a stripper. Shortly after breaking up with his dead brother's wife, Biden got Roberts pregnant.

The NY Post reported that Roberts — whom Biden claimed he had ""no recollection"" of meeting — had been on the payroll at the first son's now-defunct law firm Owasco PC during her pregnancy. After Roberts gave birth to the child, named Navy Joan, Biden promptly had Roberts kicked off the firm's health insurance plan.



Biden denied being the father (a paternity test later proved his parentage ""with near scientific certainty"") and refused Roberts' pleas to help care for the child. Consequently, Roberts sued him in an Arkansas court.

Biden defied the resulting court order to turn over financial information relevant to the case, refusing also to provide a list of the companies he owned or had an ownership interest in (e.g., Rosemont Seneca Partners, the ""$2.4 billion private equity firm"" he founded with former Secretary of State John Kerry's stepson Christopher Heinz) and a list of all of his sources of income. To avoid a contempt charge, Biden agreed to pay child support retroactive to November 2018.

Judge Holly Meyer subsequently ordered that these payments were to continue indefinitely and to be paid on the first of each month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hunter-biden-wants-pay-less-child-support,2022-09-15
'Hysterical' transsexual activists shut down talk by human rights expert about transsexual activists' intolerance,"An expert on human rights law was set to speak Tuesday at McGill University about whether transsexuals should be able to legally change their sex and invade women-only spaces when LGBT activists invaded the space, effectively shutting down the event.

Robert Wintemute, a law professor at King's College London, suggested the censorious uproar was ""hysterical"" and amounted to further evidence that any discussion of the fallout of the transsexual agenda, particularly for women, is increasingly being stifled.

What are the details?

According to the event page, Wintemute was scheduled to give a talk on Jan. 10 entitled, ""The Sex vs. Gender (Identity) Debate in the United Kingdom and the Divorce of LGB from T.""

""Since 2018, there has been a debate in the United Kingdom about whether or not the law should be changed to make it easier for a transgender individual to change their legal sex from their birth sex, and about exceptional situations, such as women-only spaces and sports, in which the individual’s birth sex should take priority over their gender identity, regardless of their legal sex,"" said the event posting.

It added, ""This debate inspired the foundation in 2019 of an organisation, LGB Alliance, which rejects the political coalition of LGB and T and challenges some transgender demands, on the basis that they conflict with the rights of lesbian and bisexual women or the rights of children who might grow up to be LGB adults.""

Wintemute, a McGill alumnus and trustee of the LGB Alliance, was invited to speak on this topic as well as to his record as a human rights and LGB scholar by the university's Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism.

Prof. Frédéric Mégret from the CHRLP suggested there was hope that Wintemute's participation in ""critical conversations"" about these issues might have been worthwhile.

""We understand that these are not consensual topics. However, we believe they can be productively and robustly discussed in an academic setting and could, in fact, be an opportunity to push back against certain views,"" said Mégret.

Robust discussion about women's rights on a university campus was apparently too much to bear for some male transsexual activists.

'Hysterical' mob rule

Canadian state media reported that transsexual activist Celeste Trianon, a biological male, sought to silence Wintemute and shut down the event, claiming the event excluded transsexual people's rights and was altogether ""transphobic.""

""I feel like there's such a tragic irony where someone who is actively working toward dismantling human rights toward one of the most marginalized groups … how such an event can be hosted at the McGill Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism,"" said Trianon.

According to Trianon, a student at another Quebec university, it is ""close-minded"" for anyone to suggest that the conference of ""rights to trans women"" means ""subtracting from the rights"" of real women.

Annie Collin, a real woman prevented from hearing Wintemute speak, told the Montreal Gazette that transsexual activists attacked her friend.

""They pushed her. They threw her phone away. They pretend they're being excluded but they're the people who tell people to get out. And they get madder because someone wants to defend women's rights, homosexuals' and bisexuals' rights. What's the problem about that?""

In a Jan. 6 Instagram post, Trianon claimed the event would ""contribute directly to the systemic elimination of trans voices and lives worldwide, as well as the dismantling of human rights as a whole.""



Trianon further accused the university of ""contributing to the genocide of trans people across the world"" in Jan. 10 letter co-signed by five professors at other Canadian universities.

The letter contended that ""free speech does not mean having to tolerate hate speech.""

This sentiment was evidently shared by the protesters, some of whom prejudged Wintemute's unuttered speech in advance as hateful.

Among the signs hoisted above the mob of anti-speech activists was one that read, ""No debate.""

The activists can be heard in one video chanting, ""We are not here for debate, f*** your systems, f*** your hate.""

Contrary to the mob's accusations that he harbored hate or irrational fears, Wintemute suggested that he would never have anything to do with a group that ""promotes hate,"" noting he had 37 years of experience defending human rights.

The professor has worked 15 successful cases challenging discrimination against gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in various European and British courts.

Wintemute told CTV News that it is ""extremely anti-democratic to interfere with a seminar at a university just because you disagree with the opinions expressed.""

""We're supposed to be a democracy with freedom of expression,"" he said.

Wintemute and the LGB Alliance advocate on behalf of the ""many women who are concerned about the presence of male-to-female persons in women-only spaces, which would include changing rooms, prisons, hospital wards, etc.,"" as well as the real females adversely impacted by the inclusion of men in women's sports.



The event's cancellation served to confirm a trend Wintemute has observed elsewhere.

""I have to thank the protesters for giving me firsthand experience of that intimidation,"" he said. ""Probably the majority of women in this country disagree with some of transgender demands, but they refuse to say so because they will be seen as intolerant.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/hysterical-transsexual-activists-shut-down-talk-by-human-rights-expert-about-transsexual-activists-intolerance,2023-01-12
"'I am, in fact, indoctrinating your children': High school educator sneers at parents concerned about 'woke agenda'","A so-called literacy coach near Chicago is testing the bounds of her free speech rights by creating several videos in which she rails against concerned parents and other ""right-wing conspiracy theorist nut jobs"" and then posting the condescending videos to TikTok.

Heather Marie Godbout, whose job title claims she is a ""literacy coach"" at Crete-Monee High School, has posted a series of education-related videos on TikTok under the handle @thatliberaleducator. In various videos, she excoriates conservatives as ""people who could know better if they could get out of their own little bubbles"" and accuses them of ""trying to bring down our democracy and create a Christian nationalist theocracy.""

In one particular video, which has the phrase ""Indoctrination? Yes please!"" emblazoned at the top and is replete with furrowed brows and audible lip smacks, she claims that it's ""[t]ime to own up to"" indoctrinating students.

""All you right-wing conspiracy theory nut jobs who seem to think the teachers are out here just indoctrinating children into some sort of woke agenda that you can’t actually define, I’m just going to come clean,"" Godbout begins.

""I am, in fact, indoctrinating your children,"" she admits.

She then spends another minute or so clarifying what her version of indoctrination entails.

""I'm indoctrinating children into understanding their own agency and learning how to think critically about the issues that impact their lives,"" she says after claiming to foster a love of ""reading and books.""

She then appears to have a clarifying moment of self-awareness when she claims to teach students to ""not just accept whatever some crazy person on the internet says at face value"" but to ""do their own research.""

She concludes the video by claiming that her work teaches students ""to be loving, kind, compassionate human beings"" who will make the world ""a better place."" She implies that she presents herself to students as a living model of such behavior.

When viewers criticized Godbout's condescending approach, she created a follow-up video in which she said she will always refuse to be respectful to people who disagree with her politically — whom she derisively refers to as ""those people"" — because ""they're talking about legislation that will literally unlive people."" She also accused one of her critics of ""tone-policing"" and of shutting ""down conversation, especially from people in marginalized groups.""

Godbout elsewhere stated that she does not fear reprisal from her employer for the videos, claiming, ""[M]y administrators fully support my First Amendment rights to free speech on my own social media platforms.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/i-am-in-fact-indoctrinating-your-children-high-school-educator-sneers-at-parents-concerned-about-woke-agenda,2022-12-19
"If forced by law to call a biological male a woman, female British politician says 'you might as well arrest me now,' threatens to leave the Labour Party","A British member of Parliament who has faced intense criticism over her refusal to disassociate biological sex from gender doubled down last week, reiterating that she will not refer to 60-year-old comedian Eddie Izzard as a woman — even if it means imprisonment.

What are the details?

On Friday, Rosie Duffield, a Labour member of Parliament for Canterbury, England, attended the annual LGB Alliance conference in London.

The LGB Alliance, which seeks to help the ""Ls,"" the ""Bs,"" and the ""Gs,"" but is not so much interested in the ""Ts,"" affirms that ""biological sex is binary, female and male, and that (for the vast majority of people) sex is determined at conception, observed at birth (or in utero), and recorded.""

The Independent reported that at the conference, Duffield was asked about the possibility that referring to a transsexual's biological sex might soon amount to a hate crime.

The Canterbury MP replied, ""Is that a serious thing? Is that coming to Parliament any time soon? I hope not because you might as well arrest me now. I'm not calling Eddie Izzard a woman.""



This response echoed a comment Duffield made in September, when she allegedly said, ""I won't say a man is a woman. Eddie Izzard is not a woman.""

Izzard, a man who dates women and previously identified as a ""lesbian trapped in a man's body,"" is campaigning to secure a spot as a Labour MP. It was only two years ago that Izzard appropriated and began using ""she/her"" pronouns.



Duffield previously stated that she would leave the Labour Party along with a number of other women if Izzard was included on an all-woman short list to become the party's candidate for the Sheffield Central region in the next general election.

""I will not be a hypocrite and I won’t lie and I won’t say that a man is a woman. Eddie Izzard is not a woman,"" Duffield said late last month. ""I’m absolutely not the only Labour woman MP who will leave the party if Eddie Izzard gets on to an all-women short list.""

Labour leader Keir Starmer has not yet revealed whether or not Izzard would be included on the list.

The Daily Mail indicated that Starmer is aware of Duffield's position on the matter and suggested that while ""for 99.9 per cent of women, it's a matter of biology ... there is a small percentage who struggle with their gender and I'm not going to simply put that on one side and ignore that.""

The Labour Party's National Executive Committee ruled in 2018 that men claiming to be women are eligible for all-women short lists.

The general election is slated for December 2024.

LGB, hold the T

Duffield similarly made waves last year at the LGB Alliance conference.

Duffield appeared on a panel entitled ""Cancel Culture and Free Speech"" alongside Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price and Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry.

The National reported that Duffield thanked Doyle-Price and Cherry for supporting her amid her ongoing troubles with the Labour Party, elements of which, in concert with online trolls, have denounced her as a ""transphobe.""

She said the Labour Party is ""incredibly lonely"" for a real feminist.

In the months and years leading up to last year's conference, a number of Duffield's staffers quit, slamming her recognition of the meaningful difference between biological women and pretenders. Pink News reported that one of the outgoing staffers suggested Duffield's comments about only women having cervixes was ""offensive to the trans community,"" despite being a matter of fact.

Duffield said, ""We’re OK to talk about everyone else’s rights, but we’re not supposed to talk about women, and we’re not supposed to talk about our bodies without quantifying it or justifying it, or adding on other groups that we also support to, sort of, you know, have our credentials allowed.""



""I'm afraid my party is an absolute embarrassment at the moment,"" she said, referencing the leftist Labour Party's embrace of extreme views on gender and sex.

Unwavering support for real women

Duffield has long been clear about her rejection of social-constructivist arguments concerning sex and gender.

On Sept. 10, 2021, she tweeted, ""I do not accept self-ID as a passport for male-bodied biological men to enter protected spaces for biological women.""



She added, ""That includes [domestic violence] refuges, women's prisons, single-sex wards and school toilets.""



Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling spoke to Duffield's mistreatment by other Labour Party members as well as trolls online, writing that she and others like her ""have been subject to campaigns of intimidation which range from being hounded on social media, the targeting of their employers, all the way up to doxing and direct threats of violence, including rape.""

Rowling added that Duffield and other such biology-affirming women ""have been put into a state of fear and distress for no other reason than that they refuse to uncritically accept that the socio-political concept of gender identity should replace that of sex.""

The Daily Mail reported that Duffield was investigated by Labour Party officials in 2021 for allegedly liking a tweet that said transsexuals were ""mostly heterosexuals cosplaying as the opposite sex and as gay.""

Alex Beverley, then-chairman of LGBT+ Labour, said, ""We feel we have exhausted all other options and now must publicly call for the whip to be removed from Rosie Duffield and for her to be suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party.""

Despite the best efforts of activists, Duffield remains, at least until now, a member of Parliament.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/if-forced-by-law-to-call-a-man-a-woman-female-british-politician-says-you-might-as-well-arrest-me-now-threatens-to-leave-the-labour-party,2022-10-24
"Illegal alien with rap sheet allegedly broke into Dem candidate's office, remains at large from ICE: Report","A man in the country illegally is responsible for a string of recent break-ins, including the attack on the Phoenix headquarters of Arizona Democrat gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs, police say.

Daniel Mota Dos Reis, 36, allegedly trespassed at an office building in uptown Phoenix on three separate occasions between October 22 and October 25. Within that office complex is the campaign headquarters for Hobbs, who is also the current Secretary of State in Arizona. That office was allegedly burglarized on Oct. 24. There is no indication that the attack was politically motivated.

On Oct. 26, Dos Reis had a run-in with police. During the confrontation, Dos Reis reportedly attempted to flee law enforcement and pushed a 60-year-old female security guard to the ground. He was then arrested for criminal trespassing and burglary and taken into custody. At the time of his arrest, police say they found several items which could be used in a burglary attempt as well as a new camera.

Later that evening, a Phoenix Police Department patrol officer was watching news coverage of the break-in at Hobbs' campaign office, which had occurred a few days before. The news segment contained surveillance images from the Hobbs attack, and the officer recognized the suspect featured on the footage as Dos Reis, whom police had arrested earlier that day. The officer then contacted the jail, discovered that Dos Reis was still in custody, and police rearrested Dos Reis on one count of third-degree burglary for the Hobbs incident.













Police believe that Dos Reis stole an Apple computer mouse, an Apple keyboard, and a black Nikon camera, worth a total of nearly $1,200.

Dos Reis is a Portuguese citizen who came to America on a student visa in 2018, but has since violated the terms of his stay, officials say.

""[Dos Reis is] currently at-large for administrative immigration violations for failing to maintain his status as a registered student at an academic institution,"" said Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe, an ICE public affairs officer.

Dos Reis also has prior convictions for assaulting an officer and shoplifting.

Because he is wanted for ""administrative immigration violations,"" many are wondering why he was not detained by immigration officers after his arrest for burglary. Instead, he was released on bond before an immigration detention order was even issued.

O'Keefe did confirm that Dos Reis was brought to the attention of Enforcement and Removal Operations, a subgroup of ICE, on Oct. 27. However, it is unclear whether an ERO officer spoke with Dos Reis before he was bonded out of jail.

Though the suspect in the case, Dos Reis, is a homeless and perhaps illegal immigrant with a criminal record, Hobbs blamed her Republican opponent, Kari Lake, for the attack on her office.

""Kari Lake’s preposterous allegation that this break-in was staged is unfounded and her refusal to condemn the threats that have become common in our politics continues to stoke chaos,"" a statement from Nicole DeMont, Hobbs' campaign manager, reads in part. ""Arizona is one of the top states for threats to election officials and poll workers. Public officials and candidates for office are harassed regularly, and armed vigilantes stand near ballot drop boxes, aiming to intimidate voters. Every Arizonan deserves to be able to do their jobs or exercise their constitutional rights to engage in our democracy safely.""

As several outlets, including KPNX-TV and KTAR News, have reported, there is no evidence linking Lake or any of her campaign rhetoric to the attack.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/illegal-alien-with-rap-sheet-allegedly-broke-into-dem-candidate-s-office-remains-at-large-from-ice-report,2022-11-03
"Illegal immigration surges 10% under Biden's watch, report says","President Joe Biden's decision to reverse as many of his predecessor's immigration policies as he can has led to more than a 10% surge in illegal immigration, according to a new review of federal data.

A dramatic increase in the number of foreign-born persons in the United States is largely driven by illegal immigrants, the Center for Immigration Studies finds in a new report. Based on data from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, CIS estimates there were 10.22 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. in January 2021. By April 2022, the illegal immigrant population is estimated to have grown to 11.6 million.

""This means that illegal immigrants accounted for some 1.35 million (about two-thirds) of the two million growth in the total foreign-born population since President Biden took office,"" the CIS report said. ""This growth is extraordinary because for the illegal immigrant population to grow, new arrivals do not simply have to exceed deaths and emigration, as is true for the total foreign-born, they also have to exceed legalizations, which are substantial every year. This means that the number of new illegal immigrants who settled in the country in the last 16 months must be a good deal larger than 1.35 million.""

There are now 47 million foreign-born persons living in the U.S. as of April 2022, the most ever recorded in any U.S. government survey or census. The percentage of foreign-born persons as a share of the total U.S. population is at a 112-year high, CIS said.

The group blamed Biden's campaign promises to undo former President Donald Trump's restrictive border policies — including halting wall construction and reinstating catch-and-release policies — for creating a perception that he would relax immigration enforcement. Republicans have accused Biden of incentivizing illegal immigration by rolling back Trump's policies.

""The administration’s decision to end the Migrant Protection Protocols (also called Remain in Mexico) for many asylum applicants, the scaling back of Title 42 expulsions, and more recently the decision to end it altogether, coupled with the release of some three-quarters of a million illegal immigrants encountered at the border as well as 146,000 unaccompanied minors, almost certainly has encouraged even more illegal immigrants to arrive at the southern border in the hope they, too, will be released into the country,"" the CIS said.

""The administration’s suspension of nearly all interior deportations and the resulting dramatic decline in immigration enforcement, including deportations, plus its refusal to automatically take custody of non-citizens released from jails and prisons have all likely made illegal immigrants feel safer, reducing emigration of those already here and encouraging new illegal immigration,"" the report stated.

The Biden administration says that increased levels of illegal immigration stem from so-called push factors in South and Central America that are causing migrants to travel to the U.S. in search of jobs, higher wages, and a better life.

""The U.S. Border Patrol already is managing numbers at historic levels due to large movements of people fleeing violence, corruption, poverty, climate change, and other hardships. And numbers could rise further from confusion over recent court orders and as smugglers continue to peddle misinformation to make a profit,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said recently.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/illegal-immigration-surges-10-under-biden-s-watch-report-says,2022-06-01
Illinois hospital system to pay $10.3 million in settlement with workers over COVID-19 vaccine mandate,"A Christian ministry says it has settled a class action lawsuit against an Illinois hospital system on behalf of more than 500 current and former health care employees who opposed the system's COVID-19 vaccine mandate on religious grounds.

Liberty Counsel on Friday announced it had reached a $10.3 million settlement with the Chicago-based NorthShore University HealthSystem after the hospital system fired hundreds of workers who claimed religious liberty exemptions and refused to comply with its vaccination policies.



“This classwide settlement providing compensation and the opportunity to return to work is the first of its kind in the nation involving COVID shot mandates. This settlement should be a wake-up call to every employer that did not accommodate or exempt employees who opposed the COVID shots for religious reasons,"" said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel.

The settlement was filed in the federal Northern District Court of Illinois and must be approved by the court.



In a statement, the Christian group said this is a ""historic, first-of-its-kind class action settlement"" involving a dispute over religious exemption requests for COVID-19 shots.

Liberty Counsel said the health care workers ""were unlawfully discriminated against and denied religious exemptions from the COVID shot mandate.""

NorthShore is an integrated health care delivery system encompassing six hospitals in the Chicago metropolitan area and employing more than 10,000 people.

According to court documents, NorthShore estimated that approximately 523 employees requested and were denied religious exemption and/or accommodation to its vaccination policy between July 1, 2021, and January 1, 2022. Of those employees, about 204 took the vaccine while 269 were fired or resigned rather than comply with the vaccine mandate.

""As a result of the settlement, NorthShore will pay $10,337,500 to compensate these healthcare employees who were victims of religious discrimination, and who were punished for their religious beliefs against taking an injection associated with aborted fetal cells,"" Liberty Counsel said.

The group estimated that employees who were terminated or resigned because their religious exemption claim was rejected will receive approximately $25,000 each. Employees who accepted the COVID-19 shot to keep their jobs will receive about $3,000 each.



NorthShore has also agreed to change its ""no religious accommodations policy,"" Liberty Counsel added, calling the previous policy ""unlawful.""



Additionally, employees who were fired will be eligible for rehire to their previous positions if they wish, Liberty Counsel said.



“Let this case be a warning to employers that violated Title VII. It is especially significant and gratifying that this first classwide COVID settlement protects health care workers. Health care workers are heroes who daily give their lives to protect and treat their patients. They are needed now more than ever,"" Staver said.

Responding, NorthShore said, ""We continue to support system-wide, evidence-based vaccination requirements for everyone who works at NorthShore – Edward/Elmhurst Health and thank our team members for helping keep our communities safe.

“The settlement reflects implementation of a new system-wide vaccine policy which will include accommodation for team members with approved exemptions, including former employees who are rehired,"" the hospital system told Evanston Now.

'I'm a little concerned today': Kari Lake emphasizes she's not suicidal and her brakes work after Hillary Clinton states Lake should 'never' win,"Hillary Clinton took aim at Kari Lake on a satellite radio show, noting that she doesn't want her ""anywhere near power."" Hours later, Lake humorously invoked the ""Clinton Body Count"" theory, publicly underscoring that she is in good mental and physical health.

Clinton wants women empowered, but only if they're Democrats

Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton went on SiriusXM’s ""Mornings with Zerlina"" on Thursday to drum up resentment for Republicans and to motivate Democrats to vote in the midterm election.

Zerlina Maxwell, who previously worked for Clinton and had her MSNBC show canceled earlier this year, raised the issue of violent political rhetoric.

Maxwell echoed Chelsea Clinton's sentiment early in the show, telling Hillary Clinton that there was ""always a whisper of violence around you and your family ever since the early days going back to Arkansas.""

Maxwell was referring to alleged violent rhetoric pointed at the Clintons, not the numerous people in the family's orbit who, according to the Daily Mail, ""died in suspicious circumstances since the early 1990s.""

Clinton suggested that those whose free speech she perceives to be violent or unacceptable should not be allowed on social media platforms. According to Clinton, it is not just free speech that incites violence that is a problem, but free speech that is ""indifferent"" to how it could be received.

Besides the ""marketplace of ideas"" having ideas she doesn't like on display, Clinton also expressed frustration with there allegedly being too many male politicians at the local level.

Maxwell asked the 75-year-old, ""Do you think we will have a woman president?""



Clinton's mind went to Arizona.



The twice-rejected presidential candidate said, ""I just don't want some woman with whom I profoundly disagree on the other side of the aisle getting there first.""



""That woman running for governor of Arizona ... I don't want her anywhere near power,"" said Clinton, refusing to identify Lake by name. The former presidential candidate cackled and then stressed, ""Never!""

Clinton claimed that Lake had laughed at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband's alleged assault by an illegal alien.

Maxwell advanced the claim, saying ""anybody who could laugh at a horrifying situation like that, that's not somebody I want in charge of the 7/11 ...""

Lake provides update on her well-being — just in case

On Fox News' ""Hannity"" Thursday night, Sean Hannity pressed Lake on her thoughts about high-profile Democrats like former President Barack Obama and Clinton campaigning against her.

Lake responded, ""First it was Liz Cheney last week, and I just laughed that off. And now I'm living rent-free in Barack Obama's mind, and then Eric Holder today.""



""But I was a little concerned today,"" said Lake. ""I'm going to be honest ... I saw Hillary Clinton bad-mouthing me. And she looked angry and actually scared.""

Laked added, ""Completely unrelated, I want you to know, just in case you're wondering, I'm in perfect health, my brakes on my car are in good shape, and I'm not suicidal.""

Hannity responded, ""One of the things that has endeared you to the people of Arizona and around the country is you got a great sense of humor.""

Lake's comical intimation that Clinton might pose a threat to her or have something to do with a brake malfunction is a reference to a decades-old theory alleging that some of the human obstacles to the Clinton family's assumption or maintenance of power died from less than natural causes.

'Clinton Body Count'

Vox reported that the ""body count meme"" started in 1993 after Indianapolis lawyer Linda Thompson compiled a list of 34 people connected to the Clintons who had died. Thompson titled the list, ""The Clinton Body Count: Coincidence of the Kiss of Death?""

Newsweek reported that the Indianapolis lawyer had been enraged by the 1993 Waco, Texas, siege where federal agents under then-President Bill Clinton torched 76 Branch Davidians, including 25 children.

Former Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-Calif.) whittled the list down to 24 people and demanded hearings on the matter.

Snopes claimed the list to be ""false,"" noting that ""Clinton was acquainted with some people who died — that's about all one can make of this list.""

Thompson had also reportedly admitted having ""no direct evidence"" of the Clintons killing anyone.

The list, which includes Hillary Clinton's colleague and former deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and various others from the Clintons' time in the White House, has grown over time.

A recent addition is the Clintons' former good friend Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile and child sex trafficker. The Clintons spent time at the pedophile's ranch. Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's private jet at least 26 times and visited the pedophile's island.

Epstein allegedly died by suicide in August 2019. The video cameras outside his cell allegedly malfunctioned, and potentially relevant CCTV footage was erased by ""technical errors.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/im-a-little-concerned-today-kari-lake-emphasizes-shes-not-suicidal-that-her-brakes-work-after-hillary-clinton-states-lake-should-never-win,2022-11-04
"In yet another NYC subway attack, cops say suspect tried to argue with victim — and when victim walked away, suspect stabbed him in back","In yet another New York City subway attack, police said a suspect tried to argue with a victim on a train platform — and when the victim walked away, the suspect stabbed him in the back.

What are the details?

Police said the perpetrator tried to engage the victim in a dispute just before 4:30 a.m. Friday on the southbound ""A"" line platform at 125th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue. Fox News reported that's a Harlem station.

Cops added that when the victim didn't respond, the suspect stabbed the victim once in the back.

Police said the victim is a 58-year-old man who ignored the suspect's attempt to start a ""verbal dispute,"" Fox News said, citing NYPD Crimestoppers. The cable network added that when the victim walked away, the suspect followed behind him, pulled out a knife, and stabbed the victim once in the upper back.

The suspect then fled the station in an unknown direction, Fox News said.

The cable network said the suspect is between 28 and 35 years old and about 5 feet, 8 inches tall with a thin build.

WNYW-TV said the victim was rushed to Mount Sinai-Morningside Hospital in stable condition where he received multiple stitches for his wound.

Police said there's a $3,500 reward, and tipsters can confidentially call 1-800-577-TIPS. WNYW added that members of the public also can submit tips by logging on to the CrimeStoppers website or on Twitter @NYPDTips.

How are folks reacting?

Facebook commenters were none too pleased with the alleged attacker or with elected officials:

""And this Rhodes Scholar's got a book in his hand,"" one commenter said.

""Still crime on the rise in the subways and yet that useless governor and mayor yap [their] gums about more cops in the subways,"" another commenter observed. ""[I've] yet to see any down there but a lot of homeless and crazy people walking and sleeping; one even taking a dump on the E train platform recently; stay safe commuters always watch your surroundings down there.""

'The invasion is real': Border county officials call on Texas to use Constitution to end Biden's border crisis,"Republican officials in several Texas border counties have declared that the illegal immigration crisis is an ""invasion"" of their communities and called on Gov. Greg Abbott to declare an emergency and begin deportations.

Officials from Uvalde, Terrell, Kinney, and Goliad Counties held a press conference Tuesday in which they announced that emergency declarations would be forthcoming to call attention to the harms inflicted by the federal government's failure to secure the border.

""I am here to let you know that the invasion is real,"" Terrell County Judge Dale Lynn Carruthers said.

""We are here to protect the sovereignty of our nation, not just the border of Texas,"" she added.

The officials said that residents in their communities have seen property damage, increased crime, and other dangers brought by the flow of drugs and human trafficking across the border. They are dissatisfied with the Biden administration's handling of the crisis and are demanding that the Texas state government step in to enforce federal immigration law in the absence of federal law enforcement.



A press release from Kinney County states that in the month of June, local law enforcement has prevented more than 67 smuggling attempts along county roads and encountered over 4,000 illegal aliens ""who avoided apprehension by Border Patrol and whose whereabouts are currently unknown.""

Since January 2021, more than 3.2 million migrants have been apprehended by law enforcement after entering the country illegally and upwards of 800,000 have slipped past Border Patrol and disappeared into the country, officials pointed out.

Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin said rampant illegal immigration has brought an influx of pedophiles, convicted murderers, drug dealers, and gang members into his community.

""It’s a nightmare. With the tragedy that we just had, our kids are going to be going back to school in the next 45 days or so, and here we’re going to start agin with the bailouts and so forth. It needs to stop. We need to make them come across the right way so we know who they are and where they’re going,” he said.

Goliad County Judge Mike Bennett told reporters there's been an increase in stolen cars and property damage reported over the last two years. He said increased crime rates are ""stealing our resources"" because more and more of the county budget has to be directed towards law enforcement.



""The Biden administration won't do a thing about it,"" Kinney County Judge Tully Shahan said. ""We’re in over our head. We need help and we need for Attorney General Ken Paxton and our governor to adopt an invasion under its definition in the Constitution. Adopt that invasion and let’s move forward.”

The counties invoked Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution and Article 4, Section 7 of the Texas Constitution to declare the existence of an ""invasion"" of the country. They urged Abbott to do likewise and ""take necessary actions to preserve and protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Texas.""

Their appeal to the Constitution to have state governments enforce federal immigration law is a strategy that has been put forward by conservative activists, including former Trump administration official Ken Cuccinelli, who has advised the county officials and spoke at the press conference.

Cuccinelli said that using the “self-help provision of the Constitution to declare an invasion … gives the governor, decided similarly, the authority to repeal that invasion.”



An Abbott spokeswoman told the Houston Chronicle that ""all strategies remain on the table"" to confront the border crisis.

“As the challenges on the border continue to increase, Texas will continue to take additional unprecedented action to address those challenges caused by the Biden administration,” she said.

But legal experts like David Bier, the associate director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, have criticized the counties' use of the term ""invasion,"" discounting the criminal elements coming over the border and emphasizing that the federal government has broad powers over immigration policy.

“The people coming are actively seeking to place themselves under the laws of the United States by seeking asylum,” Bier told the Chronicle. “So the idea that the first ‘invasion’ in the history of the world where invaders seek to subject themselves to the law of the country that they’re invading — it’s a total mischaracterization of what an invasion is.”

Legal scholar Jonathan Turley made similar comments to Fox News Tuesday.

""I'm afraid I'm skeptical. As they say in Texas, this dog won't hunt. They're relying on the guarantee clause of Article Four, Section Four, and that deals with an invasion, which is generally interpreted and long interpreted to mean an actual foreign invasion in the form of an army, an organized force,"" Turley said.

""I don't think a court would seriously consider expanding the term 'invasion' to cover this.""

Still, conservative lawmakers are supporting the counties' declaration.

""We are dealing with an invasion,"" Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) told Fox News Wednesday. ""We are dealing with Texans dying from fentanyl pouring into our communities. Our ranchers are getting overrun, their livestock are getting out, their fences are getting cut. Our communities are dealing with that. So all that these leaders in the counties in south Texas are asking for is that Texas step up and we go do what the federal government refuses to do.""

""Texas is the collateral damage of a federal government that is leaving us dangling,"" Roy said.

"Iowa, North Dakota join other states in banning TikTok on state-owned devices","Iowa and North Dakota have joined seven other states in banning employees from having TikTok on state-owned devices, bringing the total to nine states where the app is banned from being used in such a manner.

Federal authorities have committed to stymieing the video application over concerns of data harvesting and threats to national security at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, as reported by TimCast.

Both gubernatorial offices of Iowa and North Dakota announced the ban on state-owned devices on Dec. 13, 2022.

Effective immediately, Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa announced her directive to the Iowa Department of Management’s Office of the Chief Information Officer, issuing a ban on TikTok on all state devices and furthermore, prohibiting any state agencies from subscribing to or owning a TikTok account.

“It is clear that TikTok represents a national security risk to our country and I refuse to subject the citizens of Iowa to that risk,” said Gov. Reynolds on the ban.

“They trust us with their personal and confidential information and we will take every step possible to protect it, including from the Chinese government,” the governor stated.

The office of the governor of North Dakota issued its ban by way of executive order. Governor Doug Burgum's ban forbids TikTok from state-owned devices that are issued by executive branch agencies over ""growing national security concerns.""

Executive branch agencies and employees in North Dakota are prohibited from visiting TikTok's website or downloading the app on any government-provided equipment. The ban also extends to the scope of the state's internet servers, prohibiting the use of TikTok when connected to state networks.

The state's IT department is advised to enforce the ban and assist any state partners in securing their equipment.

“Protecting citizens’ data is our top priority, and our IT professionals have determined, in consultation with federal officials, that TikTok raises multiple flags in terms of the amount of data it collects and how that data may be shared with and used by the Chinese government,” Governor Burgum said in his statement.



Concerns and cries continue to mount over TikTok's invasive policies, with even Democrats echoing the viewpoints once brought forward by Donald Trump.

""I think Donald Trump was right,"" said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, in November 2022. ""It is a massive collector of information, oftentimes of our children,"" he continued.

Similar bans of the app are in place in Alabama, Maryland, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iowa-nd-ban-tiktok-statedevices,2022-12-15
Iowa teen who pleaded guilty to killing alleged rapist faces sentencing Wednesday,"An Iowa teenager who pleaded guilty to murdering her alleged rapist in June 2020 faces sentencing on Wednesday.



The Des Moines Register reported that Pieper Lewis, now 17 years old, pleaded guilty to killing Zachary Brooks, 37, when she was 15.

The teenager had run away from home several times between January and March 2020. A doctor who testified for Lewis noted that her mother, Leslie Lewis, was “mentally and emotionally abusive.”

Lewis’ attorneys told the court about an incident where Lewis had returned home from being raped, and her mother seemed to blame her daughter for the attack. The teen responded by running away and sleeping on the steps of an apartment complex.

Lewis told authorities it was then that she met a 28-year-old musician who offered to take her in. Instead, the musician forced her to have sex with multiple men, including Brooks.

The teen told the court that one night in May, Brooks raped her five times and forced her to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana. Lewis recalled that on a later date in May, the musician cut Lewis’ throat with a knife when she refused to go with Brooks.

During a visit to Brooks’ home in June, Lewis fell asleep and woke up to Brooks raping her. After he had gone to sleep, Lewis stated that she was getting ready to leave when she noticed a knife on the nightstand.

Lewis claimed that something inside her snapped. Blinded by rage, she grabbed the knife and stabbed Brooks 30 times in his sleep.

The prosecution never disputed Lewis’ claims that Brooks had raped the underage girl.

Assistant Polk County attorney Erik Howe argued, “The child’s counsel has made much of the fact that Mr. Brooks seems likely to have committed a crime of his own prior to his death: statutory rape of a minor. While the undersigned certainly doesn’t wish to condone or excuse that conduct, it really isn’t germane to the discussion of whether waiver is appropriate. While it could potentially serve as a mitigating factor, the Court has no evidence before it to suggest it was a factor in Mr. Brooks’ death whatsoever. At best, child’s counsel’s argument amounts to ‘he was a bad guy so he deserved it.’”

The musician has not been charged for the alleged sex trafficking of the underage girl.

Lewis awaits sentencing on Wednesday at Polk County Criminal Courthouse for a first-degree murder charge. The teen agreed to plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter and willful injury in adult court. Lewis could be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in prison for each charge.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/iowa-teen-killed-alleged-rapist-sentencing,2022-09-06
Iranian soccer players protested against their government at World Cup by staying silent during their national anthem,"Soccer players on the Iranian national team protested against their own government by refusing to sing along with the national anthem before their World Cup game on Monday.

The players stood silently as the anthem played and fans cheered loudly at Khalifa International Stadium in Doha, Qatar.

Protests erupted across Iran after a 22-year-old woman died in police detention when she was arrested for not adhering to the regime's strict rules on women's dress code. Protesters have publicly cut their hair and burned head coverings in memory of the woman.

The captain of the soccer team said that the players supported those Iranians who had died during the protests against the regime. More than 400 people have died protesting as state police have tried to crack down on the demonstrations.

Earlier in the month, the Iranian parliament voted overwhelmingly to recommend the death sentence for protesters. Human rights groups say more than 16,000 people have been arrested for protesting. At least six protesters have already been sentenced to death.

Some noted that the team was risking retaliation from the regime against them and their family members in Iran.

The government in Qatar has warned visitors to the World Cup that they will be subject to local laws if they try to bring their own values and customs to the games. Some have criticized the Muslim country for their hardline stance against homosexuality and drinking at the games. In response, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said Europeans should be apologizing for what they did for 3,000 years across the globe.

Fans of the Iranian soccer team also protested against the regime outside the stadium with signs and statements.

England ended up with a 6-2 victory over Iran.

Iran reportedly threatened families of World Cup players with torture and death if athletes protest again,"Iranian authorities reportedly threatened torture and death against the families of soccer players if they misbehaved by protesting at the World Cup games.

The CNN report said members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps held a meeting with the national soccer players after they stood in silence during the performance of their national anthem at their first World Cup game against England.

The report was based on a source involved with the security of the games.

The source said the players were told by the IRGC members that their families could be tortured or executed if they refused to sing the anthem again or if they participated in other protests against the Iranian regime.

Iran has been rocked with protests across the nation after a young woman died in police custody after being detained for violating the country's religious restrictions related to women's clothing. Iranian women have protested against the government by refusing to wear the hijab, a religious headdress, in public and cutting their hair, both violations of the dress code.

The government has responded with a brutal crackdown on the demonstrations. Human rights groups estimate that more than 16,000 protesters have been arrested. The Iranian parliament voted overwhelmingly to recommend the death sentence for protesters.

The CNN source said that the IRGC is surveilling their country's soccer players to make sure they don't interact with foreigners at the games.

“There are a large number of Iranian security officers in Qatar collecting information and monitoring the players,” the source told CNN.

The international soccer tournament has been plagued with controversy since it was held in Qatar, a Muslim country. The government has banned alcohol at games, causing many fans to chant in protest during the contests.

The Iranian players sang their national anthem as usual during their second World Cup game against Wales. Their next game will be against the U.S. team on Tuesday.

Former NFL player threatens MSNBC host with lawsuit over 'child abuse' attack: 'She needs to be held accountable',"Former NFL player Jack Brewer is threatening to promptly sue MSNBC host Joy Reid for accusing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) of actions ""tantamount to child abuse.""

What is the background?

After DeSantis signed into law the Stop WOKE (Wrongs Against Our Kids and Employees) Act last Friday, Reid attacked DeSantis over young black boys who held anti-critical race theory signs at the bill-signing ceremony.

""This mis-use of Black boys is tantamount to child abuse,"" Reid said. ""I would really like to hear the back-story on who these kids were and how they wound up at a DeSantis event. Given how anti-Black DeSantis is, using Black children this way is extra sick.""

Reid later said the boys were used as ""props"" by DeSantis, whom she described as ""America's most racist governor."" She even claimed without evidence the boys ""may not have known in advance why they were there.""

What is happening now?

Brewer, who played in the NFL from 2002 to 2006, is now demanding an apology from Reid — or else he will sue her for defamation.

Despite Reid claiming the boys were from a Miami-area charter school, Brewer told the Washington Examiner the boys are members of an after-school program operated by his foundation, the Jack Brewer Foundation.

""She has completely humiliated my kids and my program,"" Brewer told the news outlet. ""It's just so hurtful, and she needs to be held accountable.

""She does it so often. And you know, her words and the way that she comes across to black America leaves a stain on all of us,"" he added. ""I won't put up with it when it comes to my kids.""

Brewer explained that he planned to send a letter to Reid demanding an apology. If she refuses, his counsel is prepared to file a defamation lawsuit against her.

In a separate interview with Fox News, Brewer said Reid exemplifies ""the crisis going on in black America.""

""We are a faith-based program where we stand firm on the word of God,"" Brewer said. ""For people to be questioned … this is just a tragedy, and this is the problem with black America. This is the problem with underserved communities right here. Joy Reid is the example of the crisis going on in black America.""

""The biggest concern that we both have is just for the safety and protection of my kids and our program,"" he explained. ""We've received several phone calls from parents and different people who are obviously getting calls and harassed by folks in regards to this crazy thing that Joy did.""

Meanwhile, Brewer confirmed that the boys, in fact, wanted to be at the ceremony.

""It was explained to them on the bus ... It was explained to them while they were there. Yeah, my kids don't identify with CRT because we don't believe in it,"" Brewer said. ""We believe in loving everybody and not separating people by their skin color. That's what we teach. Our program teaches to love this country. To love God first. To love their neighbor as themselves.""



Anything else?

Reid has not responded to Brewer's demand.

However, DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw celebrated Brewer's remarks, describing them as the ""perfect response to a nasty bully.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jack-brewer-threatens-lawsuit-joy-reid,2022-04-26
Jacob Blake drops lawsuit against Kenosha Police Officer Rusten Sheskey,"Jacob Blake, who was shot in the back during a 2020 domestic incident, has dropped his civil rights lawsuit against the Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officer who fired on him.

The shooting left Blake partially paralyzed and sparked citywide protests in the days and weeks following the incident.

You can read more about the background of the shooting here.

What are the details?

Blake and his legal team dismissed the action against Kenosha Police Officer Rusten Sheskey on Friday after filing the suit against the officer in 2021.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that a one-page stipulation signed by lawyers from both sides indicated that they've agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice. As such, U.S. District Judge J.P. Stadtmueller signed an order granting the dismissal. Blake will not be able to refile the claim against Sheskey.

It is unclear at the time of this reporting whether the sides reached a settlement.

During the 2020 incident, Blake — who was armed with a knife — refused to comply with officers' orders and resisted detainment, prompting Sheskey to fire on the suspect. At the time of the incident, Blake had an outstanding warrant for his arrest on charges of third-degree sexual assault, trespassing, and disorderly conduct. The charges were related to a previous incident that took place at the same address.

The shooting prompted Blake to file suit claiming ""catastrophic, permanent injuries"" that left him partially paralyzed.

Sheskey, who was not disciplined as a result of the shooting, was previously cleared of all criminal wrongdoing. After an investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice said that it would not pursue federal civil rights charges against the officer and determined that the shooting was justified.

Neither an attorney for Blake nor an attorney for Sheskey has spoken out about the filing at the time of this report.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jacob-blake-drops-lawsuit,2022-05-11
NHL legend 'unretires' at 50 to play after team he owns is stricken with illness,"NHL and international hockey legend Jaromir Jagr came out of retirement to play just one game after his team was largely out of commission due to an unnamed illness.

Jagr, who played in the NHL from 1988 to 2018, has since played in the Czech Republic's top league for the Kladno Knights, a team he is the majority owner of.

The team was down to just 12 players due to a recent illness and, after postponing the previous game, was in danger of facing league disciplinary actions should another game be postponed.

Jagr, who is seemingly retired, not having played in any of the team's first 26 games, decided to suit up to avoid any penalties.

Amazingly enough, the Czech performed quite well considering his age, tallying two assists in just 15 minutes of ice time, according to Yahoo Sports.

“My arrival was not planned in advance,” Jagr said. “When Liberec decided to not postpone the match, we only had 12 players at training on Saturday. There was a threat of suspension and I didn’t want it to happen,"" the owner explained.

Despite his team losing 7-3 to club HC Bílí Tygři Liberec, Jagr's sacrifice was even more selfless than it initially appeared. Not only did taking the ice prevent his team from facing penalties, but his participation will delay his eligibility to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame until at least 2026.

The 6'3"" forward is all but assured to be enshrined in the Hall of Fame, as he is the top-producing European player ever to play in the NHL. Jagr is fourth all-time in goals scored, fifth in assists, and second in points, behind only ""The Great One,"" Wayne Gretzky. In three separate stretches in the NHL, Jagr played for nine different teams and participated in eight All-Star games

In March 2022, Jagr moved his team's final game of the season to a larger arena to help raise money for Ukrainian refugees who were fleeing to the Czech Republic. The game was moved to O2 Arena in Prague with a capacity of 18,000, while the original Rocknet Arena holds just 5,250.

A Sports Illustrated article from 1992 explains Jagr's deep understanding of European politics and history when it comes to Russia. His grandfather refused to work for communists when Czechoslovakia was taken over in 1948 and was put in jail for two years. Jagr, learning his history from his grandmother, ""admired"" Ronald Reagan and kept an American flag ""in his bedroom and two decals of Old Glory on the windshield of his car.""

The skater's #68 is in reference to the Prague Spring of 1968, both the year of his grandfather's passing and the time of uprising against communist authorities in Czechoslovakia.

The two-time Stanley Cup champion has played in at least one game per season since joining Kladno, purchasing shares in the team just days after his contract with the NHL's Calgary Flames ended in 2018, per CBS Sports.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jagr-substitutes-for-sick-team,2022-12-14
Carville says Greene 'dresses like white trash',"During an appearance on MSNBC, James Carville said that there is a ""staggering"" amount of ""white trashdom"" in the GOP, and that Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia ""dresses like white trash.""

Disgruntled lawmakers heckled President Joe Biden during parts of his State of the Union address on Tuesday, including when the president said that some Republicans would like Medicare and Social Security to ""sunset."" After Biden's remark, a chorus of disapproving lawmakers erupted. Greene yelled, ""Liar.""

Greene's outfit at the State of the Union was meant to evoke the idea of the Chinese spy balloon that the U.S. downed last week. The Hill reported that a spokesperson indicated the lawmaker ""wore her outfit to highlight something President Biden refused to address in his speech, the white Chinese spy balloon.""

""Biden refused to mention it, just like he refused to stop the intelligence gathering operation that traversed the United States and surveilled some of our most important military facilities in the country,"" Greene spokesperson Nick Dyer said, according to the outlet.

During a 2021 MSNBC appearance, Carville suggested that he holds the equivalent of a ""white trashology"" Ph.D. but that Greene and Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado could be the topic of a ""dissertation.""

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders delivered the Republican address to the nation on Tuesday after Biden's speech.

""President Biden is unwilling to defend our border, defend our skies, and defend our people. He is simply unfit to serve as commander in chief,"" she declared. She added, ""While you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day.""

"James Webb Space Telescope reveals stunning images of the universe, liberals lash out at 'homophobic telescope' and accuse NASA of memorializing 'queerphobia'","The first images from the James Webb Space Telescope were revealed on Tuesday. The unveiling of the first images from the largest and most advanced space telescope ever built was touted as ""revolutionary."" The James Webb Space Telescope captured the deepest and highest-resolution images ever taken of the universe. However, some liberals soured the spectacular achievement by disparaging the JWST as a ""homophobic telescope"" and accusing NASA of memorializing ""queerphobia.""

In 2002, NASA named the one-of-a-kind space telescope after former NASA administrator James Webb, who ran the fledgling space agency from 1961 to 1968 during the programs of Mercury, Gemini, and some of Apollo. Before NASA, Webb served as undersecretary of state in the U.S. Department of State during the Truman administration.

Critics accuse Webb of being complicit during the Lavender Scare – when government employees were fired for being gay in the 1950s and 1960s.



The Guardian reported, ""During Webb’s time as administrator, NASA employee Clifford Norton was fired in 1963 for 'immoral, indecent, and disgraceful conduct' after being interrogated on suspicion of homosexuality. Norton later successfully sued for wrongful dismissal.""

Current NASA administrator Bill Nelson said, ""We have found no evidence at this time that warrants changing the name of the James Webb Space Telescope.""

NASA press secretary Jackie McGuinness said, ""NASA's History Office conducted an exhaustive search through currently accessible archives on James Webb and his career. Our historians also talked to experts who previously researched this topic extensively. NASA found no evidence at this point that warrants changing the name of the telescope.""

Astrophysicist Hakeem Oluseyi declared in January 2021, ""Naming a flagship space observatory after Webb is a fitting recognition of his contributions to NASA science, even if he was just an administrator.""

""On the specific allegations against Webb, the evidence is clear,"" Oluseyi argued. ""He was not the initiator of the Lavender Scare and he was not in charge of investigating allegations of 'homosexuality' or deciding the fate of accused individuals.""

John Logsdon – a historian with George Washington University who knew Webb – told NPR, ""I don't think he took any particular actions that were unacceptable at the time. But in this new 'woke' world, they probably wouldn't be acceptable."" He noted that Webb was ""a product of the value system of his time.""

A petition was launched earlier this year demanding that NASA rename the James Webb Space Telescope. The petition has been signed by more than 1,700 people, who are mostly in the astronomy community.



The website INTO – a ""space for the queer community to talk openly"" – published an article titled: ""Homophobic Telescope Reveals First Hi-Res Images of Deep Space."" The article, which was republished on MSN, stated, ""But despite this remarkable achievement for science, the JWST continues to stand as a bitter reminder of our country’s willingness to tolerate and even memorialize queerphobia.""

Astrophysicist Lisa Harvey-Smith described Webb as ""a zealot who drove LGBT+ employees out of NASA, by all accounts.""

Astrophysicist Sarah Tuttle claimed, ""When your field is homophobic, not only does it actively harm people - it warps your science!""

Chanda Prescod-Weinstein – an assistant professor of physics at the University of New Hampshire who uses the self-description of queer/agender/woman/she – tweeted, ""As one of the people who has been leading to push to change the name, today feels bittersweet, I’m so excited for the new images and so angry at NASA HQ. NASA leadership has stubbornly refused to acknowledge that what is now public info about JW’s legacy means he does not merit having a great observatory named after him.""



Telescopes are often named after famous astronomers such as Edwin Hubble and Nobel laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. However, four astronomers want to rename the JWST as the Harriet Tubman Space Telescope because she ""almost certainly used the North Star"" to ""navigate her way to freedom.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/james-webb-space-telescope-controversy-name,2022-07-14
CNN host uses Democrat's own words to show how she is using double standard to defend Biden over classified docs,"CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota offered Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) an opportunity to be fair regarding criticism of politicians who mishandle classified documents.

But she declined to take it.

What is the background?

Last September, when the government had revealed the scope of Donald Trump's retention of classified documents, Jayapal demanded the full force of the law be used against the former president.

She even went so far as to claim that Trump ""stole"" the documents.

""Donald Trump stole classified documents,"" Jayapal said. ""He put not only our national security at risk, but the security and safety of our allies around the world. He must be held accountable to the full extent of the law.""

What did Jayapal say?

During an interview on ""CNN Newsroom,"" Camerota asked Jayapal about her tweet and whether she believes the same standard should be applied to President Joe Biden in light of classified documents being discovered in at least two areas private to him.

""Should President Biden be held to that same standard?"" the CNN anchor asked. ""Isn't it possible that President Biden is putting our national security at risk also?""

But immediately, Jayapal began to equivocate and defend Biden.

""I absolutely think that is why the Department of Justice has appointed the special counsel,"" she said.

""But again, I would just point to the fact that these documents so far that we know, what we know is that they were kept in a locked place. That was a very small number and I don't know how important these are, they might be incredibly important. They were marked top secret,"" she added. ""But the storage and the approach to this is completely different.""

Jayapal acknowledged that Biden's retention of classified documents is a ""political problem for all of us as Democrats."" But she tried to emphasize distinction between Biden's mishandling of classified information and Trump's. Biden, Jayapal claimed, is ""cooperating completely.""

However, she has no way of knowing that.

After all, the White House declined to disclose the discovery for more than two months, and when it finally admitted to the existence of classified documents inside Biden's private office, it refused to disclose the second batch of documents that had already been found at Biden's private residence.

Reporter dares ask Jean-Pierre about Joe Biden voicemail found on Hunter's laptop. But she immediately shuts down.,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was confronted Tuesday over a controversial voicemail that President Joe Biden left his son Hunter.

But Jean-Pierre made it clear that the White House is refusing to address the situation.

What is the background?

Newly revealed information from the infamous Hunter Biden laptop showed that Biden called his son to discuss a New York Times article that reported on Hunter Biden's business associations with a Chinese oil tycoon.

Biden said in the voicemail, according to the Daily Mail:

Hey pal, it's Dad, it's 8:15 on Wednesday night. If you get a chance, just give me a call. Nothing urgent. I just wanted to talk to you. I thought the article released online, it’s going to be printed tomorrow in the Times, was good. I think you’re clear. And anyway if you get a chance, give me a call, I love you.

The voicemail is noteworthy because it appears to contradict what President Biden has repeatedly claimed, namely that he was completely unaware and uninvolved with his son's overseas business dealings, which are the subject of a federal investigation.

What did Jean-Pierre say?

Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy confronted Jean-Pierre about the voicemail, highlighting the apparent contradiction the voicemail exposed.

""Why is there a voicemail of the President talking to his son about his overseas business dealings if the president has said he’s never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings?"" Doocy asked.

Confusingly, Jean-Pierre first responded that whatever Biden said ""is what stands"" before repeatedly dodging the question.

""Well, first, I’ll say that what the president said stands. So if he — if that’s what the president said, that is what stands,"" she said.

""He’s leaving a voicemail about a New York Times article concerning Hunter Biden’s business dealings. And it says, 'I think you're clear.' How is that not him talking to his son about his overseas business dealings?"" Doocy objected.

That is when Jean-Pierre completely shut down Doocy.

""We're not — from this podium, I am not going to talk about alleged materials from the laptop,"" the press secretary said. ""I will — I am not —""

""So are you disputing that it's the president's voice on the voicemail?"" Doocy interjected.

""I am not going to talk about alleged materials on a laptop. It’s not happening,"" Jean-Pierre said.

When Doocy asked again whether she was disputing that President Biden was behind the voicemail, Jean-Pierre referred Doocy to seek a response from Hunter Biden's representatives.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jean-pierre-joe-biden-voicemail,2022-07-06
Jean-Pierre snaps when reporter calls her out for giving 'non-answer' after he collapses her excuse for stonewalling,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre lost her cool on Wednesday when a reporter dismantled her reason for stonewalling reporters who ask about President Joe Biden's improper retention of classified documents.

What is the background?

As the Justice Department was investigating former President Donald Trump for retaining classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, Biden condemned his predecessor in an interview with ""60 Minutes.""

Biden said he was shocked that ""anyone could be that irresponsible.""

""Totally irresponsible,"" Biden said.

What happened with KJP?

The national press is growing increasingly frustrated with the Biden administration for not answering questions about the discovery of classified documents in Biden's private office and residence. The chief reason cited is the White House does not want to interfere with the Justice Department's investigation.

That is the exact point that Gray Television correspondent Jon Decker pressed after citing Biden's ""60 Minutes"" remarks.

""First of all, do you think it was proper for President Biden to comment on an ongoing DOJ investigation?"" he asked.

The question clearly frustrated Jean-Pierre. She refused to answer it and declared, ""I’m going to leave it there. Not going to go into it further.""

""I'm simply asking you to comment on the person that you work for — his comments,"" Decker responded.

""I just commented,"" Jean-Pierre protested.

""Well, it's not really a comment,"" Decker fired back.

The two continued to talk over one another — Jean-Pierre claiming she answered the question, Decker saying that she did not — as Jean-Pierre tried to call on another reporter.

""You gave a non-answer answer,"" Decker interjected.

""It's your opinion. It's your opinion. That is your opinion,"" Jean-Pierre pleaded.

01/18/23: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

Later, NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander called out Jean-Pierre for the runaround she has been giving reporters. In fact, the Justice Department has not directed the White House not to speak about the investigation, he said.

""We've all reached out to the Department of Justice,"" he explained. ""A law enforcement official tells NBC News the Justice Department has not told the White House that it cannot talk about the facts underlying the special counsel investigation into declassified documents.""

Fox News reporter Jacqui Heinrich highlighted the same endless circle. She told Jean-Pierre that the White House has orchestrated an ""information blackout"" in which she refers reporters to the Justice Department or White House counsel and each of those entities refer reporters to each other.

'I'm done!' WH press secretary loses it when reporter dares ask Dr. Fauci about COVID-19 origins — then another reporter steps in,"The White House daily press briefing spiraled out of control on Tuesday when a reporter dared ask Dr. Anthony Fauci whether he has investigated the origins of COVID-19.

What happened?

As Fauci and Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House COVID response coordinator, were answering questions at the press briefing, Daily Caller White House correspondent Diana Glebova attempted to ask Fauci what he has done to investigate the origins of the COVID pandemic.

Glebova shouted her question when Fauci finished answering a previous question, a routine practice when in a gaggle of reporters. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded by scolding Glebova.

""We have a process here. I'm not calling out on people who yell. You're being you're being disrespectful to your colleagues, and you're being disrespectful to our guest,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""I will not call on you if you yell. And also you're taking time off the clock, because Dr. Fauci has to leave in a couple of minutes.""



""I'm done!"" she exclaimed. ""I'm not getting to a back-and-forth with you.""

That is when Today Africa News correspondent Simon Ateba intervened on behalf of his colleague, blurting out that Glebova had asked a ""good question.""

""You need to call [on] people across the room! She has a valid question. She's asked about the origin of COVID,"" Ateba said.

""I hear the question ... but we're not doing this the way you want it. ... I'm done. Simon, I'm done with you right now,"" Jean-Pierre responded.

Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

Dr. Fauci is stepping down from his job as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden next month. He gave his final government briefing on Tuesday.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), however, has vowed that he will not stop investigating Fauci and the government's role in the COVID-19 pandemic — and whether the U.S. government engaged in gain-of-function research — after Fauci's government retirement.

Paul and other Republicans want to know whether NIAID grant funding of EcoHealth Alliance is connected to coronavirus research at the infamous Wuhan Institute of Virology.

Anything else?

Glebova responded to the incident by suggesting Jean-Pierre refused to call on her because of the nature of her question.

""I attempted to ask Fauci several times on what he personally did to demand answers into the origins of COVID-19. I always come with honest answers that Americans want to know,"" Glebova tweeted. ""That's why the White House refuses to call on me, and then calls ME 'disrespectful.'""

"Colorado school board denied reports that kids were hissing and barking as 'furries' in schools, but emails show it lied to smear parents","A school board in Colorado is in hot water for lying about the presence of ""furries"" in its schools and smearing parents complaining about the disruptive behavior.

Rumors that schools in Jefferson County were accommodating students dressing up like animals by providing litter boxes were squelched by a forceful statement from the board denying the story.

""There are no litter boxes in our buildings and students are not allowed to come to school in costume,"" read the statement. ""There are no furries or students identifying as such during the school day.""

While there was no substantiation of the claim that there were litter boxes in schools, the presence of ""furries"" was later confirmed in emails from administrators obtained by KCNC-TV. The report said there were at least two dozen parents who contacted administrators about students in costumes and referred to them as ""furries.""

Even worse, emails show the false statement was crafted in order to push a political agenda.

One email from Tara Pena, chief of family school and community partnerships, asked if it would be helpful to tie the complaints about furries to ""a larger, national political platform to further marginalize our transgender and lgbtq+ students.""

Darlene Edwards, a parent of one student, spoke to KCNC and said the behavior from the ""furry"" students was disrupting the education of her son, who is on the autism spectrum. She also said she was a Democrat and was frustrated that officials tried to politicize the issue instead of solving it.

""I have a niece that is lesbian she specifically said this is not an LGBTQ group,"" Edwards said. ""It's frustrating that it turned political rather than what's best for the kids at school.""

She added in frustration: ""Why are you trying to cover it up, rather than deal with it on the level it is?""

At least one school board member agreed with the sentiment.

""We can see in the emails our parents raised issues with it and I don't think we should be saying our parents are lying,"" said Susan Miller.

She added that enrollment in the district had dropped by 30,000 students and that most students were reading and doing math at grade levels below their own. Miller said lying about it to parents wasn't going to help administrators improve schools.

""I'm hoping we all learn from this and we can address the inconsistency and/or the communication breakdown in some way, shape or form so that our parents do believe that when they write to us… that we are responsive,"" she added.

KCNC asked Kimberly Eloe, executive director of communications for JeffCo Schools, to explain why the first statement on the issue accused parents of lying, but her response refused to address the question.

One school in Melbourne, Australia, reportedly allowed a student to identify as a cat and respond nonverbally in class as long as it wasn't a disruption to the other students.

Jeffrey Epstein victim claims to have blackmail videos,"An alleged victim of Jeffrey Epstein claimed that the disgraced financier recorded blackmail videos of wealthy associates, according to newly unsealed court documents.

The 2017 deposition from Epstein victim Sarah Ransome was released earlier this week – igniting new questions into the allegations of sexual abuse of underage girls. Ransome's deposition was taken for Virginia Giuffre's lawsuit filed against Ghislaine Maxwell.

Ransome was reportedly introduced to Epstein in late 2006 by one of his female associates who approached her at a club. Shortly after meeting Epstein, Ransome allegedly traveled to his infamous island in the U.S. Virgin Islands and one of his apartments in New York City.

Ransome claimed that she started receiving treatment from his psychiatrist.

""Jeffrey’s psychiatrist prescribed me lithium, Ritalin, and there’s a bipolar description drug that was also prescribed to me by Jeffrey Epstein’s psychiatrist,"" Ransome said in her deposition, according to Inside Edition. ""I can’t remember the exact name of that bipolar drug. But I was started off with lithium and Ritalin.""

Ransome said a side effect of the lithium was weight gain, which became an issue for Epstein. Maxwell ordered Ransome – who was a 5'8"" model – to keep her weight under 115 pounds.

""Weight was a massive issue for Ghislaine and Jeffrey, so the lithium just didn’t work for me. I mean, I put on weight quite quickly,"" Ransome said.

The weight restriction boiled over one night at Epstein's Little St. James island.

""I can’t remember the specific conversation, how it went. We got into an argument about my weight, quite a heated argument,"" Ransome remembered. ""I recall it getting overheated and that I ran off and tried to swim off the island. I wanted to get as far away from Jeffrey and Ghislaine as possible.""



A search party was assembled and Ransome was brought back to Epstein.

Ransome alleged that Epstein controlled how the women looked and dressed – he purchased all of the clothes and cosmetics.

Ransome said, “All of the outfits — there were clothes provided on the island by Jeffrey Epstein, which were all Victoria’s Secret clothing: bikinis, nightgowns.""



Victoria’s Secret was previously owned by Epstein’s former client and associate Les Wexner.

During her six months with Epstein, Ransome claimed that the convicted pedophile would record videos of his associates having sex with his stable of women. She asserted that Epstein recorded the tapes as ""blackmail.""

In newly unsealed emails, Ransome wrote, ""When my friend had sexual intercourse with [redacted] and [redacted], sex tapes were in fact filmed on each occasion by Jeffrey.""

""Thank God she managed to get ahold of some footage of the filmed sex tapes which clearly identify the faces of [redacted] and [redacted] having sexual intercourse with her,"" the email claimed. ""Frustratingly enough Epstein was not seen in any of the footage but he was clever like that.""



Ransome alleged in the email that her friend sent her footage of the threesome sex act. She also alleged that she backed up copies of the tapes on USB sticks and kept them hidden in multiple European locations. Ransome asserted that she told a single individual when the secret videos were located ""in case anything happens to me before the footage is released.""

She proclaimed, ""I will be more than willing to swear under oath and testify in court over these sex tapes.""

Ransome told the recipient of the email that the footage ""will break your heart into a million tiny pieces.""

The Daily Wire reported, ""It is unclear when this email was written, but it appears to have been written to New York Post reporter Maureen Callahan. In other emails from October 2016 to Callahan, Ransome claims that she had reached out to Russian authorities to publicize her story, that the U.S. government refused to help her, that her fiancee’s life was in danger, and seemed to suggest that the CIA had hacked her emails.""

Ransome alleged that her friend had gone to the police, but had been “humiliated.” She added that a redacted individual “heavily intimidated her, roughed her up."" Ransome said her friend was “1000% certain that the FBI did a cover-up” and that a redacted person had threatened to kill her if she went public with the allegations.

In an email sent to Callahan on Oct. 23, 2016, Ransome completely changed course and said she would ""like to retract everything I have said to you and walk away from this."" She ended her email by saying, ""I wish you the best of luck on catching Epstein and company.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-victim-blackmail-videos,2022-12-18
Jen Rubin gets hammered online for claiming a state can now 'execute' a woman who gets an abortion,"Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin was criticized and mocked online after she claimed that women could now be ""executed"" by a state after the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision.

Rubin tweeted her bizarre claim and was immediately lambasted for it.

""[A] state can now execute a woman for refusing to submit to a forced birth even if the 'abortion' is within hours of conception. barbarism,"" she tweeted Friday.

She added in a second tweet, ""senators cheering the decision are supporting states' power to criminalize all abortions in all situations. This is radical, inhumane and intolerable in a free society.""

Here's a sampling of the responses to Rubin's tweet:

""While I respect the enthusiasm you have thinking you can wish nonsense into existence, and I certainly hate to burst your crazy little bubble, but literally none of that is true,"" read one tweet.

""[I]t's wildly irresponsible for WaPo opinion writers, even less credible ones like Rubin, to spread this type of misinformation,"" responded Liz Wolfe of Reason.

""There’s something seriously wrong with you,"" replied radio talk host Jason Rantz.

Others pointed out that Rubin had previously argued against Democrats about elective abortions not being women's health.

Some just responded with confusion.

""What on God's earth are you talking about?"" said David Harsanyi of the Federalist.

Many pro-abortion supporters have taken to the streets Friday to protest against the decision by the Supreme Court to overturn federal abortion rights in the United States. Some Democrats have responded by saying they will ""defy"" the U.S. Supreme Court while others have come very close to calling for violence to meet their political goal of defending abortion rights.

Rubin has been touted by the Washington Post as their ""conservative"" columnist, but many on the right reject that identification given her constant haranguing and criticism of conservative politicians and policies.

Jennifer Rubin says the GOP has turned into a movement seeking to implement 'White Christian nationalism',"Washington Post opinion writer Jennifer Rubin asserted that the Republican Party has ceased to be a political party and has instead transformed into a movement committed to implementing ""White Christian nationalism.""

""People might be confused about how a Republican Party that once worried about government overreach now seeks to control medical care for transgender children and retaliate against a corporation for objecting to a bill targeting LGBTQ students. And why is it that the most ambitious Republicans are spending more time battling nonexistent critical race theory in schools than on health care or inflation?"" Rubin wrote.

""To explain this, one must acknowledge that the GOP is not a political party anymore. It is a movement dedicated to imposing White Christian nationalism,"" she continued.

Conservatives oppose radical leftist gender ideology and the concepts of critical race theory, and they do not want schools to foist these ideas on kids.

Rubin claimed that white Christians in the U.S. desire to cling to political power.



""The media blandly describes the GOP’s obsessions as 'culture wars,' but that suggests there is another side seeking to impose its views on others,"" Rubin wrote. ""In reality, only one side is repudiating pluralistic democracy — White, Christian and mainly rural Americans who are becoming a minority group and want to maintain their political power.""

""The MAGA crowd is offended by any attempt to identify the ongoing reality of systemic racism (evident, for example, in the criminal justice system, maternal health care, housing discrimination and gerrymandering to reduce minority voting power). The notion that institutions they refuse to reform perpetuate racism is a sort of moral challenge to their claim to be 'colorblind.' Perhaps it is simply self-interested blindness,"" she wrote.

Rubin also said that white U.S. Christians who view themselves as victims suffer from ""moral confusion.""

""Our political problems are significant, but they are minor compared with the moral confusion that is afflicting the millions of White Christian Americans who consider themselves victims. Left unaddressed, this will smother calls for empathy, tolerance and justice,"" she declared.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jennifer-rubin-white-christian-nationalism,2022-04-28
"Fox News host tussles with Lindsey Graham over 'terrible tactics, terrible timing' of abortion law announcement","Fox News host Jesse Watters confronted Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) over the odd timing of his abortion bill announcement.

What is the background?

On Tuesday, Graham held a press conference in which he introduced a new bill that would institute a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The bill includes exceptions for rape, incest, or to protect the physical life of the mother.

Oddly, Graham chose to announce his bill on the same day that Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers showed that core inflation accelerated in August, the same month that President Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act. Even worse, the Biden administration chose Tuesday to celebrate the Inflation Reduction Act.

The moment was thus one that Republicans could have seized to highlight that inflation is only getting worse under Biden's leadership.

At the same time, the 2022 midterm elections are less than two months away. Republican lawmakers, therefore, were left wondering why Graham chose this time to announce legislation that could further galvanize Democratic voters angry over Roe v. Wade being overturned.

What happened with Watters?

Graham and Watters engaged in a fiery exchange in which Graham defended his timing and Watters repeatedly pointed out that it was ""not great timing.""

""Why'd you do it on that day? Not great timing — don't you see that?"" Watters asked.

""I am proudly pro-life, and I have no apology for being pro-life. There's no bad time to defend the unborn,"" Graham responded, explaining he needed to respond to Democrats seeking to nationalize ""abortion on demand.""

""I am not going to sit on the sidelines,"" Graham added.

""No one is saying you need to sit on the sidelines, but yesterday wasn’t the day to do that,"" Watters interjected. ""Yesterday was the day they lost all momentum when this inflation thing punched them right in the face, and you gave them an out. A lot of people don’t like that. You could have done it on any other day, just like you could have delayed the whole press conference like Joe should have delayed that stupid party.""

There is no bad time to defend the unborn: Sen Lindsey Graham www.youtube.com

Graham, however, refused to apologize for the timing of his announcement, citing the need for Republicans to be ""on the offensive.""

Watters agreed with the substance of Graham's points, but knocked him for poor political ""tactics.""

""It's terrible timing, terrible tactics,"" Watters said. ""We could have shoved this down their throat on the day Americans got hammered with the inflation number and the market crashing and now all the media and the Democrats are talking about, 'Federal abortion ban! Federal abortion ban!' You know that's not smart politics, right?""



The Republican senator, however, was stalwart in defending the timing of his announcement.

""If not now, when? If not me, who?"" Graham said.

""I respect your opinion. But like I said: Timing is off and timing is everything,"" Watters responded. ""I'm just talking raw politics, brass tactics.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jesse-watters-lindsey-graham-abortion-bill,2022-09-15
"JetBlue won't hire unvaxxed because of safety concerns but hired felon to fly planes who was convicted of violent attack – investigators discovered knives, handcuffs, and a shovel in vehicle","JetBlue faced outrage from some employees and customers for hiring a violent felon to fly planes while refusing to hire individuals who have not been vaccinated for COVID, the Daily Wire reported.



The airline cited its commitment to ""safety"" as the reason employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID before beginning training. Last year, the company stated that the policy was implemented due to the Biden administration's vaccine mandate. However, the government's order was never enforced after it was blocked by an injunction.

In October, the injunction was lifted, but the administration decided to hold off on enforcing the measure. Despite that, JetBlue continues not to hire unvaccinated individuals.

""Every decision JetBlue has made throughout the pandemic has been with our safety value front and center,"" the company's job applications stated. ""Whether it's requiring masks, or many of the other health and safety protocols we've had to navigate during the pandemic, all of these efforts have been focused on making the workplace and air travel safer for you and our Customers. As part of our commitment to health and safety, COVID-19 vaccines are required for all JetBlue employees. New hire employees must be fully vaccinated prior to the start of training.""

Two JetBlue pilots, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Daily Wire that, while the airline refuses to hire the unvaccinated, it recently hired a violent felon to fly planes.

According to the pilots, JetBlue hired John Perrys, who was released from prison in 2014 after serving nine years for breaking into a judge's home and attacking her daughter. Perrys is on felony probation for the assault until 2044, according to the Florida Department of Corrections.

The Associated Press reported that during Perrys' arrest, investigators searched his vehicle and discovered knives, handcuffs, a parachute cord, a shovel, gloves, glass cutters, pepper spray, and a mask.

Perrys, an Air Force pilot at the time of the incident, was charged with burglary and assault with a deadly weapon while wearing a mask. Perrys allegedly entered the judge's home and beat her daughter, his former fiancée, with a metal baton as she stepped out of the shower.

According to the victim, Perrys also had a Taser but did not use it. The victim was able to run from the house and get help from a neighbor, the AP reported.

""Apparently JetBlue won't hire unvaccinated pilots, but they will hire violent convicted felons to fly their airplanes,"" one pilot told the Daily Wire.

One of the pilots stated that Perrys was being trained to fly the Airbus A320, but ""several instructors have refused to train him. Many captains have told management they'll refuse to fly with him.""

The second pilot said that Perrys is ""on the line as a flying pilot in control of a plane with up to two hundred paying and oblivious souls on board.""

NRA board member schools CNN's Jim Acosta in fiery interview on gun control: 'Isn't this blood on your hands?',"National Rifle Association board member Judge Phillip Journey schooled CNN host Jim Acosta on Sunday during a tense conversation about gun control.

Over the course of the lengthy interview, which spanned multiple gun-related topics, Acosta repeatedly interrupted Journey, refused to allow him to finish speaking, and blamed shooting massacres on the NRA.

'Blood on NRA's hands'

Acosta began the interview by asking Journey whether the NRA is culpable for mass shootings, claiming the NRA works to block gun safety laws.

""Isn't some of this blood on the NRA's hands?"" Acosta asked.

When Journey responded that the NRA and other pro-gun organizations have, in fact, worked to support commonsense, bipartisan legislation on firearms, Acosta accused Journey of saying ""things that just aren't true."" Acosta did not explain how Journey's remarks were false, but asked again, ""Isn't this blood on your hands?""

""I'm not the one that pulled the trigger and neither are the members of the National Rifle Association,"" Journey fired back.

""I think Buffalo is a great example where the alarms were going off in New York and all the officials did was hit the snooze button. He could have easily been processed through care and treatment action. He was a danger to himself or others. He'd already threatened mass shooting prior and nobody did anything until that,"" Journey explained.

It's all about AR-15s

After playing video of children from Uvalde, Texas, saying they're scared to return to school, Acosta asked Journey if people are allowed to bring AR-15s into his courtroom.

Journey is a judge in Kansas, but it's not clear how the question was related to the discussion. Most, if not all, courthouses in America prohibit people from entering with firearms.

""Can people bring in AR-15 into your courtroom?"" Acosta asked four times as he talked over Journey.

When Journey finally answered, ""Well, of course not,"" Acosta followed up, ""Why not?"" But before Journey could respond, Acosta moved the discussion along without allowing Journey to speak.

""Why do people need an AR-15 anyway?"" Acosta then asked.

That is when Journey took Acosta to school, pointing out that gun control advocates target the AR-15 because it is a scary-looking firearm. Journey also exposed the inconsistencies with the assault weapons ban of 1994, which focused on cosmetic features of firearms. An AR-15, after all, by function is no different from any other semi-automatic firearm.

""You know, it's just a semi-automatic rifle,"" Journey told Acosta.

""You know, if you want to be prejudiced about the way it looks, but I was aware of what happened in the '94 semi-automatic firearms ban, and there were rifles of similar function that just didn't look as ugly, they weren't black guns like a Mini 14, a Ruger Mini 14, and of course the Ruger Mini 14 was appropriate and the AR-15 was not,"" he continued.

After repeatedly stressing the Uvade killer legally purchased the firearms used in the crime, Journey attempted to introduce nuance into the discussion. But Acosta was having none of it.

Acosta ended the interview by telling Journey his ""way"" — focusing on mental health, ensuring the system catches potential mass killers before they act, and passing commonsense laws — ""doesn't work,"" claimed AR-15s are ""used to hunt people,"" and told Journey he needs to investigate his soul.

""I'm sorry to say it that way, sir, but you and your other board members need to look into your souls and see what can be done for these kids,"" Acosta said. ""These kids who keep dying over and over again. Over and over again.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jim-acosta-nra-board-member-gun-control,2022-05-31
Jimmy Kimmel admits that making anti-Trump jokes caused his show's ratings to drop: 'I have lost half of my fans — maybe more than that',"On Thursday, late-night television host Jimmy Kimmel admitted that he lost at least half of his fanbase after he made jokes about former President Donald Trump.



Kimmel appeared as a guest on an episode of the podcast ""Naked Lunch,"" hosted by Phil Rosenthal and David Wild, where he discussed his comedy and talk show host career.

Kimmel said he hopes he will still be hosting television when ""Trump goes to jail.""

When Rosenthal asked if the network ever asked him to be more politically neutral with his comedy, Kimmel replied that at one point, ABC had ""hinted"" he should refrain from disproportionately making anti-Trump jokes on the air.

""I have lost half of my fans — maybe more than that,"" Kimmel noted.

He added, ""10 years ago among Republicans, I was the most popular talk show host.""

Kimmel told the network that he was unwilling to stop making fun of Trump, even if it meant losing his show.

""I just said, 'If that's what you want to do, I understand and I don't begrudge you for it, but I'm not going to do that,'"" the comedian stated. ""If you want somebody else to host the show, then that's fine. That's OK with me. I'm just not going to do it like that.""

Kimmel noted that he knew the decision would cost him fans and hurt the show's ratings but that he is ""proud"" to be a part of a group of late-night television comedians who speak out against Trump.

He noted that ""there's a sacrifice you make when it comes to your audience, and you could do pretty well if you just stayed down the middle.""

ABC backed off on the request and allowed him to continue making jokes against Trump because the network knew his refusal was ""serious,"" Kimmel stated.

""I couldn't live with myself [otherwise],"" the comedian continued. ""I love this country too. That flag doesn't belong to them. This is ours. And when I see somebody coming in and ruining it I'm going to say something about it.""

Rosenthal told Kimmel that his jokes about Trump are a ""public service"" because ""people feel comforted knowing they're not alone.""

Kimmel's show first aired in 2003, and the talk show host recently signed a three-year extension with ABC. However, the ratings of the show and other similar late-night shows have dropped substantially in the last several years.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jimmy-kimmel-admits-that-making-anti-trump-jokes-caused-his-show-s-ratings-to-drop-i-have-lost-half-of-my-fans-maybe-more-than-that,2022-11-04
Joe Rogan calls out leftist billionaire George Soros: 'It's like he wants these cities to fall apart. He wants crime to flourish.',"Joe Rogan suggested on his podcast this week that the wanton violence and seeming lawlessness in various American cities may not be accidental, but rather by design.

The podcaster told former CIA agent Mike Baker on a recent episode of the ""Joe Rogan Experience"" that leftist billionaire George Soros, 92, ""wants crime to flourish"" and ""funds corrosion.""

After discussing disgraced former FTX CEO and Democrat megadonor Sam Bankman-Fried's legal woes, Rogan and Baker broached the subject of the social fallout generated by Democrats' top donor, whom Baker deemed a ""vampire.""

Rogan noted that he had spoken to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott about George Soros and that Abbott explained the billionaire's modus operandi, particularly as it regards exerting influence over American law and politics.

""It's f***ing terrifying,"" said Rogan. ""He donates money to [someone] very progressive, very leftist — whether it's a DA or whatever politician — and then funds someone who's even further left than them to go against them, and just keeps moving it along.""

""He's playing like a global game ... and he enjoys doing it,"" Rogan added.

TheBlaze reported this week on revelations that Soros' nonprofit system, the Soros Network, has funneled nearly $21 billion into left-leaning politics since 2000.

Open Secrets indicated that Soros was the ""top individual super PAC donor for the 2022 midterm election,"" having contributed at least $126 million to leftist super PACS in the last election cycle.

The Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund indicated in a recent report that, as of June 2022, the U.S. had ""at least 75 Soros-Backed social justice prosecutors, supported through campaign dollars and/or Soros-funded progressive infrastructure groups.""

The LELDF report claimed that in 2021, the 75 Soros-backed ""social justice prosecutors"" who now represent ""1 in 5 Americans or more than 72 million people"" oversaw ""more than 40% (9,000+) of the approximately 22,500 homicides in the US occurred in areas.""

The report further alleged that ""these prosecutors' charging and plea deal decisions, sentencing recommendations, and trial strategies"" have been a major part of the perpetuation of and rise in crime in the cities they oversee.

Among Soros' beneficiaries is Philadelphia's impeached Democrat District Attorney Larry Krasner, whom the state's House Select Committee on Restoring Law and Order accused of contributing ""to a catastrophic rise in violent crime at the expense of public safety.""

Baker responded to Rogan, saying, ""[Soros] understood early on where you wanted to seize power.""

The former CIA agent intimated that it is a popular misconception that senators or similar politicians are the most influential power-brokers. Instead, ""it's the DAs and it's the state-level politicians. That's where real change occurs and where things can happen.""

Rogan interjected, suggesting it is at this level of politics — where Soros appears most engaged — where ""real corrosion"" can have a significant impact.

""That's what's scary: It seems like he funds corrosion. It's like he wants these cities to fall apart. He wants crime to flourish,"" said Rogan. ""It's almost like he's an evil person in a Batman movie.""

In an apparent effort to bolster the villain claim, Baker noted that Soros ""made his real fortune by almost busting the bank of England. ... He's not out there for truth and justice.""

Facing criticism over his alleged hand in destabilizing American cities, Soros penned an opinion piece in July displacing blame.

In the piece, he claimed that recent crime spikes in Democrat-controlled cities weren't the result of his beneficiaries' failures but of ""a disturbing rise in mental illness among young people ... a pullback in policing in the wake of public criminal justice reform protests, and increases in gun trafficking.""

Joe Rogan reveals which Republican he thinks would be a 'good president' in 2024,"Joe Rogan is a fan of Ron DeSantis and thinks the Florida governor would make a good president.

The podcast giant shared his thoughts on 2024 with actress Gina Carano on Tuesday's episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience.""

“So all this stuff is happening while we have a dead man as a president,” Rogan said, deriding President Joe Biden.

“Are you throwing out any support towards anyone or are you gonna hold off?” Carano asked about the impending 2024 presidential election. ""Didn’t Elon Musk come out recently for DeSantis?”

She was referring to billionaire and lifelong Democratic voter Elon Musk's recent admission that he's leaning toward DeSantis as a prospective 2024 Republican presidential candidate.



Though DeSantis is not currently running and publicly has said he's focused on winning re-election in 2022, Rogan liked the idea of the Florida governor challenging Biden in 2024.

“I think Ron DeSantis would work as a good president,” Rogan told Carano. “I mean, what he’s done for Florida has been admirable.”

“I feel like I’m doing breaking news right now that wasn’t even on purpose,” Carano said in reply, laughing.

Rogan then praised DeSantis' leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic.



“I feel like what he did for Florida, a lot of people gave him a lot of grief, but ultimately he was correct,” Rogan said. “He was correct when it comes to like deaths, he was correct. And when it comes to protecting all vulnerable populations, he was correct in terms of distribution of monoclonal antibodies.

“He was furious when the government tried to pull those, they were trying to pull very effective treatments. You know, he is not perfect. He’s a human being, but, um, what he’s done is stand up for freedoms,” he added.

“People think that, that this was some weird gaslighting shit that went on where people equated freedom and saying the word freedom to like right-wing bigotry and hate is so strange,” Rogan said.



DeSantis rose to national prominence in 2020 largely because of his steadfast refusal to impose statewide mask mandates or enforce shutdowns in response to the pandemic. Democrats and mainstream journalists accused the Republican governor of putting people in danger, but DeSantis ignored them and fought back against false media narratives, winning widespread approval among Republican voters.

His stock has risen so high that in a recent New Hampshire poll of GOP primary voters, DeSantis led former President Donald Trump 39% to 37% in the first-in-the-nation primary state.

Joe Rogan says he's refused to have Trump on his podcast many times: 'I’m not interested in helping him',"Joe Rogan said that he was given many opportunities to interview former President Donald Trump and refused because he didn't want to help him.

Rogan made the comments while being interviewed on Lex Fridman's podcast.

“The Trump era is also going to be one of the weirder times,” Rogan said.

“When people look back historically about the division in this country, he’s such a polarizing figure that so many people felt like they could abandon their own ethics and morals and principles just to attack him and anybody who supports him because he is an existential threat to democracy itself,"" he added.

Rogan went on to say he believes Trump will run again in 2024 before making the admission about his show.

“By the way, I’m not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form. I’ve had the opportunity to have him on my show more than once — I’ve said no, every time,"" Rogan continued. ""I don’t want to help him. I’m not interested in helping him.”

When Fridman tried to press Rogan on whether he'd ever have Trump on his podcast based on other people he let on his show, Rogan persisted.

Rogan also mocked Biden when he spoke about the possibility of Trump running against him.

""He’s running against a dead man, you know? I mean, Biden shakes hands with people that aren’t even there when he gets off stage. I think he’s seeing ghosts. You see him on Jimmy Kimmel the other day? He was just rambling,"" he added.

Rogan's show, the “The Joe Rogan Experience,” is one of the most popular and successful podcasts in broadcasting history despite protests by many on the left who object to politically incorrect statements he's made.

"Anti-woke, anti-cancel culture comic John Cleese to debut show on TV channel one critic calls the 'British Fox News'","Monty Python's John Cleese — a legendary comic who's become an outspoken opponent of woke culture and cancel culture in recent years — is debuting a TV show in 2023 on a United Kingdom channel that one critic has called the ""British Fox News.""

What are the details?

Cleese's new show on GB News will be a collaboration with satirist Andrew Doyle that will encourage ""proper argument,"" BBC News reported. Doyle hosts ""Free Speech Nation"" on the channel, which launched last year, the network said.

Cleese warned GB News watchers that they ""may not be used to hearing the sort of things I'll be saying.""

Former GB News chairman Andrew Neil told the BBC last year, via the Guardian, that one of the reasons he exited the network was because he didn't want to be a “minority of one” at a “British Fox News.”

Cleese apparently doesn't feel similarly about GB News.

""I was approached [about the new show], and I didn't know who they were,"" Cleese told BBC News. ""I don't know much about modern television because I've pretty much given up on it — English television.""

Cleese further explained that he then ""met one or two of the people concerned and had a dinner with them, and I liked them very much. And what they said was, 'People say it's a right-wing channel, [but] it's a free-speech channel.'""

GB News launched in June 2021, BBC News said, becoming the U.K.'s first TV news start-up in 30 years.

As for any possibility of returning to the BBC in the future — ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" and Cleese's ""Fawlty Towers"" comedy series are both BBC properties — Cleese told the network, ""Not on your nelly.""

Why? ""Because I wouldn't get five minutes into the first show before I'd been canceled or censored,"" he told BBC News.

What else has Cleese been up to?

In July, Cleese told an audience at the FreedomFest conference in Las Vegas that ""woke attitudes"" are having a ""disastrous effect"" on comedy and that he has seen writers and comics censoring themselves over fear of getting canceled.

In November 2021, Cleese actually canceled himself from a speaking gig at Cambridge University after he learned that an art historian at the school had been canceled over an impersonation of Adolf Hitler that reportedly offended students.

In 2020, Cleese ripped keyboard leftists, refusing to bow to them in the wake of their ""transphobia"" accusations after he signed a letter of solidarity with author J.K. Rowling, who herself has come under fire for statements challenging transgenderism.

""I hope they fry in their own sanctimoniousness and narcissistic posturing,"" Cleese said of the woke mob. ""Until they get a sense of perspective, that is.""

Way back in 2016, Cleese declared that political correctness would lead to a ""1984"" society and cautioned against hypersensitivity to anything and everything deemed hurtful and offensive.

""All humor is critical. If we start saying, 'Oh, we mustn’t criticize or offend them,' then humor is gone, and with humor goes a sense of proportion — and then, as far as I’m concerned, you’re living in '1984,'"" Cleese said in a video, referring to George Orwell's classic dystopian novel. ""So the idea that you have to be protected from any kind of uncomfortable emotion is one I absolutely do not subscribe to.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/john-cleese-to-debut-show-on-british-fox-news,2022-10-11
Sen. John Fetterman suddenly hospitalized after 'feeling lightheaded' during retreat for Senate Democrats,"Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) was hospitalized on Wednesday while attending a retreat for Senate Democrats, his office announced.

""Towards the end of the Senate Democratic retreat today, Senator John Fetterman began feeling lightheaded,"" said Joe Calvello, communications director for Fetterman's office.

""He left and called his staff, who picked him up and drove him to the George Washington University Hospital,"" Calvello said.

Calvello explained that initial testing ""did not show evidence of a new stroke,"" but he added that doctors would continue to run tests and Fetterman would be held at the hospital overnight. The freshman senator is ""in good spirits and talking with his staff and family,"" Calvello said.

Fetterman's health became a contentious issue last year after he suffered a stroke that nearly killed him. His campaign refused to address concerns related to his health, and Fetterman refused to provide Pennsylvanians with transparency about his health, such as releasing medical records, showing that he was fit to serve in the Senate.

Moreover, the tragic impacts of his stoke remain obvious, the Associated Press reported last November:

Fetterman still suffers from auditory processing disorder — a stroke’s common aftereffect — that could require him to use closed-captioning in hearings, meetings and debates. It also could possibly limit his ability to engage in the common practice of giving interviews to reporters in Senate corridors.

Still, Fetterman's physician, Dr. Clifford Chen, said in a one-page letter last October that Fetterman is fit to serve.

""Overall, Lt. Gov. Fetterman is well and shows strong commitment to maintaining good fitness and health practices,"" Chen said. ""He has no work restrictions and can work full duty in public office.""

But it was later revealed that Dr. Chen is a donor to Democrats and even donated money to Fetterman's campaign.

Joliet Pride invites children to bring dollar bills to 'tip the performers' at all-ages drag show in Illinois,"A PrideFest event in Joliet, Illinois, advertised for children to bring dollar bills to ""tip the performers"" at an all ages drag show.

A screenshot of the advertisement was posted to Twitter by the popular social media account Libs of TikTok. Followers of the account immediately responded with scorn for the event planned for September 17.

The group appeared to delete the post from Facebook and replace it with a different version that didn't include the text about bringing dollar bills.

Profits from the event are going to fund Joliet PrideFest's outreach efforts, including ""Joliet PrideFest free, the LGBTQ+ Youth Drop-in Center, Youth Queer Prom.""

In April, the group organized an LGBTQ prom for high schoolers and included a drag show at that event as well.

The EventBrite invitation for the event showed the ""Family Friendly Drag Show"" was still scheduled for 5 to 7:30 p.m. while the ""PrideFest AfterDark Leather and Lace"" show was scheduled to start only half an hour later.

The Libs of TikTok account has exposed countless inappropriate drag shows and other extreme posts by members of the far left on social media. As a result, the account has been targeted by the news media and big tech companies, but it has been able to keep its online presence.

On Monday, the account was able to shut down a drag show promoted as a ""Back to School"" event for children in the city of Pocatello in southeast Idaho. The Southeastern-Idaho Pride posted on its Facebook page that it cancelled the show for security reasons.

""The event as planned was a G rated theatrical review, by all 18+ performers,"" their post read. ""However, due to the misinterpretation of marketing materials, and to mitigate the harm to our LGBTQ+ community, we feel it is best to not proceed with this performance.""

Here's more protests against children drag shows:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/joliet-pride-child-drag-show,2022-09-14
NBA player Jonathan Isaac touts faith as the reason he stood during league-wide BLM protests: 'The love of Jesus Christ is what is ultimately going to heal this world',"Orlando Magic forward Jonathan Isaac garnered widespread attention and scrutiny in 2020 when he chose to stand for the national anthem before games — even as every other member of his team knelt while wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts.

For Isaac, an outspoken Christian, to kneel would be to throw support behind a movement that could not ultimately heal the nation's growing racial divide, or any other fundamental human problem, for that matter. The only thing that can do that is the love of Jesus Christ as displayed in his death and resurrection.

That's the message Isaac has been sharing again this week ahead of the launch of his new book, ""Why I Stand,"" published by Daily Wire Books.

In several promotional media appearances this week, Isaac has sought to encourage others to seek answers for their pain and source the strength to stand through the gospel message.

Speaking on Saturday at the ReAwaken America Tour, Isaac said recalled how his faith motivated him to take a different approach amid immense pressure to kneel in support of Black Lives Matter.

""Around the time, that George Floyd had tragically died ... I tried my best to see it in the right way,"" Isaac told the crowd at the conference in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. ""I didn't view it as an African-American. I didn’t view it as a conservative. I didn’t view it as a liberal. I tried my best to combat the message from a Christian perspective. I tried to see it the way Christ would see it.""

""What I didn’t want to do in that moment was join into a fight by kneeling for the National Anthem. Obviously, the fight between black and white, the fight between right and left, and everything that was going on. I wanted to view it in the way that Christ would,"" he continued.

He went on to say: ""Around that time, my pastor had preached a message. The message was about when Jesus was about to be taken by the Roman Guard, and Peter lunged forward and chopped off the man's ear, and Jesus stopped him, and he said, 'Those that live by the sword, will die by the sword.' And, ultimately that Jesus had a greater plan. So, I decided to stand. It wasn't entirely about the flag. It was just that moment of saying, 'I believe that the love of Jesus Christ is what is ultimately going to heal this world because it is what has healed me.'""

The NBA player similarly told Fox News host Will Cain this week that ""the love of Jesus Christ and the gospel"" is the ""greatest message and antidote"" for the problems the world is facing.

Then, in an interview with the Daily Wire ahead of his book's release, Isaac explained that ""to kneel and wear a Black Lives Matter T-shirt don't go hand in hand with the support of black lives.""

Isaac, who has also rankled many on the left over his refusal to get the COVID-19 vaccine, also articulated how his faith in Jesus has freed him to stand firm in the face of cultural pressure.

A summary of ""Why I Stand"" on Amazon describes the book as the telling of Isaac's ""discovery that no matter your level of confidence today, God’s strength will develop in your weakness"" and ""that courage is found in trusting that God is greater than your fears.""

In a statement responding to Isaac's most recent public comments, the Orlando Magic said, ""Jonathan is a thoughtful young man with tremendous faith who has done great work in the community and is using his platform to express his voice.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jonathan-isaac-faith-jesus-why-i-stand,2022-05-16
"Jordan Peterson ordered to enter 're-education' program in Canada over his comments, speech that 'may cause harm.' He's refusing to comply.","Jordan Peterson has been ordered by a Canadian psychology governing body to enter what Peterson called a ""re-education"" program reportedly over his past comments and speech that ""may cause harm.""

Not surprisingly, Peterson said Wednesday he ""formally indicated"" his ""refusal to comply"" with the demands of the College of Psychologists of Ontario.

What are the details?

Peterson posted to Twitter parts of a document from the College of Psychologists of Ontario that outlined its concern over his ""public statements made on social media and during a January 25, 2022, podcast appearance"" that ""may have lacked professionalism.""

The document indicates that Peterson is to work with another professional to “review, reflect on, and ameliorate [his] professionalism in public statements"" and complete a ""Coaching Program.""

Peterson's stated refusal to comply could result in discipline for professional misconduct, according the document's language.

What's the background?

According to a Wall Street Journal op-ed, the College of Psychologists of Ontario last March appointed an investigator to examine complaints about Peterson’s Twitter comments as well as things he said on a Joe Rogan podcast.

The Journal — citing images provided by Peterson — said the College’s panel in November ruled that ""the comments at issue appear to undermine the public trust in the profession as a whole, and raise questions about your ability to carry out your responsibilities as a psychologist.”

More from the Journal:

What are these comments? Calling Elliot Page, the transgender actor, by his former name, “Ellen,” and the pronoun “her,” on Twitter. Calling an adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a “prik.” A sarcastic crack at antigrowth environmentalists for not caring that their energy policies lead to more deaths of poor Third World children.



Calling a former client “vindictive.” Objecting to a Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover of a plus-size model: “Sorry. Not Beautiful. And no amount of authoritarian tolerance is going to change that.” In Canada even offenses begin with “sorry.”

The Journal added that the panel found “the impact risk in this case is significant"" since Peterson's comments “may cause harm"" — and decided that coaching Peterson would help “mitigate any risks to the public.”

The College of Psychologists of Ontario declined to comment on the case, citing confidentiality, the Journal reported.

What did Peterson have to say?

“Who exactly was harmed, how, when, to what degree, and how was that harm measured?” Peterson asked, according the the Journal.

Peterson also posted a Twitter thread telling the College of Psychologists of Ontario that he's ""making what is happening public. If the public believes I'm guilty then I will take the required course of communication and then resign.""

He added to the College that if its ""allegations ... are revealed publicly to be both baseless and politically motivated then a public apology and the resignation of everyone involved in the process on your side is appropriate.""

""Let the games begin,"" he tweeted.

Peterson also appeared to take a page from Twitter owner Elon Musk's playbook, setting up a poll so the public can weigh in and side with Peterson or with the College.

Twitter reinstated Peterson to the platform in November. He had been banned in July for ""hateful conduct"" regarding tweets mentioning Page.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/jordan-peterson-ordered-to-enter-re-education-program-in-canada-over-his-comments-speech-that-may-cause-harm-hes-refusing-to-comply,2023-01-05
"'You sons of b***hes': Jordan Peterson refuses to bend the knee to 'toxic' Twitter, says he'd 'rather die' than delete tweet about transgender actor Elliot Page","Jordan Peterson faces a permanent ban on Twitter if he does not delete a tweet about transgender actor Elliot Page. The professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Toronto proclaimed that he would ""rather die"" than conform to Twitter's rules and delete the tweet in question.

Peterson's tweet posted on June 22 read: ""Remember when pride was a sin? And Ellen Page just had her breasts removed by a criminal physician.""

In the tweet, Peterson linked to an article titled: ""Elliot Page is ‘proud’ to introduce trans character on ‘Umbrella Academy.’""

The article highlighted a new Netflix show ""Umbrella Academy,"" where Page's character switches genders – much like the transgender actor did in 2020.

""The Rubin Report"" host Dave Rubin posted a screenshot of Peterson's tweet with the caption: ""The insanity continues at Twitter. @jordanbpeterson has been suspended for this tweet about Ellen Page. He just told me he will 'never' delete the tweet. Paging @elonmusk.""

Twitter said Peterson's tweet violated rules against hateful conduct.



Twitter’s hateful conduct policy states that users may not ""promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.""

""We recognize that if people experience abuse on Twitter, it can jeopardize their ability to express themselves,"" the policy notes. ""Research has shown that some groups of people are disproportionately targeted with abuse online. This includes; women, people of color, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual individuals, marginalized and historically underrepresented communities. For those who identify with multiple underrepresented groups, abuse may be more common, more severe in nature and more harmful.""

""We are committed to combating abuse motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance, particularly abuse that seeks to silence the voices of those who have been historically marginalized,"" Twitter adds. ""For this reason, we prohibit behavior that targets individuals or groups with abuse based on their perceived membership in a protected category.""

Twitter suspended Peterson's account, and would not reinstate the account until he deleted the post about the transgender actor.

Peterson's daughter, Mikhalia Peterson, said Twitter is ""definitely not a free speech platform at the moment.""

The best-selling author defiantly responded to his Twitter suspension in a 14-minute-long YouTube video, during the diatribe he said he would not bend the knee to the ""toxic"" ""rat-hole"" social media platform.

“I’ve essentially been banned from Twitter as a consequence,"" Peterson said. ""I say ‘banned’ although technically I’ve been suspended. But the suspension will not be lifted unless I delete the hateful tweet in question, and I would rather die than do that. Hopefully, it will not come to that, although who the hell knows in these increasingly strange days.""

""Since Twitter did not do me the favor of actually specifying my crime – and there are many possibilities on that front – we, unfortunately, have to guess at why this has occurred,"" Peterson said. ""And that's actually a big problem in and of itself and also indicative of the utter carelessness of the Twitter organization with regard to the propriety of its own censorial actions.""

""I should at least know exactly what I did wrong if I'm required to acknowledge that my tweet violated the Twitter rules,"" he lashed out. ""What rules you sons of bitches? Exactly? Precisely? Because such things matter when the accusations start flying.""

Peterson explained, ""I don't regard pride as a virtue, it has been classically regarded as a sin.""

He questioned why it is called ""Pride Month"" and is not called ""LGBT+ month, or whatever else alphabet acronym which is currently insisted upon as the only acceptable enlightened terminology.""

Peterson theorized that referring to Elliot Page as her previous name ""Ellen Page"" was likely what got his Twitter account suspended.

""I committed the fatal crime of what has come to be known in the appalling censorial terminology of the insane activists as 'deadnaming,' which is the act of referring to someone who has transitioned – another hated piece of jargon and slogan –by the name and by the inference, the gender, really the sex, that everyone knew them by previously,"" he stated.

Peterson continued his rant, ""And how can I describe the fact that someone who was once a woman and really still is had her breasts cut off because she/he/they/their/they had fallen prey to a viciously harmful fad, without using the appropriate sex link pronoun and the real name of the real person to whom this was really done with his her their voluntary but unfortunate acquiescence.""



Peterson declared, ""I'm not taking down that tweet or acknowledging that my tweet violated the Twitter rules.""

""Up yours, woke moralists. We'll see who cancels who,"" he blasted. ""Twitter's a rat-hole in the final analysis. And I have probably contributed to that while trying to use, understand, and master that horrible, toxic platform.""

""It's a relief, in some real sense, to be banned,"" Peterson concluded. ""And I regard that under the present conditions as a badge of honor.""

Twitter Ban www.youtube.com

Similarly, the satirical news website Babylon Bee was suspended from Twitter in March. The Babylon Bee was also suspended for ""hateful conduct"" for writing, ""The Babylon Bee's Man Of The Year Is Rachel Levine.""

Levine – who is transgender – was named President Joe Biden's assistant secretary of health at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 2021.

Babylon Bee CEO Seth Dillon proclaimed, ""We're not deleting anything. Truth is not hate speech. If the cost of telling the truth is the loss of our Twitter account, then so be it.""

Journalist rips tennis legend Novak Djokovic as 'anti-vax posterboy' — then gets blasted right back by Djokovic's wife for 'hatred and bullying',"A tennis journalist ripped Novak Djokovic as an ""anti-vax posterboy"" soon after the superstar player captured his fourth-straight Wimbledon singles title Sunday — after which Djokovic's wife hopped on Twitter to defend her husband and blast Ben Rothenberg for ""hatred and bullying.""

What's the background?

Djokovic was deported from Australia earlier this year due to his unvaccinated status, ESPN said, preventing him from competing in the Australian Open, a tournament he's won a record nine times.

The Serbian player had been granted a vaccine exemption by Tennis Australia, the country's governing body for the sport, and the the Victoria state government also approved his exemption. But the national government and the Australian Border Force overruled Djokovic's exemption and refused to sponsor his visa — and he was stopped at the Australian border and held in a room guarded by police after landing in Melbourne.

Following his Wimbledon victory Sunday, Djokovic said he won't get the COVID-19 vaccination that will allow him to enter the U.S. and play in the U.S. Open tournament, scheduled to begin at the end of August.

""I'm not vaccinated, and I'm not planning to get vaccinated, so the only good news I can have is them removing the mandated green vaccine card or whatever you call it to enter United States or exemption,"" Djokovic said, according to ESPN. ""I don't know. I don't think exemption is realistically possible. If that is possibility, I don't know what exemption would be about. I don't know. I don't have much answers there.""

'Anti-vax posterboy'

With that, Rothenberg — senior editor of Racquet magazine — called Djokovic an ""anti-vax posterboy.""

""Unless there is a swift change in US immigration law, #Wimbledon will be Djokovic’s last Grand Slam event of the year,"" Rothenberg tweeted. ""US requires vaccination for foreigners to enter, and Djokovic has firmly said he has ruled out getting vaccinated, entrenching himself as an anti-vax posterboy.""

Uh-oh

Well, Djokovic's wife didn't take kindly to the slight and hopped on Twitter to hit back at Rothenberg.

""Excuse me,"" Jelena Djokovic told the journalist. ""Just making sure that it is noted that YOU tagged him as antivax poster boy for whatever reason you have. He simply responded [to] what HIS body choice is.""

A few minutes later, Rothenberg tried to explain himself: ""I understand that it's his choice, but I also am saying that his decision to be so firmly against the vaccines that it limits his ability to play tournaments has made him, unwittingly or not, into a huge icon of the anti-vax movement. I saw this very clearly during Australia.""

Mrs. Djokovic wasn't buying it: ""You are creating a very judgmental narrative that fits your agenda. He is simply choosing what’s best for his body. If he is not playing because of making that choice, he is fine with it.""

""I can accept judgmental,"" Rothenberg replied. ""I believe every citizen, especially public figures, had a duty to act responsibly with public health actions and messaging during the pandemic, and as someone who has covered Novak as the influential champion he is, he repeatedly disappointed me deeply.""



Jelena Djokovic finished up things by calling out Rothenberg with sarcasm: ""Thank you for sharing your beliefs. I hope you don’t get judged for them. Or become a poster boy for hatred and bullying. You never know. You are also influential figure, please don’t continuously disappoint. Unless that’s your role.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/journalist-calls-djokovic-antivax-posterboy,2022-07-11
GOP Rep. Byron Donalds refuses to back down when MSNBC's Joy Reid questions his ability to lead,"Republican Rep. Byron Donalds (Fla.) shot down MSNBC host Joy Reid on Tuesday for diminishing his accomplishments and reducing him to a mere ""diversity"" pick for House speaker.

What is the background?

A faction of 20 Republicans who opposed Rep. Kevin McCarthy's speakership bid briefly coalesced around Donalds for speaker. Across several ballots, Donalds earned 20 votes. Had he won the speakership, Donalds would have been the first black House speaker.

But Democrats have attacked Donalds, who is conservative. Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), for instance, called him a mere ""prop"" who sides with white supremacy.

What happened?

During a lengthy interview in which Reid repeatedly interrupted Donalds, the MSNBC host suggested that Republicans only supported Donalds to bolster their diversity push.

""Do you not believe that the idea was to make a diversity statement by nominating you?"" Reid asked.

Donalds, just a two-term congressman, fiercely pushed back.

""That was not the idea, because I was in the room when the decision was made by people who chose to nominate me,"" Donalds said.

""The reality is that a lot of members actually do believe in my ability to lead. They do,"" he continued. ""Am I to be despised for my youth because I served one term when members know I have the ability to engage other members? Listen, we were at an impasse in our speakership elections. We got that done. Kevin McCarthy is now speaker of the House. At the same time, I was working with members on both sides of our conference to make sure that we can get the job done, and we did. That's the only thing that matters.""

GOP Rep. Byron Donalds and Joy Reid debate his House speaker nomination after one term youtu.be

Reid premised her inquiry by questioning Donalds' ""qualifications"" for leadership. When Donalds told Reid his history of serving in leadership at the state level, she questioned his knowledge about the role of House speaker.

The motive for Reid's condescending questions was to criticize the Republican Party for not being as demographically diverse as the Democratic Party.

""I don't know that you said it, but [Republican] members have said is they wanted to highlight the diversity of the conference. There are four African-American members in the House caucus, the Republican caucus. There are 56 members in the Democratic caucus,"" Reid said.

""So just — it's more diverse,"" she gleefully declared.

"Juan Williams defends Biden for attacking Republicans as 'semi-fascists,' then Karl Rove uses Biden's own words to refute him","Karl Rove and Juan Williams clashed on Sunday over President Joe Biden's harsh condemnation of Americans who support former President Donald Trump.

What is the background?

Speaking at a political rally last week, Biden claimed that ""MAGA Republicans"" are committed ""to destroying America.""

""The MAGA Republicans don’t just threaten our personal rights and economic security, they’re a threat to our very democracy,"" Biden charged. ""They refuse to accept the will of the people. They embrace political violence. They don’t believe in democracy.""

Biden also told attendees at a Democratic National Committee event that adherents to ""MAGA philosophy"" are embracing ""semi-fascism.""

""What we’re seeing now is either the beginning or the death knell of an extreme MAGA philosophy. It’s not just Trump,"" Biden said. ""It’s the entire philosophy that underpins — I’m going say something — it’s almost like semi-fascism, the way in which it deals.""

What happened between Rove and Williams?

Williams tried to defend Biden's accusations by noting they came after Jan. 6, suggesting that the context of Trump's refusal to accept the 2020 election results and the subsequent U.S. Capitol riot are justification for Biden's remarks.

""I think if people behave that way, then they can expect to be called semi-fascist — fascists — because it’s anti-democratic action,"" Williams said. ""You are acting against the Constitution of these United States,"" William said. ""I think, and without being dramatic, that’s how democracy dies. They were trying to undermine, to subvert this Constitution.""

Williams reinforced his position by pointing to Biden purportedly differentiating between ""conservative Republicans"" and ""MAGA Republicans.""

Rove, however, did not buy it and rebutted Williams' defense by using Biden's own words from his inaugural presidential address to prove Biden is dividing America — not healing it.

""He was not talking about the people who assaulted the Capitol. He was attacking the entire party,"" Rove corrected ""This was not in keeping with what the president promised us.""



Rove then proceeded to recite Biden's words.

""'My whole soul is in it,' he said in his inaugural, 'bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation.' That was after Jan. 6,"" Rove noted. ""'We must see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors. We should treat each other with dignity and respect.' He was not treating his political opponents with dignity and respect.""

Williams immediately took umbrage with Rove.

""But Karl,"" Williams interjected, ""he clearly, clearly was speaking to — he said clearly 'I'm not talking about conservative Republicans.'""

""No, he didn't say that,"" Rove fired back. ""Those words never passed his lips.""

So who is right?

The transcript of Biden's remarks show that Rove is right and Biden did not say he was not referring to ""conservative Republicans.""

In his DNC speech, Biden condemned Maryland gubernatorial Republican nominee Dan Cox — who is Trump-endorsed — as ""a MAGA Republican"" and someone who ""is not a traditional conservative Republican.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/juan-williams-karl-rove-biden-semi-fascists,2022-08-29
Judge shuts down gun rights activist's attempt to shed light on Hunter Biden's alleged gun crimes,"A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit seeking records from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives related to its 2018 investigation into how President Joe Biden's son Hunter may have committed gun felonies.

In a ruling last Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, found that while the public interest in whether the ATF failed to enforce the law against Hunter Biden is ""significant,"" it did not outweigh Biden's ""substantial"" privacy interest in the matter.

""Hunter Biden has a substantial privacy interest, and the public interest is also significant,"" Contreras wrote in a 24-page opinion shared by AmmoLand. ""But the balance is not deadlocked.""



The records request was filed by David Codrea, a gun rights activist and blogger for AmmoLand. It concerned ATF's handling of a 2018 case first reported by TheBlaze, in which a gun belonging to Hunter Biden was allegedly thrown in a trash can.

Politico corroborated TheBlaze's report in a March 2021 article detailing how in 2018, Biden's late brother's wife, Hallie Biden, allegedly found his .38-caliber handgun in his truck, disposed of the gun in a trash bin outside of Janssen's Market, and later went to retrieve the weapon only to find it was missing, according to a Deleware State Police report. Hallie Biden was dating her brother-in-law Hunter at the time.

The gun was found by a man who regularly rummaged through the grocery store's trash and returned to authorities days later, Politico reported. The outlet added that Secret Service agents had allegedly visited the store where Hunter Biden purchased the weapon and requested the purchase records, but the owner refused to provide them, saying the matter was under the ATF's jurisdiction. ATF agents later visited the store to inspect the records, according to Politico.

ATF has denied both involvement and even awareness of the incident.



A copy of the purchase records reviewed by Politico and referenced in the court records showed that Hunter Biden checked a box saying he was not at the time a user of, or addicted to, narcotics. His disclosure on the form contradicted statements he and his family members have made openly acknowledging how he struggled with drug addiction for years.

Lying about the illegal use of narcotics and other controlled substances on a federal firearms transaction record is a felony offense. But no charges were ever brought against Biden.

Codrea sued for ATF records that would provide insight into why the agency did not charge Biden, despite his public statements regarding his drug use.

However, Contreras said Biden's public statements did not diminish his privacy interest in the matter.

“Disclosure would reveal whether Hunter Biden was criminally investigated by ATF,” the judge wrote. “An individual’s public disclosure of information that could be potentially incriminating in a general sense does not reduce his privacy interest in whether he was the subject of a particular federal criminal investigation by a particular agency.”

The judge added that text messages obtained from an FBI-seized laptop purportedly belonging to Biden, in which he reportedly discussed the handgun incident and a police investigation, did not diminish his privacy interests either.



""The Court is skeptical that one’s private texts can so easily be repurposed into public acknowledgment of a criminal investigation,” the judge wrote.

The court also rejected arguments that Biden's relationship to his father, the president, weighed negatively when balancing his privacy interests against the public interest.

“The Court is not aware of any case law holding that a private citizen like Hunter Biden loses a sense of personal privacy for purposes of [a Freedom of Information Act exemption] merely by being related to a prominent public official,” Contreras ruled.

Codrea said he would not appeal the decision, writing in a blog post that his lawyer advised they were unlikely to succeed.



""Seriously, what did we expect? We were never under any illusion that we had a magic bullet. But we had to try for no reason other than to once more expose how the most in-your-face outrages get a pass when people have the right connections,"" Codrea wrote.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/judge-rejects-hunter-biden-records-atf,2022-09-19
"Teachers exempt from Freedom of Information Act, court rules – experts warn parents should be concerned about public school transparency","Earlier this month, Michigan's Oakland County Circuit Court ruled that schoolteachers are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the ruling raises concerns over public school transparency.



Judge Jacob James Cunningham determined on December 15 that public school teachers are exempt from producing school-related documents in response to FOIA requests because they are not considered ""public bodies"" and, therefore, their documents are not considered ""public records.""

On March 14, Mackinac Center Legal Foundation filed a lawsuit against the Rochester Community Schools district on behalf of Carol Beth Litkouhi, a parent with children enrolled at a school in the district.

Litkouhi argued that the district has refused to provide her with certain course materials for the class ""History of Ethnic and Gender Studies,"" thereby violating FOIA law.

""It is incredibly disappointing that the district continues to refuse to be transparent and has stonewalled my efforts to learn more about what is being taught in the classroom,"" Litkouhi stated.

According to the lawsuit, the district requested that Litkouhi pay a $419 deposit to receive certain materials she asked for via a FOIA request. Litkouhi claimed that the district provided her with some documents, including a unit plan and an icebreaker assignment, but all the other materials she requested were denied.

The district argued that some of the documents were copyrighted material and that others did not exist.

""Schools must make curricula available to parents under Michigan law,"" said Steve Delie, director of open government and transparency at the Mackinac Center. ""Despite this, Rochester schools has repeatedly failed to fulfill this legal obligation. It shouldn't take months of back and forth, hundreds of dollars and a lawsuit just to see what is being taught in your community.""

Experts told the DCNF that parents should be concerned about how the court's ruling will affect transparency in Michigan school systems.

Trent England, the founder of the Electoral College advocacy group Save Our States, told the DCNF that the Michigan court's ruling was ""an insult to parents."" He claimed that public schools ""have something to hide"" when educators are not ""subject to open government laws.""

""Virtual learning during COVID brought unprecedented transparency to public schools, revealing the radical political agenda being pushed in some classrooms,"" England stated. ""That led to outrage and a demand for school choice, so it's no surprise school administrators are fighting to get back into the shadows. But it's disappointing that a judge would do their dirty work.""

""The standard could go further than impacting transparency in the classroom and could potentially exclude local government officials, university faculty, or other state employees from being subject to the Freedom of Information Act,"" Holly Wetzel, director of public relations at the Mackinac Center, told the DCNF. ""This would severely restrict taxpayer's ability to keep government transparent and hold it accountable.""

Wetzel argued that the ruling ""should be extremely concerning to anyone who is paying attention to transparency efforts across the state.""

National Archives issues response to Trump's claim that Obama took 30 million pages of documents from the White House,"The U.S. National Archives responded to a claim made by former President Donald Trump that former President Barack Obama had taken 30 million pages of documents from the White House.

Trump made the claim while defending himself after the FBI performed a search warrant at his residence in Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday.

Ahead of the release of the warrant on Friday, Trump assailed the FBI and implied that Obama had committed far worse offenses.

""What happened to the 30 million pages of documents taken from the White House to Chicago by Barack Hussein Obama?"" wrote Trump. ""He refused to give them back! What is going on? This act was strongly at odds with NARA. Will they be breaking into Obama's 'mansion' in Martha's Vineyard?""

A statement from the National Archives addressed Trump's claims.

""NARA moved approximately 30 million pages of unclassified records to a NARA facility in the Chicago area where they are maintained exclusively by NARA,"" the archives wrote.

""Additionally, NARA maintains the classified Obama Presidential records in a NARA facility in the Washington, DC, area,"" the statement continued. ""As required by the PRA, former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.""

The warrant was unsealed by a U.S. federal judge and revealed what was taken by the FBI at Trump's residence. The list of items taken from the residence lists 11 sets of classified documents, and several documents listed as ""top secret."" The warrant also indicated that Trump was being investigated for a potential violation of the Espionage Act.

The search at Trump's residence was conducted on Monday morning and was confirmed by the former president in a scathing statement he released later that evening. The former president's supporters have accused the FBI of being politically motivated, but his critics hailed the development as being long overdue.

After facing criticism about the raid, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced on Thursday that he had signed off on the search warrant and said that the Department of Justice would ask a federal judge to unseal the order.

The former president then released a statement declaring that he would not fight the unsealing of the search warrant but would actively seek for it to be unsealed.

Defenders of the former president argue the power of the president to declassify any documents exonerates him, but critics say there is a process to declassify those documents that the former president didn't appear to follow.

Judge releases 'habitual violent offender' on $2 bail for allegedly kidnapping and beating woman. Police say he committed another crime after release.,"A man with a violent criminal history was given $2 bail for allegedly kidnapping and beating a woman he was dating, and many are expressing their outrage online.

42-year-old Aubrey Taylor was arrested in December and charged with aggravated kidnapping and assault of a woman he was dating.

Prosecutors asked for a high bail amount, but 232nd Criminal District Court Judge Josh Hill refused the request and instead ordered a bond of only $1 per charge. The suspect was released with an ankle monitor and ordered to be on 24/7 house arrest.

Taylor was then arrested only two days later for violating the bond after he allegedly threatened the same woman with a gun.

Crime victim advocates were outraged at the judge's order based on the fact that Taylor was a repeat offender. Andy Kahan of Crime Stoppers documented his criminal past.

""Career habitual violent offender who's got eight felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions for assault, has been to prison twice for robbery,"" said Kahan.

Kahan believes that Judge Hill, a Democrat, issued the low bond in protest of a new state law signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott that forbade the use of cash bonds in violent crimes and crimes of a sexual nature.

Taylor was given a $45,000 bond for the kidnapping charge and $15,000 for the assault charge after he allegedly violated the first bail.

Among those expressing their outrage at the low bond was Abbott.

""Repeat offender accused of beating woman gets $1 bond,"" he tweeted. ""Horrific. Texans must feel safe in their communities. This session, we will eliminate the easy bail policies that allow dangerous criminals back onto our streets.""

Taylor is due back in court on Wednesday.

Here's a local news report about the shocking bail amount:

"Judicial Watch sues Secret Service for records on investigation of Hunter Biden's gun, which sources say was tossed in a Delaware trash can in 2018","Judicial Watch said Tuesday it filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for Secret Service records related to the investigation surrounding Hunter Biden’s infamous gun.

What's the background?

Two years ago, TheBlaze was the first to report that Hallie Biden — widow of President Joe Biden's son Beau — in October 2018 took Hunter Biden's handgun from his vehicle without his knowledge and placed it in a garbage can outside a Delaware supermarket, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.

But after a subsequent search, the gun couldn't be found, the source said. And after law enforcement was contacted and both Hunter Biden and Hallie Biden were questioned, the source said no arrests were made and no charges were filed.

Delaware State Police told TheBlaze the case was referred for a decision on prosecution to the Delaware Department of Justice, which didn't immediately return TheBlaze's request for comment on this case.

In addition, the source also said agents from the Secret Service as well as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives visited the shop where Hunter Biden purchased the gun prior to any report being filed.

What are the details about the Judicial Watch suit?

Judicial Watch said its lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after the Secret Service failed to respond adequately to a March 25, 2021, FOIA request for records or communications about the reported purchase, possession, and disposal of Biden's gun.

The conservative outfit said it's investigating whether and how the Secret Service intervened for Hunter Biden.



What else happened during the Hunter Biden gun incident?

The source added to TheBlaze that after she disposed of the gun, Hallie Biden — who was in a relationship with Hunter Biden at the the time — contacted Hunter Biden and told him what she did, and Hunter Biden told her to go back and get the gun. But upon attempting that, she couldn't find the gun, the source told TheBlaze.

When Hunter Biden arrived at the supermarket, he told law enforcement the gun was purchased earlier in October, he used it for target practice, and he kept it in his vehicle instead of Hallie Biden's house so it was not near her children, the source with knowledge said.

The source added to TheBlaze that when Hunter Biden was asked by law enforcement whether he had contacted anyone about this incident, he asked if that meant his father, Joe Biden, and then said, ""I have never called my dad for anything"" and that he always handled his own affairs.

The source also said the ATF during its visit to the shop asked the owner for the file on Hunter Biden's gun purchase and that a copy was provided. In addition, the source said Secret Service agents also visited the shop prior to any report being filed and that they needed to find the gun.

It was not immediately clear why the Secret Service would properly have been involved in the investigation since Hunter Biden's last day of Secret Service protection was July 8, 2014.

Politico corroborated TheBlaze's report in a March 2021 article noting that two people — one of whom has firsthand knowledge of the episode and the other of whom was briefed by a Secret Service agent after the fact — said Secret Service agents asked the store owner for paperwork involving Hunter Biden's gun sale, but the owner refused, saying the matter was under the ATF's jurisdiction.

A man who regularly rummaged through the grocery store's trash found the gun and returned to authorities days later, Politico reported.

What else did Judicial Watch say?

“The Secret Service and the Biden administration apparently are in cover-up mode for Hunter Biden. Whether its Hunter Biden’s laptop, his business practices and travel, or these documents related to the careless disposal of a gun in a dumpster near a high school, this administration continues to put up unlawful roadblocks to any effort to investigate the activities of the Biden family, particularly Hunter,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said.

A different lawsuit is rejected

TheBlaze on Monday reported that a federal judge rejected a lawsuit seeking records from the ATF related to its investigation into how Hunter Biden may have committed gun felonies.

U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, last week ruled that while the public interest in whether the ATF failed to enforce the law against Hunter Biden is ""significant,"" it did not outweigh Biden's ""substantial"" privacy interest in the matter.

""Hunter Biden has a substantial privacy interest, and the public interest is also significant,"" Contreras wrote in a 24-page opinion shared by AmmoLand. ""But the balance is not deadlocked.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/judicial-watch-sues-secret-service-for-hunter-biden-gun-investigation-records,2022-09-21
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson argues constitutional amendments not 'race-neutral' or 'race-blind',"Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson claimed the framers of the ""Reconstruction Amendments"" did not intend for them to be ""race-neutral,"" that is, color-blind.

What did she say?

During oral arguments in Merrill v. Milligan, Jackson used ""progressive originalist"" methodology to refute assertions of ""color-blind"" remedies to questions of voter discrimination.

The case centers on Alabama's redistricting map, in which lawmakers gerrymandered districts in such a way that only one is majority black. Under the proposed map, black residents have control over just 14% of the state's congressional districts despite being roughly 27% of the state population.

At issue is whether Alabama's ""race-blind"" approach to drawing congressional districts ultimately discriminates against minority voters.

After hearing arguments from Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour, Jackson asserted that the entire point of the Reconstruction Amendments — the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments — was to provide a race-based legal remedy to problems that former slave states otherwise refused to adopt.

""I don’t think we can assume that just because race is taken into account that that necessarily creates an equal protection problem,"" the justice said.

Jackson explained that after she analyzed the justification of the framers of the post-Civil War constitutional amendments, ""it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted the Equal Protection Clause, the 14th, the 15th Amendment, in a race-conscious way.""

""That we were, in fact, trying to ensure that people who had been discriminated against — the Freedman, during the Reconstruction period — were actually brought equal to everyone else in society,"" she said.



To support her thesis, Jackson cited the Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which was drafted by the same lawmakers who wrote the 14th Amendment. The report provides the legal rationale for the constitutional protections deemed necessary after slavery.

""That report says that the entire point of the amendment was to secure rights of the freed former slaves,"" she explained. ""The legislator who introduced that amendment said that ‘unless the Constitution should restrain them, those states will all, I fear, keep up this discrimination and crush to death the hated Freedman.’ That’s not a race-neutral or race-blind idea in terms of the remedy.""

Going even further, Jackson noted that one purpose for adopting the 14th Amendment was to provide a legal basis for the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which ""specifically stated that citizens would have the same civil rights as enjoyed by white citizens. That’s the point of that act, to ensure that the other citizens, the black citizens, would have the same as the white citizens.""

How will the court rule?

It's too early to tell. But as Vox noted, even the court's conservative-leaning justices seemed skeptical of many of LaCour's arguments. The news outlet actually suggested that Brett Kavanaugh may side with his liberal-leaning colleagues, given the questions he asked.

Still, Alabama is likely to prevail — albeit with a narrow, not broad, victory.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/justice-jackson-constitutional-amendments-not-race-neutral,2022-10-05
Kamala Harris refuses to answer question when reporter confronts her over who pays for student loan debt forgiveness,"Vice President Kamala Harris refused to address a question about President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan on Monday.

Instead, she regurgitated the administration’s trite narrative.

What happened?

While on the tarmac after she traveled to see the since-scrubbed launch of Artemis 1, a reporter asked Harris how the administration expects to pay for Biden's plan.

""Who specifically is footing the bill for student loan forgiveness?"" the Fox News journalist asked. ""We haven't gotten a concrete answer from the administration yet.""

Instead of offering any explanation of how the program will be financed, Harris simply began reciting administration talking points defending the program.

""Well, let's start with this. First of all, a lot of the same people who are criticizing what we rightly did in following through on a commitment that we made to forgive student loan debt are the same people who voted for a tax cut for the richest Americans,"" Harris began.

""So, when we look at who is benefiting from this, 90% of the people who are going to benefit from student loan forgiveness make under $75,000 a year,"" she continued. ""And that debt has been the reason that they're unable to start a family, buy a home, and pursue their piece of the American dream.""

Harris claimed critics of the plan voted to give a ""tax cut"" to the ""richest Americans.""

But as TheBlaze reported, numerous Democrats competing in tight elections ahead of the midterms openly criticized Biden's plan last week, suggesting the issue is not one Democrats believe will curry favor with moderate voters.

Meanwhile, Harris' claim about Americans who earn less than $75,000 is also overblown.

First, Penn Wharton found that ""about 75% of the benefit [is] accruing to households making $88,000 or less."" Second, the median individual income in America is roughly $67,500. Thus it would make sense that the majority of debt forgiveness would benefit individuals who earn less than $75,000.

So who is paying?

That question remains unanswered.

Last Friday, a top White House official told reporters the administration views the plan as ""fully paid for"" by $1.7 trillion in deficit reduction that is attributed to pandemic-related spending that has since dissipated.

But that deficit reduction was always going to happen, with or without Biden. The administration, therefore, has not offered a serious answer to the question.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-plan,2022-08-30
Kari Lake is 'not a fan' of DeSantis sending illegal immigrants to Martha's Vineyard. She would go farther to secure the border,"Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake had a contrarian take for a Republican on the news that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) sent two planes full of illegal immigrants to Martha's Vineyard as part of his state's plan to relocate migrants to sanctuary cities.

Appearing on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Wednesday, Lake said that while it's fun to watch Democratic officials complain that sanctuary cities like New York and Chicago are turning into ""unofficial border towns,"" illegal immigrants should be deported, not transported into the U.S. at taxpayer expense.



""I actually, I get a kick out of it, watching these liberal mayors just, you know, throw their hands up and say, 'We can't handle it,' because it's life every day for us in these border states,"" Lake told Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

""However, I'm not a fan of it, Tucker,"" she added. ""I mean, we're just taking people here illegally who shouldn't be here. We're moving them further inland.""

Fox News first reported Wednesday that DeSantis had sent two planes full of migrants to the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, a popular summer vacation spot for affluent Americans. DeSantis spokeswoman Taryn Fenske said the migrants were relocated as part of a $12 million program approved by the Florida legislature to remove illegal immigrants from the state.

The actions by DeSantis follow those of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), who since April have bused thousands of illegal immigrants to Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C.

Lake, who is running against Democrat Katie Hobbs to succeed Ducey, said that as governor her priority would be to stop migrants and human and drug traffickers from entering Arizona in the first place. She drew a distinction between herself and other Republicans including DeSantis, who campaigned for her in April. Lake's plan is to declare an ""invasion"" at the southern border, which she argues would grant Arizona constitutional authority to use National Guard troops to secure the border.

Border-state Republican governors Abbott and Ducey have faced pressure from conservatives to make such a declaration in their respective states, but so far have refused to do so. Immigration attorneys have derided the idea as a political stunt that is sure to face lawsuits and probable defeat at the U.S. Supreme Court, which has previously ruled states cannot set immigration policy. Abbott acknowledged in April that state law enforcement officials who attempt to deport illegal immigrants could be prosecuted under federal law.

There is also debate over whether the border crisis meets the definition of an ""invasion."" More than 1 million migrants have been admitted into the U.S. temporarily by President Joe Biden as they apply for asylum, the New York Times reported. Immigrant activists say asylum-seekers presenting themselves at the border are not a hostile, invading force and that constitutional powers meant for use against a foreign army do not apply to the border crisis. Conservatives like Lake argue that violent drug cartels trafficking human beings and deadly drugs like fentanyl over the border need to be treated like foreign invaders to be stopped.



""My plan is the most aggressive plan on the border. We're going to secure the border. We're going to call it what it is, issue a declaration of invasion on day one,"" Lake told Carlson. ""Get troops on the border in the form of our National Guard. We're going to stop people from coming over. And we're going to stop the cartels from having control of our border.""

Kari Lake sat during Super Bowl black national anthem,"Kari Lake was apparently sitting down at the Super Bowl during the song ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" which is commonly called the black national anthem.

""The @NFL played two different 'National Anthems' tonight. Someone just sent me a photo of @KariLake sitting during the first one,"" Benny Johnson tweeted when sharing a photo of Lake.

""I'm just here for THE National Anthem,"" Lake replied.

""I'm against a 'black National Anthem' for the same reason I am against a 'white National Anthem,' a 'gay National Anthem,' a 'straight National Anthem,' a 'Jewish National Anthem,' a 'Christian National Anthem,' and so on,"" Lake noted in a statement, according to Fox News Digital. ""We are ONE NATION, under God. Francis Scott Key's words ring true for every single American Citizen regardless of their skin color. James Weldon Johnson's 'Lift Your Voice' is a beautiful song, but it is not our National Anthem.""

Lake expressed support for comments posted by Zeek Arkham, who tweeted, ""My 'black' National Anthem is the same anthem I've been singing since I was a child. The same one children of all races have been singing. My National Anthem never needed a color. Do they want racism to die, or do they want to keep finding ways to divide us all?""

""I love this,"" Lake noted when retweeting Arkham.

Lake, who lost Arizona's 2022 gubernatorial contest to Democrat Katie Hobbs, is slated to speak at CPAC's Ronald Reagan Dinner next month.

Lake has claimed that she did not lose the governor's race: ""I didn't lose. I won. They stole this,"" she said.

White House press secretary can't answer if Biden administration colluded with big tech,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was dumbfounded when asked about the Biden administration's alleged collusion with big tech.

High-ranking officials in the Biden administration worked hand in hand with influential social media companies to censor content that was deemed ""misinformation,"" according to emails revealed this week. The government identified ""examples of problematic content,"" and social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter would remove the posts, said the emails obtained in a lawsuit by Republican attorneys general Erich Schmitt of Missouri and Jeff Landry of Louisiana.

The big tech companies would engage in ""regular chats"" with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to identify and remove so-called ""misinformation.""

The lawsuit stated that “dozens of federal officials across at least eleven federal agencies"" engaged in a ""massive, sprawling federal 'Censorship Enterprise,;"" with the ""intent and effect of pressuring social-media platforms to censor and suppress private speech that federal officials disfavor.""



Schmitt said, ""Beyond DOJ, Meta identified 32 additional federal officials including White House Officials who communicated with them, and YouTube identified 11 federal officials including White House Officials who communicated with them, many of whom were not disclosed by DOJ.""

On Friday, Fox Business White House correspondent Edward Lawrence asked Jean-Pierre, ""On social media companies, did the administration give Twitter and Facebook talking points over flagging what the president describes as misinformation?""

As she thumbed through her notes at the podium, the perplexed Jean-Pierre instructed Lawrence to repeat his question, ""Say that one more time.""

Lawrence reiterated, ""Has the administration helped Twitter and Facebook with talking points about what the administration believes is misinformation or how much coordination is there between the administration and social media companies?""



Jean-Pierre couldn't answer the question.

""So, I–I–I don’t have anything to share with you on that. I’m not going to comment on that right at this time,"" the White House press secretary said during the briefing.

The reporter added, ""The attorneys general from Missouri and Louisiana say there's a 'vast censorship enterprise across a multitude of agencies.'""

Jean-Pierre cut off Lawrence and said, ""I'm just not going to comment at this time.""

It was a difficult week for Jean-Pierre.

The White House press secretary was befuddled by a question about unvaccinated migrants and Tennis superstar Novak Djokovic from Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy. Legacy media reporters called out Jean-Pierre for saying that President Joe Biden's prime-time speech wouldn't be ""political."" She was accused of spreading revisionist history regarding former President Donald Trump wanting to close schools during the pandemic. Jean-Pierre called MAGA Republicans such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis an ""extreme threat to democracy, and called Trump supporters ""fascists.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/karine-jean-pierre-big-tech-collusion,2022-09-03
Karine Jean-Pierre dodges abortion question by Peter Doocy,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to answer a very simple question about abortion from Peter Doocy. Instead of answering the question, she spent two minutes deflecting and attacking Republicans.

During Friday's White House press conference, Doocy simply asked Jeane-Pierre, ""Does President Biden favor any limits on abortion?""

Instead of answering the straightforward question, Jean-Pierre berated Republicans for their stances on abortion – which are already known.

""We've been very, very clear here,"" Jean-Pierre responded without answering the question.

She then pivoted to the bill introduced by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) earlier this month that would implement a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The bill includes exceptions for rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother.

Jean-Pierre said the national ban after 15 weeks ""takes us backwards"" and ""put at risk the health of women.""

Jean-Pierre then pivoted to the Democratic talking point that Republicans will quash gay marriage rights, contraceptive access, and privacy rights if abortion is banned.

Biden's mouthpiece said, ""I'm not gonna get into specifics here.""

Doocy shot back, ""Why not get into specifics?""

The Fox News White House correspondent then followed up, ""The Republicans are saying, 'We don’t want abortion after 15 weeks.' Why can't you say how many weeks the president thinks the limit should be?""

Jean-Pierre began to switch subjects to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) rollout of the Republicans agenda if they retake the House. However, Doocy quickly cut her off, ""I'm not asking about Kevin McCarthy. I'm asking about Joe Biden and his position on abortion. How many weeks?""

Jean-Pierre responded without answering the question, ""Peter, I'm answering your question. What Republicans are trying to do is take us backwards. They're trying to take away the rights and freedoms of Americans. That's what we’re calling out and that's what we’re going to continue to call out.""



The White House press secretary listed the positions of Republicans on abortion without saying if President Joe Biden – who claims to be a devout Catholic Christian – has any limits on abortion.

Doocy noted, ""We're all covering the Republican plan. Why can't you say how many weeks for Biden?""

Jean-Pierre dodged the question yet again and said, ""I answered your question.""

Doocy retorted, ""You did not answer my question, Karine!""

Jean-Pierre then called on another White House correspondent without revealing if Biden believes in any abortion limits – even up until the moment of birth.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/karine-jean-pierre-peter-doocy-abortion,2022-09-24
MSNBC host disparages own children on live TV for refusing COVID vaccine boosters: 'Shocked and appalled',"MSNBC commentator Katty Kay criticized her own children on air Thursday, condemning them for skipping additional COVID-19 vaccine booster shots.

Speaking with Dr. Zeke Emanuel as a guest host on ""Morning Joe,"" Kay admitted that she was ""shocked and appalled"" when her children, ages 22 and 16, informed her they would not be getting any additional COVID booster shots.

""I listen to that doctor and you hear how tough it is in the hospitals at the moment, and the fears of new variants, mixed with flu, that is coming on,"" Kay began. ""You would think that the country would respond by saying, 'OK, we will make sure we are all up to date on all of our vaccines.'

""But I had a strange conversation with my 22-year-old and my 16-year-old last night, and I said, 'OK, I booked you in for COVID updates, you're both back for holidays, you're going to get your boosters.' And both of them said, 'No, we don't want to. We've had enough vaccines, and we don't think we need them,'"" she continued.



""I was shocked and appalled,"" Kay admitted.

At first, Dr. Emanuel appeared to share Kay's sentiment, observing that ""young people think that they're invincible.""

""There are only two things that really can prevent transmission of the COVID virus. One is a good mask, an N95 mask and wearing it, especially in crowded situations, on airplanes and transportation, and the other is better indoor ventilation,"" he went on to say.

"Olbermann attacks Walsh, but does not respond when asked to define 'woman'","Leftist Keith Olbermann attacked conservative commentator Matt Walsh on Wednesday, suggesting that Walsh should leave the U.S. — Olbermann also apparently drew a parallel between Walsh and the Taliban.

Olbermann's attack came in response to Walsh saying that there is no way to share a nation with individuals who advocate for radical leftist gender ideology and refuse to decry infanticide.

""These hearings on abortion are instructive. The liberal witnesses have refused to condemn infanticide, refused to define the word 'woman,' and claimed that men can get pregnant. We cannot share a country with these people. There can be no unity. They are lunatics and monsters,"" Walsh tweeted. ""I don't respect them. I have nothing in common with them. I detest everything they believe and stand for. They feel the same about me. We simply cannot go on this way,"" he added.

""Easy fix: get your useless ass out of the United States of America. We didn't miss the confederacy. We won't miss you and the other American Taliban, @MattWalshBlog,"" Olbermann tweeted.

""I'd love to continue this conversation, Keith, but first I have to know if you're able to define the word 'woman.' Please advise,"" Walsh responded.

As of Thursday evening, Olbermann has not responded to Walsh.

Walsh has a ""What Is a Woman?"" documentary, as well as a book. The seemingly simple question, which anyone with a modicum of common sense should be able to answer, helps to highlight the absurdity of left-wing gender ideology.

Sarah Lopez, a witness at a House Oversight Committee hearing on Wednesday, said that getting an abortion was ""the best decision"" of her life and ""an act of self-love.""

When Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina asked if she supported infanticide, the murder of a child after birth, she said that she did not agree with the question's basis, but that she does ""believe that abortion is health care.""

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday, University of California, Berkeley School of Law professor Khiara M. Bridges spoke of individuals who have a ""capacity for pregnancy."" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri noted her use of the terminology and asked if it referred to women.

""Many women, cis women, have the capacity for pregnancy,"" but others do not, she said. She then said that ""trans men"" and ""non-binary people"" are also able to have a pregnancy.

As the exchange with Hawley continued, Bridges eventually described the lawmaker's ""line of questioning"" as ""transphobic.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/keith-olbermann-matt-walsh-taliban,2022-07-14
Home Depot founder stings Biden as 'worse than Jimmy Carter' as another inflation measurement hits a record high: 'This is a disgrace',"Home Depot founder Ken Langone tore into President Joe Biden this week over his mismanagement of the economy amid soaring inflation, emphatically calling the president ""worse than Jimmy Carter.""

Carter, the 39th president, is often cited as an unsuccessful Democratic president whose own inflationary crisis catapulted Republican President Ronald Reagan into the Oval Office.

Speaking with Fox News host Neil Cavuto on Wednesday, Langone decried the president's economic failures, specifically citing his refusal to acknowledge rising inflation as a lasting problem early in his presidency. Biden famously called inflation ""transitory"" last year.

""This was not transitory, this was a real, serious case of inflation,"" Langone charged. ""We lost a whole year on addressing the issue. Only because, frankly, we have leadership today in America that isn't willing to admit when they're wrong. They made a terrible blunder here, and now the price has got to be paid.""

The billionaire went on to suggest the only fix for the problem now is to tighten down the economy by raising interest rates.

He also slammed Biden's stance on American energy independence, saying, ""The other thing is we’ve exacerbated the problem. For example, the energy issue in America, we didn’t have to be deficient like we are. Hell, by now, that pipeline would have been almost complete.""



""And Biden’s now saying, he’s now blaming the oil companies. This is a disgrace,"" Langone continued. ""The oil companies are reacting to supply and demand. You’re going to see it in their earnings when their earnings come out. If they’re making all this much money, where are they in the numbers? It’s wrong. It’s absolutely wrong,” he continued. “And nobody’s doing anything about it yet, in a way that going to address the issue.""

""The steps we're taking right now will not help,"" he said, adding, ""And who's going to get hurt? The little guy, the poor guy that's living from paycheck to paycheck.""



Langone then predicted the brunt of a coming recession will likely hit sometime early next year, roughly nine or ten months from now.

Earlier this week, news broke that inflation hit a 40-year high in March, with consumer prices notching up 8.5% year over year.

But the numbers for producer prices were even worse, perhaps dispelling the notion that large businesses have been using the volatile economy to gouge consumers. The producer price index, which measures the prices paid by wholesalers, increased 11.2% from a year ago, CNBC reported.

What's worse, according to CNBC, is that the producer price index is considered a forward-looking inflation measurement, as it tracks prices in the pipeline for goods and services that eventually reach consumers.

When Cavuto asked Langone if he thinks the president is reaching Jimmy Carter territory, the billionaire entrepreneur responded bluntly: ""Oh, he's worse than Jimmy Carter.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ken-langone-stings-biden-worse-than-jimmy-carter,2022-04-14
CNBC host grills Rep. Jeffries on inflation: 'You don’t take any responsibility? It's just all a Putin price hike?',"CNBC host Joe Kernen grilled a congressman over the Democrats' excuses for increasing inflation and high gas prices.

Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York appeared on Kernen's show on Tuesday just ahead of a new report that showed inflation worsening instead of improving. Jeffries tried to offer talking points as an excuse for inflation, but Kernen bulldozed through them and pressured him to take responsibility.

“In this country, we’re still down front from peak production. You don’t you think there’s anything that you can do in Congress or to convince a Biden administration, you don’t think there’s any regulations that need to be eased? You don’t think there’s any offshore activity?” asked Kernen.



“You don’t take any responsibility? It’s just all a ‘Putin price hike’?” he added.

“Yeah, part of the challenge domestically in terms of production is that the oil and gas companies have refused to actually act on the permits to drill that they currently ...” Jeffries began to respond.

Kernen blasted the talking point as a ""red herring"" and explained why he thought the excuse was unreasonable.

“So there’s leases. There’s, you know, there’s also just the overall pressure from ESG and the green lobby about whether an oil company is going to make plans five or 10 years down the road when, you know, a large part of the population wants to put them out of business completely,” Kernen said.

Jeffries went on to blame corporations for their high profit margins which didn't persuade Kernen much.

On Wednesday, the Labor Department issued its latest consumer price index report that found inflation in June rising to 9.1% on an annual basis. The stock market dropped farther as a result of the report that many took as a sign that the economy was sinking into a recession.

Many economists say that the high spending policies of the Democrats worsened inflation despite other causes like the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine. A recent poll found that many Americans were unconvinced by the excuses the Biden administration was making for high inflation.

"Furious NBA coach Steve Kerr blames Republican US senators for Texas mass killing, says they're holding America 'hostage' and crave 'power'","Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr in a furious address to the media Tuesday blamed Republican U.S. senators for the mass killing of elementary school students and teachers in Uvalde, Texas, saying GOP elected officials are holding Americans ""hostage"" and crave ""power"" as they refuse to pass universal background checks on gun purchases.

""I'm not gonna talk about basketball,"" Kerr said as he took a seat in front of a microphone ahead of a playoff game against the Dallas Mavericks, adding that ""any basketball questions don't matter.""

What else did Kerr say?

Kerr — his voice shaking and his breathing labored — then recounted the recent mass killing of ""elderly black people"" in Buffalo and the shooting of ""Asian churchgoers"" in southern California while commenting on the unfolding tragedy at Robb Elementary School ""400 miles from here.""

The coach then slammed his hand on the table and hollered, ""When are we gonna do something?"" after which he clenched his teeth against his upper lip in a brief scowl.

""I'm tired,"" Kerr continued, now pounding his fist. ""I'm so tired of getting up here and offering condolences to the devastated families that are out there. ... I'm tired of the moments of silence. Enough!""

Blaming Republicans

Kerr then lit into Republican U.S. senators without specifically mentioning their political party: ""There's 50 senators right now who refuse to vote on H.R. 8, which is a background check rule that the House passed a couple years ago. It's been sitting there for two years. And there's a reason they won't vote on it — to hold on to power.""

He did name Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his Capitol Hill colleagues ""who refuse to do anything about the violence and school shootings and supermarket shootings; I ask you, are you going to put your own desire for power ahead of the lives of our children and our elderly and our churchgoers? Because that's what it looks like.""

Kerr added that he wanted ""every person here, every person listening to this to think about your own child or grandchild or mother or father or sister, brother — how would you feel if this happened to you today? We can't get numb to this. We can't sit here and just read about it and go, 'Well, let's have a moment of silence ...' [while] 50 senators are gonna hold us hostage. You realize that 90 percent of Americans regardless of political party want ... universal background checks — 90 percent of us! We are being held hostage by 50 senators in Washington who refuse to even put it to a vote despite what we, the American people, want.""

Concluding his remarks, Kerr banged the table again with the edge of his hand, saying the Republican senators ""won't vote on it because they wanna hold on to their own power! It's pathetic!"" He then rose from his seat and walked away while saying, ""I've had enough!""

It's worth noting that Kerr's father, Malcom Kerr, was assassinated in 1984 by two gunmen when he was president of American University in Beirut.

'You got into a fight': LA councilman argues with CNN anchor over refusal to resign,"A very active week has continued for Los Angeles City Councilman Kevin de León, who found himself debating CNN anchor Kate Bolduan about whether or not he should resign over remarks he made during a meeting in which he compared another council member's child to a handbag.

Recently, de León also got into a full-blown fight with an activist named Jason Reedy, who confronted the politician at a Christmas tree lighting event.

The Californian's verbal sparring match with the CNN anchor quickly got to the point, with the presenter asking him why he won't resign, as two other council members who made comments in the same meeting have since stepped down and a third lost his seat in an election.

“Let me say this, Kate, and let me be very clear about this: In a democracy voters make the decision, not folks who are in the peanut gallery, or political pundits, or even my own colleagues,” de León affirmed.

The councilman said he plans to return to work and will always be sorry for his statements, commenting that he, like many Americans, does not have the luxury of quitting his job simply because he does not like one of his co-workers.

“Tens of millions of Americans go to work every single day with folks that they don’t like. But you know what they do? They get up and they go to work,"" he remarked. ""They don’t have the luxury that some folks do when they want to walk out,” he declared.

However, during the interview, de León didn't exactly own up to his statements, rejecting the notion that he said that his colleague was using her child as an accessory. Rather, the councilman claimed it was simply a criticism on the fellow council member's affinity for handbags.

“I shouldn’t have said what I said, because it actually was a comment, I was criticizing, actually, Councilwoman Nury Martinez for her penchant for luxury handbags,” he attempted to clarify.

Regarding his recent scuffle, de León stood on his progressive policies in defense of his character.

""That's not the person who I am,"" he explained.

""I have a body and a history of progressive policies that have improved the human condition for all individuals, regardless of who you are,"" he continued. ""I will continue to serve my voters; they will make the ultimate decision,"" he concluded.

Kevin McCarthy threatens Biden's DHS secretary with impeachment if he refuses to resign: 'He cannot and must not remain in that position',"On Tuesday, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy called on Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to step down from his position over the immigration crisis at the southern border, Fox News Digital reported. McCarthy added that if Mayorkas refuses to resign voluntarily, House Republicans will attempt to launch an impeachment inquiry next year.



During a press conference in El Paso, McCarthy blamed Mayorkas for the ""great[est] wave of illegal immigration in recorded history."" He added, ""This is why today I am calling on the secretary to resign.""

""He cannot and must not remain in that position,"" McCarthy continued. ""If Secretary Mayorkas does not resign, House Republicans will investigate every order, every action and every failure to determine whether we can begin an impeachment inquiry.""

McCarthy previously told Fox News Digital that if he becomes the next House speaker, he will hold congressional hearings at the southern border to force Democrats to witness the migrant crisis firsthand.

""The American public deserves more, deserves better and expects more within their government. Enough is enough. We will do whatever it takes,"" McCarthy said.

Mayorkas has repeatedly insisted that the southern border is ""secure"" despite the overwhelming numbers of border crossings reported by Customs and Border Protection.

According to CBP data, there were more than 1,700,000 migrant encounters at the border in the fiscal year 2021 and more than 2,300,000 in the fiscal year 2022, a 37% increase. Last month alone, there were approximately 230,000 encounters.

The Border Patrol reported that every day, there are an estimated 2,500 ""gotaways,"" or immigrants who were seen crossing the border into the United States but who managed to evade law enforcement and have not been processed.

During a Senate hearing last week, Mayorkas told lawmakers that the migrant crisis is not unique to America's southern border.

""The entire hemisphere is suffering a migration crisis,"" claimed Mayorkas. ""We are seeing an unprecedented movement of people from country to country. It is not restricted to the southern border.""

In a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation, the Department of Homeland Security said, ""Secretary Mayorkas is proud to advance the noble mission of this Department, support its extraordinary workforce, and serve the American people. The Department will continue our work to enforce our laws and secure our border, while building a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system.""

""Members of Congress can do better than point the finger at someone else; they should come to the table and work on solutions for our broken system and outdated laws, which have not been overhauled in over 40 years,"" the department added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kevin-mccarthy-threatens-biden-s-dhs-secretary-with-impeachment-if-he-refuses-to-resign-he-cannot-and-must-not-remain-in-that-position,2022-11-23
'Kick Joe Manchin out': Left-wing pundit Robert Reich urges Democrats to banish West Virginia senator,"Robert Reich, a former U.S. Labor secretary and now hard-left pundit, is calling on Democrats to kick Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) out of their party, claiming that they have ""already lost control over the Senate"" because Manchin opposes an extreme left agenda.

Reich, who served as secretary of Labor for President Bill Clinton and was a member of President Barack Obama's economic transition advisory board, argued in an email newsletter that Democrats should ditch Manchin before the midterm elections in November. He wrote that the party should tell voters that even though Democrats have a 50-50 majority, they never really had full control of government because Manchin wouldn't support the most extreme elements of President Joe Biden's Build Back Better agenda.

Last week, Manchin reportedly told Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) that he would not support a Democratic spending bill that would fund a left-wing climate agenda and raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations. The West Virginia lawmaker said he could not support $500 billion in new spending while inflation is squeezing Americans and he asked Democrats to drop those provisions from the bill and focus on lowering prescription drug costs instead.

Progressives fumed at Manchin, accusing him of ""obstructing"" or ""sabotaging"" the president's agenda — which they have done previously when Manchin refused to go along with left-wing demands to end the Senate filibuster, pack the Supreme Court, pass extreme abortion legislation, and more.

Reich echoed those criticisms, accusing the moderate senator of ""putting a final spear through the heart of what remained of Biden’s and the Democrat’s domestic agenda.""

He argued that Manchin's concerns about inflation were illegitimate and that the lawmaker was corrupted by campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry.



""If the Democratic Party had any capacity to discipline its lawmakers or hold them accountable (if pigs could fly), it would at least revoke Manchin’s chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,"" Reich wrote. ""To continue to allow this key position to be occupied by the man who has single-handedly blocked one of the last opportunities to save the Earth is an insult to the universe.""

He went on to write that the reason Democrats have not punished Manchin is because they fear he would accept Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's invitation to join the GOP.

""Why exactly would this be so terrible? Manchin already acts like a Republican,"" Reich asserted.

""Oh, no! they tell me. If Manchin switches parties, Democrats would lose control over the Senate. Well, I have news for Democrats. They already lost control over the Senate,"" he wrote.

Reich argued that Democrats ""look like they control the Senate,"" but insisted they really don't because ""they can't get a damn thing done.""

""So after almost two years of appearing to run the entire government, Democrats have accomplished almost nothing of what they came to Washington to do,"" Reich complained.

""America is burning and flooding but Democrats won’t enact climate measures. Voting rights and reproductive rights are being pulverized but Democrats won’t protect them. Gun violence is out of control but Democrats come up with a miniature response. Billionaires and big corporations are siphoning off more national wealth and income than in living memory and paying a lower tax rate (often zero), but Democrats won’t raise taxes on big corporations and the wealthy.""

He wrote that by kicking Manchin out of the party now, Democrats will have an excuse they can take to voters to explain why the party failed to keep its promises.

""Democrats could at least go into the midterms with a more realistic pitch: 'It looked like we had control of the Senate, but we didn’t. Now that you know who the real Democrats are, give us the power and we will get it done,'"" he concluded. ""Maybe this way they’ll pick up more real Democratic senators, and do it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/kick-joe-manchin-out-robert-reich,2022-07-18
Bardella suggested GOP could push dress code,"Kurt Bardella, who indicates that he is a Democratic strategist, posted a tweet on Monday suggesting that the GOP may eventually start advocating for a dress code for women.

""How long until Republicans start floating policies to impose a dress code on women …"" Bardella tweeted.

Christina Pushaw, who stepped down last month from her role as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' press secretary and became the rapid response director for the governor's campaign, responded to Bardella by declaring, ""The only people calling to mandate face coverings are Democrats.""

Tim Carney, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, tweeted, ""I'm pretty sure the party mandating face coverings this decade wasn't the gop.""

Mary Margaret Olohan of the Daily Signal tweeted ""what is a women,"" in response to Bardella's comment.

Bardella has previously claimed that that the GOP is a ""domestic terrorist cell.""

""The Republican Party, the MAGA Republicans, are a domestic terrorist cell operating in America,"" he said during an appearance on MSNBC.

The death of a young woman, who died not long after being arrested by morality police in the Islamic Republic of Iran, has been the subject of international attention, with some Iranians engaging in protest.

CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour noted last week that she had been scheduled to interview Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in New York, but that the interview fell through after she refused to acquiesce to a sudden demand that she don a headscarf.

""I politely declined. We are in New York, where there is no law or tradition regarding headscarves. I pointed out that no previous Iranian president has required this when I have interviewed them outside Iran,"" Amanpour noted. ""The aide made it clear that the interview would not happen if I did not wear a headscarf. He said it was 'a matter of respect,' and referred to 'the situation in Iran' - alluding to the protests sweeping the country,"" Amanpour added.

Suspect in lethal mass stabbing at Las Vegas is reportedly an illegal alien from Guatemala,"The suspect arrested in connection to the lethal mass stabbing in Las Vegas, Nevada, was reportedly an illegal alien originally from Guatemala.

The revelation came from Fox News reporter Bill Melugin who cited a source from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The report said that ICE had no record of 32-year-old Yoni Barrios before the incident but that he had a criminal record in California.

The allegedly unprovoked attack unfolded at about 11:40 a.m. on Thursday on the Las Vegas Strip. Witnesses said that a Hispanic man began stabbing people with a large kitchen knife outside of the Wynn Casino and then continued the attack as he walked along.

Surveillance video captured the man running away with bystanders chasing after him.

Barrios was captured and detained by Sands security guards. He allegedly stabbed 8 people, two of whom have died. Three other victims are reportedly in critical condition.

Officials said they believed Barrios was the only suspect involved and that it was an isolated incident.

According to one witness account given to KTNV, Barrios approached a group of Las Vegas showgirls and asked for a photograph while holding the knife but was refused. That's when he began stabbing them, the witness said.

Police have increased their presence on the strip after the attack.

Barrios was charged with two counts of open murder with a deadly weapon and six counts of attempted murder with a deadly weapon.

He had only arrived in Nevada from California the day before the attack, according to a news report.

The Republican Party of Nevada tweeted a statement blaming Democratic policies for the heinous attack.

""Yoni Barrios wouldn’t be here if our border were secure. [Democrat gubernatorial candidate] @SteveSisolak wants Nevada to be a sanctuary state so more criminals can come here and hurt Nevadans. How many people have to die before the Democrats will secure the border?"" it tweeted.

"Dem mayor refuses to pay back taxpayer money she used on upgraded travel, says critics do not 'understand the world black women walk in'","New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell (D) has found herself at the center of controversy after she repeatedly used taxpayer money to finance expensive upgraded air travel.

Now, she is refusing to reimburse taxpayers.

What are the details?

Despite apparently running afoul of city policies, Cantrell said last Thursday that she will not pay back the roughly $29,000 of taxpayer money that she used to upgrade to first-class or business-class airfare on official trips since January 2021.

""All expenses incurred doing business on behalf of the city of New Orleans will not be reimbursed to the city of New Orleans,"" Cantrell declared, WWL-TV reported. ""One thing is clear: I do my job, and I will continue to do it with distinction and integrity every step of the way.""

City policy, on the other hand, requires that municipal employees ""purchase the lowest airfare available.""

""Employees are required to purchase the lowest airfare available,"" the policy states, according to WWL. ""Employees who choose an upgrade from coach, economy, or business class flights are solely responsible for the difference in cost.""

Last month, Cantrell claimed the upgrades are necessary to ensure her safety as a black woman. She said:

My travel accommodations are a matter of safety, not of luxury. As all women know, our health and safety are often disregarded and we are left to navigate alone. As the mother of a young child whom I live for, I am going to protect myself by any reasonable means in order to ensure I am there to see her grow into the strong woman I am raising her to be. Anyone who wants to question how I protect myself just doesn't understand the world Black women walk in.

Cantrell's statement suggested she travels alone. But the Times-Picayune obtained travel expenditures showing Cantrell travels with aides. Those aides always fly coach, and the travel records underscore the cost discrepancy between her travel and theirs.



For example, when she traveled to Washington, D.C., in January on the taxpayer dime for $2,279, her aide's seat in coach cost just $250. Meanwhile, Cantrell spent $9,710 on upgraded seats for a trip to Switzerland earlier this summer. On that trip, her aides were stuck in lousy coach seats priced at roughly $500.

Cantrell's lavish spending habits have embroiled her in controversy, especially after she spent more than $40,000 on a trip to France earlier this year that included a side stay in Paris. While in the City of Light, Cantrell stayed in a Paris hotel overlooking the Eiffel Tower that cost more than $700 per night.

What happens next?

A top aide told the Times-Picayune it's unclear whether the policy for city employees applies to Cantrell.

Currently, the New Orleans City Council is seeking counsel from various attorneys to determine whether the policy does in fact apply to the mayor.

Cantrell lists the City of New Orleans as her employer on financial disclosure forms, WWL noted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/las-vegas-stabbing-illegal-alien,2022-09-12
"Lawyer fatally shot after allegedly breaking into Texas home, making death threats, charging at homeowner","A lawyer was fatally shot over the weekend after allegedly breaking into a Texas home, making death threats, and charging at the homeowner, KTRK-TV reported.

What are the details?

Deputies with the Smith County Sheriff's Office responded to a suspicious-person call at a home on Treasure Cove near Bullard in Tyler around 11:30 a.m. Saturday, the station said.



Deputies en route reportedly learned that the suspect confronted the homeowners after getting inside the residence and insisted that the homeowner's truck belonged to him, KTRK reported.

After using force to remove the suspect from his house, deputies told KTRK the homeowner locked the door.

Deputies added to the station that soon the homeowner went outside with a shotgun to check on his truck.

KTRK said that's when the suspect — identified as Mark Anthony Correro, a 50-year-old Houston lawyer — returned to the property. Houston is nearly 200 miles south of Tyler.

The homeowner noted to investigators that he told Correro authorities were on their way and to sit down, the station said.

“The homeowner believed the suspect was having a mental episode, as he was shouting an unknown female’s name,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement to KYTX-TV, adding that during this time the homeowner’s fiancée came outside.

""Her presence seemed to agitate the suspect, and he came toward them aggressively,"" the sheriff's office added to KYTX. ""The homeowner warned the suspect several times to stop walking toward them, or he would shoot. The suspect refused and made death threats toward them.""

The suspect then charged toward the homeowner and his fiancée, the sheriff's office noted, adding that's when the homeowner shot the suspect once in the chest.

When deputies arrived, Correro was found unconscious in the front yard, KTRK said, after which deputies began CPR.

Arriving paramedics pronounced Correro dead at the scene, KTRK said.

A justice of the peace Pct. 2 arrived at the scene and ordered an autopsy, KYTX said.

Both stations said the investigation is ongoing.

The sheriff's office told TheBlaze late Monday afternoon the case will be presented to the county district attorney to determine if any charges will be filed.

"​Lawyer points gun at ex-girlfriend bartender, fires shot that barely misses, cops say — then two heroic customers step up in a big way to end lethal threat","Police say an attorney walked into an Austin, Texas, pub over the weekend, pointed a gun at his bartending ex-girlfriend, and fired a shot that barely missed her.

With that, a pair of customers stepped up heroically, tackling the gunman and ending the lethal threat.

What are the details?

Gavin Edward Rush, 41, entered the Anderson Mill Pub after 11:30 a.m. Saturday to confront his ex-girlfriend as she worked her shift, KEYE-TV reported, citing an arrest affidavit.

Their three-year relationship ended about a month and a half before, KTBC-TV reported, adding that when she rejected his desire to get back together, police said he sent several texts threatening to harm her and her new partner.

Police added that when she stopped answering Rush's texts — though informing him she was at work — he took a trip to the pub, KTBC said.

When she refused to talk to him, Rush pulled out a gun and pointed it at her — and a red dot from a laser sight was centered on her chest, KEYE said, citing the police affidavit.

KTBC said he fired a shot that narrowly missed her. The police affidavit indicates that one of the shots hit a bar mirror directly behind where Rush’s ex-girlfriend was standing, KEYE reported.

Two customers who knew the backstory tackled Rush and wrestled the firearm away, KTBC said, adding that he continued to shoot the gun during the struggle and tried to kill himself.

""It's hard to tell your story. In her case, it did work out that she was able to find some trusted people who did end up potentially saving her life,"" Nikhita Ved, vice president of community services at the SAFE Alliance, told KTBC.

Austin Councilmember Mackenzie Kelly posted surveillance video of the incident:

What happened next?

Rush is facing a felony charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon involving family violence, KEYE said, adding that the bond was set at $40,000, which typically means the suspect pays 10% — in this case, $4,000.

Indeed, Rush has already bonded out of jail, KTBC said, adding that Thomas Villareal — who heads up the Austin Police Association — stated that ""the courts have failed this victim.""

The judge did grant the ex-girlfriend an emergency protection order, KEYE said.

KTBC said Rush's law firm issued the following statement: ""Gavin Rush no longer works at the firm. We do not tolerate hatred or violence of any kind.

Leading Democrat claims some kids will be beaten to death if public schools disclose to parents that their children are getting gender identity counseling,"The New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman claimed that some kids will be beaten to death or commit suicide if public schools in the state disclose to parents that their children are getting gender identity counseling.

What are the details?

Raymond Buckley made his claim on Twitter Friday while reacting to a comment about the issue, which is a campaign issue in the state.

“Should parents have the right to know if their children are receiving gender identity counseling at school, or is Manchester school district right to keep it secret from moms and dads?” the New Hampshire Journal wondered.



Conservative commentator Michael Graham replied, “The most interesting part of this story out of #NHPolitics is that [Democrat U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas] is unabashedly arguing that parents should NOT have the right to know about behavior of their own children.”

With that, Buckley declared, “You’re purposely going after children, endangering their lives, mental health & safety & it's disgusting. Not all families are the same; some kids will be kicked out or beaten (to death) or commit suicide. All to try to get votes for Karoline? #NHPolitics”

Buckley was referring to Karoline Leavitt, the Republican nominee for New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District; Pappas is the incumbent for the seat. Leavitt is against keeping parents in the dark while Pappas said it's none of her business, WMUR-TV reported.

Graham shot back at Buckley: “The chair of @NHDems stating clearly the party's position is that teachers should decide what parents are allowed to know about their own children. @RepChrisPappas voted Thursday to kill a requirement schools inform parents when their kids receive counseling at school.""

Buckley then dug into Graham: ""You willfully refuse to accept the reality of LBGTQ kid’s [sic] lives depending on having a safe space vs parroting the false outrage of the moment. Absolutely disgusting.""

Graham gave it to back to Buckley again: ""Not sure 'Parents are domestic terrorists who will beat their gay children to death!' is the winning message Democrats think it is.""

Leavitt told the New Hampshire Journal in response to Buckley’s tweet that ""the Biden administration labeled parents as ‘domestic terrorists,’ and now the chair of the New Hampshire Democrat Party is claiming Granite State parents beat their kids to death.The Democrats’ hatred for parents who simply want to be involved in their children’s education is disgusting. It’s rooted in the fact that Democrats like Chris Pappas are funded by powerful teachers unions who want total control over our public education system. While Pappas continues to side with Joe Biden and radical bureaucrats, I will continue to stand with Granite State mothers and fathers.”

Leavitt calls to report Ramirez to Child Protective Services,"Leftist David Leavitt called a hotline on Monday in an attempt to report Republican Virginia state Senate candidate Tina Ramirez to Child Protective Services.

Leavitt, who describes himself on Twitter as an ""Award-Winning Multimedia Journalist,"" trolled various Twitter accounts that celebrated Columbus Day. ""Why are you celebrating torture, rape, murder, and enslavement?"" Leavitt wrote in response to Columbus Day posts from sitting GOP U.S. lawmakers, the Yonkers Police Department, Ramirez, and others.

He also posted the question on another tweet from Ramirez, which was not at all related to Columbus Day — Ramirez fired back, ""I teach my daughter real American history. I refuse to join the radical left’s campaign to erase history.""

""Can someone please call child care services on Tina Ramirez who's teaching her child to be a racist?"" Leavitt responded.

""Mighty bold and liberal of you to lecture a Hispanic mother with a black daughter on racism. What's next? Are you going to lecture me on women’s rights?"" Ramirez replied.

Leavitt apparently decided to take it upon himself to make the call, because he posted a series of tweets lamenting how long he had been on hold with the child abuse hotline — it is unclear whether Leavitt ever spoke to anyone on the hotline to report Ramirez

""The Virginia State hotline for child abuse has a 10+ minute hold and is experiencing 'high call volumes' with 14 callers ahead of me. This is absolutely unacceptable. How many people try to report child abuse and hang up? How many children will continue to be abused?"" he tweeted. He later noted that the hotline had ""a 60+ minute hold & is experiencing 'high call volumes' with 14 callers ahead of me.""

Ramirez described Leavitt's behavior as ""appalling.""



""He waited an hour on hold, tying up the lines of our CPS professionals trying to help Virginia’s children. The radical left is willing to put our children at risk to cancel conservatives,"" she tweeted. ""It's no surprise that a member of the radical left is willing to go so far as to call CPS on a single mother - simply because they want to erase history. The radical left doesn’t want parents making decisions for their own families,"" she added.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leading-democrat-claims-some-kids-will-get-beaten-to-death-if-public-schools-disclose-to-parents-that-their-children-are-getting-gender-identity-counseling,2022-10-12
Leftist militants attack conservative students and use terror tactics to shut down Turning Point USA event ​at UC Davis,"A Turning Point USA event was shut down Tuesday evening after multiple attacks by leftist militants on attendees were answered, not by the UC Davis police, who were kept from intervening, but by a handful of counter-protesters ready for a fight.

A night with 'MAGA Hulk'

The UC Davis student chapter of Turning Point USA organized an event for Oct. 25, set to feature conservative speaker Stephen Davis, the host of the podcast ""SMASH with MAGA Hulk.""

The chapter vice president of UC Davis TPUSA, Luke Shalz, noted that Stephen Davis is ""an African-American gentleman who does not believe in systemic racism.""

In advance of the event featuring a black conservative speaker, flyers were distributed on campus accusing TPUSA of being ""racist, homophobic, transphobic, and anti-immigrant"" and of celebrating violence. The flyers also defamed Kyle Rittenhouse, who spoke at a TPUSA event, as a ""racist murder [sic].""

The flyers called on ""anyone who opposes racism and bigotry to stand together and make it known that TPUSA is not welcome on our campus.""

Similar posts were circulated online accusing Stephen Davis of being a fascist for ""denying systemic racism.""

Notwithstanding calls for censorship ahead of the event, the university claimed that it was ""committed to the First Amendment, and ... required to uphold it. We affirm the right of our students — in this instance, Turning Point USA at UC Davis — to invite speakers to our campus, just as we affirm the right of others to protest speakers whose views they find upsetting or offensive.""

The university also reportedly informed the TPUSA campus chapter that UC Davis police would be present at the event and that they would intervene if protests turned violent.

However, when leftist protesters began using barriers as battering rams and pepper-spraying young women, the campus police — said to have been on site — did not take action or deploy into the crowd.

The university told KCRA3 that officers had been on standby when the fighting broke out, but did not act because ""the situation de-escalated on its own, eliminating the need for the police to engage.""

The brawl

The brawl that ensued allegedly involved 100 people and began, according to TPUSA's field team, when Antifa began provoking people trying to enter the venue.



In a statement, UC Davis noted there had been reports of Antifa supporters involved in the fighting and pepper-spraying and that members of the pugnacious men's group Proud Boys may have also been on the scene.

One young female conservative was pepper-sprayed by leftist agitators.

UC Davis also indicated that some ""in the crowd used barricades to beat on the glass of the UC Davis Conference Center, where about 30 people were inside waiting for the event to begin.""

Student Affairs staff reportedly determined that the chaos outside presented sufficient danger to warrant shutting down the event.

The UC Davis TPUSA chapter ultimately agreed, later stating, ""Rather than risk any further escalation of violence, our TPUSA chapter leadership decided to cancel the event when it became apparent campus PD was unable to disperse the violent agitators outside while also keeping our students safe inside.""

""This is a great loss for free speech, our speaker Stephen Davis, and for the students at UC Davis. TPUSA condemns all violence and refuses to be cowed by those who use threats and intimidation to stop conservatives on campus,"" TPUSA tweeted.

On Thursday, former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell called out UC Davis chancellor Gary May, suggesting he had failed up to stand up for true diversity on campus after Davis, a black speaker, had been shut down by ""radical lefties.""

Catherine Brinkley, a UC Davis professor, celebrated the silencing of a black conservative and the leftist attacks on unarmed students, stating she was ""really proud of our students, faculty, staff and community who showed up to counter-rally a planned speaking event at UC Davis. Thank you for putting your bodies on the line.""

It is unclear whether the event will be rescheduled.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leavitt-ramirez-child-protective-services,2022-10-27
"Leftist teacher goes crazy, bites woman at Tudor Dixon rally: Report","A public school teacher in Michigan allegedly attacked a woman at a rally for Republican gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon, reports say.

On October 29, an unnamed teacher in the Dearborn Public Schools district attended a Dixon rally held at Armando's, a Mexican restaurant in southwest Detroit. Wearing a mask that read, ""I'm speaking,"" the woman held up a sign in support of Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

Cheryl Costantino, the Republican chairwoman of Wayne County, said that as the rally progressed, the woman slowly made her way toward the stage and began behaving erratically.

""She was acting so chaotic that I was worried she would go after the speakers or something or hurt somebody,"" Costantino stated.

It turns out that Costantino was right to be concerned. She has alleged that, shortly thereafter, the woman bit and pinched her in the arm.









""The top was a compression injury because of how hard her jaw bit me,"" Costantino said, describing her injuries. ""So when it started swelling up, I couldn't even raise my arm, like it was even uncomfortable just to drive.""

Bite marks Costantino says she sustained in the assault Screen shot of WXYZ-TV video

The woman was then asked to leave, and men, likely security, attempted to escort her from the premises, but the woman attempted to stand her ground, according to Costantino.

""And she was slapping all these guys, and this guy was just trying to guide her out and ask her to leave, and she refused to leave, and she kept saying, ‘I have a ticket!'"" Costantino said, according to Breitbart.

Linda Sawyer, a witness, claimed that when she confronted the woman about the assault, the woman more or less admitted it.

""I went to her and I said, 'You bit Cheryl.' And she said, 'Yeah, well,'"" Sawyer said.

""Like she was proud of it,"" Sawyer added.

Elisa Wagner, a local precinct delegate, then began filming the woman, who by that time had grabbed a serving tray holder and, in Costantino's words, held ""it like a weapon.""

Portions of Wagner's video can be seen in the WXYZ-TV news segment, though the woman's face has been obscured.

Costantino filed a report with the Detroit Police Department, and Wagner accompanied her as a witness and corroborated her story. Police are still considering whether to file charges, pending further investigation.

WXYZ-TV has confirmed that the woman teaches in the Dearborn Public Schools. The district released a statement following the allegations:

""The Dearborn Public Schools is in the process of conducting an investigation to gather all the facts associated with this alleged incident and determine if there were any violations of board policy.""

""I don't understand who would trust someone like that with their children,"" Costantino, who is also a teacher, said. ""And why would a school open themselves up to liability by keeping an employee who would act like that?""

Dixon herself has tweeted about the incident and asked Whitmer to ""condemn"" it:

Dixon, her running mate, Shane Hernandez, and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who has endorsed Dixon, were all in attendance at the rally.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftist-militants-attack-conservative-students-and-use-terror-tactics-to-shut-down-turning-point-usa-event-at-uc-davis,2022-11-04
"Leftists melt down over Dave Chappelle winning Grammy for 'The Closer,' which leftists condemned as 'transphobic'","When Dave Chappelle took home this year's Grammy award for best comedy album — ""The Closer"" — not everyone was applauding.

As you might recall, leftists far and wide flew off the handle over Chappelle's stand-up special when Netflix released it in 2021, calling it ""transphobic"" and staging sometimes violent protests over it.

So it should come as no surprise that leftists in 2023 decried those who would dare vote for ""The Closer"" and give it a Grammy as best comedy album.

What were they decrying about?

The Hollywood Reporter went with the following headline: ""Dave Chappelle Wins Grammy for Netflix Special Condemned for Being Transphobic."" (It must be stated that some folks mocked the headline's word structure by pointing out that they didn't know there was a Grammy category for ""Netflix Special Condemned for Being Transphobic."")

The Advocate was even more to the point: ""Chappelle Wins Grammy for Transphobic Netflix Special.""

Entertainment writer Zoe Rose Bryant tweeted that ""the same industry that’s patting itself on the back tonight for making Kim Petras the first trans woman to win pop duo/group performance at the #Grammys also gave Dave Chappelle another Grammy for his transphobic special 'The Closer' so it’s nice to see hypocrisy is alive & well.""

Eric Degans — TV critic and media analyst for National Public Radio — tweeted: ""Wow. Grammys really don't care; one year after giving an award to admitted harasser Louis C.K., they gave one to Dave Chappelle's homophobic and transphobic Netflix special. Sigh.""

Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. told the Hollywood Reporter in regard to the nominations of Chapelle and Louis C.K., “We don’t control who the voters vote for. If the voters feel like a creator deserves a nomination, they’re going to vote for them. We’re never going to be in the business of deciding someone’s moral position or where we evaluate them to be on the scale of morality. I think our job is to evaluate the art and the quality of the art. We can make sure that all of our spaces are safe and people don’t feel threatened by anyone. But as far as the nominations or the awards, we really let the voters make that decision.”

Anything else?

After word got out about the content of ""The Closer,"" a prominent Netflix showrunner quit in protest; the company suspended three employees — including a queer trans worker — for crashing an executive meeting focused on Chappelle; and Netflix fired the organizer of a planned walkout for leaking confidential data related to Chappelle's special.

In relation to that Netflix walkout, the Associated Press and Variety falsely claimed a Chappelle supporter screamed profanities and was the aggressor — and both outlets issued retractions.

For Chappelle's part, he said early on that he refused to buckle under public pressure: ""I am not bending to anybody’s demands."" What's more, at that same time, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos stood against pressure to pull ""The Closer,"" arguing that ""content on screen doesn't directly translate to real-world harm.""

"Former military leaders, defense secretaries warn of hyper-politicized civilian-military environment","Former top military and Defense Department officials are sounding the alarm over increased politicization of the ""civil-military environment.""

What are they saying?

Eight former Defense secretaries and five former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff warned in an open letter Tuesday the U.S. is experiencing an ""exceptionally challenging civil-military environment.""

The military and civilian defense leaders attributed the growing problem to the COVID-19 pandemic, the end of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in particular the sharp increase of politicization in America. Former President Donald Trump's refusal to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election was the culmination of harmful politicization, the leaders said.

To stave off increased politicization of the military, the leaders drafted 16 ""core principles and best practices"" they say best preserve the appropriate civilian-military relationship.

The list of ""core principles and best practices"" outlines the proper relationship between the military, civilian leaders, and the three branches of government. The list emphasizes that the military is restricted to carrying out lawful orders and duties, highlights the ""significant limits on the public role of military personnel in partisan politics,"" and explains the role the military plays in presidential elections.



On that last point, the letter says:

During presidential elections, the military has a dual obligation. First, because the Constitution provides for only one commander-in chief at a time, the military must assist the current commander-in-chief in the exercise of his or her constitutional duty to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. Second, because the voters (not the military) decide who will be commander-in-chief, they must prepare for whomever the voters pick — whether a reelected incumbent or someone new. This dual obligation reinforces the importance of the principles and best practices described above.

The letter was signed by former Defense Secs. Ash Carter, William Cohen, Mark Esper, Robert Gates, Chuck Hagel, Jim Mattis, Leon Panetta, and William Perry; and retired Gens. Martin Dempsey, Joseph Dunford Jr., Richard Myers, Peter Pace, and retired Adm. Mike Mullen, all of whom served as chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Anything else?

The New York Times characterized the letter as ""a thinly veiled indictment of Mr. Trump and the legions of his followers."" But Mullen told the newspaper directly the letter ""is not pointed at Trump.""

Meanwhile, President Joe Biden became the target of criticism last week after he delivered a highly controversial speech during which he was flanked by U.S. Marines against a red-light backdrop. The optics invoked allegations of using military soldiers for partisan purposes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/leftists-melt-down-over-dave-chappelle-winning-grammy-for-the-closer-which-leftists-condemned-as-transphobic,2022-09-07
Liberal Republicans in South Carolina state Senate kill abortion ban,"A little more than a week after the South Carolina state House passed a near-total abortion ban, the bill was killed Thursday during a special session of the state Senate, where it was opposed by moderate Republicans and Democrats.

Five GOP senators refused to support the legislation, which would have banned most abortions from the moment of conception, with exceptions for medical emergencies threatening the life of the mother. Those opposed included the three Republican women in the state Senate, Sens. Penry Gustafson, Sandy Senn, and Katrina Shealy, as well as state Sen. Tom Davis, who was chief of staff to former Gov. Mark Sanford (R) before he was elected to the Senate in 2009, and state Sen. Greg Hembree.

During debate, Shealy chastised her male colleagues and said they should ask the women in their lives before trying to pass an abortion ban without rape or incest exceptions, the Associated Press reported.



“You want to believe that God is wanting you to push a bill through with no exceptions that kill mothers and ruins the lives of children — lets mothers bring home babies to bury them — then I think you’re miscommunicating with God. Or maybe you aren’t communicating with Him at all,” Shealy said before senators amended the bill to permit abortions if a baby cannot survive outside the womb.

But Davis, the father of three daughters, said he would filibuster any attempt to pass abortion restrictions beyond the state's current six-week ban.



“The moment we become pregnant we lost all control over what goes on with our bodies,” Davis said, reportedly recounting what his daughters told him. “I’m here to tell you I’m not going to let it happen.""

After the filibuster threat, Republican Majority Leader Sen. Shane Massey acknowledged the abortion ban could not pass.

""This is not where I wanted to be. I was hoping we'd be more aggressive, but it's clear to me the votes are not there in the Senate for an abortion ban before six weeks,"" Massey said, according to the Post and Courier. ""We don't have the votes.""



Instead, the Senate passed a measure strengthening South Carolina's fetal heartbeat law, which went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The law bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected by ultrasound, with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. However, that law was temporarily blocked by the state supreme court after Planned Parenthood South Atlantic sued, arguing it violates privacy protections in the state constitution.

Lawmakers voted 27-16 in favor of a bill that amends language in the fetal heartbeat law that the state supreme court flagged in its ruling to issue a temporary injunction blocking the law last month. The Senate-passed bill also reduces the length of time a victim of rape or incest has to seek an abortion from 20 weeks to 13 weeks.

Current state law requires that allegations of rape and incest be reported to local law enforcement within 24 hours of a victim obtaining an abortion. The Senate proposed a new requirement that a DNA sample of the aborted child be taken by a physician and sent to law enforcement to be preserved as evidence within 90 days of the abortion, WRDW-TV reports.

Additionally, the Senate bill increases the number of doctors required to sign off on an abortion in cases of fetal abnormalities from one to two. The doctors must confirm that the baby could not survive outside the womb.

The amendments to the fetal heartbeat law will now head to the state House, where representatives will either concur with the Senate's changes or attempt to pass another version of the near-total abortion ban the Senate has already rejected. The latter action would likely result in no bill passing at all.

Gov. Henry McMaster (R) said in a statement he will sign whichever legislation lawmakers agree to.

""The Senate’s bill — just like the House bill — strikes an appropriate balance,"" McMaster spokesman Brian Symmes told the Post and Courier. ""It is the governor’s hope that the House and Senate will soon come to an agreement and send a bill to his desk for signature.""

In the meantime, the state's 20-week ban on abortion remains in effect.

Liberal teacher claims 'kids are dying' because of Florida parental rights law,"A liberal teacher that was highlighted by the ""Libs of TikTok"" account said that the media needed to be less reactionary and added that kids are ""dying"" because of the debate over the Florida parental rights law.

Florida teacher Ravi Ramirez told Brian Stelter on CNN+ that she was criticized by trolls online after the Libs of TikTok account posted her video complaining about the Florida law.

Ramirez told Stelter that the media should not engage in ""reactionary behavior"" and instead report the facts.

""Already, teachers have lost jobs. Many teachers have had to take down safe spaces, posters from their classroom. Many of them have had to change the way they speak to their kids. So I think focusing on the human impact of these black and white letters on a piece of paper, you know what is this doing to our family, what is this doing to our teachers, the stress levels,"" Ramirez said.

""I think it's too much and I think it’s a personal attack on public education in general. They want to privatize education. They don’t want to make education accessible to all people. So it's important to ensure that, you know, we don't want to get reactionary behavior, which is very human and normal, but provide the facts, but never forget the real impacts,"" she continued.

""You know, kids are dying because of this and that’s my biggest concern,"" Ramirez claimed without evidence.

""I want to save kids lives. If I acknowledge one child and letting them know that they are safe with me, and that they are loved by me, that can make such a huge difference, it can change and save their lives, so let's not let them forget that,"" she concluded.

The segment with Ramirez was a lazy and sloppy regurgitation of liberal talking points against the Florida law. Stelter also appeared to justify the creator of the Libs of TikTok account being doxxed by the Washington Post in the segment.

Here's the video of the teacher's comments:

Liberals lash out at Van Jones for saying Biden is losing black voters because he didn't fulfill his promises and made their lives worse,"CNN political commentator Van Jones said that Biden and the Democrats are losing support among black voters because they overpromised, underdelivered, and inflation had made their lives worse.

Jones made the comments on CNN Friday with John Berman.

""I think that there's a disappointment factor that's set in, I think a lot of black voters feel like the black community gave the most during the election, it was a historic election, 2020, and have gotten the least,"" Jones said.

""If you look at voting rights, so far nothing. Police reform, so far nothing. You look at some of the student loan stuff, very little. So what was motivating African-American voters left, right and otherwise, were that somebody was going to come to our rescue,"" he continued.

""The day-to-day reality for black folks hasn't improved In fact, because of inflation and other things, [have] gotten worse,"" Jones concluded, ""so you're starting to see that disappointment factor set in.""

He went on to point out that conservatives have been able to recast the Republican Party as a ""multi-racial working class"" party to appeal to some minorities. He also blamed most of the disapproval for Biden on inflation.

""This idea, well look, Trump was here, he's terrible, we're gonna replace him, and we're gonna give you 100% of what you want, with 50% of the votes in the Senate,"" Jones continued.



""The math never made sense, you can pass big bills through the house, but you can't even sometimes get a hearing in the Senate. And so by the time you get to the summertime, hey, I'm hearing all this stuff is supposed to be happening, but it's never getting signed by the president,"" he explained.

""When you overpromise so much in the beginning of the year and you're underdelivering at the end of the year, and don't forget Build Back Better, et cetera, you suddenly end up with a disappointment factor plus inflation,"" Jones concluded.

Some on social media were furious with Van Jones for his criticism of the Democrats.

""Van Jones is a f***ing moron,"" read one very popular reaction.

""Van Jones is wrong. The MEDIA HAS UNDERREPORTED Joe Biden's accomplishments because they have PTSD from TFG. Get a handle on your business ffs, MSM,"" said another critic.

""I don’t know what the f*** Van Jones’ jiggin’ and jivin’ ass is even talking about,"" read another critical tweet. ""How the f*** would he know what life is like for us Blacks who ain’t never played pet negro for Trump or billionaire Bezos?""

Others agreed with Jones.

""Van Jones didn't say anything wrong here. The Democrats said what they needed to say to get the votes they needed to win, and refused to fight for any of the things that they promised. The strategy of the Democrats appears to be platitudes now and excuses later,"" read one popular response.

NBC News found similar apathy among black voters in a rural town who said it didn't appear to matter who was in the White House, Democrats or Republicans.

Libs of TikTok creator defiantly refuses to back down after identity unmasked: 'Never gonna happen',"The creator behind the Libs of TikTok account took a defiant stand Tuesday, saying in an interview that she will not back down in the face of intimidation from the mainstream media.

What is the background?

The Washington Post published a story on Tuesday unmasking the identity of the woman who runs the popular Twitter account.

The Post claimed the story was necessary because the account has impacted the public discourse. However, the story amplifies a narrative from Media Matters that claims the account is harmful to the LGBT community. In reality, Libs of TikTok simply reposts videos of teachers who espouse woke and progressive ideology, thus giving them more attention.

What did the creator say?

Speaking with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, the creator of Libs of TikTok confirmed she will not back down.

""I think that what I am doing is very effective and I think that a lot of people wanted to shut me down, they wanted to intimidate me into silence,"" the woman said. ""Unfortunately for them, that’s just never gonna happen.""

Fortunately, the woman confirmed she is bunkered down in a safe location despite having her address unmasked because the Post initially linked to her real estate license, which included the personal details.



""The past two days have been very chaotic and overwhelming. I had to make some travel plans really fast that I was not planning on earlier,"" she said. ""There was a little bit of coordination that had to happen, and I am now in a location where I don't think anyone would find me, not at any of the locations that [reporter] Taylor Lorenz leaked or that anyone can find. But it’s been a little tough, but I'm not going to let this get me down.""

Anything else?

Since the Washington Post published the exposé, Libs of TikTok has amassed an additional 200,000 followers on Twitter. That means more people will now see content reposted by Libs of TikTok precisely because of the Post's story.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/libs-hate-van-jones-biden,2022-04-20
"Deundrea Holloway charged with murder in decapitation death of Liese Dodd,","An 8-months pregnant woman was reportedly decapitated at her home in Illinois, and her head was discarded in a dumpster. Police believe that the ex-boyfriend is behind the grisly murder of the young woman and her unborn child.

Deundrea Holloway, 22, was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of intentional homicide of an unborn child, and one count of dismembering a human body in the death of 22-year-old Liese Dodd and her unborn baby girl.

Heidi Noel, Dodd’s mother, hadn't heard from her daughter in days, so she reportedly went to her home in Alton – where she had recently moved to. Shortly before 1 p.m. on June 9, Noel allegedly entered the home and found her daughter's headless corpse.

Police later found Dodd's head in a dumpster near her home, according to court documents.

""Two hours after Dodd was found dead, Gillespie police were investigating a bicycle theft about 30 miles away from Alton, in their small town of 3,000 residents. The bike’s owner gave police a description of the man pedaling away on the stolen bike, and police arrested Holloway based on that description,"" according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The outlet reported that the suspect was ""combative and uncooperative when officers brought him to their police station,"" according to Gillespie Police Department Chief Jared DePoppe – who added that Holloway attempted to hit his head against a wall and refused to provide his name. Holloway was booked into the Macoupin County Jail as a ""John Doe.""

Holloway did not have any blood on his clothing or any signs of recently being involved in a horrific crime.

The Alton Police Department informed other local law enforcement agencies in the area that they were in search of a murderer.

Holloway was connected to the horrific murder after it was revealed that he had an on-and-off dating relationship with Dodd for about two years. It was also revealed that Holloway was not the father of Dodd's unborn baby.

“What was observed, what was learned, what was found, was absolutely terrible,"" said Alton Police Department Chief Marcos Pulido – who was visibly shaken. ""Every murder is absolutely terrible. I will never take that away. But what happened to 22-year-old Liese Dodd, who had just moved to Alton, is beyond reprehensible. It’s abominable. It is completely terrible what happened to her.""

""She was savagely, savagely killed,"" Pulido angrily said as he held up a photo of Dodd. ""She was decapitated. Decapitated by a freaking savage monster. Her unborn child was also killed as a result of this. So she was brutally murdered as well as her unborn child.""

Dodd was expecting her first child on July 27. Before she was murdered, Dodd and her family were in the process of planning a baby shower.

""We were planning her baby shower for the end of this month,"" Noel told KMOV. ""I had just sent out invitations the prior Saturday for the baby shower.""

""We were just excited and gathering the items you need to have a baby,” Noel explained. “She wasn’t set on a name yet. [She] said 'my little bean.' So, we essentially were calling the baby, ‘baby bean.'""



The distraught mother said her daughter had ""a beautiful smile.""

""She was just a bright light that cared for everyone,"" Noel said. ""She had a big heart. She'd do anything for anyone. She'd go out of her way to help people.""

A GoFundMe campaign has been launched to provide assistance to the grieving family.

Holloway is being held on $2 million bail, and is scheduled to appear in Madison County Circuit court on June 24.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/libs-of-tiktok-creator-defiantely-refuses-to-back-down-after-identity-unmasked-never-gonna-happen,2022-06-20

However, the liberal lawmaker still maintained that she was the victim of the situation and somehow managed to blame Republican women.

During the Congressional Baseball Game on Thursday, Sanchez was lifted for a pinch runner. As the Democratic representative was jogging in foul territory, she gave the middle finger as she passed the Republican dugout.

Sanchez issued a statement on her outlandish behavior on Friday – which made it seem that she flipped the bird because of rude comments made by GOP lawmakers.

“The Congressional Baseball Game is one of my favorite events of the year. It’s a great cause and brings both sides of the aisle together for a night off from partisan politics,” Sanchez said. “That is why it really struck a nerve when I heard an offensive and misogynistic comment from the Republican side on my way back to the dugout.”

""In the heat of the moment, I reacted. I have no tolerance for men who make women feel like they are unimportant or don’t belong – especially on the field,"" she continued. ""I will always stand against that kind of bigotry.""

However, the insinuation made by Sanchez was disputed by Corey Inganamort – who is the mascot coordinator for the Washington Nationals.

“I was in the dugout with the Republicans last night. She is lying,” Inganamort said of Sanchez. “Nothing offensive or misogynistic was said by anybody. In fact, everybody was shocked by what @RepLindaSanchez did.”



Sanchez has seemingly changed her story.

Sanchez gave a second statement where she made the clarification that Republicans did not make crude comments to her, but it was a fan.

“It wasn’t the team,” Sanchez told NBC News’ Frank Thorp “It was an obnoxious fan who shouts misogynistic s**t at me every single year.""

Sanchez refused to repeat what the fan said.

""I'm not going to dignify it with a response because it's nasty and it's crude, and it has no place at a charity baseball game,"" Sanchez said.

Sanchez then blamed Republican women for her deceptive first response.

""If the Republican women would have stood up and said that's not acceptable instead of, you know, trashing me for my response then we might have a place where there's no misogyny that's tolerated by anybody anywhere,"" the Democrat argued.

The Republicans would easily coast to victory by trouncing the Democrats by a score of 10-0.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/liese-dodd-murder-deundrea-holloway,2022-07-31
‘Assault on inalienable human rights’: Literary professionals demand publisher cancel Amy Coney Barrett’s book while simultaneously declaring they ‘care deeply about freedom of speech’,"Over 500 individuals in the literary community signed an open letter this month calling for Penguin Random House to cancel Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s new book.



Signatories included “Rick and Morty” writer Erica Rosbe and employees of Barnes & Noble, Random House, and HarperCollins. Various publishers, members of the press, and freelance writers also signed the letter.

The signatories noted that they “care deeply about freedom of speech,” but they also believe that publishers should “uphold their dedication to freedom of speech with a duty of care.”

The letter started with a quote from a TED Talk by David Puttnam, a film producer and environmentalist, declaring that there should be a “balance” between freedom of speech and “wider moral and social responsibilities.”

The signatories claimed that publishing Barrett’s book would be an attack on “international human rights.” Therefore, they argued, canceling the deal would not be an act of censorship.

“We recognize that harm is done to a democracy not only in the form of censorship, but also in the form of assault on inalienable human rights,” the letter stated.

The signatories unified against the book deal because Barrett voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. The letter argued that abortion access is a “fundamental human right.”

They accused Justices Barrett, Roberts, Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Gorsuch of “dismantling protections for the human rights to privacy, self-determination, and bodily autonomy along with the federal right to an abortion in the United States.”

According to the signatories, by voting to overturn the ruling, Barrett is guilty of “inflicting her own religious and moral agenda upon all Americans while appropriating the rhetoric of even-handedness.”

The literary professionals stated that Barrett’s book reportedly mentioned “how judges are not supposed to bring their personal feelings into how they rule."" They accused Barrett of doing precisely that.

The letter slams Penguin Random House for paying Barrett a $2 million advance for the deal.

“This is not just a book that we disagree with, and we are not calling for censorship,” the signatories stated. “Many of us work daily with books we find disagreeable to our personal politics. Rather, this is a case where a corporation has privately funded the destruction of human rights with obscene profits.”

The signatories noted that they refused to “stand idly by” while the literary industry “misuses free speech to destroy our rights.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/linda-sanchez-finger-congressional-baseball-game,2022-10-28
"Liz Cheney compares herself to Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses Grant after losing primary: 'Their courage saved freedom'","Rep. Liz Cheney (R) seemingly compared her situation to those that former Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant triumphantly faced during the Civil War.

Cheney lost the Wyoming Republican primary by nearly 40 points, an even larger margin than polls had predicted.

What did Cheney say?

Speaking to supporters in Jackson, Wyoming, Cheney reminded them that Lincoln lost congressional elections before being elected to the White House.

She said of Lincoln:

The great and original champion of our party, Abraham Lincoln, was defeated in elections for the Senate and the House before he won the most important election of all. Lincoln ultimately prevailed, he saved our Union and he defined our obligation as Americans for all of history.



Speaking at Gettysburg of the great task remaining before us, Lincoln said, ""That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and a government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from this earth.""

After taking shots at former President Donald Trump and his supporters, Cheney invoked Grant and heroic actions he took on the battlefield as a Union general in the Civil War.

Cheney explained that Grant, in the face of heavy fighting and mass casualties, refused to retreat during the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864.

""Refusing to retreat, he pressed on to victory,"" Cheney said. ""Lincoln and Grant and all who fought in our nation's tragic Civil War, including my own great-great-grandfathers, saved our Union. Their courage saved freedom.

""And if we listen closely, they are speaking to us down the generations,"" she continued. ""We must not idly squander what so many have fought and died for.""

Earlier in her speech, Cheney reminded voters that she won the 2020 GOP primary with 73% of the vote, an even greater amount than Cheney's opponent, Harriet Hageman, won on Tuesday.

According to Cheney, she ""could easily have done the same again,"" but ""it would have required that I go along with President Trump's lie about the 2020 election.""

""That was a path I could not and would not take,"" Cheney vowed. ""No House seat, no office in this land is more important than the principles that we are all sworn to protect, and I well understood the potential political consequences of abiding by my duty.""

Anything else?

Meanwhile, Cheney confirmed early Wednesday that she is considering a presidential campaign.

""That’s a decision that I’m going to make in the coming months. I’m not going to make any announcements here this morning. But it is something that I am thinking about, and I’ll make a decision in the coming months,"" she said on NBC's ""TODAY"" show.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/literary-professionals-demand-cancellation-amy-coney-barrett-book,2022-08-17
Rep. Liz Cheney accuses House GOP leadership of enabling racism,"GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming on Monday accused House Republican leadership of enabling racism.

""The House GOP leadership has enabled white nationalism, white supremacy, and anti-semitism. History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse. @GOP leaders must renounce and reject these views and those who hold them,"" Cheney tweeted.

In response to Cheney's post, former Republican National Committee chair Michael Steele tweeted, ""Word.""



""She's right, you know... "" leftist MSNBC host Joy Reid tweeted.

""My colleague has it right,"" Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. of New Jersey tweeted. ""You can draw a direct line from the dangerous rhetoric and incitement of trump and gop leaders and the violence of rampaging neo-nazis, militia maniacs, Capitol insurrectionists and other rightwing domestic terrorists.""

Cheney's tweet came after a white 18-year-old man perpetrated a shooting on Saturday at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York. The attack left 10 people dead, all of whom were black — three others people were wounded, including two white people and one black person, according to the Associated Press. The individual has been arraigned on a murder charge, but has pleaded not guilty.

""How do we know Liz Cheney is correct?"" Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California tweeted. ""Because @GOPLeader refuses to condemn white replacement theory, which radicalized Buffalo murderer. And MAGA Republican @EliseStefanik ran ads promoting the vile, racist and anti-Semitic replacement theory.""



In a statement, Stefanik senior adviser Alex deGrasse has rejected the idea that Stefanik ever promoted racism.

""Any implication or attempt to blame the heinous shooting in Buffalo on the Congresswoman is a new disgusting low for the Left, their Never Trump allies, and the sycophant stenographers in the media,"" deGrasse said in the statement. ""Despite sickening and false reporting, Congresswoman Stefanik has never advocated for any racist position or made a racist statement.""

Last year, Cheney was kicked out of a House leadership role. The congresswoman was one of the 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of impeaching then-President Donald Trump in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot. In May, 2021, the outspoken Trump critic was was ousted from her role as House Republican conference chair. Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York was later selected to fill the slot.

Cheney and GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois are the only two Republicans serving on the House select committee tasked with investigating the Jan. 6 episode. The congresswoman, who has served in the House since 2017, is seeking re-election, but Trump has endorsed challenger Harriet Hageman who is vying to defeat Cheney in the GOP primary.

Los Angeles Democrat DA failed to prosecute illegal alien who instead went free and stabbed 8 people in Las Vegas,"Democrat Jackie Lacey was the Los Angeles County District Attorney from 2012-2020. Lacey charged 32-year-old Yoni Barrios with criminal domestic violence in 2019. Had she secured a timely conviction, Barrios would not have been able to allegedly stab eight people and murder both 47-year-old Brent Allan Hallet and 30-year-old Maris Mareen Digiovanni on October 6. However, the case never went to trial, and Barrios was ultimately permitted to roam freely in the United States.

Charged, not tried

Barrios is a criminal noncitizen from Guatemala. The Nevada GOP noted that Barrios would not have been able to hurt Nevadans if the U.S. border had been secure.

Although his illegal entry into the U.S. may have been legal grounds to get Barrios off of American streets, there were two additional opportunities that were also fumbled.

In 2016, Barrios was stopped for speeding and driving without a license in Riverside, California. He received only a citation and a fine.

The Daily Mail obtained documents indicating that Barrios was charged with a violent crime in July 2019 by former Los Angeles D.A. Jackie Lacey. The corresponding criminal domestic violence incident took place on August 18, 2018. A conviction would have meant up to four years in prison followed by deportation.

While Lacey reportedly filed the case approximately one year after the incident, the first pre-trial hearing did not take place until April 8, 2021.

Since Lacey had failed to bring the criminal domestic violence case to court in a timely fashion, the judge dismissed it on the first day of the trial, citing the state's penal codes 1381, 1381.5, and 1382.



California has strict speedy trial laws. California Penal Code Sec. 1382 states that the ""court ... shall order the action to be dismissed ... [in] a felony case, when a defendant is not brought to trial within 60 days of the defendant's arraignment on an indictment or information, or reinstatement of criminal proceedings ... or within 90 days after notice of the writ or order is filed in the trial court and served upon the prosecuting attorney.""

Notwithstanding the judge's insistence that the case was dismissed owing to delays, Eric Siddall, vice president of the Association of Los Angeles Deputy District Attorneys, told the DailyMail.com, ""If the case was thrown out by the judge, it was probably because of witness issues.""

A preventable rampage



Barrios allegedly began his unprovoked stabbing spree on October 6 outside the Wynn Casino in the 3100 block of South Las Vegas Boulevard. Brandishing a large kitchen knife, he reportedly began stabbing people on the sidewalk and then proceeded south down the street, stabbing several additional victims.

According to his arrest report, he ""started running and looking for groups of people so he could 'let the anger out.'""

Police indicated that Barrios stabbed eight people, one of whom died on the scene and another of whom later died at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.

When concerned citizens gave chase, Barrios allegedly fled, only to be captured by Las Vegas police and Sands security guards.

Anna Westby, who survived a stab in the back, held Maris DiGiovanni in her arms as she was dying. She said that Barrios, armed with a knife, had claimed to be a new chef. Showcasing his weapon, Barrios allegedly said he had ""created this new brand of knives with his chef business"" and then asked the victims to pose with him for a photo with his logo. When the victims refused, Barrios reportedly began stabbing them.

Barrios, who was charged last week with two counts of open murder with a deadly weapon and six counts of attempted murder with a deadly weapon, appeared in court on October 11. He was appointed a public defender and ordered to be held without bail.

He is scheduled to appear again for a preliminary hearing on January 12.

"Los Angeles prosecutors drop charges against Konnech CEO Eugene Yu, accused of overseeing 'largest data breach in United States history'","In an abrupt and hushed post-election reversal on Wednesday, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office (DAO) dropped all charges against Eugene Yu, citing ""potential bias"" in the investigation. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge granted the dismissal per the DAO's request.

Yu, a 64-year-old Chinese national, is the CEO of the Michigan-based election software company Konnech, which licensed its proprietary PollChief software to various municipalities and counties across the U.S..

Yu was arrested on Oct. 4 and charged with personal data theft, allegedly storing sensitive American information on servers in communist China, and grand theft by embezzlement.



Prosecutor Eric Neff previously stated that the crimes allegedly committed by Konnech amounted to the ""largest data breach in United States history.""

What are the details?



DAO spokesman Tiffiny Blackwell said in a statement, ""We are concerned about both the pace of the investigation and the potential bias in the presentation and investigation of the evidence. ... As a result, we have decided to ask the court to dismiss the current case, and alert the public in order to ensure transparency.""

The alleged bias is likely in reference to the nature of the complaint that first prompted the investigation into Konnech.

According to the DAO, the complainant was Gregg Philipps of the Texas-based voter integrity group True the Vote.

Gregg Philipps and True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht accused Konnech of being ""owned by the Chinese Communist Party"" and involved in the ""subversion of our elections.""

Philipps and Engelbrecht are presently fighting a defamation lawsuit launched by Konnech for these claims and ""accusations of treason, espionage, bribery, and election fraud.""

Yu's lawyer, Gary Lincenberg, claimed, ""Mr. Yu is an innocent man,"" and accused ""conspiracy theorists"" of seizing upon the Konnech CEO's arrest to ""further their political agenda.""

Dismissal not necessarily a dead end

Reuters reported that since the judge granted the DAO's motion to dismiss the case without prejudice, charges can be refiled.

Without explicitly committing to refiling the charges, the DAO indicated it would ""assemble a new team, with significant cyber security experience to determine whether any criminal activity occurred"" on the basis of the ""immense volume of digital data"" it had collected in the case.

The New York Times reported that the DAO hasn't indicated whether Konnech had stored data in China or whether Yu might still face additional criminal charges.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/los-angeles-democrat-da-failed-to-prosecute-illegal-alien-who-instead-went-free-and-stabbed-8-people-in-las-vegas,2022-11-13
Loudoun County father arrested at school board meeting for standing up for kids and against leftist indoctrination cleared of wrongdoing,"A Loudoun County dad was criminally charged and smeared as an extremist after he took a stand at a school board meeting in June 2021 against leftist indoctrination and ""moral decay."" On Wednesday, he was cleared of wrongdoing.

After his vindication in court, Jon Tigges told TheBlaze that while he does not advocate getting arrested, every person has to come to their own understanding of ""what God is calling them to say and do.""

For some, this might mean they ""simply stop living their life on Facebook and have someone over for dinner. For others, it may be reconciling with estranged family members. ... But to do nothing in the midst of decay and injustice is disobedience [to God],"" he added. ""The greatest paradox is that we must die to truly live.""

What's the background?

Jon Tigges was arrested on June 22, 2021, and charged with trespassing after he refused to leave a Loudoun County school board meeting that apparently did not go the way the board members wanted.

TheBlaze previously reported that the district and its board had made national headlines over the ""pornographic"" content in assigned books, their mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the suspension of a Christian teacher who opposed transsexual policies, and a student claim that the administrators' admission of transsexuals into girls' locker rooms put her in danger.

Over 250 people signed up to express their concerns about the school board's proposed transsexual accommodations, critical race theory, and other leftist designs foisted upon kids in the county.

Officials tried to prematurely end the meeting while concerned citizens, including Tigges, attempted to give their testimonies.



According to Loudoun Now, school board chairman Brenda Sheridan (Sterling) halted the meeting, claiming that members of the crowd were being disorderly. Superintendent Scott Ziegler, who was indicted over his handling of transsexual rapes and fired last month, then declared the gathering an ""unlawful assembly,"" ordering the board room to be cleared.

Tigges told the sheriff clearing the room that he intended to stay until everyone had an opportunity to speak — only 51 of the 259 had been heard — and that the meeting, which was scheduled to run at least another hour, was technically not over.

He was handcuffed and dragged outside.

In a video of the arrest, Tigges can be heard informing the deputies taking him away, ""This is an unlawful arrest. I have a First Amendment right.""

In September 2021, Tigges was found guilty of trespassing by Judge Ian Williams in a Virginia district court.



Tigges announced his appeal soon thereafter, noting, ""Public officials can't stop public comments just because they don’t like what is being said, nor can they demand that attendees not make noise of any kind.""

Judge Douglas Fleming Jr. of the 20th Judicial Circuit in Virginia happened to agree with him.

Vindicated

On Wednesday, Fleming cleared Tigges of any wrongdoing.

Fleming found both that Tigges had a First Amendment right to attend the meeting and that Ziegler had no right to declare the meeting an ""unlawful assembly,"" thereby nullifying the grounds for the trespassing charge, reported the Federalist.

""Unlike the first two judges who ruled against my case, Judge Fleming actually made a ruling based on state statutes. ... The first judge stated that since Ziegler didn’t 'feel safe” he could have peaceful protesters arrested. The second judge determined that a person’s constitutional right to speech and assembly were not allowed during a meeting recess,"" Tigges told TheBlaze. ""Three's a charm I guess.""

Tigges suggested that the ordeal opened his eyes ""to just how deep and dark the rabbit hole of evil really is. Helped me see that real freedom is grounded on (1) faith, (2) family, and (3) friends — not government.""



The Loudoun father indicated that his grounding is now firmer than its ever been. ""God has never been more real or personal in my life,"" he said.

In terms of his family and friends, Tigges credits his wife, Chris, for withstanding what was ""really a rough ride"" and coming out even stronger and the ""amazing people we met through this.""

Even his wedding venue business, Zion Springs, which was canceled by its major referrers such as WeddingWire and TheKnot, and ultimately lost over $1 million in revenue, has rebounded, enjoying its best year ever in 2022.

While his business turns a profit, Tigges noted that he has profited from the insights he gleaned during this protracted battle to peaceably assemble and speak out against the school board's adoption and advancement of radical leftist agendas — a battle in which he and parents like him were smeared as domestic terrorists by the National School Boards Association and by elements of the Biden administration.

""I learned that I needed to stop expecting someone else to do something and take responsibility for what I could influence. That started with a long look in the mirror and realizing I had neglected giving time, treasure, and talents to my community,"" he said.

Tigges noted that he will move forward with the understanding that ""the biggest problem ... was not that bad people are going to do bad things. I knew that already. The solution is to get good people to do good things.""

""God's people sin by their silence. Faith without works is dead,"" Tigges suggested, noting, ""We don't trust God when we display inaction in the face of justice.""

The Loudoun father called on other Christians to similarly look in the mirror and to challenge ""the depravity all around them. The Bible is clear that change in our world starts with the Church.""

Tigges indicated he will be launching a podcast on Friday called ""Bedrock Blueprints,"" in which he'll discuss frameworks based on truth.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/los-angeles-prosecutors-drop-charges-against-konnech-ceo-eugene-yu-accused-of-overseeing-largest-data-breach-in-united-states-history,2023-01-05
"Portland sues Louis Vuitton for unpaid 2020 taxes, the same year the store was looted by rioters","In 2020, rioters and looters ransacked the Louis Vuitton store in Portland, Oregon, stealing an estimated $300,000 in merchandise and causing another $500,000 in damages. The city filed a lawsuit against the store in late August for failing to pay $40,000 in taxes and penalties from 2020.



Local media outlets have questioned whether Louis Vuitton might be withholding the funds because the city and county failed to provide adequate protection to the store during the riots. Many businesses in the downtown Portland area were damaged during the protests.

Portland alleged that the luxury retailer owes the city $23,825 in business taxes, penalties, and interest. The lawsuit also stated that Louis Vuitton owes the county another $18,443 in unpaid taxes, the National Review reported.

In the case, the city claimed that it had made the company aware of the overdue charges. However, Portland reported that Louis Vuitton has not filed reports or paid the outstanding dues.

National Review obtained a copy of the lawsuit, but the case does not specify why the luxury retailer refused to pay taxes for that year.

On May 29, 2020, rioters and looters entered Portland’s Pioneer Place mall, a shopping center with many luxury stores. Videos of the rioters went viral on social media, showing them smashing the glass storefront at Louis Vuitton, pushing their way inside, and running out with designer handbags.



Rioters also targeted H&M, Starbucks, Apple, and Capital One storefronts located inside the shopping center.

The 35 reported riots during the summer of 2020 cost the Portland Police Bureau over $12 million.

The vice president of research for the Cascade Policy Institute in Portland, Eric Fruits, told the National Review that it is unclear why Louis Vuitton has not paid taxes to the city for 2020. He stated that there could be several factors, including that the luxury store might be challenging the city’s new Portland Clean Energy Fund, which adds a new 1% tax on larger retailers.

“They might be contesting whether or not they are obligated to pay that tax,” Fruits said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty about who actually has to pay it.”

Fruits also mentioned that the city recently initiated a program that could provide local small businesses that suffered damages during the riots with a $10,000 grant.

However, Louis Vuitton is not a small local business. Even if the French luxury store were provided the grant money, it would hardly make a dent in the reported $800,000 in damages and stolen goods. The city has already paid out $720,000 to 135 businesses impacted by the summer of rage.

Fruits stated, “What a messed up world we live in where a business pays their business income tax, a big chunk of that is supposedly for public safety, and then they have to pay taxes again to support a fund to cover the damages because there’s no public safety.”

According to Fruits, if Louis Vuitton refuses to pay 2020 taxes because of the lack of protection during the riots, he believes it will be a challenging case to win.

Louis Vuitton has not addressed questions from the media regarding the lawsuit. The luxury retailer did not respond to requests for comment, reported Oregonian and Portland's KOIN.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/loudoun-county-father-arrested-at-school-board-meeting-for-standing-up-for-kids-and-against-leftist-indoctrination-cleared-of-wrongdoing,2022-09-07
"Male rapist sent to women's prison after 'transitioning' before trial. Despite Scottish first minister's trans agenda, she now admits that was not a great idea.","A Scottish man was convicted this week of raping two women. Prior to his trial, he began identifying as female. While he changed his name and put on a wig, he held onto his manhood and his capacity to reoffend. Nevertheless, after his conviction, he was sent to an all-women's prison.

This decision, consistent with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's LGBT agenda and the corresponding radical legislation she has helped to advance, has proved intolerable to the British public and has since been reversed.

What's the background?

31-year-old Adam Graham, who now calls himself Isla Bryson, raped his first victim on Sept. 16, 2016, in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. He raped another woman on June 27, 2019, in Drumchapel, Glasgow.

The Telegraph reported that the rapist ""transitioned"" after being accused of the second sexual assault. Bald, muscular, and decorated with face tattoos, this transition apparently consisted of the rapist throwing on a blonde wig and some lipstick, although he claims to be taking hormones.

When asked about whether he would have his genitals removed, the rapist stated, ""I obviously want all the surgery that the NHS can provide.""

Paulette Hamilton, a Labor member of parliament, said, ""We have to respect that he is transitioning to a woman.""

Scottish Tory community safety spokesman Russell Findlay said, ""This rapist decided that he was no longer a man only after appearing in court on a rape charge.""

""We now have the utterly perverse situation where a Scottish court refers to someone who says he identifies as female using 'her penis' to rape two vulnerable women,"" Findlay added. ""We warned of the inevitability of this happening if the SNP’s gender self-ID law passed, but for it to have become reality is deeply worrying and an affront to the victims.""

The Scottish National Party, helmed by Sturgeon, passed the ""Gender Recognition (Scotland) Bill"" in December, enabling Scots ""of either gender [to] apply to the Registrar General for Scotland for a gender recognition certificate on the basis of living in the other gender,"" without obtaining or providing a medical diagnosis for gender dysphoria.

Sturgeon's so-called reforms would also cut the duration a person must live in their ""acquired gender"" from two years to roughly six months.

LGBT activist groups hailed this as a ""big step forward.""

The U.K. conservative government vetoed the bill, enraging Sturgeon, who tweeted in reply that the veto constituted a ""full-frontal attack on our democratically elected Scottish Parliament and its ability to make its own decisions on devolved matters.""

Sturgeon made clear that she would go to great lengths to save her so-called reforms, reported the Telegraph.

The British government's minister for Scotland, Alister Jack, suggested that such so-called reforms might create ""significant complications"" and lead to ""more fraudulent or bad faith applications,"" reported Time magazine.

Although Sturgeon's legislation is presently in limbo, Scottish institutions already go to great lengths to accommodate transsexuals.

Since 2014, the Scottish Prison Service allows convicts, per its gender identity policy, to be located corresponding with the ""new gender in which they are living"" on a case to case basis.

The Times reported that half of transsexual inmates in SPS facilities began their ""transition"" after they were convicted.

Graham, now Bryson, was convicted at the High Court in Glasgow on Jan. 24. His sentencing will take place on Feb. 28.

The male rapist was reportedly sent to HMP Cornton Yale, an all-women's prison in Stirling.

The backlash

The rapist's estranged wife Shonna Graham told MailOnline that the convict's transition was a ""sham for attention,"" and that he was ""bullsh****** the authorities"" to avoid being incarcerated with other men.

Joana Cherry, a Scottish politician who chairs the Joint Committee on Human Rights, told Times Radio, ""To many people, it will look like this convicted rapist has gamed the system in order to try and garner sympathy and to end up in a women's prison. ... Women in prison are very vulnerable. Many women in prison have themselves been abused and have suffered injuries over the years.""

Cherry added, ""I'm very concerned about the safety of women prisoners, with whom a convicted rapist has been placed.""

Rachael Hamilton, a conservative member of the Scottish parliament, tweeted, ""The Isla Bryson case confirms our worst fears about predatory men gaining access to women’s spaces. Nicola Sturgeon didn’t listen to the warnings from experts, academics, witnesses or women’s groups during the passage of the gender self-ID Bill.""

Transitioning from women's to men's prison

The backlash evidently proved too much to manage.

Sturgeon, who previously said she stands ""full-square behind trans people,"" announced Thursday, ""Given the understandable public and parliamentary concern in this case, I can confirm to Parliament that this prisoner will not be incarcerated at Cornton Vale women’s prison.""

The SNP leader and staunch transsexual activist conceded that it was imprudent to have a male rapist incarcerated in a female prison, reported the Guardian.

However, Sturgeon ultimately pinned the decision on the SPS, claiming, ""The Scottish Prison Service is in the process of giving effect to the decision it has taken not to incarcerate this prisoner in Cornton Vale.""

Scottish Ccnservative leader Douglas Ross characterized the decision as a ""screeching U-turn.""

Ross noted that the warrant issued by the court had called for the rapist to be sent to a men's prison in Glasgow, however, this was reportedly overruled by the SPS.

The Express reported that prison bosses referenced guidance from Sturgeon's party stating that transsexual convicts should be sent to prisons corresponding to their sex they identify with.

""We need to know why the Scottish Prison Service, which is accountable to SNP ministers, chose to overrule the court’s recommendation that this person ought to be sent to Barlinnie,"" said Ross.

When pressed by Ross on the subject, Sturgeon said, ""There is no automatic right for a trans woman convicted of a crime to serve their sentence in a female prison, even if they have a gender recognition certificate. Every case is subjected to rigorous individual risk assessment and as part of that the safety of other prisoners is paramount.""

Sturgeon tempered her admission with the claim that it is important ""that we do not even inadvertently suggest that somehow trans women pose an inherent threat to women.""

Ross asserted that ""the reality is that Nicola Sturgeon wants to make it easier for brutes like this to legally change gender for their own cynical ends. Yet her refusal to answer this question leaves her self-ID policy in total disarray.""

Susan Smith, a director with the nonprofit For Women Scotland, told the Telegraph, ""The fact that sending a convicted rapist to a women’s jail would even be considered shows how mad this has all become.""

""Only last month, the Scottish Government refused to entertain the possibility of refusing to allow men accused of rape attempting to seek a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC),"" said Smith. ""This case indicates that predatory and abusive men will stop at nothing to manipulate courts and torture victims. Had this man been able to acquire a GRC, there would have been greater protections around the identity of the accused.""

An Oklahoma man has been accused of posing as a psychic so that he could lure his daughter's friend into the back of his car, rape the girl, and then demand she send him nude pictures.

According to the victim, identified only as ""S.S."" in police reports, 36-year-old Andrew Burns, the father of one of her friends, had raped her on three different occasions. The story S.S. told police about her interactions with Burns is particularly horrifying.

Sometime before May 2022, S.S. had gone to Burns' home in Jay, Oklahoma, about 90 miles east of Tulsa, for a sleepover with his daughter, identified as ""E.B."" Both girls were 11 years old at the time. While there, S.S. received a strange text message from someone named ""Casey."" Casey claimed to be a psychic and warned S.S. that her ""family members will get hurt or die"" if she did not ""make out or have sex with"" Burns, the affidavit stated. Burns then allegedly came into the room, claiming that he had received a similar message. He expressed sympathy for the experience but instructed S.S. to sleep on the couch that night. She complied.

Some time that night, Burns awakened the girl and cajoled her out to his car, which was parked outside, the report said. Once there, Burns allegedly began raping the girl digitally. When she complained that it ""hurt really bad,"" he raped her orally instead, she claimed. He stopped only when S.S. lied and claimed that E.B. was watching them through the window, the affidavit stated. ""Casey"" texted her the next day to say that Burns' mind had been erased.

A similar rape occurred later that summer, S.S. claimed, when she went to E.B.'s house again for another sleepover. Once again, S.S. received a strange text message from a psychic, and once again, Burns supposedly coaxed her out to his car. Once there, Burns supposedly raped S.S. digitally and orally.

The third rape, which allegedly occurred in August, was also the most violent. According to S.S., Burns picked her up for E.B.'s birthday party about a half-hour early so that they could be alone. Then in E.B.'s room, Burns supposedly forced S.S. to disrobe, threatening to hurt her brother if she refused to comply. He then took off his own clothes, laid her on the bed, and then put ""his penis inside [her] cooch,"" the affidavit said. S.S. recalled that Burns had placed his hand over her mouth and that she began crying because she couldn't breathe. She then heard Burns moan before she passed out. She woke up fully clothed, she said.

S.S. also alleged that Burns had repeatedly contacted her using different numbers and demanded that she send him nude photos of herself. He promised her that if she sent the pictures, she wouldn't be raped. After she sent him photos of her naked body but with her face obscured, he threatened to show the photos to her grandparents if she did not send him more, she claimed.

Another mutual friend of S.S. and E.B. confirmed that she had seen ""weird"" text messages and that Burns was ""forcefully doing things to her,"" the affidavit said. E.B. had also reportedly received strange messages about getting S.S. drunk, but those messages were not sexual in nature.

When confronted later that month, Burns denied all the allegations. Police then seized his phone and reportedly discovered several images, including nude photos the girl had supposedly sent, as well as a picture of the girl's naked genitals, which Burns allegedly took after he raped her in August.

Burns was arrested on Friday and charged with a slew of crimes: first-degree rape, forcible sodomy, rape by instrumentation, and soliciting a minor for indecent exposure. He was booked in Delaware County Jail but posted the $100,000 bond and was released. It is unclear when he is next scheduled to appear in court.

"Male blood donor, 66, required to state on form if he's pregnant — part of new, woke UK policy. He's turned away from clinic when he refuses to answer.","A 66-year-old man in the United Kingdom who's been donating blood for nearly 50 years was turned away from a clinic last week because he wouldn't answer an apparently new question on a form that asks if the prospective blood donor is pregnant, the Daily Mail reported.

The director of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service told the outlet that the agency has a ""duty to promote inclusiveness — therefore all donors are now asked the same questions.""

What are the details?

Leslie Sinclair — who has donated 125 pints of blood in his life — was told he had to answer a part of the form that asks if he's expecting a child or has been pregnant in the past six months, the Daily Mail said, adding that pregnant women must wait six months after giving birth to donate blood.

After he argued that as a man — and as a person age 66 years — the question doesn't apply to him and that he shouldn't have to answer it, Sinclair said clinic staffers replied that they couldn't accept his blood, the outlet said.

With that, Sinclair walked away over the ""nonsensical"" policy, the Daily Mail reported.

""I am angry because I have been giving blood since I was 18 and have regularly gone along,"" the father of two from Stirling in central Scotland told the outlet. ""I'm very happy to do so without any problem.""

Sinclair added the following to the Daily Mail:

There is always a form to fill in and that's fine — they tend to ask about medical conditions or diseases — and clearly that's because the blood needs to be safe. This time around, there was a question I hadn't seen before: ""Are you pregnant, or have you been in the last six months?"" which required a yes or no answer. I pointed out to the staff that it was impossible for me to be in that position, but I was told that I would need to answer, otherwise I couldn't give blood. I told them that was stupid, and that if I had to leave, I wouldn't be back, and that was it. I got on my bike and cycled away. It is nonsensical, and it makes me angry because there are vulnerable people waiting for blood, including children, and in desperate need of help. But they've been denied my blood because of the obligation to answer a question that can't possibly be answered.

Sinclair added to the outlet that his wife, Margaret, 59, also was appalled: ""She just can't understand it, either.""

What did a health official have to say?

Professor Marc Turner, director of SNBTS, last week told the Daily Mail about the new policy.

""We appreciate the support of each and every one of our donor community and thank Mr. Sinclair for his commitment over a long number of years,"" Turner told the outlet. ""Whilst pregnancy is only a relevant question to those whose biological sex or sex assigned at birth is female, sex assigned at birth is not always visually clear to staff. As a public body we take cognizance of changes in society around how such questions may be asked without discrimination and have a duty to promote inclusiveness — therefore all donors are now asked the same questions.""

Anything else?

The National Health Service in England launched a campaign last week to recruit a million more blood donors over the next five years due to falling numbers during the pandemic, the outlet said, adding that the SNBTS began a drive earlier in June to find 16,000 new donors in the coming year.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-accused-of-posing-as-psychic-so-that-he-could-repeatedly-rape-his-daughter-s-11-year-old-friend-collect-nude-pictures-of-her,2022-06-20
"Man stole from Starbucks tip jar, attempted to run over barista after he was refused $1.25 refund, police say","A man in Oklahoma may have to learn the value of a dollar the hard way. On Sunday, Richard Engle, 61, of Harrah, Oklahoma, about a half-hour east of Oklahoma City, was arrested after workers at a Starbucks in nearby Edmond claimed he stole $1 out of their tip jar.

The incident began the day before, on Saturday, when Engle's wife, whose name has not been released, ordered a drink at that Starbucks location. When she received her order, she found the drink unsatisfactory and complained to the staff, asking for a refund which would have amounted to $1.25. The staff refused and instead suggested she direct her complaint to the Starbucks corporate office.

The woman instead vented her frustration to Engle, her husband. Engle returned to the store on Sunday and repeated his wife's complaint. When the staff once again refused to issue a refund, Engle allegedly attempted to rectify the issue on his own. According to reports, Engle waited until the barista behind the counter turned and faced the other direction. With the person's back to him, Engle supposedly snatched $1 from the tip jar on the counter.

If he did, Engle was not nearly as sneaky about it as he thought he was. A Starbucks employee spotted him and followed him out of the store and into the parking lot, where the situation seems to have escalated considerably. While the Starbucks worker attempted to photograph or otherwise take note of Engle's license plate, Engle supposedly backed his Kia SUV into the worker multiple times before pulling away.

Police were somehow able to track Engle down at his Harrah residence and arrest him. He has been charged with robbery and assault. A search for Engle at the Oklahoma County Detention Center website did not yield any results, indicating he has already been released from custody. It is unclear when he is next expected to appear in court.

Man thrown over the side of a bridge after Chargers game in wild incident caught on video says his attacker has still not been arrested by police,"A man who was caught on video being thrown over the side of a footbridge while exiting a Los Angeles Chargers on November 20th is speaking out, blasting police for not arresting his attacker and saying he no longer feels safe attending games at SoFi Stadium.

In the video, the man, who has been identified as Austin Willenbring, can be seen in a shoving altercation with some unknown individuals, who eventually lift him up and throw him over the side of the bridge railing to a concrete walkway below.

Caution: The video below may be disturbing to sensitive viewers



Wild video shows man getting thrown over bridge at SoFi Stadium www.youtube.com





According to Willenbring, who spoke to WCAL-TV, the altercation began when ""Something caused everyone to kind of move to the right hand side. That's where I feel, whatever happened to the guy — something happened to him — unfortunately he mistaken for me for doing something to him, I had my hands on my sister, never talked to the guy.""

In the video, the men can be seen then dragging Willenbring to the railing before throwing him over.

Willenbring says that he suffered serious injuries as a result of his fall, including a concussion and broken ribs. Even still, he says that he and his sister were able to track down and identify the men who had thrown him over the railing, and even though they were able to make a positive ID to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputies, and had video of the entire incident, police refused to make an arrest. WCAL also reports that there is no record that the man identified by Willenbring has yet been arrested by police or charged with any crime in connection with the incident.

""I just want an adequate investigation by Inglewood,"" Willenbring told WCAL.

Inglewood police told WCAL they are ""still investigating"" the incident, and Inglewood mayor James Butts defended the city's response to the incident, saying, ""Here's the reality: When you have hundreds of thousands of people in one place, when you have alcohol involved, you're gonna have fights. It's an unfortunate fact of life. We have to put things in perspective, six million patrons in three years, three altercations.""

Willenbring says that he plans to cancel his season ticket package because he no longer feels safe going to games.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-stole-from-starbucks-tip-jar-attempted-to-run-over-barista-after-he-was-refused-1-25-refund-police-say,2022-12-04
Joe Manchin exposes how Biden's 'Build Back Better' agenda is a 'complete social realignment',"Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) eerily described President Joe Biden's signature legislative plan on Friday as a program of ""complete social realignment.""

What did Manchin say?

Speaking with a West Virginia radio host, Manchin revealed what he really thinks of the president's ""Build Back Better"" plan and why he refuses to support it.

""First of all, the Build Back Better, way back when, was a complete social realignment — everything in the world you could throw at it,"" Manchin said.

""I was very clear when the president and I talked, I said, ‘Mr. President, this piece of legislation is going to change our country from when John Kennedy said ask not what your country can do for you, what you can do for your country, that piece of legislation will change us to how much more can my country do for me,'"" he continued.

""We are $30.5 trillion of debt and climbing, and we have to be serious about this. But inflation is wreaking havoc on everybody's lives. I don’t care what social-rung you're on,"" Manchin admitted. ""So that’s why that one [was killed]. There's no such thing as Build Back Better again.""

Manchin is defending himself after he was accused of sinking, at least for now, Democrats' latest hope at passing a massive spending package.

The moderate Democrat, however, clarified on Friday that he is not against the policy proposals put forward by his party, especially those that focus on energy and climate. Rather, his concern is not exacerbating the inflation crisis.

In fact, after the consumer price index showed that inflation rose 9.1% year-over-year in June, Manchin promised he would not support any new spending packages for the foreseeable future.

What are Democrats saying?

House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) told reporters last week there is ""incredible frustration"" within Democratic ranks over Manchin repeatedly blocking Biden's agenda.

""We’re all going to die,"" Yarmuth said of Manchin tanking Democrats' climate goals, NBC News reported.

""We’ve got one person who’s trying to dictate policy for the entire country and that’s a shame,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, we have one Democrat who thinks he knows better than every other Democrat.""

According to the New York Times, staffers who work for Senate Democrats ""seethed and sobbed"" after Manchin said he would not immediately support the latest spending package.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-thrown-over-the-side-of-a-bridge-after-chargers-game-in-wild-incident-caught-on-video-says-his-attacker-has-still-not-been-arrested-by-police,2022-07-18
Manhunt underway after NYPD officer left in critical condition with fractured skull in latest of a series of armed robberies,"At 10:50 a.m. on Tuesday, three masked men exited a black Honda sedan on Olmstead Avenue in the Bronx and ambushed a 48-year-old off-duty NYPD officer.

Officer Muhammed Chowdhury, a father of three, was out jogging ahead of his 3 p.m. shift at the Central Park Precinct. The three suspects attacked him in broad daylight, striking him multiple times in the head and taking off with his cellphone, car keys, and wallet.

When fellow police officers located Chowdhury, he was unconscious and reportedly bleeding from the ear. At Jacobi Medical Center, he was found to have a fractured skull and bleeding in the brain.

According to his cousin Shobu Ahmed, the 18-year police veteran is presently unable to assist his fellow officers in determining who was responsible. ""He's not really, really 100%.""

Police are now conducting a manhunt for the three suspects involved in this robbery and in several others.

Police suspect that this attack is the latest in a series of 19 car-jackings, assaults, and robberies committed throughout the Bronx and Queens by the trio.



A video taken Monday is said to show another such instance where a 36-year-old victim on Quimby Avenue in the Bronx was robbed at knife-point by three men who had similarly exited a black sedan.

Police have suggested that the trio may have started their crime spree on August 1, when they allegedly carjacked a 35-year-old man's 2011 Hyundai Sonata in Morris Park at knife-point.

The New York Daily News reported that the three are also believed to have perpetrated an assault and robbery on August 5 in the Castle Hill section of the Bronx, a carjacking at gunpoint of a 2020 BMW in Pelham Gardens, and several more armed car-jackings starting on August 7.

Patrick Lynch, the president of the NYC Police Benevolent Association, issued a statement saying: ""While we pray at our injured brother's beside tonight, police officers across this city are searching for the cowards who did this to him ... Make no mistake: we will find them.""



Without naming any one prosecutor, politician, or mayor in particular, Lynch also said, ""We will need the rest of the justice system to step up and do its job ... This is what happens when our leaders refuse to hold criminals accountable — not even a police officer can walk these streets safely.""



Lynch may have a point. The year started off with the shooting of five NYPD police officers, four in under 72 hours.

As for robberies, just recently, on August 19, another off-duty NYPD officer was targeted by three masked men, but in this instance, the suspects robbed the victim at gunpoint and drove a white car. The suspects pulled up to the officer outside El Jefe Sports Cantina in Washington Heights, pistol-whipped the officer's cousin, and took the officer's wallet and phone.

On July 27, an off-duty NYPD officer had his firearm, wallet, keys and police identification stolen at gunpoint in the Bronx.

Anti-police hostility, bail reform, rising crime, and the perceived lack of support from ""the rest of the justice system"" may have spurred the mass resignation the NYPD is currently facing. 2,465 police officers have filed to leave the NYPD this year, 1,098 of whom are doing so without qualifying for a full pension.

Vincent Vallelong, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, stated ""Politicians need to have the police's back, and we need our district attorneys to actually go out and do the job that they swore an oath to do.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/manchin-build-back-better-social-realignment,2022-08-24
Maniac allegedly murdered female coworker who repeatedly refused his advances: Police,"A Minnesota man is facing murder charges after a female coworker was brutally gunned down in the parking lot of the facility where they both worked.

According to police, Nicole Hammond, 28, of St. Cloud, Minnesota, was shot in the neck just before 7 a.m. on October 24. When police arrived shortly thereafter, they attempted to render Hammond lifesaving aid, but she died at the scene.

Screen shot of FOX 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul YouTube video

Police then learned from Hammond's coworkers at Dubow Textile Inc. that another employee, 36-year-old Jordan Carpenter, had been spotted in the parking lot shortly before a gunshot was heard. He then allegedly got into his vehicle and left the premises.

Coworkers also indicated to police that Carpenter had a ""bad temper"" and that he had made several romantic advances toward Hammond, who was not interested. In a subsequent investigation, police found that Hammond and Carpenter had exchanged several angry text messages the night before she died. In the text messages, Hammond stated firmly that she did not want Carpenter to touch or manipulate her. She also requested him ""not to make things uncomfortable at work.""









While police were interviewing Dubow staff about the shooting, they learned that one employee was then on the phone with Carpenter and that he was currently located at his sister's home in Sauk Rapids, just a few miles away. Police found Carpenter there and arrested him without incident just before 10 a.m. During the arrest, they reportedly recovered a 9mm handgun and a loaded magazine with rounds matching a casing found at the scene. Carpenter was then booked on one charge of second-degree murder.

In subsequent conversations with police, Carpenter supposedly admitted that he had been walking toward Hammond's vehicle when she was killed and that he had heard a gunshot. He then said he fled the scene because the sight of Hammond's severely injured body ""traumatized"" him.

""He didn’t render aid, go to work, nor did he call 9-1-1,"" police said.

Carpenter never admitted to killing Hammond.

Dubow CEO Rob Dubow said that management did not know that Carpenter had allegedly been harassing Hammond.

""Unfortunately, we had no idea,"" Dubow stated. ""Any time there is anything that requires our intervention, we step in. But in this case, we had no indication that there was anything awry.""

""Quite honestly, it's my worst nightmare,"" he added.

It is unclear when Carpenter is expected to appear in court.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/manhunt-underway-after-nypd-officer-left-in-critical-condition-with-fractured-skull-in-latest-of-a-series-of-armed-robberies,2022-11-03
Maniac allegedly went on Las Vegas stabbing rampage after getting turned down for photo with showgirls,"Two people were killed and six others injured in a stabbing rampage that took place on the Las Vegas Strip around 11:40 a.m. on Thursday. The suspect arrested in connection with the stabbings is 32-year-old Yoni Barrios. He was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and charged with two counts of open murder with a deadly weapon and six counts of attempted murder with a deadly weapon.

Brandishing a large kitchen knife, the suspect began his brutal attack outside the Wynn Casino in the 3100 block of South Las Vegas Boulevard. The attacks were unprovoked.

Although Barrios first allegedly began stabbing on the sidewalk, he proceeded south down the street and stabbed several more victims. Ultimately, he fled as concerned citizens began to chase him down.

Within minutes of the stabbings, the LVMPD apprehended the suspect with the help of Sands security guards. According to KTNV, police arrested him in front of the Venetian and observed that his sleeves were covered in blood.

Th suspect stabbed eight people, two of whom died. One was pronounced dead on the scene and the other perished later at University Medical Center.

The deceased victims have been identified: 47-year-old Brent Allan Hallett and 30-year-old Maris Mareen DiGiovanni. DiGiovanni, who leaves behind a husband, worked as a teacher at 9th Bridge School in Las Vegas.

Three of the other stabbing victims are reportedly in critical condition.

LVMPD Deputy Chief James LaRochelle stated that this ""was an isolated incident. ... All evidence indicates Barrios acted alone and there are no outstanding suspects at this time.""

The Review-Journal noted that Barrios is not a Las Vegas resident.

One witness told KTNV that the suspect had approached a number of Las Vegas showgirls holding a large knife, which he allegedly explained away, claiming himself to be a chef. He then reportedly asked the women to pose for a photo with him. The witnessed indicated that when the victims refused, the suspect began stabbing them.

The LVMPD indicated on Thursday that the suspect's motive is unknown.

Another witness, Pierre Fandrich of Montreal, Canada, reported seeing ""a lot of blood"" and that he initially mistook the terrified shrieks and cries of the victims for laughter.

Fandrich said that one woman, who appeared to have been stabbed in the back, helped another victim who was on the ground. Another bystander reportedly aided in efforts to resuscitate the woman until first responders arrived.

One tourist from London told KVVU that one victim took off his shirt and tried using it to staunch his bleeding before collapsing at the base of an escalator.

The City of Las Vegas has responded to the accident by beefing up its police presence on the Strip.

Many companies dropping vaccine mandate: 'The rationale ... had become weak',"Many global companies have quietly ended the vaccine mandates they once imposed on their employees and future hires.

According to a report from Axios, Goldman Sachs announced late last month that no employee, except those working in New York City, will be subject to a vaccine mandate as a precondition of their continued or future employment. That policy went into effect earlier this week.

And compared to other companies, Goldman Sachs is relatively late to the game. The international sports and footwear giant Adidas, based in Germany, dropped its vaccine mandates for all employees back in early February.

""Though no longer required, we strongly encourage all employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19,"" an Adidas spokesperson stated in an email at the time. The email also noted that all U.S. employees still had to report their vaccination status to the company.

Adidas followed in the footsteps of Starbucks and Intel, which had both already abandoned their vaccine mandates. Cisco and JPMorgan Chase also changed their vaccine mandate policies this summer.

Business and public health leaders have offered several reasons for the dramatic about-face on vaccine mandates.

Jeff Levin-Scherz, a population health leader at Willis Towers Watson, an investment and risk management company based out of Texas, believes that these companies ""decided that the rationale for [mandates] had become weak enough that they don’t want to continue.""

Because testing and treatment for the COVID virus has progressed so well, vaccines could no longer reasonably be claimed as the only line of defense against further spread.

Others believe that company leaders desperately want employees to return to in-person work, and they see the mandates as a potential barrier to that goal.

According to Axios, Erin Grau of Charter, a media and services company which claims to give ""people the tactical playbook for what work can and should be,"" said that vaccine mandates are expensive and time-consuming for current employees and potentially off-putting for new hires.

In addition to those companies which have reconsidered their vaccine mandates, there are several companies facing lawsuits because of the mandates. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports that several area businesses — including Eli Lilly and Co., Roche Diagnostics, and Ascension St. Vincent, which are all affiliated with the medical industry — have been sued by former and/or current employees who were either forced to take the vaccine against their religious objections or were fired for refusing it. All three companies continue to impose the vaccine mandate, but have not required a booster.

Even the Biden administration has begun to temper its rhetoric on vaccines. It recently issued companies a list of recommendations for combatting COVID this fall and did not include vaccines among them.

Meanwhile, many other major corporations — including Google, Tyson Foods, United Airlines, and Facebook — have kept their vaccine mandates in place.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/maniac-allegedly-went-on-las-vegas-stabbing-rampage-after-getting-turned-down-for-photo-with-showgirls,2022-09-09
Marie Osmond defends refusing her children an inheritance — to protect them from 'laziness and entitlement',"Marie Osmond, one half of the famous duo Donny & Mari, is reiterating her commitment not to leave her children a financial inheritance.

Osmond, 63, told US Weekly in an interview last week that she believes an inheritance, especially among children who expect the financial windfall, only breeds ""laziness and entitlement.""

""Honestly, why would you enable your child to not try to be something? I don’t know anybody who becomes anything if they're just handed money,"" Osmond told the magazine. ""To me, the greatest gift you can give your child is a passion to search out who they are inside and to work.

""That's one of my rules with my kids. If you start it, you finish it. You don't ever have to do it again, but you gotta finish,"" she added. ""And, I just think all [an inheritance] does is breed laziness and entitlement.""

The comments reiterate the sentiment that Osmond first shared three years ago when she publicized her intent not to provide her seven living children with a split of her wealth.

""My husband and I decided that you do a great disservice to your children to just hand them a fortune because you take away the one most important gift you can give your children, and that's the ability to work,"" she said in 2020. ""You see it a lot in rich families where the kids don't know what to do so they get in trouble. So I just let them be proud of what they make.""

Anything else?

Osmond is in good company with her view toward a financial inheritance. NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal, for example, has made it clear he does not believe in handouts.

Last year, O'Neal said his children must present him with multiple college degrees ""in order to get my cheese.""

""They know they have things to fall back on, but it’s not going to be that easy,"" he said of his children. ""In order to get my cheese, you have to present me with two degrees.""

And in 2021, O'Neal famously said, ""My kids are older now, and they're kinda upset with me. ... They're not really upset, but they don't understand. 'Cause I tell them all the time: We ain't rich. I'm rich.'""

New book reveals Gen. Mark Milley sought to 'fight' his commander in chief,"In an August 8 New Yorker piece drawing from Peter Baker's and Susan Glasser's forthcoming book ""The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021,"" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley recounts how he penned a resignation letter addressed to then-President Donald J. Trump shortly after the BLM riots — which injured over 50 Secret Service agents — were dispersed outside the White House in June 2020.

In the letter, which Milley ultimately scrapped, he allegedly wrote: ""I regret to inform you that I intend to resign as your Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ... The events of the last couple weeks have caused me to do deep soul-searching, and I can no longer faithfully support and execute your orders as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is my belief that you were doing great and irreparable harm to my country.""

In one of alleged multiple drafts of the resignation letter, dated June 8, Milley insinuated that Trump ""subscribe[d] to many of the principles that we fought against"" in World War I and in World War II.

Despite suggesting that Trump was dictatorial and an extremist, Milley never submitted his resignation. He spoke instead to political contacts ""including members of Congress and former officials from the Bush and Obama Administrations.""

Former Secretary of Defense and CIA chief Robert Gates is quoted as having told Milley: ""Keep the chiefs on board with you and make it clear to the White House that if you go they all go, so that the White House knows ... this is about the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff quitting in response.""

Milley ultimately decided he would not quit and told his staff, ""I'll just fight him.""

Qualifying Trump's agenda, including withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Germany, and Africa, as ""damage,"" he determined to prevent the president from realizing his goals. ""If they want to court-martial me, or put me in prison, have at it,"" Milley is quoted as having told his staff, adding: ""But I will fight from the inside.""

Just as Milley had telegraphed his intention not to execute possible orders from the president regarding action against America's Chinese communist adversaries, he similarly notified Democrats ""that he would not go along with any further efforts by the president to deploy the machinery of war for domestic political ends.""



House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer were among those he so notified.

According to Baker and Glasser, ""[Former Defense Secretary Mark] Esper and Milley found new purpose in waiting out the President. They resisted him throughout the summer.""

This book preview suggests that Milley, unelected, then all but set American foreign and domestic policy, having assigned himself four goals, including: ""First, make sure Trump did not start an unnecessary war overseas. Second, make sure the military was not used in the streets. ... Third, maintain the military's integrity.""

Declan Leary suggested that these revelations amount to more evidence that Milley nearly mounted a military coup.



When Bob Woodward's and Robert Costa's book ""Peril"" was first published, alleging that Milley offered his Chinese communist counterpart reassurances, legal scholar Jonathan Turley underlined on September 19, 2021, how ""in a system based on civilian control of the military, there can be no blurring of the lines of authority. Good intentions are no defense.""



In his reflection on Milley's conduct, Turley invoked Article 94 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice on mutiny or sedition, which reads: ""(a) Any person subject to this chapter who — (1) with intent to usurp or override lawful military authority, refuses, in concern with any other person, to obey orders or otherwise do his duty or creates any violence or disturbance is guilty of mutiny; ...

Marlon Brando's infamous Academy Awards stand-in Sacheen Littlefeather denounced by her sisters as a 'fraud' and not an Apache,"Sacheen Littlefeather rose to notoriety in 1973 as Marlon Brando's Academy Awards stand-in, denouncing the film industry for its representation of Native Americans. The actress, whose real name was Marie Louise Cruz, died Oct. 2.

Despite Cruz's claims throughout her life of being an Apache, her sisters indicated that Cruz was instead of Hispanic and European heritage and a ""fraud.""

Brando's denunciatory proxy

Her claim to fame was refusing the Oscar for Best Actor on behalf of Brando, who didn't attend the Hollywood ceremony.

""My name is Sacheen Littlefeather. I'm Apache, and I am the president of the National Native American Affirmative Image Committee,"" Cruz said as she stood at the podium in a buckskin dress and moccasins.

Cruz said Brando refused the award because of ""the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry ... and on television in movie re-runs, and also with recent happenings at Wounded Knee.""

Her allusion to Wounded Knee was in reference to the 1973 Incident at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, when armed followers of the American Indian Movement occupied the area for 71 days and shot and paralyzed U.S. Marshal Lloyd Grimm and wounded an FBI agent. The incident, in fact, was still going on during the 1973 Oscars ceremony.

Some audience members jeered Cruz during her brief speech.

Clint Eastwood quipped when presenting the next award, ""I don’t know if I should present this award ... on behalf of all the cowboys shot in all the John Ford westerns over the years.""

The New Yorker's Michael Schulman claimed in September that Cruz ""was poised and courageous, and the mockery she endured was flagrantly sexist and racist.""

Cruz later claimed that after the event she had been ""silenced"" and struggled to find work.

Earlier this year, the Academy held a ""reconciliation"" event for Cruz at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.

David Rubin, former Academy president, wrote to Cruz as part of the organization's apology: ""The abuse you endured because of [the Oscar speech] was unwarranted and unjustified ... The emotional burden you have lived through and the cost to your own career in our industry are irreparable ... We offer both our deepest apologies and our sincere admiration.""

The Academy's accompanying statement said that Cruz had been ""discriminated against for the last 50 years.""

In a statement ahead of the event, Cruz said, ""Regarding the Academy's apology to me, we Indians are a very patient people.""

The European Apache

But according to her sisters, Cruz was the daughter of a Spanish-American and a woman of European descent.

The Guardian, taking Cruz at her word, reported last year that her father ""was Native American, a mix of Apache and Yaqui, and her mother was white.""

Cruz's sister, Rozalind Cruz, had entertained the possibility that their father might have been of ""Yaqui and Spanish"" descent after all, tweeting as much on Oct. 4, and going so far as to try enrolling in the White Mountain Apache Tribe.

However, nearly one month after printing Cruz's obituary calling her an ""Apache activist,"" the New York Times reported that Jacqueline Keeler, a member of the Navajo Nation, produced genealogical research for Rozalind Cruz that placed her application status in doubt.

The research traced the family of Cruz's father back to Mexico in 1850. There was no evidence of him being a Native American or having any Native ancestry.

Orlandi Cruz told the San Francisco Chronicle that her sister Marie's claim of Apache heritage is ""a lie ... My father was who he was. His family came from Mexico. And my dad was born in Oxnard.""

Rozalind Cruz concurred: ""It is a fraud ... It's disgusting to the heritage of the tribal people. And it's just ... insulting to my parents.""

Both sisters identify as ""Spanish,"" suggesting their deceased sister alternatively sought to be an ""American Indian princess. It was more prestigious to be an American Indian than it was to be Hispanic in her mind.""

In her research into whether or not Marie Louise Cruz was a ""Pretendian,"" Keeler found that ""all of the family's cousins, great-aunts, uncles and grandparents going back to about 1880 (when their direct ancestors crossed the border from Mexico) identified as white, Caucasian, and Mexican on key legal documents in the United States.""

None of the ancestors belonging to the woman who called herself Sacheen Littlefeather married anyone reportedly Native American or American Indian.

""Keeler proves Littlefeather was a troubled woman who made the stories of others her own,"" Liza Black, associate professor of history and Native American studies at Indiana University, told the Times.

The paper also reported that [N]ila [N]orthsun — a Shoshone poet and friend of Marie Louise Cruz — suggested that Native identity is ""what you feel in your heart, and what your belief system is,"" seemingly downplaying Cruz's apparent Hispanic and European heritage.

Keeler was not impressed by this line of thinking, writing that ""a U.S. citizen of distant French descent does not get to claim French citizenship. And it would be absurd for that person to wear a beret on stage at the Oscars and speak on behalf of the nation of France.""



Other controversial race claims



Democrat U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) is another high-profile individual whose claims of being part Native American were put to the test in recent years.

TheBlaze reported that Warren identified as Native American on her application for a job at Harvard University and hand-wrote ""American Indian"" in the field for ""race"" on her State Bar of Texas registration card.

In 2018, former President Donald Trump, who had long derided Warren as ""Pocahontas,"" challenged the senator to get a DNA test to prove she was Native American. The test results came back showing that she was only 1/1,024th Native American if at all.

Warren touted this result as proof of her membership to the group.

Over 200 Cherokee and other Native Americans signed an open letter to Warren calling on her to retract claims she had Native American heritage.

Rachel Dolezal, former head of the Spokane, Washington, chapter of the NAACP and former adjunct professor at North Idaho college, long claimed to have both black and Native American heritage.

In 2015, after years of claiming to be black and teaching African-American studies, Dolezal's relatives revealed she was, in fact, white. She subsequently admitted that she was ""born white"" but ""I do consider myself to be black.""

CNN reported that in 2002, she had sued Howard University for allegedly discriminating against her, suggesting the school had favored black students over her at a student art exhibition.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mark-milleys-alleged-military-coup,2022-10-31
Massachusetts man charged with mom's murder commits suicide in his jail cell by choking on wet toilet paper,"A Massachusetts man charged with the alleged murder of his mother committed suicide in his jail cell this weekend by choking on wet toilet paper, authorities said.



Adam Howe, 34, was facing murder charges in the death of his mother, Susan Howe, 69.

On Friday evening, police arrived at Susan Howe's home to perform a wellness check and respond to reports of a fire, according to Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe and Truro Police Chief Jamie Calise.

First responders discovered a body set on fire in front of the Cape Cod home. Adam Howe, who lived with his mother, was on the scene but quickly barricaded himself inside the residence when authorities arrived.

""As the emergency personnel realized that it was a body that was burning, the male subject ran into the house and locked the door,"" officials reported.

Officers forcibly extracted Adam Howe from the residence, placed him under arrest, and brought him to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.

According to the sheriff's office, ""Medical professionals at Cape Cod Hospital examined Mr. Howe and cleared him to return to custody. He was then transported by Mass. State Police to the Ash Street Jail in New Bedford on Saturday afternoon.""

While in custody, Adam Howe was provided with a nylon rip-resistent smock, clothing designed for at-risk prisoners. He was placed on security watch, which required guards to visually check on him every 15 minutes.

The sheriff's office reported that between the visual checks, Adam Howe used wet toilet paper to block his airways. He was found unresponsive around 3:00 p.m. on Sunday.

Bristol County District Attorney Thomas M. Quinn's office stated that three officers and two nurses immediately performed CPR on the suspect. He was then rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Because Adam Howe was believed to have suffered from mental health issues, questions were raised about why he was placed in jail instead of remaining at the hospital. WCVB-TV reported that the hospital allegedly refused to take him due to an unspecified technicality.

Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe said that the ""tragic case illustrates the broken nature of the mental health system, particularly … when entwined in the criminal justice system.""

The New York Post reported that Adam Howe was previously charged in August for breaking into a business and possession of Suboxone without a prescription – a pharmaceutical drug used to treat opioid addiction.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/marlon-brandos-infamous-academy-awards-stand-in-sacheen-littlefeather-denounced-by-her-sisters-as-a-fraud-and-not-an-apache,2022-10-04
Massachusetts school districts prepare for illegal teachers' strikes that threaten school closures again,"Teachers unions in Malden and Haverhill in Massachusetts have voted to authorize teachers' strikes that will begin on Monday if their demands are not met, in spite of the fact that strikes by public sector employees are illegal under Massachusetts law. The strikes threaten to once again impact students whose learning needs have been severely negatively impacted by teacher-driven school closures during the pandemic. This time, teachers are threatening to refuse to return to work Monday over things like their wages, staffing levels, and class sizes.

Deb Gesualdo, president of the Malden teachers union, defended the vote for an illegal strike, telling WBUR, ""Nobody wants to go on strike. Nobody wants to take an illegal action. But we feel that we are backed into a corner and have to. It's very serious.""

By ""backed into a corner,"" Gesauldo means, apparently, that teachers have felt ""disrespected"" by the offers they have received during the collective bargaining process. ""I think it does send a larger and stronger message that we are not going to be stuck in these toxic cycles of endless, disrespectful bargaining that are not just disrespectful to the educators, but are disrespectful to our students, their families and the community,"" Gesauldo said.

Negotiations are scheduled to continue on Sunday in the hopes of averting a strike.

Haverhill, meanwhile, does not intend to take the threatened illegal strike lying down. It has threatened to sue the Haverhill Education Association in superior court, in what ought to be an open and shut case if the strike goes forward. Additionally, it has also reported the union to the state Department of Labor Relations, asking for an investigation into the threats of an illegal strike.

Representatives of both school districts condemned the teachers' unions for threatening to strike, saying that the strikes would not bring the parties closer to a negotiated contract, and would instead only harm students who have already fallen behind academically due to pandemic-related school closures.

At least one elected Democrat in Massachusetts, however, believes not only that the teachers should strike, but also that the law should be changed to specifically allow teachers to unilaterally decide to shut schools down. ""Restoring the right to strike is foundational,"" State Representative Erika Uyterhoeven told WBZ-TV.

According to WBUR, if the strikes go forward tomorrow, approximately 14,000 students will be affected.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/massachusetts-man-charged-with-mom-s-murder-commits-suicide-in-his-jail-cell-by-choking-on-wet-toilet-paper,2022-10-16
Explosive Matt Walsh report on pediatric transgender 'care' from Vanderbilt University Medical Center leads to demands for investigation,"Tennessee Republicans are speaking out against the Pediatric Transgender Clinic at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and Gov. Bill Lee (R) has called for an investigation of the clinic after an explosive report by the Daily Wire's Matt Walsh revealed appalling details of so-called gender-affirming ""care"" provided to children.

On Tuesday, Walsh posted video and archived webpages from Vanderbilt in which doctors discuss how transgender hormone regimens for minors and sex-change surgeries are a ""big money maker"" for the clinic. Additional video shows that staff members were warned that any ""conscientious objection"" to the transgender ""care"" would be frowned upon.

“The ‘pediatric transgender clinic’ at Vanderbilt University Medical Center raises serious moral, ethical and legal concerns,” Governor Lee told the Daily Wire in a statement. “We should not allow permanent, life-altering decisions that hurt children or policies that suppress religious liberties, all for the purpose of financial gain. We have to protect Tennessee children, and this warrants a thorough investigation.”

Walsh summarized his investigative findings in a Twitter thread posted Tuesday.

""My team and I have been investigating the transgender clinic at Vanderbilt here in Nashville. Vanderbilt drugs, chemically castrates, and performs double mastectomies on minors,"" Walsh wrote.

He shared video of a 2018 Medicine Grand Rounds lecture given by Dr. Shayne Sebold Taylor, a physician at the VUMC Clinic for Transgender Health. In the lecture, Taylor discusses how sex-change surgeries ""make a lot of money.""

A female-to-male chest masculinization surgery, also called ""top surgery,"" can bring in as much as $40,000, Taylor states. She also notes that a patient receiving ""routine hormone treatment"" will visit the clinic just a few times each year but ""can bring in several thousands dollars ... and actually makes money for the hospital.""



Taylor goes on to describe how vaginoplasty surgeries, in which a man is castrated and doctors surgically create a fake vagina using tissue from his penis, can make as much as $20,000 in revenue, citing data from the Philadelphia Center for Transgender Surgery. She excitedly states that figure is likely an ""underestimate"" given costs for hospital stay, post-op visits, anesthesia, and other associated medical bills.



She adds that female-to-male ""bottom surgeries,"" in which doctors take skin and other tissues from a woman's forearm or thigh to create a fake penis, can make as much as $100,000 in hospital revenue.

""These surgeries are labor-intensive, there are a lot of follow-ups, they require a lot of our time, and they make money,” Taylor told the audience. “They make money for the hospital.”



In a separate Medicine Grand Rounds lecture, Vanderbilt health law expert Ellen Wright Clayton warns hospital staff that asserting a ""conscientious objection"" to performing transgender ""care"" has ""consequences"" for the patients.

“If you are going to assert conscientious objection, you have to realize that that is problematic,” Clayton said. “You are doing something to another person, and you are not paying the cost for your belief. I think that is a … real issue.”

She said that conscientious objectors would be accommodated to the extent they can find someone else to perform a sex-change surgery.

“I just want you to take home that saying that you’re not going to do something because of your conscientious — because of your religious beliefs, is not without consequences, and should not be without consequences,” she said. “And I just want to put that out there.”

She tells staffers that if they don't want to perform this kind of work, they shouldn't work for Vanderbilt.



Walsh also revealed details about the medical center's ""Trans Buddy"" program, in which Vanderbilt provides trained ""peer advocates"" for gender-dysphoric patients who visit for doctor's appointments or other health care services.

""The 'buddies' are trans activists from the community who attend appointments with trans patients, monitoring the doctors to guard against 'unsafe' behavior such as misgendering,"" Walsh reported.

""Vanderbilt makes their Trans Buddies available to children, too. They make lots of 'services' available to children, including chemical castration. Though at some point in the last month they removed explicit admission of this fact from their site,"" he tweeted, sharing an archived screenshot from the Vanderbilt Pediatric Transgender Clinic website.

Video from the Vanderbilt Psychiatry YouTube channel unearthed by Walsh shows Vanderbilt professionals recommending that ""gender-affirming hormones"" be given to children as young as 13 to prevent them from going through puberty.

Another video shows plastic surgeon Julian Winocour and physician’s assistant Shalyn Vanderbloemen explaining that the clinic will perform ""top surgeries"" on girls as young as 16 if they provide parental consent and have been taking testosterone.

""So, let’s review. Vanderbilt got into the gender transition game admittedly in large part because it is very financially profitable. They then threatened any staff members who objected, and enlisted a gang of trans activists to act as surveillance in order to force compliance,"" Walsh wrote.

""They now castrate, sterilize, and mutilate minors as well as adults, while apparently taking steps to hide this activity from the public view. This is what 'health care' has become in modern America,"" he concluded.

Multiple state and federal Republican lawmakers expressed shock and outrage at Vanderbilt following Walsh's report.

""This evil can not stand in TN,"" said state Rep. Jason Zachary. ""The Legislature must address such abuse of children and act to protect those who face consequences for their religious objections. This will be a priority for me in 2023.""

""We are shocked by what we have seen in these videos,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) tweeted. ""We would hope that VUMC would make better decisions. There is nothing healthy about mutilating the bodies of minor children. We need an investigation into VUMC putting profits ahead of children immediately.""

Republican Rep. Chuck Fleischmann called the report ""incredibly disheartening and completely unacceptable.""

""Tennessee children deserve better than what's happening at VUMC, and I stand alongside Governor @BillLeeTN in demanding a thorough investigation,"" Fleischmann said.

Shortly after Walsh published his Twitter thread, the website for Vanderbilt University Medical Center's Pediatric Transgender Clinic was taken down.

Vanderbilt University Medical Center issued the following statement:

Vanderbilt University Medical Center is now the subject of social media posts and a video that misrepresent facts about the care the Medical Center provides to transgender patients.



VUMC began its Transgender Health Clinic because transgender individuals are a high-risk population for mental and physical health issues and have been consistently underserved by the U.S. health system.



We have been and will continue to be committed to providing family-centered care to all adolescents in compliance with state law and in line with professional practice standards and guidance established by medical specialty societies.



VUMC requires parental consent to treat a minor patient who is to be seen for issues related to transgender care, and never refuses parental involvement in the care of transgender youth who are under age 18.



Our policies allow employees to decline to participate in care they find morally objectionable, and do not permit discrimination against employees who choose to do so. This includes employees whose personal or religious beliefs do not support gender-affirming care for transgender persons.



The Trans Buddy program mentioned in the video has received national acclaim. Its purpose is to provide peer volunteers who support persons who are seeking highly personal care in an unfamiliar environment, and who may have been refused medical services in the past or avoided seeking them out of fear of being met with hostility.

Walsh responded on Twitter: ""They do not specifically deny anything in my report. Their only defense for drugging and mutilating kids is that their parents allegedly consent to it,"" he said. ""That’s all the confirmation you need.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/massachusetts-school-districts-prepare-for-illegal-teachers-strikes-that-threaten-school-closures-again,2022-09-21
Mitch McConnell sends House Democrats stern message after police arrest armed man near Brett Kavanaugh's house,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) delivered a stern message to House Democrats on Wednesday after police arrested an armed man near the residence of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

What happened?

Police arrested a California man near Kavanaugh's home in Maryland shortly before 2 a.m. Wednesday morning.

The man allegedly told police that he wanted to kill Kavanaugh. When police detained the man, he was carrying a gun, knife, and other ""burglary tools,"" the Washington Post reported. Fortunately, the man never set foot on Kavanaugh's property.

The man was allegedly angry about the leaked opinion draft that indicated the Supreme Court had voted to overturn abortion precedents, and was also reportedly under the belief that Kavanaugh would vote to nullify gun control measures.

What did McConnell say?

Shortly after after news broke of the man's arrest, McConnell spoke on the Senate floor and demanded House Democrats pass the Supreme Court Police Parity Act.

The Senate unanimously passed the bill last month after the opinion draft leaked. The bill would extend police protection to the immediate family member of Supreme Court justices or ""any officer of the Supreme Court if the Marshal determines such protection is necessary.""

House Democrats, however, have refused to vote on the bill. Their reasoning? Because it does not extend police protection to law clerks and other Supreme Court staff.

""House Democrats have spent weeks blocking it. The House Democratic majority has refused to take it up. That needs to change — right now,"" McConnell said. ""House Democrats must pass this bill and they must do it today.

""House Democrats need to stop their multi-week blockade against the Supreme Court security bill and pass it before the sun sets today,"" he demanded.

McConnell: House Democrats Must Immediately Stop Blocking Supreme Court Security Bill www.youtube.com

In his brief speech, McConnell attributed the shocking arrest and alleged assassination plot to ""unhinged, reckless, apocalyptic rhetoric"" against the Supreme Court's conservative-leaning justices.

“This is exactly the kind of event that many feared that terrible breach of the Court’s rules and norms could fuel,"" McConnell said. ""This is exactly the kind of event that many worried the unhinged, reckless, apocalyptic rhetoric from prominent figures toward the Court, going back many months, and especially in recent weeks, could make more likely.

“This is exactly why the Senate passed legislation very shortly after the leak to enhance the police protection for the Justices and their families,"" he added. ""This is commonsense, noncontroversial legislation that passed this chamber unanimously.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/matt-walsh-report-children-transgender-vanderbilt,2022-06-08
"'F*** you, Fauci!' Megyn Kelly deconstructs every one of Dr. Anthony Fauci's lies in brutal takedown","Megyn Kelly ripped White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci on her podcast Wednesday, reacting to Fauci's announcement that he will step down from his government role before the end of the year.

The former Fox News anchor blasted Fauci, who told CNN earlier this week he will ""certainly consider"" testifying before Congress after he steps down from his role at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Republicans have promised to call Fauci, the chief government spokesman during the COVID-19 pandemic, to testify on his recommendations and oversight of funding for coronavirus research in Wuhan, China.

""He sounds like he's been invited to afternoon tea at one of our houses,"" Kelly said on SiriusXM's ""The Megyn Kelly Show"" podcast. ""F*** you, Fauci! You don't get to say whether you go. You get a congressional subpoena, you show up, or you get the Steve Bannon treatment.""

Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist to President Donald Trump and a media personality, was found guilty of criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to answer a subpoena to testify on the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.



In a monologue on Wednesday's podcast, Kelly savaged Fauci, accusing him of lying repeatedly to the American people and of encouraging policies that failed to slow the spread of COVID-19 but succeeded in tearing the country apart.



“The truth is that Dr. Fauci, who had a greater hand than anyone in causing Americans to lose their jobs, years of learning, and even their lives — thanks to the social and economic upheaval he helped foist upon us during the pandemic — ought to be ashamed to show his face in polite society,” Kelly said. “Instead the man is self-congratulatory.”

Kelly tore into Fauci's record, blaming his COVID-19 pandemic recommendations for encouraging politicians to enact lockdown policies that she said killed jobs, kept children out of school, and tanked the economy. She accused him of lying about his views on masks and misleading the public by shifting goalposts to get people to accept harsh pandemic restrictions. Kelly said Fauci and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ignored evidence that contradicted their COVID-19 guidance and arrogantly declared that anyone who disagreed with their positions was criticizing ""science.""



“He mocked the idea of natural immunity, eliminating the need for his mandatory, beloved vaccines, despite admitting years earlier that natural immunity is in fact the gold standard,” Kelly said. “His unexplained reversal cost millions their livelihoods. As of October of 2021, 5% of unvaccinated adults said they had lost a job due to a vaccine mandate, according to the Kaiser Foundation.”

She reviewed how truckers, health care workers, police officers, and military members have been forced out of their jobs because of their convictions about the COVID-19 vaccines.



“But Fauci’s biggest lie was told under oath, when he testified before Congress that his group at the [National Institutes of Health] never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China,” Kelly said. “The kind that experiments on bat coronavirus to try to make them more lethal or more transmissible in humans.”

Fauci has repeatedly denied lying about NIH support for gain-of-function research in high-profile clashes with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) during multiple congressional testimonies. Kelly noted that the NIH contradicted Fauci by appearing to admit in writing that the nonprofit group EcoHealth Alliance violated the terms of an NIH grant by funding gain-of-function experiments.

She condemned Fauci for being unapologetic for his handling of the pandemic and ""indifferent to the harm he has caused."" She expressed particular scorn for his recent comments on Fox News saying that he does not think that COVID-19 lockdowns have ""irreparably damaged anyone.""

“We should pray this guy never gets near another grant or health group again in his life,” Kelly said. “He has destroyed the trust in public health. His decisions have hurt countless numbers of people. He did it all while posing on magazine covers and celebrating himself and his outsized ego, while our kids were muzzled and missed years of school as we all missed funerals and weddings and the chance to say goodbye to loved ones on their deathbeds.

""And we did indeed suffer irreparable harm, sir, whether you care to admit it or not,"" she concluded. ""Good riddance, Dr. Fauci. You are not truth and you will not be missed.”

Memphis police identify body of kidnapped female jogger missing since Friday,"Memphis police announced on Tuesday that they had identified the body of Eliza Fletcher, a woman who was allegedly abducted by Cleotha Abston, 38, during her morning jog.



Fletcher, a 34-year-old school teacher, was declared missing on Friday when she did not return from her morning run, WHBQ-TV reported.

The mother of two was jogging near the University of Memphis when she was stopped by a vehicle. Security cameras revealed that Fletcher was forced into the SUV.

On Saturday, U.S. Marshals arrested Abston after finding his DNA on a pair of sandals discovered close to where Fletcher was last seen. In addition, the arrest affidavit revealed that Abston’s cellphone was determined to be in the area where the woman was abducted.

The suspect refused to provide any details about what happened to Fletcher or where she was located.

Police used dogs, ATVs, and a helicopter to search for the school teacher over the weekend.

Around 5 p.m. on Monday, authorities discovered a body behind a vacant duplex. Police noticed vehicle tracks in the high grass behind the duplex and an odor of decay in the area. Authorities also located a trash bag containing purple running shots, fitting the description of Fletcher’s outfit.

Law enforcement confirmed that the body was Fletcher’s on Tuesday morning.

Memphis police director Cerelyn “CJ” Davis stated that it is too early in the investigation to determine Fletcher’s cause of death.

Abston was convicted in 2000 for kidnapping a prominent Memphis attorney, Kemper Durand. He forced Durand into the trunk of his own vehicle at gunpoint and ordered him to withdraw money from an ATM. Durand was able to get away from the 16-year-old assailant.

Abston was sentenced to 24 years in prison for that crime, but he served only 20. Now, just two years after his release, he is being charged with the kidnapping and first-degree murder of Eliza Fletcher.

In a Tuesday statement, Tennessee Lt. Gov. Randy McNally argued that if Abston had been held in prison for the entire duration of his sentence, he would not have been able to attack Fletcher, the Associated Press reported.

“This case not only proves that the recently passed Truth in Sentencing Act was necessary, but that it was long overdue,” McNally said. “We must redouble our efforts to ensure those who transgress against citizens are punished — and severely.”

The Truth in Sentencing Act , a law which went into effect in Tennessee on July 1, requires violent criminals to serve an entire sentence without the possibility of early release.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/megyn-kelly-anthony-fauci-take-down,2022-09-06
"Men convicted in Whitmer kidnapping plot allege juror misconduct, biased treatment from judge","The two men recently convicted of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and charge her with treason have requested a new trial. They claim that the judge presiding over their case demonstrated prejudicial bias against them on more than one occasion and that one of the twelve jurors had bragged to a co-worker in the early stages of a trial that he or she had already thought they were guilty and wanted them to ""hang.""

On Thursday, Barry Croft Jr., 46, and Adam Fox, 38, petitioned the court for a hearing on these issues, hoping that evidence presented during the hearing would convince the court to grant them a new trial.

During the trial, the court filing alleges, Judge Robert Jonker, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, had limited the time defense attorneys had to cross-examine a key witness, called some of the evidence offered by the defense ""crap,"" and permitted a juror who may have violated the judge's orders in two separate instances to remain on the jury panel.

""Throughout the trial,"" the defense attorneys Josh Blanchard and Christopher Gibbons wrote, ""the court repeatedly interjected with commentary regarding the quality of the defense evidence and questioning, the time it was taking defense counsel to complete questioning of witnesses, made sarcastic remarks about the trial continuing until Thanksgiving, referred to defense counsel’s questioning as 'crap,' and made other remarks that the court itself has described as 'dyspeptic.'""

Jonker limited the defense to 50 minutes of cross-examination time against Kaleb Franks, a former co-defendant who took a plea deal and began cooperating with the prosecution. No such time restrictions were placed on the prosecution, either with Franks or with any other witness in the trial.

Throughout their cross-examination of Franks, Blanchard and Gibbons claim in the filing that Jonker ""impatiently interjected with the amount of time remaining for each lawyer"" and that he made a snide remark in open court that the defense's line of questioning against Franks had been ""ineffective.""

In addition to Jonker's supposedly prejudicial behavior from the bench, the defense alleges that one of the jurors deliberately disobeyed Jonker's orders and discussed the case with a co-worker and with a family member.

According to the defense, the juror in question had contacted a co-worker in the early stages of the trial, blustering that he or she ""intended to ‘hang’ the defendants if (the juror) was selected.""

Though that particular co-worker did not cooperate with defense investigator Gary Gaudard, a second co-worker not only identified the name of the juror and the other co-worker but also corroborated the story that the juror had talked with the other co-worker ""about finding them guilty, no matter what,"" the defense wrote.

The defense also alleges that the juror, who has not been identified in any way, contacted a relative to announce that the jury had come to a decision, even though the verdict had not yet been read in court. Jonker had explicitly instructed the jury not to discuss the case or the status of deliberations with anyone outside the jury panel.

Jonker met with the juror alone, without attorneys for either side present. During what the defense has characterized as ""seven minutes of unsworn questioning,"" Jonker discussed the allegations with the juror and determined that the juror was not biased and had harbored no preconceived notions about guilt prior to the trial. Jonker also refused to compel the co-workers to testify in an evidentiary hearing. The defense hopes the court will reconsider that decision.

Though a hung jury could not make a determination back in April about their participation in the Whitmer kidnapping plot, Croft and Fox were convicted by a new jury on August 23. They were found guilty of conspiracy to kidnap and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and scheduled to be sentenced sometime in December. They face the possibility of life in prison.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/memphis-police-identify-body-of-kidnapped-female-jogger-missing-since-friday,2022-09-09
"Man claims his girlfriend died after smoking meth so he cut her legs off with a chainsaw and stuffed her body in garbage bags, police say","Police said a man admitted to sawing the legs off of the body of his girlfriend after they smoked methamphetamine and she died.

The Benton County Sheriff’s Office said they were called to a home of 60-year-old Edward A. Bagwell in Ambia, Indiana, on July 3. A friend of Bagwell's called police after he allegedly told them that he had dismembered his 61-year-old girlfriend Rita Spigner, according to a probable cause affidavit.

Police said that Bagwell admitted to them that he used a chainsaw to dismember Spigner after immediately asking them if he was going to go to prison.

Deputies said they found something that felt like a human corpse inside garbage bags when he searched Bagwell's home.

Bagwell was interviewed at the Benton County Jail by Indiana State Police detectives and told them that Spigner had lived with him at the home for eight years.

He allegedly told them that he smoked methamphetamine with Spigner on June 18 and slapped her when she began to scratch his legs and refused to stop. According to his account, she fell and began to convulse but stopped moving when he returned from looking for his phone.

He allegedly claimed that he didn't call the police because she was already dead, and he instead cut her legs off with an electric chainsaw. He also reportedly admitted to stuffing her body parts into garbage bags.

An autopsy found that Spigner had severe heart trouble but the cause and manner of her death won't be determined until results of a toxicology test are completed.

Bagwell has only been charged with abuse of a corpse and a failure to report remains, but police are still investigating the matter. He is being held at the Benton County Jail on a bond of $300,000.

Mexican president thanks Biden for not securing American border with 'even one meter of wall',"The president of Mexico thanked President Joe Biden for failing to secure America's southern border and insisted that he grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens who have stolen into the United States.

Biden met with the leftist Mexican leader Andres Manuel López Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Mexico City on Tuesday for the North American Leaders' Summit. The topic that dominated the summit was what Biden called ""the greatest migration in human history.""

Standing alongside Biden and Trudeau, Obrador remarked, ""President Biden, you are the first president of the United States in a very long time that has not built not even one meter of wall and ... we thank you for that, sir.""

The Mexican president noted that ""some may not like"" Biden's refusal to secure the border, particularly ""the conservatives.""

465,034 illegal aliens were encountered at the border in the first two months of this fiscal year; 2.37 million criminal noncitizens poured over the southern border last year, and millions more stole over in 2021.



During former President Donald Trump's last term in office, only 458,088 illegal aliens were encountered at the southern border, and his administration raised roughly 737,079 meters of wall.

Biden said, ""There can no longer be any question, none, in today’s interconnected world. We cannot wall ourselves off from shared problems,"" adding, ""We’re trying to make it easier for people to get here.""

That wasn't enough for the Mexican president.

Obrador insisted ""in a very respectful manner"" that Biden pressure the ""U.S. Congress to regularize the migration situations of millions of Mexicans who have been in the States working, living in the United States, and contributing to the development of that great nation.""

On his way to the summit, Biden met with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in the beleaguered border city of El Paso. Abbott communicated to Biden: ""Under your watch ... America is suffering the worst illegal immigration in the history of our country. Your open-border policies have emboldened the cartels, who grow wealthy by trafficking deadly fentanyl and even human beings.""

Abbott indicated that what Biden later characterized as making it ""easier for people to get here"" was tantamount to a failure to ""defend the States against invasion.""

The New York Times reported that during the summit, the Mexican president — whose crime-ridden country is presently a war zone — took a not-so-subtle jab at Abbott for ejecting criminal noncitizens from Texas and sending them to so-called sanctuary cities, calling the governor's efforts ""completely inhuman.""

According to the White House, the North American leaders ultimately ""reaffirmed their commitment to work together to achieve safe, orderly, and humane migration in region.""



These commitments apparently included giving ""migrants streamlined access to legal pathways""; ""countering xenophobia and discrimination against migrants and refugees by promoting balanced public narratives on migrants and refugees to support their meaningful inclusion in the region""; and, per Biden's announcement last week, allowing 30,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, or Haiti to enter the U.S. every month.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/meth-girlfriend-dead-chainsaw-legs,2023-01-11
Miami-Dade School Board overwhelmingly rejects proposal requiring recognition and observance of October as 'LGBTQ History Month',"On September 7, the Miami-Dade School Board, which oversees a school system with over 331,000 students, held a public meeting at its headquarters in downtown Miami. Over the course of six hours, various personalities and groups took turns expressing their support or criticisms for a proposal advanced by board member Lucia Baez Geller, who represents District 6. Geller's resolution, H-11, if enacted, would have had the school board ""recognize and observe October 2022 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) History Month,"" as well as provide social studies instruction on gay history.

At 9:45 p.m., the board voted 8-1 against the proposal.

Part of the reason cited for voting down the proposal was that it was likely in conflict with Florida's Parental Rights in Education Bill, which reinforces parents' natural rights to make decisions concerning their children's upbringing.

Geller did not handle the decision well and was visibly upset. She claimed, ""There is an election year and the anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric is a tool used by some to spread misinformation.""



School board chair Perla Tabares Hantman, who plans to retire in November, stated, ""We have to be in accordance with the law.""

Although last year, the board — differently constituted — voted 7-1 to recognize October as a gay-themed month (also proposed by Geller), Geller drew heat this week by pushing further for a gay-themed curriculum change.

Geller suggested that just as students are required to learn about the War of Independence, the Civil War, the world wars, and the civil rights movement, they should similarly learn about cases pertinent to gay activism in the United States.

Accordingly, H-11 would have had students specifically study and learn about Supreme Court cases Obergefell v. Hodges (where bans on same-sex ""marriage"" were ruled unconstitutional) and Bostock v. Clayton County (where discrimination against employees on the basis of gay orientation or transsexuality was ruled unconstitutional) in social studies classes.

In her September 2 letter to the board, Geller asserted that October should be a time ""established to remind all cultures within our wider community of the important roles that LGBTQ people have taken in shaping the social, historical, legal, and political worlds we live in today.""

She further highlighted how a gay-focused month would constitute ""an effective means of educating and calling to action our community to work together by fighting prejudice and discrimination ... and increasing visibility and raising awareness.""

Board member Christi Fraga, who represents District 5, was the lone dissenter in last year's successful vote to observe a gay-themed October. According to WPLG, Fraga suggested on Wednesday that H-11 creates a ""hostile"" environment and emphasized it isn't up to teachers to ""decide what will be taught in classrooms during this time.""

Pastor Max Tovar, who led a prayer outside the meeting and asked the board members to reject the motion, told the Miami Herald that H-11 was ""a Trojan horse.""

Others, reported the Guardian, indicated that the realization of Geller's proposal would amount to sexual abuse of children.

The chair of Moms for Liberty Miami-Dade, Eulalia Maria Jimenez, suggested the alteration of the social studies curriculum to complement an already gay-themed month requiring observance by students was tantamount to ""indoctrination."" In an Instagram post, the group had written, ""Help us protect the children against grooming agenda HB-11.""

A transsexual supporter of H-11 present at the meeting suggested such language was dehumanizing to the gay community.



The president and founder of the gay activist group PRISM FL, Maxx Fenning, went a step further, suggesting that a refusal to render October a gay month and require its observance by children was akin to Nazi persecution.

Another activist group, Equality Florida, expressed shock and alarm in response to the school board's determination, writing, ""Tonight's vote is more proof of the sweeping, dangerous effect of Florida's discriminatory Don't Say LGBTQ law.""

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis-backed candidates flipped the Miami-Dade school board last month. Concerning that win, the 1776 PAC tweeted, ""Miami Dade is now the LARGEST county in America with a conservative school board majority. Congrats to Roberto Alonso and Monica Colucci.""

"Miami-Dade School Board rejects sex-ed books that discuss 'pulling out,' gender identity: 'It is something that I personally do not believe is age appropriate for those students'","Parents outraged at the graphic content taught in public schools and available in public libraries may just have scored a major victory. In a 5-4 vote on Wednesday evening, the Miami-Dade School Board in Florida decided to reject two textbooks on human sexuality, one for middle school and one for high school.

The vote came after a raucous school board meeting in which over 40 members of the public spoke. All but two spoke in favor of adopting the textbooks.

“Half of all high school kids have sex before they graduate from high school, that’s not something we’re gonna change,"" Marika Lynch, a parent of three who spoke at the meeting, told reporters. ""So do we want them to have the best information? Yes. Do I want my kids who are all pre-teens to have the best information? Absolutely, that’s what we’re here for today.”

""Refusing to provide students with this necessary information would undoubtedly cause children to experience sexual health consequences,"" said another speaker.

However, opponents to the textbooks also made their concerns known. Two women were escorted from the meeting when their shouts against the textbooks became disruptive.

Another man, Alex Serrano also voiced his objections to the material, which he said include “[m]atters related to their sexuality, to their health, to their human reproduction, to abortion, to access to plan B pills, matters related to contraceptive methods.""

Serrano represents the Miami-Dade chapter of County Citizens Defending Freedom, a national organization which seeks to empower Americans ""to defend their faith, freedom, and liberty, while placing local governance under the watchful eye of local American citizens acting as patriots."" The group compiled a list of concerns about the textbooks. According to the list, one textbook goes into detail about various contraception methods, including the ""withdrawal"" method, also described as ""pulling out."" Another excerpt explains that gender identity differs from biological sex.

Serrano said he removed his own children from the school district after he discovered that they were being taught age-inappropriate content.

Board member Mari Tere Rojas agreed that the textbooks in question were too mature for middle and high school students. ""It is something that I personally do not believe is something that is age appropriate for those students to address,” she said about the various contraception discussions in the books.

In rejecting the books, the board reversed an earlier vote to approve them.

Local teachers unions are not pleased with the reversal. A statement issued by United Teachers of Dade President Karla Hernandez-Mats said in part that members are ""disturbed by the continued attempt from extremist groups to censor books. We live in an enlightened society and completely oppose the censorship of knowledge and accurate teaching materials.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/miami-dade-school-board-rejects-lgbtq-history-month-curriculum,2022-07-21
Miami Heat urge fans to call senators and demand gun control laws,"The Miami Heat basketball team urged fans to call their senators and ""make change at the ballot box"" to pass gun control laws in an announcement before an NBA playoff game Wednesday night.



“The Heat organization, the Boston Celtics and the NBA family also mourn those who lost their lives in the senseless shooting that took place yesterday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas,” the stadium announcer said as the Heat prepared to play the Boston Celtics in game five of the teams' playoff series.

“Our hope is that the families, friends, coworkers and loved ones of all those impacted by this tragedy will find the comfort and strength they need, as they carry on in honor of those whose lives were lost,” the announcer added, before a moment of silence for the 19 children and two teachers who were killed by a deranged gunman in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday.

But afterward, the announcer turned a unifying moment in a political one.



""The Heat urges you to contact your state senators by calling 202-224-3121 to leave a message demanding their support for commonsense gun laws,"" the announcer said. ""You can also make change at the ballot box. Visit Heat.com/vote to register and let your voice be heard this fall.""

The Heat's political statement comes days after NBA coach Steve Kerr blamed Republican U.S. senators for the massacre at Robb Elementary School.

Kerr said that Republicans ""refuse to do anything about the violence and school shootings and supermarket shootings; I ask you, are you going to put your own desire for power ahead of the lives of our children and our elderly and our churchgoers? Because that's what it looks like.""

Heat coach Erik Spoelstra similarly called on lawmakers to address gun violence in comments he made to the media Wednesday.

""After continued events there's a call to action,"" said Spoelstra. ""I think everybody is trying to figure out a way to be heard to force some kind of change from the people that can make change. I just really feel for all the families ... but it just continues to happen.""

Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio responded to the criticism Wednesday, accusing the NBA of ""politicizing a horrific tragedy in America.""

""Since @NBA @MiamiHeat is so committed to social justice and has pledged to 'speak the truth' when can we expect you to condemn the genocide of Uyghur Muslims being committed by your business partners in China?"" Rubio tweeted.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/miami-dade-school-board-sex-ed,2022-05-26
Michelle Obama takes a veiled swipe at Trump during ceremony to unveil White House portraits,"Former first lady Michelle Obama appeared to take a swipe at the expense of former President Donald Trump during an unveiling ceremony of the Obamas' portraits at the White House.

The former first lady spoke during the ceremony for the unveiling Wednesday and emphasized that her husband former President Barack Obama respected the transition of power to Trump when he won in 2016.

""Traditions like these matter, not just for those of us who hold those positions, but for everyone participating in and watching our democracy,"" said Obama.

""You see, the people they make their voices heard with their vote, we hold an inauguration to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Those of us lucky enough to serve work, as Barack said, as hard as we can, for as long as we can — as long as the people choose to keep us here — and once our time is up, we move on,"" she added.

""And all that remains in this hallowed place are our good efforts and these portraits,"" Obama concluded.

Some on social media praised Obama for politicizing her speech to take a jab against Trump and his refusal to accept the official results of the 2020 presidential election.

""Oh God, I loved Michelle Obama's speech. Can she deliver a dagger to the heart while telling the truth!!!"" responded one supporter.

""I loved her speech , throwing shade at trump it was wonderful!!!!"" replied another user.

""The Art of throwing shade, a chef's kiss by Michelle Obama,"" read another tweet.

""Michelle Obama throwing subtle shade to MAGA and Trump and I'm here for it,"" said another supporter.

A month after the 2016 election, the former first lady cast a similar insult against Trump when she said in an interview that America would come to appreciate having had a ""grown-up"" like her husband after electing Trump.

Michigan State shooter had prior felony gun charge dropped by Democrat DA — would otherwise have been barred from having a firearm,"Michigan Democrats are pushing for new gun control laws after three Michigan State University students were gunned down and several others were injured in a shooting Monday evening.

It is unclear whether additional laws will be any more effective than the existing gun laws that a Democratic district attorney failed to faithfully apply in full to the MSU shooter after his previous run-in with the law.

Former Ingham County District Attorney Carol Siemon not only pushed for Anthony McRae to avoid serious consequences and reacquire a weapon, but a general policy for other criminals as well.

More laws not to enforce

The Detroit Free Press reported that Anthony McRae — the man police indicated was responsible for slaying three innocent students and then killing himself — was arrested in 2019 on a gun-related charge in Lansing, Michigan.

Chris Gautz, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections, told the Free Press about the arrest.

""On June 7, 2019, an officer spotted an individual near an abandoned building on East Street in Lansing around 1:30 a.m. The officer questioned McRae, who said he had just left a store,"" said Gautz. ""When asked, he admitted he had a gun on him and did not have a concealed weapons permit. He claimed he left home to walk to a store [to] buy cigarettes and feared for his safety so he took his gun.""

According to court records, a police officer approached McRae, asked him if he was armed, then, upon confirmation that he was, detained him. The officer found a Ruger LCP .380 semi-automatic pistol on McRae's person along with a loaded magazine.

McRae was charged with a violation of concealed carry law and possessing a loaded weapon in a vehicle.

Despite the initial felony charge, the Ingham County District Attorney's Office, formerly helmed by progressive Democrat Carol Siemon, cut McRae a deal and lowered the charges to a misdemeanor.

Ingham County Prosecutor John Dewane, Siemon's successor, told the Free Press, ""Mr. McRae would have been barred from legally purchasing, owning, or possessing a firearm if he would have been convicted of the [concealed weapons] charge.""

""The misdemeanor conviction did not prevent him from purchasing, owning, or possessing a firearm after he successfully completed his terms of probation,"" added Dewane.

Dewane noted in a statement Tuesday that the original felony charge was punishable by up to five years.

McRae was ultimately sentenced to 12 months probation on Nov. 26, 2019, and then discharged from probation on May 14, 2021. He never served prison time for the offense.

Siemon, the Democrat who ran the DA's office around the time McRae received his sweetheart deal, retired from her post on Dec. 31, after 17 years with the county.

According to the Lansing State Journal, Siemon long drew criticism for her charging and plea-bargain policies.

For instance, in 2020, Siemon was accused by a judge of trying ""to be creative to get around the judge and the Legislature, and quite frankly, the law,"" in ""two cases that clearly are textbook first-degree, premeditated murder.""

Since Siemon opposes sentences of life without parole, she tried to let a murderer who smashed two women to death with a hammer in 2019 and planned to kill another two women plead guilty to second-degree murder.

Ingham County Sheriff Scott Wriggelsworth said upon learning of Siemon's proposal, ""Everybody that's involved in this case, in these cases, thinks this plea offer is ridiculous.""

In August 2021, Wriggelsworth and a group of police chiefs called out Siemon for her decision to limit the occasions she would pursue felony firearm charges.

The Lansing State Journal reported that Siemon believed that refusing to hold criminals to account would aid in decreasing racial disparities in the criminal justice system.

Then-Stockbridge Police Chief John Torres said, ""If she doesn’t want to prosecute the law, I think she should resign.""



Wriggelsworth called her soft-on-crime approach ""misguided"" and suggested it ""puts us all in danger. ... Our community should be outraged.""

The sheriff added that Siemon's ""policy is terrible for Ingham County, terrible for the community.""

Siemon's policy proved terrible for students at Michigan State University this week.

Democrat policy at work

TheBlaze previously reported that a 43-year-old black suspect, whom police have identified as McRae, killed three MSU students: Arielle Diamond Anderson, Brian Fraser, and Alexandria “Alex” Verner.

MSU Police indicated that shots were fired after 8 p.m. near Berkey Hall on the East Lansing campus. After the initial shooting, the gunman reportedly opened fire at the MSU Union, where students often gather to eat or study.

Five additional victims were transported to E.W. Sparrow Hospital with ""life-threatening"" injuries.

When law enforcement closed in on the suspect with the help of a public tip nearly four hours after the initial shooting, the gunman committed suicide with a gun the Democrat DA's office enabled him to possess legally.

Michigan Supreme Court says ban on sex-based discrimination also bans sexual orientation discrimination,"The Michigan Supreme Court has declared that a state law prohibiting sex-based discrimination also bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation — the 5-2 ruling marks a significant blow for Michiganders who oppose the LGBT agenda.

""At issue for our consideration is whether the prohibition of discrimination 'because of . . . sex' in the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act (the ELCRA) ... encompasses discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. We hold that it does,"" the decision states. ""Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation necessarily constitutes discrimination because of sex.""

The case involved Rouch World, LLC, which had declined to host a same-sex wedding, and Uprooted Electrolysis, LLC, which refused to provide hair-removal services to a transgender woman. In both instances, the owners of the facilities felt that providing the requested services would have violated their religious beliefs.

The owners of Rouch World ""explained that hosting and participating in a same-sex wedding ceremony would violate their sincerely held religious belief that marriage is a sacred act of worship between one man and one woman,"" the opinion noted.

And in the other matter, ""the owner of Uprooted Electrolysis, perceived the requested services to be centrally connected to Wolfe’s transgender identity and asserted that delivering these services would violate her sincerely held religious belief that sex is an immutable gift from God,"" according to the ruling.

""I take no issue with the merits of the policy adopted today by a majority of this Court,"" Justice Brian Zahra wrote in a dissent. ""And this Court’s duty is to say what the law is, not what it thinks the law ought to be. But this is exactly what a majority of this Court has done here. The majority opinion declares that the ELCRA's prohibition of discrimination 'because of . . . sex' precludes discrimination because of sexual orientation—an interpretation that eluded the Legislature, the courts, the Michigan Civil Rights Commission (the MCRC), the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (the MDCR), and the people of Michigan for the vast majority of the ELCRA’s 45-year existence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michigan-state-shooter-had-prior-felony-gun-charge-dropped-by-democrat-da,2022-07-29
Michigan town defunds 'groomer' library over its insistence on including graphic LGBT content in young adult section,"After a protracted battle over its LGBT content, residents of Jamestown Township, Michigan, voted no (62.5% to 37.5%) on August 2 to a 10-year millage renewal and increase for the Patmos Library. (A millage rate is the tax rate used to determine local property taxes.)

Bridge Michigan has reported that 84% of the library’s $245,000 annual budget derives from the now rejected millage, which means, according to library board president Larry Walton, Patmos will likely run out of funds in early 2023, despite the library having $325,000 in reserve. It will also mean residents won't have their property taxes raised by $24.

Walton accused those who voted to defund the library over its LGBT content of being “short sighted.”

Nathan Triplett, president of the ACLU of Michigan, lauded Walton and his team for ""refus[ing] to give in"" to the demands of residents of a county that voted for Donald Trump over Joe Biden by a 20-point margin.

Another Twitter user suggested Walton had held the library hostage over LGBT pornography.

Executive director of the Michigan Library Association, Debbie Mikula, told Bridge Michigan that among the 40 public library millage rates that were voted on across the state on Tuesday, most passed. Patmos Library, she suggested, was exceptional given its ""cultural issues.""

In the weeks leading up to the vote, concern was expressed over the content on display and in circulation at Patmos Library.

In one instance, some parents reportedly took issue with the inclusion of Maia Kobabe's ""Gender Queer: A Memoir"" in the library's collection. Kobabe's comic book contains illustrations of sex acts, including one encounter involving a sex toy, and has been touted as ""a tool"" to help others understand pronoun use and the meaning of ""nonbinary."" When asked to remove the book from circulation, the library board instead set it behind the counter.

The board kept 59 other books with LGBT themes — including ""Spinning"" and ""Kiss Number 8"" — on the shelves (some in the young adult section) despite similar backlash.

Kelly Jensen, writing for Book Riot, blamed ""conservative propaganda"" for painting Patmos Library ""as an institution with groomers."" She highlighted the efforts of a small group named the Jamestown Conservatives, which has a private Facebook page with 146 members, created on May 24. Jensen assigned them the victory: ""Jamestown Conservatives, a right-wing group ... is responsible for helping defund their public library.""

Jensen also warned fellow liberals: ""We will continue to see groups like Jamestown Conservatives across the country get onto public library and school boards to make decisions on the curriculum and materials all students have access to.""

Jamestown Township resident Sarah Johnson told Bridge Michigan after voting against the millage renewal: ""We're all for the library. I use it. We want to make a statement that we want some say in the books.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michigan-supreme-court-sexual-orientation,2022-08-04
"Middle school teacher refuses to use transgender students' preferred names, pronouns due to her Christian faith — then she's forced to resign, lawsuit says","A former middle school teacher in Ohio said she was forced to resign after refusing to use transgender students' preferred pronouns due to her Christian faith, and now she's suing her former school district, Alliance Defending Freedom said.

What are the details?

ADF said its attorneys filed the lawsuit Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, on behalf of Vivian Geraghty, who taught English at Jackson Memorial Middle School in Massillon.

The suit says Jackson Local School District officials forced Geraghty to resign in August because she refused to abide by the district's requirement that she use transgender students' ""preferred names and pronouns."" ADF argues in its suit that such a requirement is ""unconstitutional"" and violates her ""sincerely held religious beliefs."" The suit also says ""scientific understanding"" is behind Geraghty's ""view that a person is male or female based on sex, not personal identity, and participating in a student’s social transition violates those beliefs by forcing her to communicate messages she believes are untrue and harmful to the student.""

More from ADF:

The controversy began when two students asked Geraghty to participate in their social transition. This included using new names to reflect a new asserted gender identity for both students and using pronouns inconsistent with one student’s sex. The school counselor e-mailed Geraghty and several other teachers with instructions to participate in the students’ social transition. In response, Geraghty approached the principal with the hope of reaching a solution that would allow her to continue doing what she had always done: teach her class without personally affirming as true things that she believes are false and harmful.



The principal and his superior, the school district’s director of curriculum, instruction, and assessment, told Geraghty that “she would be required to put her beliefs aside as a public servant,” that her unwillingness to participate in a social transition in violation of her faith amounted to insubordination, and that continuing to teach consistent with her beliefs would “not work in a district like Jackson.” Further, the officials told Geraghty that, if she would not participate in the students’ social transitions, she must resign immediately.

“No school official can force a teacher to set her religious beliefs aside in order to keep her job,"" ADF legal counsel Logan Spena said. ""The school tried to force Vivian to recite as true the school’s viewpoint on issues that go to the foundation of morality and human identity, like what makes us male or female, by ordering her to personally participate in the social transition of her students. The First Amendment prohibits that abuse of power. Jackson Local School District officials nonetheless forced Vivian to resign because she resisted this unconstitutional command and explained that it was her Christian faith that made her unable to participate in her students’ social transition.”



The lawsuit seeks Geraghty's reinstatement to her teacher position, compensation for lost wages, punitive damages, and a declaration that the district's policy is unconstitutional.

How did the school district respond?

""This district always will strive to provide a safe, comfortable environment for all of our nearly 6,000 students in which to learn,"" a spokesperson for Jackson Local School District told Fox News Digital when asked for comment about the lawsuit. ""We have engaged legal counsel and we will have no further comment on pending litigation.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/michigan-town-defunds-groomer-library,2022-12-14
Project Veritas video exposes teacher sexualizing students,"A dean at a high-priced Connecticut private school has been placed on leave after a Project Veritas video appears to show him sexualizing his students.

Iman Rasti is the middle school dean, writing center director, and seventh-grade English teacher at the Greens Farms Academy, according to his LinkedIn account. He was reportedly caught on video making sexually explicit comments about his underage students entrusted to his care. Rasti seemingly admits to being sexually turned on by his seventh-grade students.

The undercover Project Veritas journalist asked Rasti if he was ever ""tempted"" by his students, and he nodded in agreement, then said, ""Every day.""

Rasti then appeared to confess being sexually aroused by his students: ""It's very hard. I mean, literally and figuratively.""

When asked about being sexual with his students, the dean noted, ""That possibly means me losing my job, my reputation – it’s risky, way too risky.""

Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe said the female journalist recorded two hours of video speaking with Rasti – including the teacher making sexual remarks about his students.

""Like, one thing they [students] do these days, they sit down in front of me, they purposefully sit down somewhere in the class that is literally directly in front of me,"" Rasti said. ""They spread their legs wide open and that is just brutal. Brutal.""

""Every day, there is different panties on: green, black, white,"" he stated. ""And they [students] make sure – it’s like they talk to each other, the three of them do that.""

“They open their legs, and I am teaching, and I see what I see,"" Rasti told the undercover journalist at a restaurant. ""They make sure that the panties are positioned in a way that I actually see the thing.""

Rasti is seen on video telling the Project Veritas journalist that he has seen the genitalia of his female students.

Rasti – who was hired by the school in 2019 – said he is distracted by the girls spreading their legs during the class.

He said, “Well, how can you concentrate? How can you continue talking with your classroom when you see that?""

""I don’t know for women – if you see, I don’t know, I guess for women it’s sexy to see a man with a hard-on,"" Rasti continued. ""Maybe it’s sexy, I don’t know.""

The teacher said of his students, ""And they smile, and they smirk at me, and they close and open, close and open a couple of times. They’re naughty.""

""When girls start having sex, it’s interesting for someone like me who has been in and out of relationships all my life, and married, and all of that,"" he admitted.



Rasti theorized that you can see ""changes in face and appearance"" of adolescent girls once they begin having sex.

""You see a 15-year-old girl, and then next year they come back to school and she’s a woman,"" he declared. ""There is no way she has gained weight just doing nothing, so it is clear that she has had sex. A lot of sex.""



“Part of the reason why those girls give me attention – in addition to me being genuine with them and honest with them – I think it's maybe they get that vibe, that sexual tension. I feel like they get it now,"" he added. ""They lost their head with the TikToks.""

Rasti met with the Project Veritas journalist a second time, and he made a shocking confession.

""I get the vibe, it’s obvious, but I refuse, because I don’t f*** my students. That’s my principle,"" the dean said, but added, ""I don’t do that, but sometimes I make exceptions. Sometimes.""

Rasti then admitted that he had numerous sexual encounters with his students when he was a college professor.

""Not with my K-12, but college, I had sex with many, many, many, many of my students,"" he seemingly bragged.

After Rasti's exposure in the Project Veritas video, Greens Farms Academy placed Rasti on leave.

""We have just been made aware of a report of inappropriate comments allegedly made by a teacher at GFA,” Greens Farms Academy spokesperson Michelle Levi told the Hartford Courant. ""We are placing the employee on leave and will be promptly investigating this matter and taking appropriate action.""

Levi said the school sent a message about the situation to the parents of students on Thursday night. The school also provided parents with ""resources"" that could offer assistance.

Westport Police Capt. David Wolf told the outlet that police are aware of the damning video, but there is no investigation at this time.

"Middle schooler placed in choke hold, gets neck wrenched; school allegedly faults victim while attacker, said to be a wrestler, is less severely disciplined","In the wake of a viral video showing a boy seated at a Texas school lunch table being placed in a choke hold, dragged from his chair, and then getting his neck wrenched, parents of the attacked student said Coppell Middle School North determined their son was at fault and that he received harsher discipline than the attacker.

What are the allegations?

The mother of Shaan Pritmani said in a Change.org petition — signed by more than 360,000 people as of Thursday morning — her son was ""physically attacked and choked by another student at his middle school"" during lunch May 11. The mother, Sonika Kukreja, added that the school said her attacked son ""was at fault and received a 3-day"" in-school suspension while ""the aggressor only received a 1-day ISS.""

The petition adds that the victim's friends shared video of the assault and said Shaan ""wasn't at fault"" — but school officials weren't changing their ruling. In addition, the petition claims the school resource officer ""refused to file a citation because school administration asked it not be written, as there have been too many bullying complaints lately.""

In addition, the petition states the boy who placed the choke hold on Shaan ""is on the wrestling team and can be seen carrying out a very dangerous carotid restraint on Shaan's neck. This technique restricts blood flow to a person's brain by compressing the sides of the neck where the carotid arteries are located. Shaan appears to briefly lose consciousness at the end of the neck choke maneuver.""

A WFAA-TV reporter posted the following tweet containing a blurred video of the attack. Content warning: Profanity:

Here's a link to an unblurred clip of the attack.

What else did the mother of the attacked student say?

“It was horrible. I couldn't sleep for three nights straight. It felt like I was being choked. I cried many times watching it,” Kukreja told KXAS-TV.

""His neck could’ve snapped,"" she added to WFAA-TV. ""I wouldn’t have my son.""

She added to the station that she's ""deeply concerned about the safety of our children and the message our school board, our police department, is sending out by not acting on this.""

What did the school district have to say?

“Coppell ISD is aware of a video circulating on social media showing an incident at Coppell Middle School North involving a physical altercation between two students,"" Superintendent Brad Hunt said in an email to parents. ""Bullying, both verbal and physical, as well as physical acts of aggression are never acceptable and do not align with who we are at CISD and our core values."" The email added that ""because of student privacy laws and this being an ongoing investigation, we cannot share any further specifics on this situation or student discipline matters.""

What did the attorney for the other student have to say?

Mark Lassiter, attorney for the family of the other student, told KXAS his client was responding to vulgar and violent threats against his family.

“We are confident that after all the facts are revealed, the case will be closed and no further action will be taken other than what the school has already decided was appropriate,"" Lassiter told KXAS.

In a statement to WFAA, Lassiter said, ""We welcome a chance for the truth to come out that the young man who was pulled from the table made threats.""

What did the attorney for Shaan's family have to say?

Marwa Elbially, attorney for Shaan's family, told KXAS she denies the accusations and said the attack shouldn't have happened.

“The school can preach all it wants that they're anti-bullying and place it on their website, but they are sending a message to this kid and the rest of the student body that this behavior is acceptable,” Elbially added to KXAS.

Image source: KXAS-TV video screenshot

Elbially added to WFAA that the student who put the choke hold on Shaan ""could’ve potentially paralyzed or have killed him. No real action is taken against that kid.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/middle-school-teacher-students-sexual-project-veritas,2022-05-19
Migrants refuse relocation from $280/night NYC hotel; NYPD clears encampment near Hell's Kitchen,"Police were dispatched to the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan Sunday night when a group of migrants housed in a hotel there refused relocation to a Brooklyn shelter.

""This weekend, we began the process of moving single adults[sic] males form the Watson Hotel to Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, as we transition the hotel to meet the large number of asylum seeking families with children,"" said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in a statement obtained by Fox 5 NY.

""The facilities at Brooklyn Cruise Terminal will provide the same services as every other humanitarian relief center in the city,"" the statement also said.

More than 50 migrants protested the move to the Brooklyn facility, setting up camp outside the hotel Sunday night, according to the National Review. Some of the migrants visited the new shelter, but returned to the hotel after finding conditions there unsatisfactory, the outlet also reported.

One of Sunday's protesters described the facility as an ""icebox"" with ""hundreds of cots in warehouse-like rooms, few bathrooms, and little heat,"" according to a report published at W42St.com.



The NYPD cleared the migrants' tents from blocking the sidewalk along 57th Street on Monday around 11 a.m., ABC 7 NY reported.



A Twitter user documenting part of the scene last night, described it as a ""mini-riot,"" and shared a brief video. The video shows a crowd gathered in front of the Watson Hotel along with a number of police officers, emergency vehicles, and a bus.

""The former residents pounded on the [Watson Hotel's] door and pressed their faces against the glass, yelling 'Open!' as security guards and staff watched on from the inside,"" according to the Villager, which posted several photographs of the chaotic scene.



New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced the opening of a fifth ""Humanitarian Emergency Response and Relief Center"" at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal on January 21, 2023. In that announcement, he noted that the facility ""will provide approximately 1,000 asylum seekers with a place to stay, access support, and get to their final destination.""

""Since this humanitarian crisis began, the city has taken fast and urgent action. . .opening 77 hotels as emergency shelters and four other humanitarian relief centers already, standing up navigation centers to connect asylum seekers with critical resources, enrolling children in public schools through Project Open Arms, and more,"" the statement concluded.

"Migrating walrus stops to rest in seaside town, creating instant tourist attraction and causing chaos for locals","A giant, migrating arctic walrus has apparently decided to take a rest from his travels in a seaside British town, creating an instant public sensation and causing chaos in the English town of Scarborough.

The walrus, which is believed to be the same animal named ""Thor"" who caused a similar scene a month ago on the Hampshire coast in England, apparently clambered ashore on Friday night and plopped himself down in the middle of the Scarborough street for a snooze. A team of aquatic animal experts from the local Sea Life Scarborough aquarium promptly cordoned off the area to prevent humans from getting too close and began monitoring the situation.

According to these experts, the walrus appears to be in fine shape physically and is merely resting before continuing its journey north — albeit in an unusual spot. It is believed to be the first time a walrus has been spotted in Scarborough. Aquarium staff asked the public to ""Please be respectful of his rest and try not to disturb him. While it is a very exciting opportunity for us, naturally they do not like lots of noise and are not familiar with domestic animals so please keep pets on leads and remain a safe distance for your own welfare and his. Hopefully within a few days he will have got enough rest to move on and continue his adventures North!""

Nevertheless, the spectacle of a giant walrus apparently on a vacation in the middle of an English seaside town has drawn a gaggle of gawkers from all around. According to ITV, crowds of hundreds have lined up outside the cordon to get a glimpse or a picture for social media of the unusual phenomenon.

Local residents have been amazed by the sudden influx of visitors. One local, Richard Coulson, told the Guardian that ""I live just round the corner from where it actually is and the traffic up and down our road – it’s just like a summer’s day, it really is absolutely teeming with cars and people. It’s amazing how much attention it’s brought.""

""It’s the first time I’ve ever seen one. It’s huge. We see seals quite regularly round Scarborough coastline but something of that size, it’s enormous. You respect nature when you see something of that size. Its tusks are bigger than my arms.""

The extent of the attention appears to also be ""agitating"" the walrus, who has thus far refused to return to the ocean. The extent of his agitation has led local marine wildlife experts to develop a ""backup plan"" for forcing Thor to return to the ocean if he attempts to haul himself up any further into town. Saturday afternoon, they also moved the cordon back further in an attempt to calm the walrus and keep the increasing crowd sizes down.

The crowd has likewise been accused of growing increasingly unruly, with Yorkshire Live reporting that many of the gawkers have been ""barging and hassling"" volunteers who are trying to keep the crowd at bay.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/migrants-refuse-relocation-from-280-night-nyc-hotel-nypd-clears-encampment-near-hell-s-kitchen,2022-12-31
Owner of Mexican restaurant in California posted a photo with Mike Lindell and is now receiving threats and harassment,"A restaurant owner in northern California said that she and some of her staff were receiving threats and harassment after putting up a photograph with MyPillow founder and CEO Mike Lindell.

Michelle Hill told the SFGate that two of her employees at ""Tres Chiles Picosos"" recognized Lindell because they had purchased MyPillow pillows, but they did not know about his political activism.

Lindell has claimed that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and that former President Donald Trump was the true victor. He is being sued by Dominion Voting Systems for $1.3 billion in a defamation lawsuit for his accusations that the company participated in a scheme to fix the election.

Hill says neither she nor her restaurant's waitress and bartender knew about the political controversy surrounding Lindell when they took a photograph with him and posted it to the restaurant's Facebook page.

""I don't get into politics,"" Hill said. ""We knew nothing about him apart from that he's the MyPillow guy ... my staff buys his pillows, his sheets, his socks, they were just excited to see someone famous.""

Hill said she found out about the controversy after receiving numerous negative comments on the photo.

“It's not about the politics, it's about the crimes and sedition,” one user reportedly replied on Facebook. “You don't post photos with other tourists, why start with him.”



Hill says she would have posted the photo even if she had known about the controversy beforehand because Lindell is still famous.

""This was the first person that had come into the restaurant that they had seen on TV,"" Hill explained. ""They probably would've taken a photo with Biden, or Trump, or Martha Stewart or George Clooney if they had come in... this had zero to do with politics.""

She says she has received threatening phone calls and some people are calling for an outright boycott. But she refuses to take down the photograph.

""I'm not going to be bullied,"" Hill concluded.

""Tres Chiles Picosos"" translates to three spicy peppers.

Mike Pence says he will not testify before Jan. 6 Committee: 'Congress has no right to my testimony',"Former Vice President Mike Pence said that he would refuse to testify before the Jan. 6 Committee because Congress has ""no right"" to his testimony.

Pence made the comments in an interview with Margaret Brennan of CBS News, who asked him whether he would testify as many of his staffers have.

""I served for twelve years in the Congress. It's inconceivable to me that one party would appoint every member of a committee in Congress; that's antithetical to that whole idea of the committee system. That being said, I never stood in the way of senior members of my team cooperating with the committee and testifying,"" Pence responded.

""But Congress has no right to my testimony,"" he added.

""We have a separation of powers under the Constitution of the United States, and I believe it would establish a terrible precedent for the Congress to summon a vice president of the United States to speak about deliberations that took place at the White House,"" Pence said.

""So you're closing the door on that entirely?"" Brennan asked.

""I'm closing the door on that,"" he said.

""But I must say again the partisan nature of the January 6 Committee has been a disappointment to me. It seemed to me in the beginning there was an opportunity to examine every aspect of what happened on January 6 and to do so more in the spirit of the 9-11 Commission, non-partisan, non-political,"" Pence added.

""And that was an opportunity lost,"" he concluded.



Video showed that some of the rioters on Jan. 6 chanted, ""Hang Mike Pence,"" and a confidential witness for the FBI said that rioters were seeking to kill Pence for not helping overturn the official results of the election.

The committee will likely be disbanded after the newest term of Congress begins, since Republicans have narrowly seized control of the House of Representatives. In October, the committee voted unanimously to subpoena former President Donald Trump to have him testify about his possible role in the events of the rioting on January 6.

"Filing appears for Mike Pence 2024 presidential campaign, but his spokesperson calls it a prank","A filing for the 2024 presidential campaign for Mike Pence appeared on Monday, but a spokesperson for the former vice president denied that they had any involvement.

The filing was reported on social media and was widely circulated. Soon after, Pence spokesperson Devin O'Malley denied that Pence had filed.

""Former Vice President Mike Pence did not file to run for President today,"" he tweeted, then added that someone had pranked the media.

The Republican politician gained prominence as a right-wing talk show host in Indiana before he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2001. He was elected governor of Indiana in 2013 before being selected by then-candidate Donald Trump to be his vice presidential candidate in 2016.

Pence has been criticized by many on the left and by those opposed to Trump for refusing to denounce the president for claiming the 2020 election was fraudulent. Some of the rioters on Jan. 6 reportedly chanted for Pence to be harmed over his refusal at the time to call for the election results to be recounted.

He has since publicly stated that he refuses to testify before the congressional committee investigating the rioting on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol.

""Congress has no right to my testimony,"" said Pence.

""We have a separation of powers under the Constitution of the United States,"" he added, ""and I believe it would establish a terrible precedent for the Congress to summon a vice president of the United States to speak about deliberations that took place at the White House.""

Former President Donald Trump announced his campaign for the 2024 election in November.

Despite Rev. Franklin Graham publicly announcing that he wouldn't endorse anyone for the 2024 Republican presidential primary, his statement praising Pence raised speculation that Pence would announce his campaign soon.

""I appreciate very much former Vice President Mike Pence; there are a number of Republicans that have great leadership abilities, but Vice President Mike Pence has served this nation and he's served it well,"" Graham said to reporters.

""And I hope that his role in serving this nation is not finished,"" he added.

When asked if he was endorsing Pence, Graham said they were instead going to go eat some fried chicken.

Mike Pence opens door to testifying to January 6 Committee during New Hampshire visit,"Former Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he would consider testifying before the January 6 Committee if called to do so by the House of Representatives.

Speaking at the ""Politics & Eggs"" breakfast at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, Pence told the audience any ""invitation"" he receives to testify would be given ""due consideration,"" though he suggested there may be executive privilege concerns.

“If there was an invitation to participate, I would consider it,” Pence said, according to WMUR-TV. “But you've heard me mention the Constitution a few times this morning. In the Constitution, we have three co-equal branches of government, and any invitation that would be directed to me, I would have to reflect on that.""

""It would be unprecedented in history for a vice president to be summoned to testify on Capitol Hill,"" Pence continued. ""But as I said, I don't want to prejudge. So if ever any formal invitation [is] rendered to us, we’d give it due consideration.”

If called to testify, Pence would be the first former vice president to appear as a witness before a congressional committee. Schuyler Colfax was the first sitting vice president to do so in 1873, while sitting presidents including Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and Gerald R. Ford have testified to Congress.

Pence had a falling-out with former President Donald Trump after the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when he refused to block the certification of President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.



Former aides to the vice president Marc Short and Greg Jacob have previously testified before the committee on the events that occurred when Trump's supporters formed a mob and instigated a riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Rioters had made violent threats against Pence, including threatening to ""hang"" him.

Jacob, a lawyer for Pence, said that despite the threats against his life, the vice president refused to leave the Capitol on that day because he ""did not want to take any chance that the world would see the vice president of the United States fleeing the United States Capitol.""

WATCH: Why Mike Pence refused to leave the Capitol on Jan. 6 #shorts youtu.be

Pence's personal testimony would be of interest to Jan. 6 Committee investigators who have sought answers on Trump's effort to pressure his vice president to overturn the election. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), one of two Republicans on the committee, previously charged Trump with urging Pence to take ""illegal"" and ""unconstitutional"" actions.

The former vice president's visit to New Hampshire, an early primary state, comes amid widespread speculation that he intends to challenge Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

The ""Politics & Eggs"" breakfast is a forum frequently visited by prospective presidential candidates. Pence last spoke there in 2019 while campaigning for Trump's re-election.

Mike Pence subpoenaed in special counsel investigations into Trump,"Former Vice President Mike Pence was subpoenaed on Thursday as part of the special counsel probe into former President Donald Trump.

ABC News was first to report the development.

The subpoena was issued by special counsel Jack Smith who was tasked by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in November to investigate the classified documents seized in an FBI raid from Mar-a-Lago and the effort to overturn the 2020 election.

It is unclear what information Smith is seeking from Pence, but the subpoena reportedly came as a result of months of negotiations between Pence's team and the special counsel.

Garland said that he made the decision to appoint a special counsel based on the announcement from Trump that he has chosen to run for election in 2024 and also based on the presumption that Pence is likely to run for president as well.

Smith worked previously as a public corruption prosecutor.

Pence has previously said that he would absolutely refuse a subpoena from the U.S. House committee investigating the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. That committee has been concluded after Republicans were able to regain control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections.



The former vice president had been pressured by Trump and his supporters to refuse to certify the results of the 2020 election, but he relented despite reports that some of the rioters on Jan. 6 were seeking to harm him.

The investigation into classified documents found in Trump's possession has been greatly complicated by the discovery of similarly classified documents found to be possessed by both current President Joe Biden and Mike Pence.

Man Mike Tyson reportedly pummeled identified as a 36-year-old with an extensive criminal record,"The man heavyweight boxing legend Mike Tyson reportedly pummeled on a Florida-bound JetBlue plane is said to possess an extensive criminal record.

What's a brief history?

Footage obtained by TMZ Sports appears to show the boxing star repeatedly punching a male airline passenger in the face ahead of a Wednesday evening flight out of San Francisco International Airport.

Sources close to Tyson said that the victim — later identified as 36-year-old Melvin George Townsend of Punta Gorda, Florida — was ""extremely intoxicated"" and ""wouldn't stop provoking the boxer in his seat"" before the apparent assault.

The outlet reported that an unnamed witness and friend were boarding the flight when they noticed Tyson among their fellow passengers.

An excited Townsend reportedly ""kept trying to talk to the 55-year-old fighter as he sat behind him.""

""Eventually, though, we're told Tyson had enough of the guy behind him talking in his ear ... and told him to chill,"" the outlet reported. ""When the guy didn't, that's when the witness says Tyson started to throw several punches at the man's face.""

What are the details?

The Daily Mail has reported that Townsend has served 15- and 20-month sentences over the years for crimes including drug possession, burglary, grand theft, fraud, and more.

Townsend's attorney, Matt Morgan, told TMZ that Tyson never should have put his hands on what he described as an ""overly excited fan,"" and instead ought to have ""exercised greater restraint.""

It is unknown at the time of this reporting whether Townsend plans to sue the former heavyweight champion.

""[Townsend has] not made a determination on what his next steps will be,"" a source close to Townsend told TMZ. ""He hired counsel due to his physical injuries, the overwhelming nature of this event, and the associated media inquiries.""

A spokesperson for Tyson said, however, that the 55-year-old was merely reacting to Townsend's erratic and unruly behavior, and said that the Florida man had been harassing him ever since he stepped onto the plane — even going as far as to throw a water bottle at the boxer.

""Unfortunately, Mr. Tyson had an incident on a flight with an aggressive passenger who began harassing him and threw a water bottle at him while he was in his seat,"" his representative told the Daily Mail in a statement.

Townsend, however, has denied throwing a water bottle at the boxer.

What else?

A spokesperson for the San Francisco Police Department confirmed the incident with the outlet.

""On Wednesday April 20, 2022, at approximately 10:06 p.m., San Francisco Police officers assigned to the SFPD Airport Bureau were dispatched to a physical altercation onboard an airplane located at the Domestic Terminal of the San Francisco International Airport,"" a statement from the department said. ""Officers arrived and detained two subjects that were believed to be involved in the incident. One subject was treated at the scene for non-life-threatening injuries. That subject provided minimal details of the incident and refused to cooperate further with the police investigation. Both subjects were released under 849(b) of the California Penal Code pending further investigation.""

Mike Tyson will not face criminal charges for reports that he pummeled a fellow airline passenger,"Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson will not face criminal charges following reports that he pummeled a fellow airline passenger, CNN has reported.

Tyson was reportedly captured on camera hitting plane passenger Melvin George Townsend III after Townsend was accused of harassing Tyson before takeoff.

What are the details?

San Mateo County, California, District Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe told the outlet that he did not file any misdemeanor battery charges against Tyson ""based on the circumstances surrounding the confrontation"" including the ""conduct of the alleged victim.""

""It is simply a case that does not belong in the criminal court,"" Wagstaffe told the outlet. ""If they want to sue each other, that's their business.""

He added that both parties requested no charges be filed in the case.

Video showed a man identified as Tyson bending over and repeatedly striking a man identified as Townsend while the plane sat on the tarmac at San Francisco International Airport awaiting takeoff.

At the time, a spokesperson for Tyson said that Townsend was an ""aggressive passenger who began harassing [Tyson] and threw a water bottle at him"" shortly after boarding.

Townsend, who was previously described as an overexcited fan, denied throwing a water bottle at Tyson.

A spokesperson for the San Francisco Police Department confirmed the incident in a statement.

""On Wednesday April 20, 2022, at approximately 10:06 p.m., San Francisco Police officers assigned to the SFPD Airport Bureau were dispatched to a physical altercation onboard an airplane located at the Domestic Terminal of the San Francisco International Airport,"" a statement from the department read.

Military watchdog says officials were too quick to reject religious exemptions for COVID-19 vaccination,"The military may have acted too speedily to deny religious exemptions for COVID-19 vaccination requested by service members, a Defense Department watchdog concluded in a report.

Pentagon Inspector General Sean O'Donnell wrote there was a ""concerning"" trend in the number of exemptions and the rate at which they were rejected, according to a June 2 memo reported by Military.com.



""We found a trend of generalized assessments rather than the individualized assessment that is required by Federal law and DoD and Military Service policies,"" O'Donnell wrote to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. ""Some of the appellate decisions included documentation that demonstrated a greater consideration of facts and circumstances involved in a request.""

Austin ordered a vaccine mandate for troops on August 24, 2021, the day after the Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Service members were required to either get the shots or be ultimately discharged.

The Army, the largest branch of the military, has received 8,514 religious exemption requests of which 1,602 were rejected. Only 24 have been approved and the rest are pending as of Aug. 12.



The inspector general estimated there were about 50 denials per day in a 90-day period across all branches of the military. O'Donnell indicated military officials spent just minutes reviewing each exemption instead of thoroughly reviewing each case, making the military vulnerable to lawsuits from service members who were forced to resign after refusing to take a COVID-19 vaccine.

""The volume and rate at which decisions were made to deny requests is concerning,"" the memo reportedly said. ""Assuming a 10-hour work day with no breaks or attention to other matters, the average review period was about 12 minutes for each package. Such a review period seems insufficient to process each request in an individualized manner and still perform the duties required of their position.""

Several legal challenges have already been filed alleging unvaccinated service members were discriminated against by the military. In late March, a Texas judge blocked the Navy from discharging sailors with pending exemption requests, Military.com reported. Last week, the U.S. Marine Corps announced a pause on administrative actions against unvaccinated Marines after a federal judge in Florida in August blocked the Corps from discharging religious exemption applicants.

Many service members remain in limbo as the Biden administration navigates these legal challenges. The Army National Guard has about 40,000 unvaccinated soldiers that it has no plan for, according to Military.com. Another 1,200 Coast Guardsmen are seeking to qualify for a class-action lawsuit against the military for their religious exemptions being denied, the outlet reported.

Minnesota woman claims pharmacist violated her 'human rights' when he refused to fill a prescription for emergency contraception,"A Minnesota woman has sued her local pharmacist for refusing to fill a prescription for emergency contraception, an act she says violated her human rights.

Back in 2019, Andrea Anderson, a mother of five from McGregor, Minnesota, about two hours due north of Minneapolis, took a prescription for the emergency contraception pill Ella to the Thrifty White pharmacy, the only pharmacy in the small town, after she claims a condom broke during intercourse. However, the pharmacist on duty, George Badeaux, refused to fill it, claiming that emergency contraception violates his religious beliefs because it could prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman's uterus.

“It is similar to removing all care from a newborn child by throwing it out the backdoor into the woods,” Badeaux said in a court filing.

Badeaux informed Anderson that another technician would be on hand the next day, weather permitting, but that he couldn't guarantee that the person would be willing to dispense the pills. The lawsuit states that Badeaux also refused to direct Anderson to another pharmacist who might be able to help her, as required by state law.

Anderson claims that she then called a CVS in Aitkin, approximately 25 miles away, but the CVS technician there told her that she would not fill the prescription either. Anderson finally elected to drive 100 miles roundtrip, with a snowstorm looming, to fill the prescription at a Walgreens in Brainerd.

According to the lawsuit, Badeaux violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act when he refused to fill the prescription. The Act outlaws sex discrimination, including instances related to pregnancy and childbirth.

Aitkin County District Judge David Hermerding has already ruled that Badeaux and his lawyers may not invoke his First Amendment religious rights, though Badeaux will have an opportunity to explain his religious objections to emergency contraception without confusing ""the jury into thinking this is a religious freedom contest.""

“The issue for the jury is not defendant’s constitutional rights,” Judge Hermerding wrote. “It is whether he deliberately misled, obfuscated and blocked Ms. Anderson’s path to obtaining Ella.”

Gender Justice — a group which claims that ""[r]eligious beliefs are not a license to target, harass, or discriminate against or deny services to someone because of who they love or how they identify"" — has provided Anderson with legal counsel.

Jury selection began on Monday, and the trial itself should conclude by Friday.

CVS was also named in the initial lawsuit, but the plaintiff and CVS have since reached an undisclosed settlement.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/military-watchdog-vaccine-religious-liberty,2022-08-02
"‘Miscalculation’ causes ICE to underreport illegal immigrants released without tracking technology by over 18,000%","Immigration and Customs Enforcement claimed that a “data miscalculation” caused the agency to underreport the number of illegal immigrants released into the United States without tracking technology by over 18,000%, the Daily Caller News Foundation reported.



During a private event hosted by ICE last week, the agency distributed documents to attendees about the 2004 “Alternatives to Detention” program. The initiative was launched as a “flight-mitigation tool” to track illegal immigrants using ankle bracelets and cell phones while they await scheduled court proceedings.

According to the internal document obtained by the DCNF, as of November 14, ICE had released 49,459 illegal immigrants without any tracking technology. The reported figure on the document vastly differed from the stats on ICE’s website, which stated that only 266 immigrants were released without ankle monitors or cell phones as of November 19.

Additionally, the document revealed that only 8,118 illegal immigrants were released with GPS tracking devices as of November 14. According to ICE’s website, the agency reported that 56,805 illegal immigrants were being monitored using GPS trackers as of November 19 – a 600% difference.

“The Biden administration is hostile to transparency, and when it does publish data, it refuses to respond to media inquiries regarding significant discrepancies like this,” a former ICE official told the DCNF. “Likely, ICE communication staffers are having a lot of difficulty defending this administration’s chaotic and lawless policies.”

DCNF reached out to ICE last week to reconcile the reporting discrepancies. On Wednesday, the agency updated its website to state that 49,166 illegal immigrants are not being tracked while 7,905 are being monitored using GPS tracking devices.

“Upon further inspection of what participants were provided against what was publicly available online, it became clear there was a data miscalculation. Teams worked quickly to address and reconcile the issue, now updated on ICE.gov. We regret ICE provided erroneous ATD enrollment data and worked to resolve the miscalculation going forward,” an ICE spokesperson told the news outlet.

“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently hosted a symposium to share ideas and inform future concepts for the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program,” the ICE spokesperson continued. “The event was held at ICE headquarters with more than 100 stakeholders from nongovernmental organizations, academia, and private industry in attendance.

Missouri sheriff refuses to release gun owner info to the FBI: 'I will go down with the ship if need be',"A sheriff in Missouri has refused to release gun owner information to the FBI, even if the agency threatens to arrest him.

Republican Scotland County Sheriff Bryan Whitney wrote to residents in his community on Monday about the plan to audit Missouri's gun owner records.

""As the sheriff of Scotland County, I want all my citizens to know that I will not allow, cooperate or release any [conceal carry weapon] information to the FBI, ‘even at the threat of a federal arrest,’"" said Whitney.

""Point Blank, ‘I will go down with the ship if need be,’"" he added, according to Fox News.

Whitney says the FBI planned to audit 24 counties, though it is unknown which counties in Missouri would be affected.

Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt also sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray, criticizing the decision.

""The FBI has absolutely no business poking around in the private information of those who have obtained a concealed carry permit in Missouri,"" Schmitt wrote.

""The Second Amendment rights of Missourians will absolutely not be infringed on my watch,"" he added. ""I will use the full power of my Office to stop the FBI, which has become relentlessly politicized and has virtually no credibility, from illegally prying around in the personal information of Missouri gun owners.""



Schmitt also pointed out that many Missouri residents don't trust the FBI because of various recent scandals involving the bureau.

""You may wonder why there is such strong suspicion of federal agents here in the ‘Show Me State.’ Simply put, Missourians are hard-working, law-abiding citizens who don’t need a national nanny-state keeping tabs on us. But more than that, over the last couple of years, we’ve seen story after story of incompetence and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI,"" he added.



The FBI said in a statement to Fox News that the audit would be routine and that no personal information would be at risk.

Schmitt, however, pointed directly to the ""witch hunt"" against former President Donald Trump to support his contention that the FBI could not be trusted.

20 Major League Baseball teams have promoted or funded groups involved in child gender transitions,"Twenty of the thirty Major League Baseball teams have promoted or funded groups that advocate child gender transitions, according to a report from National Review.

The report says that teams have included LGBT-themed ""Pride Nights"" that have led to their support of groups that ""encourage or provide sex-change procedures and gender-transition hormone treatment for minors as young as 12.""

Other groups push ""social transitions,"" which have to do with switching clothing, names, and pronouns for children as young as 3 years old.

In one example, the Detroit Tigers encouraged ticket buyers to donate to various organizations related to the LGBT movement. Among those were PFLAG of Detroit, which is dedicated to ""donating Gay, Lesbian, Bi-sexual, and Transgender-positive books to public libraries for a greater understanding of the real lives of our children.’”

The Boston Red Sox donated $200,000 to Fenway Health, an LGBT clinic, as a part of their 2018 LGBT “Spirit Day” celebration. Fenway Health offered services including hormonal drugs, puberty blockers, and sex-change surgeries for adolescent children.

The comprehensive report listed all of the 20 teams with their support for numerous transgender organizations. It also noted that surveys show MLB fans to be among the most conservative, just behind those of the National Hockey League.

Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, told National Review that MLB fans needed to pressure the organization against such one-sided partisan support.

""The reality of Major League Baseball — one of our last conservative institutions, if you will — not just going woke in terms of lip service, but actively funding something that is nefarious and evil, is a real gut punch,” Roberts said.

“What it highlights for me and for all of us at Heritage, and movement conservatives around the country, is that we have to be focused, as conservatives, on retaking the institutions that are able to be reformed,"" he added. ""I think Major League Baseball is probably one of those.”

Among those who have previously pushed back against MLB's push for the LGBT agenda were players on the Tampa Bay Rays who refused to wear LGBT ""pride"" themed jerseys in June.

Mom-to-be will birth her son twice in order to save his life: 'God was on his side',"New mom Jaiden Ashlea recently gave birth to her son, Levi James, and in order to save his life, she'll give birth to him a second time in July.

Say what?

Ashlea told the New York Post that doctors flagged a concerning development during a routine wellness check at her 18-week scan. Her doctor then deliverered the news that no parent wants to hear: Her unborn child was suffering from spina bifida.

“I was in shock. I couldn’t even speak when the doctor was telling us this,” Jacksonville, Florida, resident Ashlea said.

The news only got worse from there. Doctors then told her and her fiancé Noah Detrick that the child would likely be born brain dead and would have zero quality of life.

“I remember saying to myself, ‘This isn’t real, this isn’t happening,” Ashlea said. “It was a nightmare.”

Ashley explained, however, that she and Detrick refused to abort the baby and vowed to do whatever they had to in order to keep their family intact.

The couple and their unborn baby traveled to Orlando, where she found out about a surgery that could help repair the baby's spine.

According to the report, Ashlea went into surgery for the repair.

""Doctors made a Cesarean incision along her stomach, broke her water, and successfully repaired the sizable lesion, or abnormality, plaguing the L2 vertebrae in the baby’s lower back,"" the outlet reported. ""Then, they repositioned the tot inside Ashlea’s tummy, sewed her up, and put her on strict bed rest.""

Ashlea will remain on bed rest until the child can be delivered via C-section at 37 weeks — which ends up being in July.

“Since the surgery, [doctors have] seen so much more movement and signs of any malformation in his brain are reversing,” Ashlea explained. She also noted that doctors believe her born-again son may not have any major motor issues following his second birth. “He’s kicking his legs, and twisting his ankles in there. I can feel him moving.”

She added that she can't wait until she can meet her son.

“I’m excited for him to realize how many people were rooting for him, and how loved and special he is,” she added. “Not everyone gets the chance to have this surgery. And I want him to know that God was on his side.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mlb-child-transition-baseball,2022-05-18
"Mom tells 911 she found her boyfriend naked in bed with her 7-year-old daughter. After he runs off, mom gets in car, chases him, and hits him.","A mother called 911 saying she found her boyfriend naked in bed with her 7-year-old daughter, and after he ran off, the mother got in her car, chased him, and ended up hitting him, KCBD-TV reported.

The incident occurred in August 2021 in Texas, the station said. It came to light this week when the suspect was jailed in the Lubbock County Detention Center.

The boyfriend was identified in the police report as 29-year-old Delmer Orlando Ortiz Licona, but his name is listed as Orlando Delmer-Ortiz at the jail, KCBD reported, adding that the Lubbock man is facing charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child.

What happened?

Police said a woman called 911 around 1 a.m. Aug. 8, saying she found her boyfriend in bed with her 7-year-old daughter, the station reported.



The woman was yelling, “What are you doing to her?” during the 911 call, KCBD said. She told the dispatcher she needed an officer at her home, the station reported, adding that the mother also said, “I just found my man, huh, whoever lives with me, naked in the bed with my daughter"" and “please hurry, he’s running away, please hurry.”

When the dispatcher asked, “And he’s your boyfriend?” the woman responded, “He’s supposed to be, but you hurry up, or I’m going to kill him. I’m going to f*****g kill him. Please hurry, please hurry. I’m fixing to kill him, hurry please, please hurry, please f*****g hurry. He’s jumping the fence. He’s f*****g jumping the fence. Hurry,"" KCBD reported.

The woman identified her boyfriend to the dispatcher as ""Delmer"" who is ""from Honduras,"" the station said.

The dispatcher heard the mother tell her daughter to get in the car, and the mother told the dispatcher her child was OK and that she ""got home just [in] time,"" KCBD said.

The woman also told the dispatcher she was following the suspect, after which the dispatcher heard a loud sound as if something was hit and then a little girl screaming and crying, the station said.

The dispatcher heard someone say, “Please get an ambulance,"" KCBD reported.

When asked why, the woman said, “He’s in the alley, he just got in front of my car. He just got in front of my car, sir,"" the station said.

The dispatcher asked, “Did you just hit him?” and the woman replied, “Yes, he jumped right in front of my car, he jumped right in front of my car, sir,"" KCBD said.

She said Licona was passed out drunk but was OK and that she was OK, the station reported, adding that the call ended.

When 911 called back, the woman said Licona was moving and talking, and she was heard saying, “What were you thinking, Orlando?” and telling her daughter, “You shouldn’t have to go through that situation. You’re okay, you’re okay, he’s okay, too, the ambulance is coming,"" KCBD reported.

She also was heard saying, ""Why? Answer me. What were you doing? What were you doing? What were you doing?” the station said, adding that the call soon ended again.

What happened next?

Investigators were assigned to the case in March, according to KCBD, and the mother agreed to bring in her child for a forensic interview, after which the child gave specific details about the assault.

Police in April attempted to interview Licona about the sexual abuse investigation, the station said, but police reports said he repeatedly refused to show up for scheduled meetings with the investigator, the station said.

With that, the case was given to the the criminal district attorney’s office, an arrest warrant was issued for Licona, and he was booked Tuesday into jail, where he was being held without bond for an immigration enforcement detainer.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mom-births-baby-twice,2022-05-06
"Montana judge strikes down law requiring surgery to change gender on birth certificate, but the state says it will defy the order","A Montana judge struck down a state law that required surgery in order for a person to change their gender on a birth certificate, but the state said it would defy the order.

District Court Judge Michael G. Moses said Thursday that the law violated the state constitution.

""The medical consensus in the United States is that gender identity is innate and that efforts to change a person’s gender identity are harmful to a person’s health and well-being, but also are unethical,"" wrote Moses.

The Republican-controlled state passed a law to restrict birth certificate changes without surgery, but Moses had previously found the law unconstitutional. The state then issued a new rule blocking all changes to birth certificates.

Moses chided attorneys for trying to get around his previous ruling.

“Isn’t that exactly what happened here?” Moses asked. “I’m a bit offended the department thinks they can do anything they want.”

Mere hours after the decision, the Montana Department of Health and Welfare indicated it would defy the order and refuse to process changes in birth certificates.

“The Department thoroughly evaluated the judge’s vague April 2022 decision and crafted our final rule to be consistent with the decision,"" said Department of Public Health and Human Services director Charlie Brereton.

""It’s unfortunate that the judge’s ruling today does not square with his vague April decision,” he added.

ACLU attorney Malita Picasso expressed outrage at the statement by Brereton.

“It’s shocking that after this morning’s hearing the department would allege there was any lack of clarity in the court’s ruling from the bench,” Picasso said. “It was very clear that Judge Moses expressly required a reversion to the 2017 policy, and anything short of that is a continued flagrant violation of the court’s order.”

Mother attempts to murder her 2 young children by slitting their throats. She then FaceTimes their father and goes live on social media,"On Sunday, a New Orleans woman, Jenee Pedesclaux, called the father of her children several times to show him the stab wounds she had inflicted on their 2-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter. According to court records, Pedesclaux then slit the necks of both children.



On Pedesclaux's initial call to the children's father, Jermaine Roberts, she told him that she had damaged his car and would not go to jail. She threatened to kill herself and their children.

According to WWL-TV, Pedesclaux then FaceTimed Roberts and showed him his 2-year-old son, whose neck appeared to be red. She called again and showed Roberts his 4-year-old daughter, who appeared to be bleeding from the neck. On the last call Pedesclaux made, Roberts reported seeing his daughter gasping for air.

The 31-year-old mother went live on social media while covered in blood and allegedly stated, ""I'm done; my children is dead! I'm done, I'm done, and it's all Jermaine fault! It's always Jermaine fault! I'm done! I'm killing myself!""

Roberts notified the police after Pedesclaux's first call and rushed to the house to save his children. Pedesclaux refused to let him inside when he arrived and stated, ""We gone. It's over with.""

Roberts broke a window to force his way into the home. The mother threatened Roberts with a knife and bit him. Roberts grabbed his children and drove them to the hospital, where both were rushed into surgery.

Pedesclaux's daughter, Paris Roberts, did not survive the attack and succumbed to hemorrhagic shock on Sunday. The child had a laceration on her neck that damaged her trachea. Paris sustained additional injuries on her shoulders and upper chest.

Pedesclaux's son, Jay'Ceon Roberts, also suffered multiple injuries and damage to his trachea. The young boy was intubated in critical but stable condition.

Court records state that Pedesclaux turned the knife on herself and made a superficial cut below her neck. She was treated for the injury and booked into jail. She now faces one charge of second-degree murder and one charge of attempted second-degree murder.

In November, Roberts' girlfriend, Attoundra Baptiste, filed a non-domestic stay-away order against Pedesclaux after she damaged her vehicle. Pedesclaux pleaded guilty to the damage.

Roberts and Pedesclaux were in a custody dispute over their two children. In April, Roberts requested joint custody. He stated that the children's mother was ""not stable or providing a healthy environment for the kids.""

Traces of benzodiazepine, cocaine, and cannabinoids were found in Pedesclaux's system during a drug test in March.

Her family released a statement implying that Pedesclaux suffered from ongoing mental health issues. It read, ""Mental health is a crisis that is affecting every family and ours is no different. The lack of mental health services and the toxic mix of social media has added to the problems we face as a community. This is a large family of faith and we ask with all humility that the city pray for our family and for our Paris and Jay'Ceon.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/montana-judge-gender-birth-certificate,2022-08-11
Mother saved her 10-year-old from a school that covertly transitioned her. Now she's fighting back and speaking out against the 'medicalization of children',"Schools across America are affirming the gender dysphoria of children without parental consent.



While some educators have been exposed for intentionally confusing children on matters of sex and identity, entire school boards are doubling down, with some battling in court to keep facilitating students' so-called transitions without telling parents.

When Jennifer — who omitted her surname for the sake of her child's privacy — caught her school covertly transitioning her 10-year-old daughter; she rescued her little girl and began homeschooling.

In many similar cases, the cards appear stacked against parents, particularly those unable to homeschool but wary of strangers confusing their kids and putting them on paths to sterile, drug-dependent, and disenchanted lives.

Jennifer recognized that while her little girl was spared, she wouldn't be the last targeted; that educators, school administrators, pharmaceutical companies, psychologists, and other power- and profit-incentivized parties were just getting started.

Recognizing that other parents may need help and that this is a battle worth winning, Jennifer and other parents are now going on the offensive.



TheBlaze recently spoke to Jennifer about the fight her volunteer organization, Partners for Ethical Care, is taking to the loose coalition of bad actors apparently eager to transmogrify children, usurp parental rights, and turn a profit at the expense of innocence.



What are the details?

In November, Jennifer told Wesley Yang, who runs the Substack ""Year Zero,"" about how her school first socially transitioned her 10-year-old daughter without informing her.



""The school was using a name that she made up, so not her name that was given to her, and different pronouns,"" said Jennifer.

Jennifer's daughter no longer used the girls' bathroom. Had she been 13 or older, she would have been able to use boys' facilities without Jennifer knowing, but as she was still only 10 at the time, she instead used the office washroom.

A school therapist would regularly meet with Jennifer's daughter, ultimately in excess of five hours.

In these meetings, the therapist would reportedly employ biologically inaccurate pronouns in reference to the little girl and egg on the child's temporary identity crisis.

One teacher went so far as to suggest that Jennifer's little girl be assigned to a boys' cabin at camp.

For the most part, the school elected not to keep Jennifer's family in the loop.

""It just felt so much like an injustice,"" she told TheBlaze. ""I knew I was gonna try to do whatever I could to push back against it.""

Despite fearing that Child Protective Services might break up her family, citing her refusal to accommodate the so-called transition, Jennifer ultimately pulled her daughter out. CPS fortunately never came, and Jennifer now homeschools her child.



Her daughter's previous confusion, exacerbated by her LGBT friend group and by social media, dissipated over time.

While her battle for her daughter's well-being was over, Jennifer's war against the ""medicalization of children"" was just beginning.

Partners for Ethical Care

While Jennifer and her family enjoyed the requisite stability to homeschool, she recognized that not all parents have that as an option. She also suspected that soon, CPS and other state agencies would be weaponized against families antipathetic to the medicalization of their children.

""I do remember at some point, my mother's saying to me, 'This is so huge. ... What are you going to be able to do?' I said I don't know, but if I don't, who will do something?"" said Jennifer. ""Everything has to start somewhere, right?""

Jennifer noted that at the time, she wasn't aware of some of the other groups committed to protecting children from the transsexual agenda but is now well acquainted with the work of Stephanie Davies-Arai of Transgender Trend and others in the U.S. extra to the ""vast underground network of parents"" committed to the fight.

Keen to undertake an initiative of their own, Jennifer, Alix Aharon of the Gender Mapping Project, Jeannette Cooper, and several others banded together in fall 2020.

Jennifer recalled the sentiment early on: ""We're like, let's start this organization. Let's fight. Let's fight the medicalization. ... We were looking to create awareness because there didn't seem to be much outside of our tiny bubble. And to gather stories to potentially help [in legal efforts].""

The group they founded is called Partners for Ethical Care.

""No child is born in the wrong body"" is the understanding underpinning the work undertaken by the volunteers behind PEC, all committed to stopping the ""medicalization of children.""

As part of its campaign to raise awareness, PEC shares testimonials on both its website and podcast from families adversely affected by transsexual ideology as well as from those who have ""desisted"" (i.e., ended social and or medical transmogrifications.)

PEC also provides parents with resources detailing methods by which they can opt their kids out of gender education programs and find ""gender-critical"" therapists, as well as what to look out for in the way of deceptive practices widely employed by school administrators and educators.

The awareness and resource campaign is critically important, suggested Jennifer, since the fight against the medicalization agenda targeting minors and the true nature of the underlying problem is ""under a media blackout, especially in left-wing media, mainstream media.""

Best practices

Jennifer highlighted three major ways parents can confront this threat posed to their children.

First, she suggested that parents should regulate and monitor their kids' interactions online.

""The biggest thing is for parents to keep their kids off the internet for as long as possible,"" she said. ""My daughter did learn some of these things in an online forum — a drawing forum.""

Whether it's on Discord or in online games, ""The internet is a predator's playground right now.""

According to Jennifer, both predators and the ideologically motivated seek out the vulnerable online.

Narrowing kids' exposure to content that inspires and promotes gender dysphoria online is important but only a partial measure.

Second, Jennifer suggested that parents need to stand up for their kids in their school districts.

Any ground conceded by parents regarding how their children are to be raised is ground that will ultimately be taken by bad actors. Thus, parents need to keep ""standing up for their kids and trying to change the harmful policies"" in schools.

""I will say it's scary for a lot of people to go up [against school boards and educators],"" she said, noting how parents critical of transsexual bathroom policies and the crimes they enabled in Loudoun County, Virginia, ""got framed as terrorists.""

Jennifer suggested that the PEC, like the parental rights movements combatting transsexual propaganda and policies in Virginia and the coalition of Muslim and Christian parents who recently sued a school board in Ohio, are not, contrary to the suggestion of some LGBT activists, ""powered by hate.""

""We are not getting paid. We're doing this out of love. We're doing this because we care that much,"" she said.

Third, ""every parent should look into the gender policy at their school. Information is power.""



This can be hard, she said, because often, schools keep their real intents and policies hidden.

The foundation for these three tactics is awareness.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mother-attempts-to-murder-her-2-young-children-by-slitting-their-throats-she-then-facetimes-their-father-and-goes-live-on-social-media,2022-12-21
"Mother of 10-year-old rape victim shocks reporter, claims everything being said about alleged perpetrator is a 'lie'","The alleged mother of the 10-year-old girl at the center of a national story told a reporter on Thursday that the man accused of raping her daughter is the victim of slanderous lies.

What are the details?

Telemundo reporter María Vargas-Pion went to the house where law enforcement apprehended 27-year-old Gerson Fuentes, the man charged with raping the child.

The woman who opened the door identified herself as the mother of the young child, confirming the victim also lives there and that she is ""fine."" Shockingly, the woman, who refused to provide her name, claimed that everything being said about Fuentes is a ""lie.""

According to Vargas-Pion, the mother also confirmed that she refused to press charges against Fuentes.

She reportedly refused to press charges despite Fuentes, according to Telemundo, telling police that he had sexual contact with the young girl on at least two occasions. The assaults reportedly happened when the girl was 9 years old, Telemundo reported, and resulted in a pregnancy, which was terminated in an abortion procedure last month.

Fuentes is being held in jail on $2 million bond. He is from Guatemala and was living in the United States illegally.

Anything else?

Another interesting aspect to the story is whether physicians who knew about the sexual assault reported the case to law enforcement, as required by Ohio and Indiana law.

The Indianapolis Star confirmed that Dr. Caitlin Bernard, the Indianapolis OB/GYN who performed the abortion, disclosed the abortion by filing the correct forms with the Indiana Department of Health and the Department of Child Services.

Bernard filed the appropriate form on July 2, two days after the abortion, according to the newspaper. Indiana law mandates the form be filed within three days for patients under the age of 16.

Still, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita (R) said the state will investigate the circumstances of the case.

""As we stated, we are gathering evidence from multiple sources and agencies related to these allegations,"" Rokita told the Star. ""Our legal review of it remains open.""

Meanwhile, attorney Kathleen Delaney said Bernard is considering legal action against Rokita and others for having ""smeared"" her.

""She followed all relevant policies, procedures, and regulations in this case, just as she does every day to provide the best possible care for her patients,"" Delaney said in a statement provided to the Star.

""She has not violated any law, including patient privacy laws, and she has not been disciplined by her employer,"" the statement continued. ""We are considering legal action against those who have smeared my client, including Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, and know that the facts will all come out in due time.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mother-fighting-back-and-speaking-out-against-the-medicalization-of-children,2022-07-15
"Mother preparing to take her kids to school spots stranger on front porch. He refuses her demands to leave, so mom shoots him multiple times.","A Texas mother shot a stranger multiple times Thursday morning when he refused to obey her repeated orders to leave the front porch of her home in Spring, which is about a half hour north of Houston.

What are the details?

""Mom was getting ready to actually take the kids to school, and that's when she was alerted from her motion that somebody was on her front porch. And that's when all this started,"" Investigator Bryan O'Neal of the Harris County Sheriff's Office told KTRK-TV regarding the scary 6 a.m. encounter in the Breckenridge Forest Subdivision. ""So definitely not a good way to start your morning.""

The mother told KTRK off camera that she didn't recognize the man. Sheriff's deputies told the station she called 911 and said the man wouldn't leave. KTRK added that doorbell camera video reportedly shows her repeatedly asking the man to leave.

Soon the mother came outside, the station said, adding that deputies indicated she held the man at gunpoint and phoned family members for help.

When the man did not comply with her request to leave, she fired her gun, investigators told KTRK. Deputies added to the station that she shot the man four to six times. Her boyfriend, who lives nearby, showed up at the scene and reportedly also fired his gun, KTRK added.

The Harris County District Attorney's Office will review the case and determine if charges should be filed, the station said, adding that the homeowner is cooperating with investigators.

Deputies said the mother and her children were unharmed, KTRK added.

What happened to the man who wouldn't leave the porch?

The man was taken to a hospital where he underwent surgery, the station said, adding that his condition and identity are unknown. Investigators added to KTRK that they believe he's between 45 and 50 years old.

SkyEye video taken above the home in the 2500 block of Joyful Forest Drive showed a lot of blood on the driveway and entrance area of the home, the station said.

Mother regrets socially transitioning 4-year-old son to a girl: 'Like leaving a cult',"A self-described former ""true believer"" in gender ideology has publicly admitted that she regrets ""leading"" her son to transition into a girl when he was just four years old.

A woman and mother, identified only as Rose, recently discussed her story on the podcast ""TRIGGERnometry,"" hosted by comedians Konstantin Kisin and Francis Foster. On the episode entitled ""I Transitioned My Child - I Regret It,"" Rose appeared on screen with her face obscured but otherwise spoke openly about how she spent years raising her two sons as gender-neutral and how denying them a clear gender identity ultimately harmed them.

""The ideology stops you"" from asking too many questions and from ""putting the pieces together"" to get to the truth, Rose told Kisin and Foster. ""You just say, 'This is this. Period.' There's no understanding of what's underneath"" the ideology, she said.

Rose first shared her story in a Substack article last August. In the article, ""True Believer,"" Rose explained that she and her lesbian lover, whom she referred to as her ""partner"" and her ""spouse,"" were so entrenched in gender ideology that they decided to raise their two sons as gender-neutral. Though using ""he/him"" pronouns for both, they never told the boys that they were male and had determined to let the boys decide for themselves which gender they wanted to be.

It was a decision that still ""continues to haunt"" her, she claimed. When her older son was three or four, he began demanding answers about his gender, but she and her ""partner"" insisted that he could choose. ""I was leading my innocent, sensitive child down a path of lies that were a direct on-ramp to psychological damage and life-long irreversible medical intervention,"" she admitted. ""All in the name of love, acceptance, and liberation.""

Not only did that boy's temporary decision to identify as a girl affect him, but it also influenced his younger brother, who soon afterward claimed he wanted to be a girl, despite showing no outward signs of femininity. Because the younger boy's professed desire to be a girl did not accord with the boy they knew him to be, Rose and her ""spouse"" began to question their assumptions, including the assumptions they had adopted when they began ascribing to gender ideology.

""Everything we thought we knew or believed that had led us to socially transition our older son began to unravel,"" Rose said.

Rose and her ""spouse"" eventually informed the boys that they were male, not female, and restored the boys' given names, pronouns, and clothes. Though the initial process of detransitioning them was challenging, Rose intimated that detaching herself from gender ideology was even more difficult. The women had surrounded themselves with people who had praised them for ""affirming"" their children's gender identity and who had encouraged them to avoid all friends and loved ones who refused to follow along, so they felt alone, confused, and full of remorse.

""Mama, this is your fault,"" Rose recalled her son saying to her. ""You changed my name.""

""This experience for me has felt like leaving a cult, a cult that would have me sacrifice my child to the gods of gender ideology, in the name of social justice and collective liberation,"" Rose wrote. ""I have left this cult, and I am never turning back.""

The boys, now eight and nine, are now ""happy and thriving,"" she said. But Rose said she still lives with regrets about the harm she inflicted on them and may have continued to inflict, if she and her ""partner"" had not radically changed their approach to parenting.

""When I look back at this, it is almost too much to write about,"" she stated. ""The grief and the shock of what we did is so deep, so wide, so sharp and penetrating. How could a mother do this to her child? To her children? I truly believed that what I was doing was pure, right and good, only to later realize with horror what it could have lead to for my child.

""This horror still shakes me to my core,"" she said.

"Senate's top gun-control advocate squashes Biden's hope for more gun control, assault weapons ban","Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a top gun-control advocate, dismissed on Sunday the possibility that lawmakers will pass new gun-control legislation before Republicans take control of the House in January.



What is the background?

After two mass shootings last week, President Joe Biden demanded that Congress pass ""stricter gun control"" laws before the new Congress convenes in January.

""The idea we still allow semiautomatic weapons to be purchased is sick. It's just sick. It has no, no social redeeming value. Zero. None. Not a single, solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers,"" Biden said on Friday.

He also confirmed that he is ""going to try to get rid of assault weapons"" during the lame-duck session in Congress.

But what did Murphy say?

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Murphy admitted an assault weapons ban passed by the House is unlikely to pass the Senate.

""I'm glad that President Biden is going to be pushing us to take a vote on an assault weapons ban. The House has already passed it. It's sitting in front of the Senate,"" Murphy began.

""Does it have 60 votes in the Senate right now? Probably not,"" he explained.

""But let's see if we can try to get that number as close to 60 as possible,"" the senator continued. ""If we don't have the votes, then we will talk to [Senate Majority Leader Chuck] Schumer and maybe come back next year with maybe an additional senator and see if we can do better.""

Murphy also suggested the federal government should punish so-called ""Second Amendment sanctuary"" localities.

""They have decided that they are going to essentially refuse to implement laws that are on the books. That is a growing problem in this country,"" Murphy claimed. ""And I think we’re gonna have to have a conversation about that in the United States Senate. Do we want to continue to supply funding to law enforcement in counties that refuse to implement state and federal gun laws?""

Second Amendment sanctuary states and cities, however, generally have not vowed to outright ignore laws.

Rather, they have simply passed resolutions vowing to protect the Second Amendment and not enforce controversial gun control measures whose constitutionality, and thus legality, is disputed. Indeed, promising to enforce Second Amendment rights is enforcing the law.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/mother-regrets-socially-transitioning-4-year-old-son-to-a-girl-like-leaving-a-cult,2022-11-28
Elon Musk says Twitter deal 'cannot move forward' until platform discloses how many users are really just bots,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk said Tuesday that his deal to purchase Twitter Inc. ""cannot move forward"" until the company comes clean about how many of its hundreds of millions of active users are, in fact, spam bots.

The development is the latest escalation in an ongoing feud between Musk and Twitter executives, who last month agreed to let the Tesla founder buy the social platform outright for approximately $44 billion after much haranguing.

Since then, however, Musk has placed the deal ""on hold"" as he seeks more information from the company regarding its true user base.

The presence of spam accounts on Twitter is widely considered a major problem. But in recent weeks, Twitter has maintained that fake or spam accounts represent fewer than 5% of its total number of users. However, many observers, including Musk, remain highly skeptical of that determination — especially since the company itself noted the figure was essentially a loose estimate.

""In making this determination, we applied significant judgment, so our estimation of false or spam accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated,"" the company said in an April 28 quarterly report.

In a tweet Tuesday, Musk claimed without citing a source that at least 20% of Twitter's users are fake before suggesting that the figure could even be much higher than that. Then he dropped the hammer by declaring his acquisition pulled until further clarity on the matter is achieved.

""My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate,"" Musk said, adding, ""Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%.""

""This deal cannot move forward until he does,"" he concluded.

Musk's allegation was bolstered by a recent study assessing that 49.3% of followers on President Biden's official @POTUS Twitter account are ""fake followers."" The study, put on using an audit tool from software company SparkToro, analyzed Biden's followers' accounts based on a number of factors, including location issues and default profile images, according to Newsweek.

MarketWatch reported this week that many market analysts think Musk is using the spam bot discrepancy to negotiate a lower price for the deal or back out entirely. But in response, Twitter has reiterated its intent to complete the deal under its original conditions.

Musk has pressed the issue before, though.

In April, he declared, ""If our Twitter bid succeeds, we will defeat the spam bots or die trying!""

Then in May, he added, ""There is so much potential with Twitter to be the most trusted & broadly inclusive forum in the world! That is why we must clear out bots, spam & scams. Is something actually public opinion or just someone operating 100k fake accounts? Right now, you can’t tell.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/murphy-biden-assault-weapons-ban,2022-05-18
"Muslim soccer player refuses to wear rainbow jersey backing LBGTQ, sits out game — now leftists smell blood: 'Homophobia is not an opinion but a crime'","Idrissa Gueye — a Muslim soccer player for French team Paris Saint-Germain — refused to wear a jersey adorned with rainbow-colored numbers in support of an LBGTQ agenda and sat out his team's 4-0 Saturday win against Montpellier, the Daily Mail reported.

Now, one activist group wants an investigation, and others want Gueye punished.

What are the details?

The Daily Mail said players across France wore the special jerseys over the weekend in solidarity with the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia, which takes place Tuesday.

Gueye's manager Mauricio Pochettino said the player's absence from the match was for ""personal reasons, but he is not injured,"" the outlet added.

But the Daily Mail, citing French outlet RMC Sport, said Gueye was out because he didn't want to wear the jersey with rainbow colors; the Daily Mail added that its sports news section has contacted Gueye's representatives for comment.

'Homophobia is not an opinion but a crime'

Rouge Direct — which the Daily Mail said fights against homophobia in sport — is calling for action and wants the French League and Gueye's team to find out why he missed the game.

""Homophobia is not an opinion but a crime,"" Rouge Direct tweeted Sunday. ""The [league] and the [team] must ask ... Gueye to explain [himself] and very quickly. And punish him if necessary.""

President of the France LGBT+ Sports Federation Eric Arassus told RMC Sport that Gueye ""is a great player, but religion is not a part of the sport. Every player took part [in the rainbow jersey initiative] except him. He should be sanctioned. Gueye’s excuses show that the club [PSG] and league let homophobia happen,"" the Daily Mail said.

Gueye, 32, regularly shares messages about his faith on social media, the outlet added.

L’Equipe newspaper reported that Gueye missed last season's match during which the rainbow jerseys were worn due to gastroenteritis, the Associated Press said.

How have others reacted?

Reactions on Twitter to Gueye sitting out the game seemed mixed, though it seems, so far, most folks support his decision:

""Idrissa Gueye is Muslim. He has never (not to anyone's knowledge) mistreated or discriminated against any member of the LBGTQ community,"" one user said. ""Forcing him to be a poster boy for a something against his faith, however, is very disrespectful, borderline Islamophobic even.""

""He has every right not wear some stupid LGBTQ+ flag on his [jersey] ... what happened to freedom of choice?"" another user asked. ""Why are these devils trying to shove it down everyone’s throat ... Massive Respect Idrissa Gueye ... I’m now a fan.""

""Hope more footballers are like Idrissa Gueye,"" another user said. ""We should never allow people to shove their extreme and insane ideology down in our throats.""

Nancy Pelosi's husband pleads guilty to DUI and causing injury charge – dodges jail time,"Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was arrested in May for driving under the influence and causing a collision. On Tuesday, Pelosi pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five days in jail, but he will not be required to serve that time.



Judge Joseph Solga subtracted four days from the sentence – two days that Pelosi already spent in jail and two days of good conduct credit. With only one day remaining in the jail sentence, the judge ordered him instead to participate in an eight-hour work program, reported Fox News Digital.

Pelosi was also sentenced to participate in a three-month drunk driving program, one year with an ignition interlock device on his vehicle, three years of probation, and $7,000 in restitution payments.

He was initially charged with two misdemeanors following the car accident. Pelosi was released from Napa County Department of Corrections custody in May on $5,000 bail, the Associated Press reported. On August 3, he pleaded not guilty to both charges. On Tuesday, one of the two charges was dropped.

Pelosi was not present in the courtroom for either court date but had his lawyer, Amanda Bevins, appear on his behalf.

The accident occurred on May 28 and involved his 2021 Porsche and a 2014 Jeep. It caused ""major collision damage"" to the other vehicle, and the driver stated ""that he had begun suffering pain in his upper right arm, right shoulder and neck the day after the crash.""

When police officers arrived at the scene, Pelosi reportedly handed them his California Highway Patrol 11-99 Foundation membership card. The organization provides ""emergency benefits and assistance to CHP employees and their families and scholarships to their children."" Fox News Digital reported that the charity ""was reviewing Pelosi's membership due to the incident.""

On ""Jesse Watters Primetime,"" DUI attorney in Napa County Ryan Wilber stated that Pelosi received special treatment. He said, ""I have personally handled many cases where there is an allegation of injury, and almost the knee-jerk reaction when prosecutors get that information across their desk is that it's a felony, and maybe they'll reduce it later. But it almost always, almost always, starts off as a felony. And my understanding of the injuries in this case, it was shocking to me to see that it was not filed as a felony right away.""

The news outlet reported that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to comment, and her office referred to her husband's arrest as a ""private matter.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/muslim-soccer-player-rainbow-jersey,2022-08-23
"Nancy Pelosi talks inflation, abortion ahead of midterms","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) gave an interview on Sunday, but she didn't want to talk about inflation or if she would step down from her leadership position in the new Congress in January.

Pelosi gave an interview during CBS News’ “Face The Nation” on Sunday. She was asked about inflation – the top issue for American voters heading into midterm elections, followed by the economy and jobs.

""And the fact is, is that, when I hear people talk about inflation, we have to change that subject,"" Pelosi revealed. ""Inflation is a global phenomenon.""

Inflation is a losing issue for Democrats. A new ABC News poll found that 36% of Americans trust Republican leadership to handle record inflation versus 21% who believe in Democrats.

Pelosi defended the record inflation in the United States that has crippled Americans by saying, ""The E.U., the European Union, the U.K., the British, have a higher inflation rate than we do here.""

""It's not – the fight is not about inflation. It's about the cost of living,"" Pelosi told host Margaret Brennan. ""And if you look at what we have done to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, to bring down the cost of – of energy and the rest in our legislation, you will see that that has been opposed every step of the way by the Republicans, and they have no plan for lowering the cost of living or helping with inflation.""

Bloomberg reported last month, ""August electricity bills for US consumers jumped the most since 1981, gaining 15.8% from the same period a year ago, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.""

Brennan asked Pelosi if she regrets sending out $1,400 checks and passing huge pandemic relief bills, and if they contributed to inflation.

""No, absolutely not, because this – that was necessary for people to survive. Our purpose,"" she responded. ""But the point is, is that, when you reduce unemployment, it's inflationary. That is a fact.""

Brennan pointed out a CBS News poll that found abortion ranks as the seventh most important voting issue for Americans, and the top concerns are the economy, inflation, crime, and immigration. She asked Pelosi if Democrats made a ""miscalculation"" in going all-in on abortion messaging and seemingly neglecting the economy.

""Well, I can just say this. Nobody ever – elections are about the future,"" Pelosi replied. ""They're about the economy. Everybody knows that. Nobody said we're doing abortion, rather than the economy, but it's – it's about both. And I can tell you that that issue is very, very provocative and encouraging people to vote across the country.""

Brennan asked Pelosi if she intends to remain in a leadership role when the new Congress happens in January.

Pelosi shot back, ""I'm not talking about that. I'm here to talk about how we win the election.""

""I'm not here to talk about me,"" the 82-year-old Democrat continued. ""I'm here to talk about the future, America's working families, for the children. It's always about the children.""

In December 2018, Pelosi vowed to step down as the top Democrat in the House by 2022.

“Over the summer, I made it clear that I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,"" Pelosi said in a statement nearly four years ago.



“For some time, there have been a number of conversations to advance a proposal to institute term limits for senior leadership positions in our Caucus,"" she added. ""This proposal, which was developed by Members who care about the institution of the House of Representatives, would provide that Members in senior leadership positions can serve 3 terms with an additional term with two-thirds support of the Caucus. It would include the two terms of the Democratic Majority from 2007 to 2011.""



“It is my understanding that Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries and incoming Rules Committee Chair Jim McGovern plan to bring up this proposal for a discussion and a vote by February 15th. I am comfortable with the proposal and it is my intention to abide by it whether it passes or not,"" Pelosi concluded.

Nancy Pelosi says about Taiwan what the Biden administration did not upon historic visit: 'Must stand by Taiwan',"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi published a powerful essay on Tuesday after she landed in Taiwan for a historic visit, saying what the Biden administration refused to say one day earlier.

Pelosi became on Tuesday the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Taiwan in more than 25 years. She did so in defiance of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

What did the Biden admin say?

At the White House press briefing on Monday, National Security Council coordinator John Kirby reassured the world the U.S. does not recognize Taiwan's independence.

""The world has seen the United States government be very clear that nothing has changed — nothing has changed — about our One China policy,"" Kirby said.

""We have said — and we have repeatedly said — that we oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side. We have said that we do not support Taiwan independence,"" Kirby added.

But what did Pelosi write?

While official U.S. policy may mandate that Washington not recognize Taiwan's independence, Pelosi sent a loud-and-clear message in the pages of the Washington Post after landing in Taiwan on Tuesday.

The California Democrat described Taiwan as ""a leader in governance"" and ""a leader in peace, security and economic dynamism"" — and stated unequivocally that America ""must stand by Taiwan.""

Noting that Beijing has increased its aggression toward Taiwan in recent years, Pelosi said that her visit ""should be seen as an unequivocal statement that America stands with Taiwan, our democratic partner, as it defends itself and its freedom.""

Pelosi was even explicit about the Chinese Communist Party's abuses of power and startling human rights abuses:

The CCP’s brutal crackdown against Hong Kong’s political freedoms and human rights — even arresting Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen — cast the promises of 'one-country, two-systems' into the dustbin. In Tibet, the CCP has long led a campaign to erase the Tibetan people’s language, culture, religion and identity. In Xinjiang, Beijing is perpetrating genocide against Muslim Uyghurs and other minorities. And throughout the mainland, the CCP continues to target and arrest activists, religious-freedom leaders and others who dare to defy the regime.

""We cannot stand by as the CCP proceeds to threaten Taiwan — and democracy itself,"" she said.

Anything else?

After touchdown, more than two dozen Senate Republicans released a statement expressing support for Pelosi's trip, which have since been removed from Twitter.

Editor's Note: This story originally stated that Kirby is the Pentagon spokesman; he is not. In May, Kirby left that position and joined the National Security Council as coordinator for strategic communications. We regret the error.

"National Review: Text messages contradict New York Times, support Bari Weiss claim that Times senior editor wanted Chuck Schumer's opinion on Tim Scott op-ed","A second source has reportedly come forward to support former New York Times opinion editor Bari Weiss' jaw-dropping claim that an editor at the Times once insisted that Democratic Majority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) be consulted before the paper published an op-ed by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.).

The New York Times has repeatedly denied the allegation. But National Review writer Nate Hochman reported Monday that a source ""with direct knowledge of the matter"" provided text messages from a senior New York Times editor that backed up Weiss' account and even shared the email address of Schumer spokesman Justin Goodman.



Last Wednesday, Weiss interviewed Scott for an episode of her podcast, ""Honesty with Bari Weiss,"" during which she told the South Carolina lawmaker that New York Times editors in 2020 had debated whether or not to run an op-ed from Scott on police reform in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.

Weiss, who cited ""constant bullying"" from colleagues as a reason for her departure from the Times in July 2020, alleged that a senior opinion editor had instructed a junior colleague to consult with Schumer before publishing Scott's op-ed.



""I was at the New York Times, and you or your staff sent in an op-ed about the bill and why it fell apart,"" Weiss recounted. ""And this is the part I’m not sure if you know — there was a discussion about the piece and whether or not we should run it, and one colleague, a more senior colleague, said to a more junior colleague who was pushing for the piece, ‘Do you think the Republicans really care about minority rights?’""

""Wow,"" Scott said.

""And the more junior colleague said, ‘I think Tim Scott cares about minority rights.’ And then — and here’s the pretty shocking part — the more senior colleague said, ‘Let’s check with Senator Schumer before we run it,'"" Weiss continued.

""And the colleague, the younger one, refused. Because he said — because that colleague said it wasn’t an ethical thing to do,"" she said.



The New York Times has vehemently denied this in public comments to multiple media outlets. ""New York Times Opinion never seeks outside approval or consultation whether to publish guest opinion essays,"" a spokesman for the Times told TheBlaze on Friday.

New York Times Communications repeated the denial in a tweet responding to Scott, who accused the paper of silencing him.

However, National Review reportedly obtained text messages that contradict the Times' statements and support Weiss' account. National Review's source ""shared the contents of messages that contradict the Times’ statements and reaffirm Weiss’s account. They are consistent with Weiss’s recollection that a senior editor at the Times opinion page questioned whether Republicans cared about minority rights and directed a staff member to send the Scott op-ed to Schumer’s office, though the junior editor apparently did not do so,"" Hochman wrote Monday.

The New York Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Navy rescinds punishments for SEALs seeking religious exemptions to COVID vaccine,"The U.S. Navy rolled back an order punishing SEALs who refused COVID vaccinations based on their religious beliefs, Fox News reports.

On September 24, 2021, the Navy issued “Trident Order #12 –Mandatory Vaccination for COVID-19.” The order specified that “Special Operations Designated Personnel (SEAL and SWCC) refusing to receive recommended vaccines based solely on personal or religious beliefs will still be medically disqualified,” court documents revealed.

This order meant that SEALs were designated as ""non-deployable"" if they submitted religious accommodation requests exempting them from the COVID vaccine. All special warfare forces were initially expected to come into compliance with the vaccine mandate by the middle of October 2021.

The order was put on hold due to a preliminary injunction that was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in February 2022.

Fox News reports that a new filing in the lawsuit shows the Navy quietly reversed Trident Order #12 on May 22, 2022. A communication order was sent by the Navy on May 23 stating, ""This order rescinds reference A."" ""Ref A"" was referred to as ""Trident Order #12 on COVID-19 Vaccinations.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the Navy for clarification on whether the Navy replaced the order or why Trident Order #12 was being rescinded. ""The Navy does not comment on ongoing litigation,"" a Navy spokesperson responded.

Filings also show that the legal team representing the SEALs only became aware of the recession on September 1.

""To the best of counsel’s knowledge, Trident Order #12 was not replaced. As the Court will recall, Trident Order #12 stated that SEALs who are unvaccinated due to religious beliefs are medically disqualified, though SEALs who are unvaccinated due to medical reasons are not automatically disqualified. Trident Order #12 also implemented the COVID-19 vaccine mandate at the command level for Naval Special Warfare forces, setting a deadline of compliance for October 17, 2021,"" the SEALs' legal team wrote.

The 35 SEALs involved in the lawsuit are being represented by First Liberty Institute and Hacker Stephens LLP.

First Liberty's senior counsel and director of military affairs, Mike Berry, told Fox News Digital, ""Now that the Navy has rescinded this unlawful order, the only reason it won't allow our SEALs to get back to doing their jobs is because of their religious beliefs.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/national-review-new-york-times-bari-weiss,2022-09-13
NBA star Kyrie Irving declares vaccine mandates ‘one of the biggest violations of HUMAN RIGHTS in history’,"NBA star Kyrie Irving spoke out against New York City's lingering vaccine mandate after reports indicated Mayor Eric Adams would lift the requirements for private employers but not for city workers.

""If I can work and be unvaccinated, then all of my brothers and sisters who are also unvaccinated should be able to do the same, without being discriminated against, vilified, or fired,"" the Brooklyn Nets star tweeted Tuesday.

""This enforced Vaccine/Pandemic is one the biggest violations of HUMAN RIGHTS in history,"" he added.

Irving, who is unvaccinated, has been permitted to play for the Nets at Barclays Center since March when Adams created an exemption to New York's vaccine mandate for professional athletes and performers. The exemption was added after Irving was forced to watch his teammates play from the sidelines because the city's vaccine rules prohibited him from playing but allowed him to sit in the arena. Critics blasted the health ordinance for lacking common sense.

On Tuesday, Adams announced that the strictest-in-the-nation COVID-19 vaccine mandate for private businesses and student athletes imposed by his predecessor Bill de Blasio would end on Nov. 1. However, the vaccine rules will remain in place for municipal employees.

""Our vaccinated workforce kept the city open and operating, with over 300,000 employees it was crucial to put it in place and we're keeping it in place,"" Adams said, according to WNBC-TV. ""Our vaccinated workers have carried out their jobs and stepped up when the city needed them the most and we think it's imperative to send the right message and lead by example.""

Observing that 89% of New Yorkers have been vaccinated, including children, the mayor said it was time to give schools, parents, and businesses more flexibility by lifting the vaccine requirements.

New York will continue to recommend that residents get booster shots and COVID-19 vaccinations.

""The rollout has been important and crucial and because we've been so successful, it's time to move on to the next level of fortifying our city,"" Adams said as he got the latest COVID booster at city hall. ""This puts the choice in the hands of New Yorkers. It's imperative we're asking them to continue to encourage their employees to get their vaccines and booster shots.""

New York City's vaccine requirements have resulted in more than 1,500 municipal workers getting fired for refusing to comply. There is no telling how many private sector employees lost their jobs after refusing to get vaccinated.

NYPD officers blasted the mayor Tuesday for creating a double standard with vaccine rules.

""This announcement is more proof that the vaccine mandate for New York City police officers is arbitrary, capricious, and fundamentally irrational,"" said Pat Lynch, the head of the Police Benevolent Association.

""Now that the city has abandoned any pretense of a public health justification for vaccine mandates, we expect it to settle our pending lawsuits and reinstate with back pay our members who unjustly lost their jobs,"" Lynch added.

The mayor's announcement follows New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) lifting the statewide mass transit mask mandate and other pandemic restrictions on MTA buses and subways. It also comes after President Joe Biden declared the coronavirus pandemic ""over"" in an interview with CBS News over the weekend.

NBA star Kyrie Irving suspended without pay over failure to 'say he has no antisemitic beliefs'; he's now 'unfit to be associated with the Brooklyn Nets',"Superstar NBA player Kyrie Irving was suspended for at least five games without pay Thursday by his team, the Brooklyn Nets, for failure to ""unequivocally say he has no antisemitic beliefs,"" ESPN reported.

What's the background?

Irving posted a tweet last week that linked to the Amazon page of a movie titled ""Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America,"" which is based on a 2015 book by the same name, the sports network reported in an earlier story.

ESPN said the movie contains ""antisemitic tropes.""

On Saturday night after a loss to the Indiana Pacers, Irving was asked why his tweet is still active.

""I'm not here to argue over a person or a culture or a religion and what they believe,"" Irving said, according to ESPN. ""Nah, this is what's here. It's on a public platform. Did I do anything illegal? Did I hurt anybody? Did I harm anybody? Am I going out and saying that I hate one specific group of people? ... So I'm not going to stand down on anything that I believe in. I'm only going to get stronger, because I'm not alone. I have a whole army around me.""

Media full-court press

On Thursday of this week, Irving refused to apologize during a post-practice media session, the sports network reported, and said only that he meant no harm. Irving said some things in the movie are untrue, ""but he didn't say he shouldn't have posted a link to it,"" ESPN wrote.

""I'm not the one who made the documentary,"" Irving said, according to the sports network.

ESPN added that Irving ""didn't say no"" when he was asked if he holds anti-Semitic beliefs.

""I cannot be anti-Semitic if I know where I come from,"" he said, according to the sports network.

Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt reacted by writing that ""the answer to the question 'Do you have any antisemitic beliefs' is always 'NO' without equivocation. We took @KyrieIrving at his word when he said he took responsibility, but today he did not make good on that promise. Kyrie clearly has a lot of work to do,"" ESPN said.

The sports network added that during the press conference Irving ""quickly grew defensive"" and asked reporters ""why they weren't asking questions about the history of black people in America, saying 300 million of his ancestors are buried in the country.""

""I'm just proud of my heritage and what we've been through, and the fact that this has pinned me against the Jewish community and I'm here answering questions of whether or not I'm sorry or not about something I didn't create and was something I shared, and I'm telling everybody I'm taking responsibility, then that's where I sit,"" Irving said, according to ESPN.



Irving also was asked specifically about his beliefs regarding the Holocaust, the sports network said.

""Those falsehoods are unfortunate,"" he replied in reference to the movie, ESPN said. ""And it's not that I don't believe in the Holocaust. I never said that. Never, ever have said it. It's not come out of my mouth. I never tweeted it. I never liked anything like it. So the Holocaust in itself is an event that means something to a large group of people that suffered something that could have been avoided.""

Kyrie Irving: I can dismiss any label you put on me | SportsCenter youtu.be

Suspension

After Irving's Thursday press conference, the Nets suspended him.

""We were dismayed today, when given an opportunity in a media session, that Kyrie refused to unequivocally say he has no antisemitic beliefs, nor acknowledge specific hateful material in the film. This was not the first time he had the opportunity — but failed — to clarify,"" the Nets said in a statement, according to ESPN. ""Such failure to disavow antisemitism when given a clear opportunity to do so is deeply disturbing, is against the values of our organization, and constitutes conduct detrimental to the team. Accordingly, we are of the view that he is currently unfit to be associated with the Brooklyn Nets.""

The Nets said Irving's suspension would last ""until he satisfies a series of objective remedial measures that address the harmful impact of his conduct,"" the sports network said. The Nets' statement said the organization ""made repeated attempts to work with Kyrie Irving to help him understand the harm and danger of his words and actions""

Despite Irving and the Nets announcing Wednesday that each, in conjunction with the ADL, would donate $500,000 to anti-hate causes, ESPN reported that following Irving's suspension, Greenblatt tweeted that ""we were optimistic but after watching the debacle of a press conference, it's clear that Kyrie feels no accountability for his actions. @ADL cannot in good conscience accept his donation.""

Apology

About four hours after his suspension, the sports network said Irving issued an apology on Instagram: ""To all Jewish families and communities that are hurt and affected from my post, I am deeply sorry to have caused you pain, and I apologize. I initially reacted out of emotion to being unjustly labeled anti-Semitic, instead of focusing on the healing process of my Jewish brothers and sisters that were hurt from the hateful remarks made in the documentary. I want to clarify any confusion on where I stand fighting against anti-Semitism by apologizing for posting the documentary without context and a factual explanation outlining the specific beliefs in the documentary I agreed with and disagreed with. I had no intentions to disrespect any Jewish cultural history regarding the Holocaust or perpetuate any hate. I am learning from this unfortunate event and hope we can find understanding between us all.""

Irving also said the movie ""contained some false anti-Semitic statements, narratives, and language that were untrue and offensive to the Jewish race/religion, and I take full accountability and responsibly for my actions,"" ESPN said.

Anything else?

Irving was embroiled in controversy last season, too, when he was barred from Nets home games for not receiving the COVID-19 shot in defiance of New York City's vaccine mandate. Yet Irving still was allowed to enter the Nets' arena as a spectator and sit courtside, which only exacerbated the bad optics.

Finally, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced in March an exemption from NYC's vaccine mandate for city-based athletes and performers, and Irving was back playing home games.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nba-star-kyrie-irving-savages-vaccine-mandates-ahead-of-big-new-york-city-announcement,2022-11-04
NBC News tried covertly revising article that originally contradicted White House claim that Biden admin wasn't given a choice between WNBA's Griner and Marine Paul Whelan,"NBC News issued a report contradicting the Biden administration's official narrative concerning the government's prisoner swap with Russia. Apparently hoping no one would take notice, the news organization quickly changed its original report without signaling it had done so.

While ostensibly intended to buttress the Biden administration's claims about its inability to bring home former Marine Paul Whelan, NBC News' stealth edit has prompted some to wonder what actually went on behind the scenes.

Only after being met with criticism online and a request for comment from TheBlaze did the news organization offer a retroactive correction hours later.

What are the details?

In its Dec. 8 prisoner swap with Russia, the Biden administration ultimately exchanged Viktor Bout, who conspired to kill Americans, for lesbian basketballer Brittney Griner.

The White House suggested that the Biden administration never had a choice to bring home Whelan from Russia — that ""the choice became to either bring Brittany home or no one.""



However, NBC News, citing a senior U.S. official, first reported that the ""Kremlin gave the White House the choice of either Griner or Whelan — or none.""

Rikki Ratliff-Fellman, director of programming at Blaze Media, noted a significant discrepancy between NBC News' original report and the article as it now exists online.

Without issuing an editorial note, NBC News made a stealthy change to the article, such that it now reads, ""The Kremlin ultimately gave the White House the choice of either Griner or no one after different options were proposed.""

Ratliff-Fellman highlighted the changes in a Tweet, posing the question, ""Why the cover-up?""

This alteration to the article changes the entire narrative.

It also happens to buttress the tale told by President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, and other members of the administration and mainstream media.

Biden said, ""This was not a choice of which American to bring home. ... Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul's case differently than Brittney's.""

Blinken said, ""This was not a choice of which American to bring home. The choice was one or none.""



Jean-Pierre recycled the line, saying, ""The choice was bring Brittney home or no one. The president will never stop working to secure Paul Whelan's release.""

Perhaps providing a rationale behind what NBC News originally reported was a binary decision, Jean-Pierre said that Griner is ""an important role model; an inspiration to millions of Americans particularly the LGBTQI+ Americans and women of color.""

An entire paragraph concerning Whelan's notification in prison about the ""outcome of the negotiations"" was also was initially added without editorial note to the NBC News article in addition to the stealth edit.

TheBlaze reached out to NBC News with regards to its changes, asking why it originally failed to highlight the change with an editorial note, whether someone at the White House asked for the change, whether its original source had recanted or stood by its initial claim, and whether it continues to stand by its source.

While NBC News failed to respond to TheBlaze at the time of this writing, it did however issue a correction at 4:09 p.m. on Thursday claiming that ""an earlier version of this article misstated the choice the Biden administration was given over hostages. It was to swap for Griner or no one, not a choice between Griner or Whelan.""

Notwithstanding

Despite the stealth edit and the subsequent correction, the NBC News article still references remarks made by Whelan's lawyer Vladimir Zherebenkov.

Zherebenkov indicated that the deal involved a choice and implied that it was between the former Marine and the basketballer.

The lawyer said the exchange was a ""one to one"" and that ""choosing Griner appeared 'more humane' because she is a woman and an Olympic champion, while Whelan was in the military and it is 'easier for him to be in custody.'

Although happy about Griner's release, Whelan told CNN, “I am greatly disappointed that more has not been done to secure my release, especially as the four year anniversary of my arrest is coming up.”

Whelan suggested that he was ""led to believe that things were moving in the right direction, and that the governments were negotiating and that something would happen fairly soon.""



Whelan is a former Marine who served in Iraq. He has been detained in Russia since December 2018 and was convicted by a Moscow court of espionage in 2020.

Griner, a basketballer who refused to stand for the American national anthem during home openers in 2020, was arrested in February on smuggling charges after traveling to Russia with cannabis oil in her luggage.

David Whelan, the American hostage's brother, told reporters, ""It is so important to me that it is clear that we do not begrudge Ms. Griner her freedom. ... As I have often remarked, Brittney's and Paul's cases were never really intertwined. It has always been a strong possibility that one might be freed without the other.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nba-star-kyrie-irving-suspended-without-pay,2022-12-08
NBC News punishes reporter behind viral Paul Pelosi report that the network later scrubbed: Report,"NBC News reportedly suspended an on-air reporter over a report about the Paul Pelosi attack that the network later retracted.

What is the background?

On Nov. 4, NBC News correspondent Miguel Almaguer reported that Paul Pelosi gave police no indication that he was in danger when they responded to his residence. The report was based on Almaguer's sources.

Almaguer explained:

After a ""knock and announce,"" the front door was opened by Mr. Pelosi. The 82-year-old did not immediately declare an emergency or tried to leave his home but instead began walking several feet back into the foyer toward the assailant and away from police. It's unclear if the 82-year-old was already injured or what his mental state was, say sources.

The report quickly circulated on social media. And without explanation, NBC News later scrubbed it from all network platforms.



""The piece should not have aired because it did not meet NBC News reporting standards,"" NBC News said in a statement.

The network, however, did not explain what about the report failed to meet its editorial standards, nor did the company explain how the story managed to air if the story did not go through proper vetting channels.

What happened to Almaguer?

The Daily Beast reported that NBC News suspended Almaguer and is conducting an investigation.

The network has not officially confirmed the suspension, and company representatives refused to comment about internal personnel issues, but Almaguer indeed has not appeared on NBC's airwaves since his Paul Pelosi report.

Almaguer's profile on NBC News' website has also been scrubbed.

The lack of transparency about Almaguer and the removed story is generating criticism among even people who formally worked at NBC News.

""NBC News must be more transparent with its viewers about this error. Who wrote Miguel’s script? Who approved the script? Are he and his producers suspended during an internal investigation?"" said a former network executive who spoke to Fox News.

""NBC’s silence on this matter speaks volumes,"" the former exec added. ""NBC owes it to its audience to be truthful and not cover this up.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nbc-news-covertly-revises-article-that-originally-contradicted-white-house-claim-that-biden-admin-had-a-choice-between-griner-and-whelan,2022-11-15
"North Carolina woman arrested for allegedly beating 8-year-old granddaughter to death, had been previously reported for child abuse","Police arrested Patricia Ann Ricks, 72, of Nashville, North Carolina, and charged her in the beating death of her 8-year-old granddaughter.

Police said that they were called by a juvenile at the home of Ricks on Dutchman Road to inform them that she was going to the hospital with Christal Lane, her granddaughter.

The girl died before they arrived at the hospital, police said, and investigators determined that she had died from severe blunt force trauma.

""Based on the investigation, it was determined that the 8-year-old juvenile was beaten so severe by the grandmother that she died from the injuries,"" a news release from the Nash County Sheriff's Office said. ""The child had severe injuries throughout her entire body and head.""

Nash County Sheriff's Office Capt. Robert Bowen told reporters at a media briefing that police found weapons at the home but refused to elaborate on the details.

""Some weapons or items were used as weapons at the residence,"" he said.

The girl had four siblings who were living at the Ricks residence, and they were placed into custody of Nash County Social Services Department after the incident.

Police also confirmed that Ricks had been previously referred to the Nash County Department of Social Services for accusations of child abuse just weeks before the death of the child.

""There was a referral to determine if there was abuse in the home,"" said Captain Jeff Sherrod of the Nash County Sheriff's Office.

Ricks was charged with first-degree murder and felony child abuse. She was booked into the Nash County Detention Center without bond. She appeared in court on Feb. 9.

Bowen said the incident was still under investigation as police try to determine a motive for the killing.

North Carolina single father jailed for 24 hours with no bond for refusing to wear mask in judge's courtroom,"A judge in Harnett County, North Carolina, put a man in prison for showing up for jury duty without a face mask.

Gregory Hahn, 47, was jailed for contempt of court after he refused to wear a face mask in Judge Charles Gilchrist's courtroom. Gilchrist is reportedly the only judge in the county who has implemented a mask mandate.

On Monday, Hahn appeared for orientation with 98 other people who were summoned for jury duty. He says that prior to showing up on Monday, there was no notice that jurors were required to wear masks.



“There were signs saying no masks were required,” Hahn told local news station WRAL-TV. “We all walked in.”

According to Superior Court clerk Renee Whittenton, everyone in Gilchrist's courtroom is required to wear a mask, and the jurors were notified of this requirement at check-in.



“You can go in any district courtroom without a mask, you can come into superior court without a mask and the [district attorney’s] office without a mask, but with Judge Gilchrist he has a mandate that you must wear a mask,” Whittenton told WRAL.

The clerk said that any juror who did not have one was provided with a mask to wear.

But Hahn said potential jurors were not told about the mask requirements. There was no notice on his summons. And there is not signage at the courthouse indicating masks are required.

“I said, ‘I’m not going to wear a mask,’” Hahn said. “He said, ‘I understand you don’t want to wear a mask,’ and I said, ‘That is correct, sir,’ and he says, ‘Why?’”

Hahn said the judge asked him again if he would refuse to wear a mask in the courtroom. He told Gilchrist that was correct.

“[Gilchrist] said ‘24 hours in the Harnett County jail,’” Hahn told WRAL.

Hahn was then handcuffed, booked, and taken to jail under no bond for contempt of court.

""I never thought this could happen in this country,"" Hahn said.

Harnett and Lee Counties issued a joint order on March 10, 2022, permitting the presiding judge in each courtroom to decide, at their discretion, whether masks are required, WRAL reported. Masks are optional in hallways, foyers, restrooms, meeting rooms, and other areas elsewhere in the courthouse.



Hahn said he asked the judge if he could be excused since it was one day in jail.

He recounted that Gilchrist said, ""I could, but I'm not going to.""

Hahn, a single father, also asked if he could call his son at home. The judge refused, Hahn said.

“I was dumbfounded,” Hahn said. “I felt it was bullying.”

He told WRAL that his 24 hours spent in jail were the worst of his life and accused the judge of bringing in his personal beliefs into the courtroom.

""I'm jailed for doing my civic duty and not doing anything,"" Hahn said. ""It's mind-boggling.""

He added that the judge acted hypocritically and told WRAL he's considering filing a lawsuit.



“The irony of this whole thing is that the judge was talking to me without a mask on,” Hahn told WRAL.

"About half of all US homicides remain unsolved, even as case numbers rise: 'It's a 50-50 coin flip'","An analysis of recent crime data indicates that homicide clearance rates are down, even as homicide rates have spiked.

According to a report issued by the FBI regarding crime statistics, local law enforcement agencies have struggled to solve even half of the cases that come under their jurisdiction.

""It's a 50-50 coin flip,"" says Thomas Hargrove, who runs the Murder Accountability Project, which tracks unsolved murders nationwide. ""It's never been this bad. During the last seven months of 2020, most murders went unsolved. That's never happened before in America.""

This disturbing trend becomes even more worrisome as homicide rates continue to climb. According to MSNBC, murder rates increased by almost 15% between September 2020 and September 2021, and cities like Los Angeles, Baltimore, and even Jackson, Mississippi, have been unable to contend with the increase in case loads.

Though a city of just 160,000 people, Jackson recorded 153 homicides in the last year and has just eight homicide detectives on staff to investigate them.

""The whole system is backlogged,"" said James Davis, the police chief of Jackson. ""I could use more police officers. I could use more homicide detectives, but if the state is backed up, the court is backed up, we will still have the same problem by developing these cases that we're already doing.""

In its report about low homicide clearance rates, CBS notes a disparity in clearance rates for cases involving black victims and those involving white victims. Cases involving white victims, the report claims, are resolved ""about 50% more than when the victims were black."" However, FBI data indicates that between 2010 and 2020, there were approximately 16% more black homicide victims nationwide than white victims, and more black victims mean more of their cases are unsolved.

Not to mention, differences in clearance reporting affects overall numbers and suggest that the clearance rate for black victims might be even lower than otherwise thought. Chicago, with its remarkably high homicide rate, often grants ""exceptional clearances"" — intended to be used only when an offender is dead, serving a sentence on another case, or when a victim refuses to cooperate — to cases in which no perpetrator has been tried or perhaps even identified, an indication that the 44% clearance rate Chicago reported in 2020 may have been inflated.

But while victim demographics, police department sizes, and changing crime rates are interesting, they miss the true story at the most basic level: the grieving friends and family members who are left without answers.

Marsha Mayes, whose 3-year-old son Terrell Mayes Jr. was killed by a stray bullet more than a decade ago, has still not gotten justice, but she remains hopeful.

""I want the killer to know you can't run,"" Mayes said. ""God knows everything.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nc-single-father-jailed-no-bond-refusing-wear-mask,2022-07-01
Illinois man allegedly kidnapped 3 Ohio children after communicating with 12-year-old through SnapChat and other social media​,"An Illinois man is facing a kidnapping charge after three children from Ohio were found in his car, and police say he had been conversing with one of them on social media for weeks.

The Lake County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post that it was contacted on Jan. 21 by the parents of two missing children from Middleton, Ohio. Their 12-year-old and 14-year-old daughters were missing. Also missing was a 15-year-old boy who was a friend of one of their daughters.

They said that one of their cellphones was tracked to an address in Beach Park, a village of about 14,000 people in the northeast part of Illinois.

Police were able to determine that 19-year-old Michael Negron lived at the address and also drove a Ford Mustang that matched the description of a car seen in Middleton.

Sheriff's deputies were located the car at a gas station and found Negron with the children. They arrested the man, and he was transported to the Lake County Sheriff’s Office Criminal Investigations Division. The children were transported to the Lake County Children’s Advocacy Center.

Investigators say that Negron had been communicating with the 12-year-old girl for several weeks through social media and games, including Fortnite and SnapChat, and then moved on text messages and FaceTime.

Police said one of the children had also texted a description of the car they were in. They allegedly tried to leave his car, but he refused to let them go.

He has been charged with one count of kidnapping and three counts of child endangerment. Police said additional charges are possible. He remains in jail under a $200,000 bond.

Lake County Sherrif's Office Deputy Chief Christopher Covelli told WFLD-TV that Negron's intention and motivation for allegedly kidnapping the children are still under investigation.

He went on to warn parents that they should be closely monitoring their children's interactions on social media and online.

""There are predators out there, and they use apps that the kids are on, for example in this case, he was using Fortnite, SnapChat, and then they started communicating on FaceTime, text message, telephone.""

The children have been reunited with their parents.

Netflix shares blunt message to woke employees offended by its content: 'Netflix may not be the best place for you',"Netflix is taking a hard-line stance against woke employees who advocate for silencing artists whose content offends them.

The news comes after Netflix disclosed a dismal business performance in the first quarter of 2022. The company, in fact, lost 200,000 subscribers between January and March, the first subscriber decline in more than a decade. The company had expected a net gain of 2.5 million subscribers over that time period.

What are the details?

The streaming platform updated its famous corporate culture memo to include a section on ""Artistic Expression,"" Variety reported. The memo vows Netflix will not cancel artists even if Netflix employees find the content objectionable or ""harmful.""

""Not everyone will like — or agree with — everything on our service,"" the memo reads. ""While every title is different, we approach them based on the same set of principles: we support the artistic expression of the creators we choose to work with; we program for a diversity of audiences and tastes; and we let viewers decide what’s appropriate for them, versus having Netflix censor specific artists or voices.""

The memo adds that if employees cannot support Netflix's work, they should hit the road and find another job.

""As employees we support the principle that Netflix offers a diversity of stories, even if we find some titles counter to our own personal values. Depending on your role, you may need to work on titles you perceive to be harmful,"" the memo states.

""If you’d find it hard to support our content breadth, Netflix may not be the best place for you,"" the memo advises.

Why the change?

According to Variety, the ""artistic expression"" update is related to controversy involving comedian Dave Chappelle.

After Chappelle's newest comedy special ""The Closer"" debuted on Netflix last October, controversy erupted when critics falsely accused Chappelle of being transphobic and homophobic. Netflix employees rebuked their bosses for streaming the comedy special, and they even staged a walkout to demonstrate their anger with the alleged harmful content.

However, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos refused to cave to the angry mob.

In multiple employee memos, Sarandos made it clear that Netflix leadership stood by the diversity of its content, including comedy specials that may include what some people describe as ""harmful.""

""Stand-up comedians often expose issues that are uncomfortable because the art by nature is a highly provocative,"" one of the memos said. ""As a leadership team, we do not believe that The Closer is intended to incite hatred or violence against anyone (per our Sensitive Content guidelines).""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/negron-kidnap-ohio-kids-illinois,2022-05-13
"Netherlands seeks to close 3,000 farms by threatening farmers with 'compulsory' land buyouts if they refuse 'voluntary' offers to comply with EU climate rules","The Dutch government announced plans to buy and close up to 3,000 farms near areas deemed environmentally sensitive to comply with EU climate rules, the Telegraph reported.



The Netherlands stated that it would first offer one-time voluntary deals to large nitrogen-emitting farms in hopes of reducing pollution. However, if not enough farmers accept that initial offer, the Dutch government announced that it would move forward with ""compulsory purchases.""

According to the government plan, which hopes to target 2,000 to 3,000 farms, landowners will first be offered a deal ""well over"" the property's value.

Nitrogen Minister Christianne van der Wal told members of parliament on Friday, ""There is no better offer coming."" She added that if enough farmers do not take the ""voluntary"" offers, then with ""pain in the heart,"" the government will move forward with compulsory purchases.

The Netherlands, the second-largest food exporter in the world, is aggressively pushing forward with the plan to comply with the EU's conservation rules. The agriculture industry is reportedly responsible for nearly half the nitrogen emitted in the country.

Dutch farmers have continued to stand their ground and protest over the extreme restrictions, fearing for their livelihoods and standing staunchly against the compulsory buyouts. Many farmers feel that the agricultural sector is unjustly targeted while other industries, such as aviation, are not.

LTO Nederland, the largest farmers' lobby organization, accused the government of enforcing ""restrictions without perspective."" The group noted that trust in the Dutch government ""has been very low for a long time.""

LTO chairman Sjaak van der Tak stated, ""Of course it is positive that a good voluntary stop scheme is being promised. But the stayers who are central to us will have many additional restrictions imposed.""

Another farmers' group, Agractie, stated that voluntary buyouts are welcomed by farmers but cannot be offered with the threat of compulsory purchases to follow.

According to a ruling by the Dutch Council of State in 2019, every new activity that emits nitrogen requires a permit, including farming. In the future, the government is considering taxing nitrogen emissions to encourage sustainability, the Dutch News reported.

Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers' Research, told the Daily Caller News Foundation, ""The Netherland's war on farmers to pursue their ESG agenda serves as a stark warning. Americans should be vigilant against efforts by both governments and big Wall Street firms like BlackRock pushing these same dangerous 'net zero' carbon emissions targets here in the U.S. It is difficult to overstate the recklessness of undermining farmers during the greatest global food crisis in decades. This will likely exacerbate the food price inflation we are already experiencing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/netflix-memo-offended-employees-harmful-content,2022-11-29
NJ Democratic councilwoman defies dozens of Jersey City constituents demanding she resign after video of alleged hit-and-run goes viral: 'I am not resigning',"A New Jersey Democratic councilwoman disregarded pleas from her constituents for her to resign after reportedly being caught on video plowing into a bicyclist with her car and fleeing the crime scene in her vehicle.

Approximately 100 Jersey City residents spoke at Wednesday night's council meeting. Most of the constituents at the five-hour meeting were there to call for councilwoman Amy DeGise to resign. The residents demanded DeGise's resignation for an alleged hit-and-run incident involving a cyclist.

""Her behavior shows a disregard for human life,"" declared Molly Booth – a longtime Jersey City resident who said she had never spoken at a council meeting before. ""Apparently it needs to be said: Valuing human life is a necessary qualification of public officials.""

Gothamist reported, ""The most emotional moment of the night came when Kenneth Bandes of Families for Safe Streets held up a photo of his daughter, who was run over and killed by a bus at the age of 19.""

""The councilmember’s father seems to think that those who care about traffic safety are radicals,"" Bandes said. ""My only radical agenda tonight is only to protect others from the heartache we experienced. The councilmember should step down and stay off the road.""





Amy's father is Tom DeGise – Hudson County Executive and a self-described ""progressive Democrat."" He called the Jersey Journal a ""rag"" that has become an ""attack dog for the radical left"" for reporting on his daughter.

The Jersey Journal covered Amy DeGise's alleged hit-and-run as well as ""her troubling driving record, dozens of parking tickets, an unpaid veterinarian bill and her residence in an apartment complex meant for low- to moderate-income families even though she earns nearly $200,000 a year,"" NJ.com reported.

Despite dozens of her own constituents demanding that she resign, Amy DeGise defiantly dismissed the wishes of the Jersey City voters.

“I am not resigning,” Amy DeGise proclaimed. “I remain committed to this position on the council.”

""When the legal process in traffic court is finished, I will have more to say and I can address outstanding concerns and questions. And in the meantime, I’m not resigning,"" the Jersey City councilwoman added.

“For those who call for my resignation, you are heard, and I understand that you have concerns and questions that I respect and would enjoy any type of dialogue or discussion with you after I go to court,” DeGise told the overcapacity crowd.

""I do not identify with the perception that you have of me, but adversity does make us work harder,"" DeGise said, according to the New York Post. ""To those of you who believe in me, thank you. And to those of you who don’t, thank you for making me want to be a better leader.""

""This has only made me stronger and I will use that strength to fight for the issues that help every resident,"" she continued.

""I'm a private person, more than you think. I know everyone thinks I enjoy this public eye [but], I’m a very private person,"" DeGise claimed. ""And, I would like to deal with this privately and I would like that respect, but it has gone vulgar.""



""I'm appreciative of everyone who came out and had to stay tonight,"" the Democratic councilwoman said. ""I’m appreciative and so grateful for the people who have reached out to support me or just want to wait until that court process goes on to ask me any further questions [or] to pry anymore. I cannot make it through these days without you.""

“I remain committed to this position on the council, no matter your perception of me,"" she concluded. ""Please know that my commitment is genuine, as is my love for Jersey City, and it is as strong as ever. Thank you.”

Gothamist reported, ""DeGise's case has not yet gone to court. The case has been moved from Hudson County, where she’s so politically connected, to Essex County, another Democratic stronghold.""



On the morning of July 19, DeGise was caught by a traffic surveillance camera driving her black SUV through an intersection in Jersey City and slamming into a bicyclist. DeGise's black Nissan Rogue caused 29-year-old UberEats deliveryman Andrew Black to catapult into the air because of the force of the collision. Black and his bike were tossed several feet into the intersection.

The embattled Jersey City councilwoman didn't stop to check on Black after smashing into him.

Black did run a red light in the accident.

DeGise turned herself in at police headquarters six hours after the crash. She was charged with leaving the scene of an accident.

DeGise has never publicly apologized to Black or her constituents.

New York City teachers fingerprints sent to FBI over vaccine mandate,"New York City teachers who declined to get the COVID-19 vaccine had their personnel files flagged and their fingerprints sent to the FBI and the New York Criminal Justice Services, according to a legal group.

The New York City vaccine mandate required Department of Education employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID by Sept. 5, 2022. As of mid-September 2022, approximately 1,950 NYC Department of Education employees had been fired for declining to get the COVID-19 vaccine.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams ended the vaccine mandate for NYC workers on Feb. 10.

However, Department of Education employees who were not vaccinated against COVID were reportedly penalized by having a ""problem code"" inputted in their personnel file.

An assistant principal in the Bronx was suspended without pay for not getting the COVID vaccine.

An affidavit stated, ""And while she applied to over 60 jobs during that span, she received no offers because, as one interviewer told her, the DOE attached a problem code for her due to alleged 'misconduct.' While she waited for a decision, her home went into foreclosure, her son had to leave college, and she was forced to get vaccinated to feed her family.""

A former therapist at NYC's Early Intervention Program for children with disabilities or developmental issues found out she was labeled with a ""problem code"" by an agency that she was working with, according to the Alliance Defending Freedom.

""I was shocked that I had been flagged as ineligible to work, because such problem codes often indicate poor performance reviews, misconduct, or even criminal activity. None of these apply to me,"" the former employee stated. ""I did not understand how someone from outside the DOE could even possess this incorrect information about me, I was extremely embarrassed by its negative implications, and I was immensely disappointed that I had to inform the families that I had been assigned to that I could not service their children.""

Teachers for Choice – a self-described ""organization comprised of teachers and parents that are 100% against forced medical mandates for any American to keep their job, especially educators – argues that teachers' ""fingerprints are sent with that flag to the FBI and the New York Criminal Justice Services.""

The New York Criminal Justice Services ""maintains criminal history records and fingerprint files and performs background checks for employment and licensure.""

Teachers for Choice claims that after the personnel files are flagged, they are then sent to the national databases at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice.

John Bursch, attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom, defended terminated New York City workers in court on Feb. 8.

Bursch said in court, ""In addition, you've got these problem codes in the personnel files.""

""When the city puts these problem codes on employees who have been terminated because of their unconstitutional policies, not only do they have this flag in their files, but their fingerprints are sent with that flag to the FBI and the New York Criminal Justice Services,"" Bursch said. ""So it impacts their ongoing ability to get employment.""

Bursch told the Daily Caller, ""Even for those who are eligible for reinstatement, when they apply, they've all got so-called 'problem codes' in their personal file because they purportedly failed to fulfill a contractual condition, which was to get vaccinated.""

""The city simply didn't like that some people objected to the vaccine on religious grounds and they punished them for that,"" Bursch said.

New York Democrats push for transsexuals with intact male genitalia to be jailed with real women,"New York Democrats reintroduced legislation Wednesday that would permit male felons to be jailed with women in the event that they identify accordingly.

Assembly Bill A709 is an updated version of the ""Gender Identity Respect Dignity and Safety Act"" sponsored by assemblywoman Nily Rozic last session, which appears to have fizzled out in committee. There was a corresponding bill in the state Senate.

The act, co-sponsored by assembly members Emily Gallagher, Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, Charles Lavine, and Jo Anne Simon, requires that criminals imprisoned in state and local correctional facilities who claim to ""have a gender identity different from their assigned sex at birth be addressed and have access to commissary items, clothing and other materials that are consistent with the person's gender identity.""

For instance, a biological male with his male genitals intact must be provided with a tampon in the event that he has requested one and has also stated he identifies as a woman.

Should the bill pass, correctional officers would be required to address transsexual, ""gender nonconforming, nonbinary, or intersex"" convicts ""in a manner that most closely aligns with such person's gender identity, including the name and pronouns specified by that person.""

The preferred name in question need not correspond with the name on the convict's government-issued identification.

If a male convict identifies as a woman, he would also have ""the right"" to be searched by a female correctional officer or staff member.

Prisoners are to be given so-called ""affirming medical care"" to maintain their ""sex characteristics,"" including, but not limited to, hormone treatments and post-op drugs, if so desired.

Perhaps most controversially, the bill states that criminals must be ""placed in a correctional facility with persons of the gender that most closely aligns with such person's self-attested gender identity unless the person opts out of such placement.""

To evidence their mental severance of biological sex from gender, a convict need only say so, although a diagnosis of gender dysphoria or a ""variation in their sex characteristics"" are also valid.

Complaints by other prisoners who do not wish to be housed with a member of the opposite sex (e.g., real women) will be ignored. However, the commissioner could overcome the placement if ""there is clear and convincing evidence that such person presents a current danger of committing gender-based violence against others.""

The feminist activist group Keep Prisons Single Sex USA noted on Twitter that this exception to the proposed rule sets a high provability standard for the likelihood of re-offense and that the phrasing of ""current danger"" as opposed to historical danger would ensure that a man who previously abused women could still be jailed with female prisoners.

Keep Prisons Single Sex USA added that ""if a male inmate does not present a 'current danger of committing gender-based violence,' but engages in misconduct towards female inmates, like sexual harassment,"" he would not be returned to a men's prison.

A coalition of transsexual activist and leftist groups penned a letter to members of the state House and Senate in May 2022, suggesting that New York ""has not done enough for our community members experiencing incarceration.""

This coalition of social constructivists suggested that a ""person's genital status"" should not be factored into decisions over what type of facility a convict should be assigned to.

The letter suggested that transsexual convicts ""are subjected to daily misgendering, abuse, and other inhumane treatment.""

According to the LGBT activist organization Equality New York, this bill would be a check against a purported trend in the New York State criminal justice system of transsexual criminals being refused basic rights.



The ACLU of New York claimed that this bill would keep transsexuals safe.

Not all are optimistic about the prospect of women's prisons being flooded with men.

Amanda Stulman of Keep Prisons Single Sex USA wrote to the bill's sponsors on Thursday, noting, ""This Bill provides that, unless they opt out, fully genitally-intact, sexually-functioning incarcerated males are presume eligible to be housed in women's prison if they assert – at any time – a gender identity other than 'male.'""

Extra to noting that the bill is opaque about what it means by ""gender,"" as in its reference to ""gender-based violence,"" Stulman argued the legislation would incentivize men to request cross-sex housing.

Under the law, if a transsexual's request for transfer is denied, he can initiate proceedings for ""injunctive relief and damages, including reasonable attorney fees.""

Stulman suggested, ""These terms invite declarations of 'gender identity' differing from one's sex with the prospect of (a) being awarded placement in a women's incarceration facility; (b) a monetary reward; (c) attorney fees paid by the state.""

The law, according to Stulman, may also run afoul of women's rights, particularly those with deeply-held, Constitutionally-protected religious beliefs requiring that they not be around naked men.

Group of New York sheriffs say they will not aggressively enforce new gun control law that 'unfairly targets law-abiding citizens',"As the state of New York appeals a court decision blocking its sweeping new gun control law, a group of sheriffs say the law unfairly targets law-abiding citizens and that they won't aggressively enforce it.

The controversial Concealed Carry Improvement Act restricts licensed gun owners from carrying concealed weapons in so-called ""sensitive locations,"" including public parks, houses of worship, government buildings, and private property except where the owners have posted signage permitting firearms on the premises. U.S. District Judge Glenn Suddaby temporarily blocked the law from taking effect on Oct. 6, ruling that these restrictions and other licensing requirements established by the state legislature were unconstitutional.



A half-dozen sheriffs agree and say they will exercise their discretion in enforcing the law, including Fulton County Sheriff Richard Giardino, who spoke to ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning.

Giardino said his office will focus on criminals possessing weapons instead of pursuing complaints against otherwise law-abiding gun owners carrying concealed in public.

""We’re going to use our discretion to not go on complaints that say, ‘Oh, my neighbor has a bulge on his side, we think he's got a gun, he’s in a store,’"" he said.

""We have limited resources. We have limited money and we're going to use that in the best capacity,"" the sheriff explained. ""So it's not refusing to enforce it, it's using our discretion.""

He added, ""It unfairly targets law-abiding citizens who previously could carry concealed and could go into a store or a restaurant. And then on September 1, all of a sudden, they could be charged with a felony.""

Watch:







Several parts of the Concealed Carry Improvement Act were declared unconstitutional after gun rights advocates brought a case against New York State earlier this year. Judge Suddaby found that the state's definition of ""sensitive locations"" where concealed-carry permit holders cannot take their weapons was too broad.

Additionally, requirements that permit applicants demonstrate ""good moral character"" and turn over their social media history to the state licensing agency were found to be unlawful.

New York Attorney General Letitia James filed an appeal on Monday asking the state's highest court to issue a stay against Suddaby's injunction, which would go into effect on Wednesday.



“Today my office filed a motion to keep the entire Concealed Carry Improvement Act in effect and continue to protect communities as the appeals process moves forward. This common-sense gun control legislation is critical in our state’s effort to reduce gun violence,” James said in a statement.

The filing claimed public safety would be at risk if the law is not permitted to go into effect.

The gun rights group representing the plaintiffs blasted the state's appeal.

“Not surprisingly, the anti-gunners in New York appear hellbent on wasting taxpayer dollars to continue defending their patently unconstitutional gun control law. We will continue to fight back, until those in Albany recognize that their citizens’ rights shall not be infringed,” said Erich Pratt, senior vice president of Gun Owners of America.

"New Zealand elites claim that Jacinda Ardern, who embraced a 'two-tier society,' was chased out by 'excessive polarisation'","New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, 42, announced her resignation on Thursday, noting that after over five years in office, she could no longer hack it.

While Ardern, former participant in the World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders program, was clear about her reasons for quitting, a number of Kiwi politicians and activists have jumped to another conclusion: that the prime minister was forced out by ""excessive polarisation"" and ""vilification,"" in part by those critical of her excessive polarization of New Zealand during the pandemic and her government's vilification of those wary about receiving COVID-19 vaccinations.

The resignation

""I am human. Politicians are human. We give all we can for as long as we can, and then it's time. And for me, it's time,"" Ardern said tearfully on Thursday.

Ardern took power on Oct. 26, 2017, at the age of 37. Her resignation takes effect Feb. 7.

""I believe that leading a country is the most privileged job anyone could ever have, but also one of the more challenging,"" she said. ""You cannot and should not do it unless you have a full tank plus a bit in reserve for those unexpected challenges.""

The prime minister stressed that her party's underperformance in the polls ahead of the upcoming election was not the reason for her calling it quits and clarified that ""the adversity you face in politics ... was not the basis of my decision.""

The actual reason, according to the prime minister, was simple: ""I know that I no longer have enough in the tank to do [this job] justice.""

Ardern underscored: ""I am not leaving because it was hard. Had that been the case, I probably would have departed two months into the job.""

Perceived victimization

The Guardian reported that speculation is mounting that ""abuse and threats"" drove Ardern to throw in the towel, even though she made clear that was not the case.

""It is a sad day for politics where an outstanding leader has been driven from office for constant personalisation and vilification,"" said Māori party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer. ""Her [family] have withstood the ugliest attacks over the last two years with what we believe to be the most demeaning form of politics we have ever seen.""

New Zealand's first elected woman prime minister, Helen Clark, said, ""The pressures on prime ministers are always great, but in this era of social media, clickbait, and 24/7 media cycles, Jacinda has faced a level of hatred and vitriol which in my experience is unprecedented in our country.""

""Our society could now usefully reflect on whether it wants to continue to tolerate the excessive polarisation which is making politics an increasingly unattractive calling,"" Clark added.

Kate Hannah, director of the so-called Disinformation Project, told the Guardian, ""The scope of what we’ve observed over the last three years is such that there’s no way it could not have been a contributing factor – for any person,"" adding, ""What we see now is absolutely normative, extremely vulgar and violent slurs … incredibly violent use of imagery around death threats.""

Richard Shaw, a politics professor at Massey University in New Zealand, told the New York Times that Ardern ""became the personification of a particular response to the pandemic, which people in the far-flung margins of the internet and the not-so-far-flung margins used against her.""

Ardern's two-tier society

The suggestions that Ardern was subjected to unprecedented abuse, polarization, and vulgarity appear to be provided in a vacuum of context.

TheBlaze previously reported that in 2021, a reporter said to Ardern, ""You've basically said, and you probably don't see it like this, but two different classes of people if you're vaccinated or unvaccinated. If you're vaccinated you have all these rights.""

Ardern replied gleefully, ""That is what is, yep, yep,"" thereby confirming, to borrow a turn of phrase from Clark, that the state intentionally mandated ""excessive polarisation.""

Accordingly, citizens of the purportedly free nation were not allowed to exercise their mobility rights until 90% of the country was fully vaccinated.

Ardern's government implemented a ""traffic-light"" pandemic regime whereby those who were vaccinated were allowed to travel around and use services freely, whereas those who refused the mRNA vaccines had their freedoms of assembly and mobility all but eliminated.

The unvaccinated were not permitted to eat in restaurants, work out in gyms, or drink in bars.

The prime minister, whom Ngarewa-Packer suggested was forced out by ""the most demeaning form of politics,"" told citizens, ""If you are still unvaccinated, not only will you be more at risk of catching Covid-19, but many of the freedoms others enjoy will be out of reach.""

Ardern went on to erroneously suggest that the virus was majoritively spread by and between unvaccinated persons.

In August 2021, Ardern forced her entire country into lockdown after a 58-year-old man tested positive for COVID-19. Schools were closed. All gatherings were canceled. Citizens were confined to quarters. Residents were allegedly prohibited from removing their face masks to drink outdoors.

In February 2022, Ardern said that anti-mandate protests in Wellington, which she characterized as intimidating, ""cannot be tolerated,"" reported the Associated Press

Extra to vilifying protesters and citizens struggling to exercise their bodily autonomy, Ardern compared free speech online with ""weapons of war"" during a September speech at the United Nations.

The New York Post reported that Ardern said that ""mis- and disinformation online"" constitute challenges ""that we must as leaders address,"" adding, ""We have the means; we just need the collective will.""

Ardern adopted militant language, intimating that dissenting views on climate change and ""dangerous rhetoric"" should be crushed.

Independent journalist Glenn Greenwald was taken aback by Ardern's comments, writing, ""This is the face of authoritarianism – even though it looks different than you were taught to expect. And it’s the mindset of tyrants everywhere.""

""This is someone so inebriated by her sense of righteousness and superiority that she views dissent as an evil too dangerous to allow,"" said Greenwald.

During the pandemic, Ardern intimated that government disseminated information was the only true information, saying, ""You can trust us as the source of that information. You can also trust the director general of health and the Ministry of Health. For that information, do feel free to visit at any time to clarify any rumor you may hear: covid19.govt.nz. Otherwise, dismiss anything else. We will continue to be your single source of truth.""

Ardern's curbs on Kiwis' freedoms were not all speech- or pandemic-related, however. In 2021, she announced a plan to ban smoking and put nearly all of the country's tobacconists out of business. A year later, the country implemented the world's first annually rising legal smoking age, with the intent of coercively phasing out the addictive pastime.

As she moves on from helming New Zealand's apparent ""single source of truth,"" Jacinda said she wants to be remembered ""as someone who always tried to be kind.""

Ardern raised some eyebrows in December after calling the opposition leader David Seymour an ""arrogant p****"" in Parliament.

Editor's note: This article has been updated to note that Helen Clark was the first elected female prime minister of New Zealand. The first woman prime minister was Jenny Shipley.

"NHL player, citing his faith, doesn't warm up with team wearing LGBTQ colors before 'Pride Night' game. ESPN writer who covered controversy bashes player on Twitter.","Philadelphia Flyers player Ivan Provorov, citing his religious beliefs, refused to skate before Tuesday's ""Pride Night"" game since his teammates were wearing LBGTQ colors for their warm-up, ESPN reported.

The 26-year-old defenseman told reporters after the Flyers' 5-2 home win over the Anaheim Ducks that he intended ""to stay true to myself and my religion,"" the sports network said.

Provorov said he is Russian Orthodox.

""I respect everyone,"" he added to reporters. ""I respect everybody's choices.""

The Flyers wore rainbow colors on their warm-up jerseys and used sticks with rainbow tape, which ESPN said are being auctioned by Flyers Charities with proceeds going toward the team's ""efforts to grow the game in diverse communities.""

Provorov was the only Flyers player who didn't have a jersey or a stick up for auction after the game, the sports network added.

Flyers coach John Tortorella said he didn't consider benching Provorov for not taking part in the warm-up, ESPN reported: ""With Provy, he's being true to himself and to his religion. This has to do with his belief and his religion. It's one thing I respect about Provy: He's always true to himself. And so that's where we're at with that.""

ESPN writer who penned story bashes Provorov on Twitter

The author of the ESPN story cited above — Greg Wyshynski, senior NHL writer for the sports network — exercised a fairly even hand in his article, but he blasted Provorov on Twitter:

""Ivan Provorov is the only @NHLFlyers player not to have a Pride jersey up for postgame auction,"" Wyshynski tweeted. ""The sale of pregame jerseys and rainbow sticks benefit Flyers Charities and efforts to grow the game in diverse communities. Provorov owes them a donation.""

Responding to a Twitter user who declared Provorov doesn't owe ""s**t"" to Flyers Charities for holding to ""his belief,"" Wyshynski shot back: ""He literally refused to participate in a charity fundraising event for his team. This isn't skipping Pride because he refused to wave from a float. He does, in fact, owe them s**t.""

Wyshynski wasn't done:

Wyshynski also issued a message to ""all the homophobes"" taking shots at him on Twitter:

Wyshynski wasn't alone

As you might guess, Wyshynski wasn't the only sports media figure to get personal undergarments in a wad over the situation:

Anything else?

The Flyers, like many professional sports franchises, are heavy supporters of the LGBTQ community and events like ""Pride Night.""

They're woke in other ways, too.

Readers of TheBlaze may recall that the Flyers in 2019 removed their Kate Smith statue outside the Wells Fargo Center over reports the late vocalist sang racially insensitive songs in the early 1930s.

Smith had been a Flyers legend for singing ""God Bless America"" before playoff games in the early 1970s when the team won its only Stanley Cup trophies — but in addition to removing her statue, the Flyers also said Smith's ""God Bless America"" no longer would be played at games and was erased from its library.

Members of Smith's family were outraged at the Flyers for the move and said Smith was not a racist. In fact, Smith told millions back in the day that ""race hatreds"" must be ""exterminated,"" and she also pioneered racial integration on television.

NHL team skips 'Pride Night' warmup jerseys: 'We support everyone's individual right to respectfully express their beliefs',"The New York Rangers hockey team took the ice for warmups before their game on Friday night without the promised rainbow-colored jerseys and stick tape meant to show deference to the so-called ""LGBTQ+"" community, causing outrage among left-leaning media outlets and activists.

For the past six seasons, the Rangers have hosted ""Pride Night Friday"" at Madison Square Garden, and that tradition continued this year. On January 27, Michael James Scott, a Broadway star who identifies as gay, performed the national anthem. Andre Thomas, the co-chair of NYC Pride and Heritage of Pride, participated in the ceremonial, pre-game puck drop. The arena, especially the jumbotron, was emblazoned in ""rainbow colors,"" and members of the Rangers Blue Crew, the people responsible for inciting fan engagement, still carried rainbow-colored flags.

But the players themselves did not don any gear making reference, either by word or by symbol, to sexual relationships of any kind. Instead, they wore Reverse Retro jerseys, which depict the face of the Statue of Liberty.

Writers at many news outlets and activists have heavily criticized the Rangers organization as a result. ""New York Rangers ... FAIL to explain why they backtrack on promise,"" a Daily Mail headline howled. Mollie Walker, the New York Post beat writer for the Rangers, complained that the team took an ""otherwise a beautiful celebration of inclusivity"" and turned it into a ""slight"" against ""members of the LGBTQ+ community.""



David Kilmnick, the president of the LGBT Network in Queens, called the decision ""a slap in the face.""

""If the Rangers are saying they’re going to be celebrating Pride Night, everybody needs to, for lack of a better term, 'come out' and celebrate,"" Kilmnick insisted. ""To give the OK to these hockey players to be homophobic is not celebrating pride. It’s the opposite of it.""

Promotions for the seventh-annual ""Pride Night"" at MSG did promise that ""the Rangers will be showing their support by donning pride-themed warm-up jerseys and tape in solidarity with those who continue to advocate for inclusivity.""

The organization has not explained its seemingly last-minute costume change, though it has issued a statement:

""Our organization respects the LGBTQ+ community and we are proud to bring attention to important local community organizations as part of another great Pride Night,"" the statement reaffirmed.

""In keeping with our organization’s core values, we support everyone’s individual right to respectfully express their beliefs,"" it concluded.

Some have interpreted the second half of the statement to mean that at least one member of the Rangers organization was planning not to participate. Another NHL team, the Philadelphia Flyers, has had to manage a lot of unwanted attention for nearly two weeks after one team member, defenseman Ivan Provorov, publicly stated that, in keeping with the tenets of his Russian Orthodox religion, he would not wear a ""pride"" jersey.

""I respect everybody's choices,"" Provorov told reporters after the Flyers' win over the Ducks on January 17. ""My choice is to stay true to myself and my religion. That's all I'm going to say.""

No Rangers player has stated publicly that he would have refused to participate in the annual ""Pride"" celebration, but the entire team walked — or perhaps skated — away winners that night. The Rangers trounced the visiting Vegas Golden Knights 4-1 and are now 27-14-8 on the season, good for third place in the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference.

Niece of big-name establishment Republican arrested following meltdown on Spirit plane: Report,"The niece of former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (R) was arrested recently after officials say she became unruly on a Spirit Airlines plane before it even had a chance to take off.

Just before 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day, Shannon Epstein, 25, climbed aboard a Spirit Airlines flight headed from New Orleans to New Jersey. However, after the plane left the gate but before it could take off, Epstein allegedly began causing a scene, accusing a Latina family seated near her of ""smuggling cocaine.""

Because of the wild accusation, airport officials decided to redirect the plane back to the gate so that Epstein could be removed. However, she refused to cooperate, reports say. When deputies tried to force her to deplane, she became ""extremely combative,"" said Capt. Jason Rivarde of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office.

During a scuffle with six deputies at Louis Armstrong International Airport, Epstein supposedly caused several injuries. She has been accused of biting one officer in the arm to such an extent that she broke the skin. She has also been accused of kicking another officer in the groin. Both were treated by paramedics.

There are allegations that she spat at officers as well. Officers ultimately restrained her by handcuffing her to a wheelchair, even as she reportedly continued to attempt to bite and to hurl obscenities at them.

Witnesses also claimed that during the incident, Epstein threatened that the officers involved would soon lose their jobs or go to jail themselves because of her powerful connections. She reportedly bragged that she was related to a friend of former President Donald Trump.

Epstein was booked in the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center on six counts of battery on a police officer, three of disturbing the peace, one of resisting arrest by force, and one of remaining after forbidden. She was released from custody that same day after she paid the $10,750 bail.

She is scheduled to appear in a Jefferson Parish court in late January, though most cases related to an airplane or airport incident are transferred to federal court, Rivarde stated.

Christie did not respond to requests for comment from the New York Post or NOLA.com.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nhl-team-skips-pride-night-warmup-jerseys-we-support-everyone-s-individual-right-to-respectfully-express-their-beliefs,2022-12-04
"Failed progressive candidate tries to poll her followers on college loan forgiveness, and the results are embarrassing","Nina Turner, the failed, far-left progressive congressional candidate, was embarrassed by her own poll which tried to push support for college loan forgiveness.

Turner posted a Twitter poll on Saturday in an attempt to demonstrate the support for the federal government forgiving the massive debt from student loans.

Opponents of the debt forgiveness policy hijacked the poll, resulting in the response ""No, people should suffer"" winning with 68.6% of the nearly 40,000 votes.

Turner's preferred response, ""CANCEL ALL OF IT!"" received support from only 24.9% of the respondents.

Many on social media took the opportunity to ridicule Turner and her support for student debt forgiveness at the expense of the taxpayer.

""Yes, you should suffer if you purchased a worthless degree. The only other option is that someone else suffers on your behalf. Of those two choices, it should be you. 100 percent. Stop being a selfish coward,"" replied commentator Matt Walsh.

""If your degree doesn’t have enough value for you to pay it off, it definitely doesn’t have enough value to make me pay it off,"" read another popular response.

""You took a loan knowing you would owe the money when you graduated. Be an adult like all of us have been and pay back your own damn loan. You do not deserve a free ride just because you feel entitled. I paid my loan, my kids loan and I am not paying yours. Grow the f up,"" responded another detractor.

Turner ran for the U.S. House seat in Ohio's 11th Congressional District, but lost the primary despite having raised more money than her more centrist opponent. She gained national prominence when she co-chaired the 2016 presidential campaign for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

""We didn't lose this race — evil money manipulated and maligned this election!"" she said at the time.

""They took evil money to come in here and do this!"" she added.

President Joe Biden made student loan forgiveness part of his presidential campaign, but he has since avoided backing full loan forgiveness and has asked Congress to pass legislation with lower limits on debt forgiveness. Some on the left called him racist and classist for refusing to excuse $50k of debt for every student debtor.

NJ councilwoman hit-and-run of bicyclist in Jersey City,"There are calls for a New Jersey councilwoman to resign after shocking video was released of her plowing into a bicyclist with her vehicle and fleeing the crime scene.

Traffic cameras caught the moment that Democratic Jersey City Councilwoman Amy DeGise was involved in a disturbing hit-and-run that catapulted a delivery person into the air.

Around 8 a.m. on July 19, DeGise sped through an intersection in Jersey City. DeGise's black Nissan Rogue slammed into 29-year-old UberEats deliveryman Andrew Black. The impact of the crash flipped Black airborne until he slammed violently onto the pavement. The severity of the crash caused Black's shoes to fall off. Black and his wrecked bicycle were flung feet from the crash.

DeGise did not slow down whatsoever as she sideswiped the cyclist, and she sped away from the hit-and-run.

A dazed Black walks to the sidewalk. Black needs to brace himself on a street pole in order to examine his wounds.

A woman brings the man his lost flip-flop that was in the middle of the street. Another bystander provides a cooler for Black to sit on while he attempts to recover from the crash.

Black spoke to HudPost about the incident.

“I come up to a light, and I have the right-of-way, and right before I get hit, I look left, suddenly I just hear ‘Ba!’ And then I just get hit, and then I hit the hood, and I roll over, and I’m in such pain,” Black told the local media outlet.



""Black was grateful that, despite dealing with deep bruising, he didn’t suffer major physical injuries; however, he suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and says the incident has already caused increased anxiety,"" HudPost reported.

NJ.com noted that city officials released the traffic camera footage of the hit-and-run ""hours after a local news website, HudPost.com, aired a short interview with the victim.""

Despite Black's assertion, it appears that DeGise had the right of way and the biker crossed a red light. She was reportedly presented with a summons for leaving the scene of an accident and failing to report it.



DeGise is a Jersey City Councilwoman-at-Large, former chair of the Hudson County Democrats, and the daughter of current county executive Tom DeGise.

There are calls for DeGise to resign following the hit-and-run.

“Past being elected, it’s a living human being – it was really hard for me to witness that,” Councilman Frank Gilmore told WNBC. “It’s a matter of public trust, it’s a matter of respect, it’s a matter of human decency.”



Jersey City councilmember James Solomon said, ""The word I use is horrified, that’s how I felt watching the video. She’s an elected official and we have to hold ourselves to a higher standard and that’s why I think she should resign.""

Former Councilman Chris Gadsden wrote on Twitter, ""I respect Councilwoman Amy DeGise, but I think after everyone sees the video, we have no other choice but to ask her to step down.""

Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop said, “She shouldn’t have left the scene. That was a tremendous mistake. I’m happy that she took some responsibility by going to the police proactively afterwards. That was the correct move under those circumstances after leaving.""

In November, DeGise parked illegally and had been driving with an expired registration since 2019. The councilwoman's car was blocking the path of turning trucks, and her car was hit because of its illegal location in the street.

Police body cam video shows DeGise seemingly attempt to get out of her vehicle being impounded by telling the cop that she has a relative who was “an officer.""

""I have a card on me,"" DeGise tells the officer. ""If there's any way I can have a ticket instead. Please.""

""I was endorsed by the police in Jersey City – I'm a councilwoman,"" she informs the cop.

DeGise then tells the officer that she talked to someone in the mayor's office in Jersey City.

New Jersey man admits to paying $20k in cryptocurrency to murder 14-year-old in order to prevent her testimony in child porn case,"A New Jersey man admitted to paying $20,000 in cryptocurrency to have a 14-year-old girl murdered in order to prevent her testimony in a criminal case involving child pornography.

U.S. attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced the guilty plea made by John Michael Musbach in a press release Friday.

Musbach was first arrested in March 2016 for child pornography over sexually explicit photographs and videos he exchanged with a 13-year-old teenager living in New York. The teen's parents discovered the inappropriate interactions on the girl's phone and contacted police.

He was arrested and charged with endangering the welfare of a child (the victim) by sexual contact.

In messages sent between May 7, 2016, and May 20, 2016, Musbach tried to hire a hitman on a murder-for-hire website on the dark web. He paid approximately $20,000 worth of cryptocurrency after confirming that a 14-year-old was not too young to be a target.

After asking when the murder would be committed, Musbach was told that he needed to pay another $5,000 in cryptocurrency. He refused and demanded a refund, after which the administrator of the website admitted that the murder-for-hire website was a scam. The scammer then threatened to contact law enforcement and turn in Musbach.

Officials were able to link Musbach's bank account to the funds used to secure the cryptocurrency that was sent to the murder-for-hire scam artist.

Musbach pled guilty to one count of knowingly and intentionally using and causing another to use a facility of interstate and foreign commerce with the intent that a murder be committed. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.

He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 13.

Here's more about the case against Musbach:

NJ superintendent resigns after comments about 14-year-old girl who committed suicide,"The superintendent of the New Jersey school district resigned after making shocking allegations against a 14-year-old girl who committed suicide and her father.

Adriana Kuch was found dead on Feb. 3 at her home in Bayville, New Jersey. The 14-year-old girl committed suicide two days after she was assaulted at her school.

Adriana's father, Michael Kuch, believes that his daughter committed suicide because she was violently attacked by bullies at her high school. Video of the brutal beatdown that took place at Central Regional High School in Berkeley Township was uploaded online.

The distraught father was furious that school officials didn't contact the police to press charges against the four students who allegedly attacked his daughter.

Four girls were suspended indefinitely for their alleged involvement in the attack.

Superintendent Triantafillos Parlapanides claimed, ""I don't believe a police report was done. We normally just suspend. If a parent wants to press charges, they can with the police. We're not going to double-whammy a kid where they are suspended and then police charges as well.""

Michael Kuch demanded justice for how the high school attack was handled.

Parlapanides – who reportedly makes $190,000 a year – attempted to defend his position by making eye-opening remarks about the deceased teen girl and her father.

Parlapanides told the Daily Mail, ""After [Adriana's] mother's suicide since her father was having an affiar [sic] at the end of her 6th grade. Her father married the woman he had an affair with and moved her into the house.""

""Her grades and choices declined in 7th and 8th grade,"" the superintendent said. ""We offered her drug rehab and mental services on five occasions but father refused every time.""

Parlapanides alleged, ""We tried helping her several times but mother's suicide was a major reason she started making poor choices.""



Kuch responded to the superintendent's claims, ""I don't know how to respond to this insane deflection. This guy is a piece of s**t.""

Kuch explained to the Daily Mail that Adriana's mother battled addiction and died in 2015, when Adriana was only 7 years old.

He denied the claims that Adriana was offered drug counseling. Kuch admitted that he was trying to get help for his daughter, who had been smoking marijuana with a vape pen.

Parlapanides resigned on Sunday – the same day as Adriana Kuch's funeral.

The Central Regional School District issued a statement on Saturday:

The Central Regional School District Board of Education has accepted the resignation of Dr. Triantafillos Parlapanides. The Central Regional family continues to mourn the loss of one of our children. We are all praying for the family and loved ones and our entire community. The Central Regional School District is evaluating all current and past allegations of bullying. The District has contacted the Department of Education and will undergo an independent assessment of the District's anti-bullying policies and ensure every necessary safeguard is in place to protect our students and staff. Dr. Douglas Corbett is acting Superintendent effective immediately.

Three students who were suspects in the Feb.1 incident were originally charged with third-degree felony assault, and a fourth student was hit with a disorderly conduct charge. However, Ocean County prosecutors upgraded the charges.

'Nothing short of a humanitarian catastrophe': Portland mayor proposes controversial ban on unsanctioned encampments,"On Friday, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler announced a five-point plan to address the city's homelessness crisis, including a citywide ban on unsanctioned encampments.



""The magnitude and the depth of the homeless crisis in our city is nothing short of a humanitarian catastrophe,"" Wheeler stated during a Friday press conference. ""We need to move our scattered, vulnerable homeless population closer to the services that they need.""

The plan includes: creating 20,000 units of affordable housing by 2033, increasing access to paid non-standard work, banning unsanctioned camping, creating a diversion program to encourage treatment for drug abuse and mental health, and setting a city budget.

Wheeler said that he hopes to create three designated sites to house up to 125 campers each before the start of winter. However, funding has yet to be locked down, and the camping sites would take 18 months to open. The mayor did not specify how much the project would cost.

""We do have locations in mind. We're currently in discussions with those who control those sites and will be ready to discuss them as soon as we have agreements in place,"" said Wheeler.

According to WFIN, more than 3,000 people in Portland are homeless, a 50% increase from 2019. The outlet reported that the city contains 700 encampments within 146 square miles. A recent survey found that the top concern for Oregonians is homelessness, KATU reported.

Wheeler explained that arrests and fines are an option for individuals who refuse to move, but not a first resort.

""If somebody just absolutely just digs in and says, 'I won't go,' then we'll have to talk about criminal sanctions. But I also want to stress, the fourth resolution that we put into place, our goal here isn't to write a bunch of citations,"" said Wheeler.

The mayor noted that the city would waive the sanctions and low-level offenses in exchange for volunteering to participate in treatment for substance abuse and mental health. Wheeler stated that the ultimate goal of the proposed program is to ensure that people who need treatment receive it.

Homeless advocates expressed concern about the ban on unsanctioned encampments and the timeline for creating additional housing.

Scott Kerman, executive director of Blanchet House, a Portland non-profit offering services to the homeless, told KATU that his main apprehension about the program is the ban.

""I certainly have a lot of questions about the enforcement mechanism of this ban,"" said Kerman. ""And I think Mayor Wheeler acknowledged that those individuals that are not incentivized to select services and shelter options will be arrested.""

Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty also expressed deep concern over the mayor's proposal.

""No city plan for shelter expansion should involve sending people to jail because they live in extreme poverty, or may be suffering from a mental or behavioral health issue,"" Hardesty stated.

The mayor's proposed plan will be introduced to the City Council on Wednesday. In 2015, the council declared a state of emergency on homelessness that it has extended five times since then.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nj-teen-suicide-superintendent-resigns,2022-10-24
Twitter reactions to NPR claiming 'Don't Tread on Me' Gadsden flag license plate promotes dangerous far-right extremist ideology,"A ""Don't Tread on Me"" license plate was introduced late last month. The new license plate features the Gadsden flag – a popular resistance symbol that Americans flew during the Revolutionary War. However, NPR warns that the Revolutionary-era flag symbolizes a ""dangerous far-right extremist ideology."" The notion that a license plate with a Revolutionary War-era symbol of Americans was quickly lampooned on Twitter.

On July 30, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis unveiled the Gadsden flag license plate featuring a black coiled rattlesnake over a yellow background and the words: ""Don't Tread on Me.""

""The free state of Florida has a new license plate for pre-order that benefits the Florida Veterans Foundation and sends a clear message to out-of-state cars, 'Don’t Tread on Me' or Florida,"" DeSantis wrote on Twitter.

Florida offers 149 specialty license plates, plus 31 potential license plate ideas that require 3,000 vehicle tags to be pre-ordered for them to be approved for production. In less than two weeks, the Gadsden flag license plate has reached more than half the total needed for it to be produced.

For every Gadsden flag license plate sold, $25 will reportedly go to the Florida Veterans Foundation – an organization for ""Florida veterans and their families by providing direct services and partnering with state and local governments, veteran service organizations, and educational institutions to improve their physical, financial, mental, emotional, and social well-being.""

The choice of the Gadsden flag for the fundraising license plate was made in 2019.

Last week, Newsweek claimed, ""Much like the Confederate flag, the Gadsden flag is accused of harboring racial connotations, seeing as its designer owned and traded black slaves.""

A spokesperson for DeSantis told Newsweek, ""From a historical perspective, the Gadsden flag was used during the American Revolution by colonists fighting for freedom from the oppressive big government of the English king. That spirit has guided America to this day, and Governor DeSantis likewise believes that freedom is a worthy pursuit and viable alternative to heavy-handed government.""

The statement added, ""Many Floridians celebrate Florida as the vanguard of freedom, and countless others have moved here from across the country to live under a state government that enshrines freedom in its decision making.""

NPR dedicated an entire article to the specialty license plate – which it characterized as a ""far-right"" symbol.

The NPR author did concede that other states such as Kansas, Missouri, and Virginia have ""similar plates"" available.



The article also noted that the flag was an anti-British and anti-colonial symbol created by South Carolina political Christopher Gadsden during the Revolutionary War.

However, the article stated, ""The imagery of the Revolutionary War-era Gadsden flag dates to Benjamin Franklin but has, for many, come to symbolize a far-right extremist ideology and the 'Stop the Steal' movement that sought to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.""

NPR cited a member of the left-leaning Southern Poverty Law Center – who claimed that the Gadsden flag has been used for some ""really awful"" causes, including the Jan. 6 riot.

The official NPR Twitter account posted the article with the description: ""Gov. Ron DeSantis said a new Florida license plate featuring the Revolutionary War-era Gadsden flag sends a 'clear message to out-of-state cars.' Critics say it symbolizes a dangerous far-right extremist ideology.""

Twitter reactions to the NPR article widely mocked the idea that a Revolutionary War-era symbol was ""dangerous.""

BlazeTV contributor Jill Savage: ""Imagine being such a snowflake that a license plate scares you.""

Hudson Institute senior fellow Rebeccah Heinrichs: ""Freedom is 'far right' now. Wild stuff.""

YouTube personality Tim Pool: ""They refer to our history as dangerous far right extremism. A brain slug is taking over our country.""

Defense of Freedom Institute spokesperson Angela Morabito: ""I am begging you to read a history book.""

Journalist Jim Treacher: ""The American Revolution is dangerous.""

Claremont Institute fellow Jarrett Stepman: ""The message of the Gadsden flag is dangerous if you're in league with tyrants looking to do some treading. I guess NPR is covering news it thinks is the most relevant to its audience.""

U.S. Air Force combat veteran Col. Rob Maness: ""Shut up you un-American communists – I have it on my truck twice.""

Heritage Foundation communications director John Cooper: ""I don't use the term 'snowflake' too often, but, if you're triggered by the Gadsden flag...""

Media critic Stephen L. Miller: ""NPR refused to cover the Hunter Biden story because it said it wasn't newsworthy. Here they are up in arms over a license plate.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nothing-short-of-a-humanitarian-catastrophe-portland-mayor-proposes-controversial-ban-on-unsanctioned-encampments,2022-08-11
Nurse charged with murder after she injected 97-year-old man with 'something special' when he became agitated: Report,"A nurse working in Lexington, Kentucky, has been formally charged with murder after reports state that she committed ""intentional medical maltreatment"" against an elderly patient who had become agitated.

James Morris, a 97-year-old WWII and Korean veteran, had been admitted to Baptist Health Hospital earlier this year after ""a slip and fall injury,"" says a report from the state Board of Nursing. At some point during his stay, he had become agitated, and nurse Eyvette Hunter, 52, reportedly requested that he be given medication to calm him down. Her request was denied by both a doctor and a nurse practitioner, according to WKYT-TV.

Despite the refusals, Hunter was later allegedly spotted on April 30 injecting contents from a syringe either directly into Morris or into Morris's IV. When asked twice what she had administered to Morris, Hunter allegedly replied that it was ""something special.""

Reports claim that she gave him a dose of lorazepam, an anti-anxiety medication, which may have been intended for another patient. Lorazepam works by slowing brain activity.

Within a half-hour after the injection, Morris became sedated and began having difficulty breathing. When other medical care professionals attempted to assist him, they discovered that his oxygen saturation equipment had been turned off, presumably to silence its alarm.

The medical team managed to improve Morris's oxygen levels, but he had developed pneumonia from either some food or medicine he'd ingested. He then entered hospice, where he died two days later on May 5.

The report from the Board of Nursing claims that Hunter admitted to administering lorazepam to Morris without permission and that Morris died as ""a direct result"" of Hunter's actions.

""Despite the rapidly declining condition of the patient, [Hunter] never called for rapid response nor acted with any sense of urgency,"" the Board of Nursing stated.

Following a police investigation into the incident, Hunter was indicted for murder on Monday and taken into custody on Tuesday. She is currently being held at Fayette County Detention Center. Her bond has been set at $100,000.

The Kentucky Board of Nursing suspended her license after she was indicted. Baptist Health terminated her on April 30, though the hospital stated that she had no complaints lodged against her until her alleged treatment of Morris.

The Lexington Herald-Leader reports that Hunter was a traveling nurse who also worked at the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center, which likewise terminated her following her indictment. Until Monday, she had been a licensed and registered nurse in Kentucky since 2018. Before that, she had been a licensed LPN, beginning in 2007. The Herald-Leader claims Hunter had also been licensed as a nurse in other states, but which states and when she had been licensed remain unclear.

"NY Times writers hold 24-hour strike over wages, remote work rules – 1,100 union employees cite outlet's 'failure to bargain in good faith'","More than 1,100 union writers and other staff at the New York Times staged a 24-hour walkout on Thursday after the company failed to lock down a contract with the union by last week's deadline, Reuters reported.



NewsGuild of New York, a labor union for news professionals, pointed to the company's ""failure to bargain in good faith.""

After 20 months of deadlocked contract negotiating, the union set a new deadline for midnight on December 8 but failed to ""reach a fair deal"" with the Times regarding salaries, health insurance benefits, and return-to-work requirements.

""Their wage proposal still fails to meet the economic moment, lagging far behind both inflation and the average rate of wage gains in the U.S.,"" the union stated.

According to the NewsGuild, which represents more than 1,450 employees in the Times' newsroom, the newspaper's management team walked out of Wednesday's marathon bargaining session with five hours left before the deadline.

""Over 1,100 New York Times workers are now officially on work stoppage, the first of this scale at the company in 4 decades,"" NewsGuild posted on Twitter. ""It's never an easy decision to refuse to do work you love, but our members are willing to do what it takes to win a better newsroom for all. #GuildStrong!""

Union employees and supporters planned to picket and rally outside the New York Times building on Thursday afternoon. Staff encouraged others not to read the paper's articles or engage in any Times platforms, including the word game Wordle.

""We're asking readers to not engage in any @nytimes platforms tomorrow and stand with us on the digital picket line! Read local news. Listen to public radio. Make something from a cookbook. Break your Wordle streak,"" Amanda Hess, a writer at the Times, posted on Twitter.

""I'm walking out with 1,100 of my @NYTimesGuild colleagues for a fair and complete contract,"" wrote Michael Gold, a Times reporter. ""This contract is more than an investment in us: This is an investment in the future of @nytimes and an investment in the public that we serve.""

""There's something about this form that makes people act so ugly, but the NYT is not just journalists,"" Ida Bae Wells, a New York Times magazine reporter, posted on social media. ""We're striking for our lower paid colleagues, those who put out the paper, our security guards, our news assistants. That is the point of COLLECTIVE actions. We fight together.""

The New York Times addressed the one-day strike in a Thursday morning article, confirming that the contract between the newspaper and the union had expired in March 2021. After 40 bargaining sessions, the Times and NewsGuild continued to face several sticking points.

According to the Times, the union was unsatisfied with its proposed raises, return-to-work policy, and the employee performance rating system.

""White Guild members were more likely to get the top ratings,"" stated a study conducted by NewsGuild, ""while Black and Hispanic members were more likely to get the lowest two ratings.""

Following the report, the newspaper claimed that the managing editor, Marc Lacey, announced plans to update the rating system.

The Times reported that during the 24-hour walkout, nonunion writers and staff would continue to release news reports.

""Strikes typically happen when talks deadlock. That is not where we are today,"" said Joe Kahn, the executive editor of the Times. ""While the company and the NewsGuild remain apart on a number of issues, we continue to trade proposals and make progress toward an agreement.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nurse-charged-with-murder-after-she-injected-97-year-old-man-with-something-special-when-he-became-agitated-report,2022-12-08
NYC fires hundreds more teachers for refusing mandatory vaccination,"President Joe Biden claimed that the pandemic is over in his interview with ""60 Minutes,"" which aired on Sunday. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told CNN in January that vaccines are ineffective at preventing transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Earlier this year, the CDC began acknowledging the benefits and protections provided by the natural immunity resultant of an infection by the virus. Nevertheless, workers across America continue to lose their jobs for refusing COVID-19 vaccines.

The New York City Department of Education has terminated an additional 850 teachers for resisting the vaccine mandate. According to the New York Post, this recent spate of firings brings the total number of school employees ousted for their failure to comply to 1,950.

Those fired have also lost their health insurance benefits.

While 850 remained resolute in their refusal to comply with the mandate, 1,300 employees who had been placed on unpaid leave with benefits agreed to show proof of vaccination by September 5.

450 got vaccinated before the deadline and are reportedly ""returning to their prior schools or work locations."" Those who refused to show up with papers were ""deemed to have voluntarily resigned.""

Vaccinations for jobs

The mandate that has now put thousands of New Yorkers out of work first went into effect on October 4, 2021. Then-mayor Bill de Blasio indicated that objectors, estimated to be about 5% of 148,000 public school staffers, would be placed on unpaid leave. Teachers, principals, school safety agents and food service workers were among those targeted by the requirement.

De Blasio said, ""Every adult in our schools is now vaccinated, and that's going to be the rule going forward.""

Mayor Eric Adams maintained the mandate, recently noting that ""city workers served on the front lines during the pandemic, and by getting vaccinated, they are, once again, showing how they are willing to do the right thing to protect themselves and all New Yorkers.""

Those who did not do what was perceived by Adams to be ""the right thing"" did not have their livelihoods protected, despite having ""served on the front lines.""

In addition to firefighters, police officers, and teachers losing their jobs on account of personal medical decisions, tens of thousands of health care workers were similarly terminated after Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul expanded her predecessor's mandate to include staff in various additional hospital settings.

Timing and legality

Whereas the firing of thousands of unvaccinated NYPD police officers may leave an overburdened police force with even fewer hands to deal with a 36% surge in crime, the loss of thousands of educators will similarly have a negative impact on the city. After all, there is a looming teacher shortage.

The New York State United Teachers union indicated that approximately 180,000 teachers need to be hired in the state over the next decade, especially after 280,000 teachers across the U.S. left the workforce during the pandemic.

Jolene DiBrango, the union's executive vice president, said ""The teacher shortage is definitely not looming anymore. It is here. It is in a full blown crisis mode.""

Earlier this month, the New York City Council's Common-Sense Caucus pressured the mayor and Dr. Ashwin Vasan, the city's health commissioner, to ease restrictions and mandates.

Republican councilman Joe Borelli of South Shore, a member of the group, noted that ""these mandates ... no longer have any basis in public health rationale.""

Months after the city lifted its vaccine mandate for indoor venues, teachers must still be vaccinated along with children seeking to participate in extracurricular activities. Borelli called these vestigial mandates ""simply absurd.""

While the Supreme Court blocked the Biden administration's federal vaccine mandate, Justice Sonia Sotomayor refused to block NYC's mandate for teachers in October 2021. Late last month, Sotomayor again declined to block the mandate.

Notwithstanding federal permissiveness, last week, a Manhattan judge ruled that a Brooklyn police officer, Officer Alexander Deletto, could not be fired for refusing vaccination. Deletto had sought a religious exemption, which the city had initially denied.



Deletto's lawyer, James Mermigis, told the Post ""These are people that were heroes during COVID that put their own safety at risk to help the city of New York and this is how the mayor treats them? ... It's an absolute disgrace.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ny-times-writers-strike-24-hours,2022-09-19
Dozens of NYC teachers put on unpaid leave for allegedly providing fake vaccination cards; teachers' union vows lawsuit,"According to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, dozens of school teachers in New York City have been accused of providing fake vaccination cards in order to prove compliance with New York City's vaccine mandate, and those teachers will not be returning to the classroom after spring break is over. The union representing the teachers, however, is vowing a lawsuit if the mayor doesn't change his mind.

According to WCBS-TV, the New York City Department of Education identified ""fewer than 100"" teachers who allegedly submitted fake vaccination cards to the department to demonstrate compliance with former mayor Bill de Blasio's vaccine mandate in the city. The department did not explain how it determined that these vaccine cards were fake, but did say that the teachers would be immediately placed on unpaid leave and were subject to termination.

""I'm really disappointed to learn there were fake vaccination cards. Not only is it illegal, it undermines our entire trust,"" said Adams. The department further added that law enforcement is investigating these individuals, leading to the possibility of criminal charges.

However, the United Federation of Teachers issued a statement promising to fight back, saying that the punishment is based on ""unproven allegations"" and that the city's actions are ""a clear violation of the basic notion of due process."" The union threatened a prompt lawsuit if the city did not immediately change its stance.

Michael Kane, a former teacher who was dismissed for failure to comply with the city's vaccine mandate, criticized the city's actions and the apparent hypocrisy of allowing NBA star Kyrie Irving to receive an exemption from the mandate, but not school teachers. ""We now have Eric Adams saying if you're a high paying performer or athlete, you don't have to abide by this rule, but if you're part of the working class, you do. What we have now is not public health. We have class warfare,"" Kane said.

NYU prof fired after his students complained they couldn't hack it warns not to 'coddle students for sake of tuition',"New York University students successfully petitioned to have a chemistry professor fired last month because they found his pre-med course too challenging. That professor is now speaking out about students' inability to ""take responsibility for failure"" and the danger of appeasing juvenile demands to be coddled.

Fired for expecting competency

84-year-old Maitland Jones Jr. is a professor of chemistry. Prior to teaching at NYU for fifteen years, he taught at Princeton University from 1964 until 2007, where he worked on over 200 papers, monographs, and books. According to Princeton's Office of the Dean of Faculty, the lab in which he experimented ""was an incubator of scientific and cultural exchange at all levels.""

Jones has a reputation as an academic who ""teaches the very knowledge he creates"" and whose classes, at least at Princeton, received rave reviews. As recently as 2017, he was celebrated as one of the ""Coolest Professors at NYU.""

The New York Times reported that last spring, 82 of his 350 undergraduate students signed a petition against Jones, claiming that his ""high-stakes course"" was too hard, going so far as to personally blame Jones for their poor test scores.



The petition said, ""We urge you to realize that a class with such a high percentage of withdrawals and low grades has failed to make students' learning and wellbeing a priority and reflects poorly on the chemistry department as well as the institution as a whole.""

According to the Guardian, the petition did not explicitly demand for Jones to be fired. Nevertheless, NYU deans terminated Jones' contract in August ahead of the fall semester.

Jones later wrote that the ""deans never revealed the contents of the petition to me so I was unable to refute it in any way. After several months of silence on their part, on Aug. 2 the deans fired me over the objections of the chemistry department. The administration summarily dismissed the grievance I filed.""

Paramjit Arora, a fellow chemist and colleague of Jones', told the New York Times, ""The deans are obviously going for some bottom line, and they want happy students who are saying great things about the university so more people apply and the U.S. News rankings keep going higher.""

Jones stated that while his ""reputation as a chemist and educator has not been seriously damaged,"" barring ""fair-minded support from departmental and university leadership,"" teachers will no longer be able to ""transfer their knowledge and experience to the next generation of students and teachers.""

Appeasing the complainers

The New York Times noted that extra to firing Jones, NYU officials tried to appease his former students, enabling them to withdraw from his class retroactively — in what Mark E. Tuckerman, the chemistry department's chairman referred to as a ""one-time exception"" — while also offering to review their grades.

Marc A. Walters, director of undergraduate studies, wrote to Jones ahead of his termination, indicating that NYU would ""extend a gentle but firm hand to the students and those who pay the tuition bills.""

Jones seized on this remark among others in a recent opinion piece he penned for the Boston Globe.

The veteran academic suggested that such interventions on behalf of students unwilling to confront their test score-illuminated shortcomings have a ""chilling effect ... on teaching overall and especially on untenured professors.""

Jones suggested that untenured faculty won't dare to ""give real grades"" and risk their careers ""at the peril of complaining students and deans who seem willing to turn students into nothing more than tuition-paying clients.""

The problem, in Jones' estimation, is not just the confrontation-adverse administrators who he indicated think of students chiefly as clients. The students complaining have also themselves to blame.

In his op-ed, Jones claimed that, during the pandemic when in-person classes were interrupted, he ""commissioned and paid for a series of 52 videos to substitute for canceled in-person lectures. Students rarely watched them. They performed abysmally on exams that would have seemed too easy only a few years ago.""

Despite failing to prepare and execute, many students who evidenced their need for help didn't seek it, certainly not by attending zoomed office hours.

Zacharia Benslimane, a Ph.D. student at Harvard who previously worked as a teaching assistant in Jones' course, told NYU, ""I have noticed that many of the students who consistently complained about the class did not use the resources we afforded to them.""

The incompetence amongst students was not, however, universal, just as the signers of the petition did not come close to achieving a majority.

Jones reported that while single digit scores became common ""and we even had zeros on exams ... 60 percent of my students still got As and Bs this past semester.""

While underperformers bottomed out, top students were allegedly performing better than ever.

'Tough love'

Concerning the underperformers, Jones wrote, ""Everyone hits limits at some point, and it is a vital life skill to use 'failure' to overcome and improve. Failure should become a class 'teachable moment.'""



The pandemic may have exacerbated the problem of incompetence and the refusal to address it, but, according to Jones, the problem goes back at least a decade.

""About 10 years ago, I noticed that students were increasingly misreading exam questions,"" Jones wrote. ""My careful attention to the wording or problems did not help much. Exam scores began to decline, as did attendance in the traditional large lecture section of the course.""

The solution, argued Jones, isn't appeasement but ""tough love.""

""Deans must learn to not coddle students for the sake of tuition ... They must join the community in times of conflict to generate those teachable moments,"" wrote Jones.

In addition to adults remaining resolute in upholding high standards, Jones emphasized that students ""need to develop the ability to take responsibility for failure. If they continue to deflect blame, they will never grow.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-teachers-fake-vaccine-cards,2022-10-23
New Zealand health officials take custody of baby whose parents refused 'vaccinated blood' transfusion,"Parents in New Zealand who refused to allow their baby to take a transfusion of blood if it contained the COVID-19 vaccine now find the state in possession of their child after worldwide coverage of the story.

As reported by the Guardian, the baby boy is now in guardianship of his surgeon and cardiologist “for the purpose of consenting to surgery to address the obstruction and all medical issues related to that surgery, including the administration of blood,” said Justice Ian Gault, the judge presiding over the case.

New Zealand health authorities including the blood services sector have said that allowing parents to refuse the transfusion would set a ""dangerous precedent"" and open up the door to patients making demands as to where their blood comes from, including whether or not it contains vaccines, as in this case.

The state will remain in guardianship over the boy until he recovers from his surgery, which is said to be January 2023 at the latest. The parents will not be punished further in terms of custody of the child.

While the open-heart surgery is said to be lifesaving, the father stated, “We don’t want blood that is tainted by vaccination.”

""We're fine with anything else doctors want to do,"" said the parent of the baby, just 6 months old, in an interview with a woman named Lizz Gunn.

During the same interview, the father says that authorities told him his say ""was not a scientific say, it's your concern but not our concern.""

In an press conference in front of a crowd of protesters and reporters outside the courthouse, the mother commented on the need for ""safe blood"" while insisting on having the right as a parent to choose:

""We're desperate for an operation, but we need to have safe blood, that is our right, as a mother and as a voice for my baby,"" she remarked.

""They're saying we know what's best, we know what's good for your baby and we want to do it our way, and we are not even going to talk to you,"" a spokesperson for the parents said in the press conference.

""We're going to go into the court and we're going to try and get somebody from the court to gang up with us, effectively,"" the woman claimed of the health officials. ""[We'll] make you do what we want to do, because we're going to show you we're the boss,"" she continued.

According to the judge, New Zealand blood services has seen a significant rise in requests for unvaccinated blood or direct blood donations to recipients in the last six months.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyu-prof-fired-because-his-students-couldnt-hack-it-calls-for-tough-love-and-warns-not-to-coddle-students-for-sake-of-tuition,2022-12-07
Gibson's Bakery 'beat Goliath': Oberlin college finally ponying up after conclusively losing defamation suit,"Oberlin College, a notably woke institution, indicated on Thursday that it would pay the $36.59 million it owes to Gibson's Bakery — the local establishment that the college had defamed and falsely accused of racism.

Payback

After the Ohio Supreme Court decided not to hear its appeal in August, the college issued a release on September 8 indicating that it had ""initiated payment in full."" While admitting that the ""size of this verdict is significant,"" Oberlin suggested that it would be able to satisfy its ""legal obligation without impacting [its] academic and student experience.""

The amount was decided by a lengthy lawsuit first launched by the bakery in 2017 against Oberlin and former dean of students and vice president of the college Meredith Raimondo.

In an opinion piece published last week in the New York Post, bakery owner Lorna Gibson noted that she had not yet ""seen a penny from the school ... which has a billion dollars' worth of assets at its disposal.""

Lorna also explained the primary reason why her family first filed suit. Her husband David's 89-year-old father, who dedicated his life to the 137-year-old family business, ""did not want to die being falsely branded a racist.""

It was David, Lorna's husband, who wouldn't live to see Oberlin pay the price for slandering their family. David died of cancer in 2019. He lived long enough, however, to see the verdict handed down in his bakery's favor — a verdict Oberlin would try to have appealed.

The accusations leveled by Oberlin students, leadership, and staff, she wrote, were ""deeply painful to our core.""

How it started

In November 2016, a robbery rocked Gibson's Bakery. Allyn Gibson, the owner's son, is said to have been badly beaten while attempting to apprehend an individual he had observed stealing from the establishment. When officers arrived to the scene, they found Allyn laying on his back with several individuals hovering over him, punching and kicking.

The counter-narrative suggested that Allyn had tackled a black male student who had stolen from the bakery, prompting two female students to intervene.

Three Oberlin students — Jonathan Aladin, Endia Lawrence, and Cecelia Whettstone — were subsequently arrested. The charges handed out were robbery, simple assault, and attempted petty theft. Their arrests generated an uproar.

Hundreds of students and teachers rallied outside of Gibson's Bakery the next day and for several more days in succession, denouncing the bakery as racist and its owners as ""white supremacists."" Among the protesters was the dean of students and other members of Oberlin staff.

Flyers, allegedly generated by at least one college staffer, were circulated that called for a boycott of the bakery, insinuating it had a ""LONG ACCOUNT of RACIAL PROFILING and DISCRIMINATION.""

The trio involved in the robbery eventually pled guilty to misdemeanor charges, including aggravated trespassing and attempted theft. According to the AP, in their plea agreement, the three stated that their actions were wrong and that the store wasn't racist.

Notwithstanding these clarifying statements and admissions of guilt, members of Oberlin College and the student body were adamant that Gibson's Bakery and those who worked there were racist and were fit for economic destruction.



The lawsuit

The business' reputation was not the only thing that was attacked by the college. Its financial wellbeing was similarly put at risk. In addition to the social pressure not to patronize the establishment, Oberlin terminated all standing orders from the bakery.

David Gibson reportedly met with the president of the school, but the college remained steadfast in its refusal to retract the accusations its body had made at the bakery's expense.

Consequently, Gibson's Bakery filed a civil complaint against Oberlin and Raimondo for libel, slander, interference with business relationships, and interference with contracts.

The Gibsons suggested that Oberlin college leaders were chief proponents of the defamatory economic boycott; that they had gone so far as to confer credit to students who would skip class to protest the bakery.

Upon the filing of the suit, Oberlin claimed the ""allegations are untrue,"" and announced it would terminate all business relationships with the bakery ""until such time as a mutually productive relationship may be re-established.""

Victory delayed

In June 2019, the jury awarded Gibson's Bakery $11 million against Oberlin. Meredith Raimondo was held liable for the counts of libel and interference with business relations, but was spared financial penalty as the college would be responsible to pay for any amounts awarded against her.

The jury later awarded the Bakery $44 million in damages, which was reduced owing to state limits. The reduced award would, nevertheless, include money to reimburse the bakery's legal fees.



In October 2019, Oberlin attempted appealing the case to the Ohio Ninth District Court, but that appeal was dismissed on April 1, 2022. Oberlin would still have to pay the bakery to the tune of $31 million.

Again, Oberlin looked for a way out. In May of 2022, the college looked to the Ohio Supreme Court to take up its appeal of the multimillion dollar judgment, but that was declined in August 2022.

The win

The Gibson family's lawyer, Lee E. Plakas, claimed ""Truth matters ... David, supported by a principled community can still beat Goliath.""

Lorna stated on September 1 that when Oberlin finally paid up, ""I wouldn't buy a house, or go on vacation, or leave Ohio. I would replace the compressors for the refrigerators and replace the fryers and proofers that we use for our dough ... I'd hire back employees and ramp up production."" Ultimately, she'd stand her ground and continue the work her late husband, son, and family have been keen to do, and have been doing for over a century.

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio) celebrated the Gibsons' victory on Twitter.

Oberlin College, whose purse will soon be roughly $37 million lighter, stated that it hopes ""that the end of the litigation will begin the healing of our entire community.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/nz-govt-takes-guardianship-ofbaby,2022-09-09
'Obviously ... it was the wrong decision': Texas DPS chief admits fatal police error in Uvalde school shooting,"Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw admitted Friday that police in Uvalde, Texas, made a fatal error in judgement during Tuesday's mass shooting event at Robb Elementary School, waiting outside for backup instead of rushing in to confront the gunman.

“Obviously, based on the information we have, there were children in that classroom that were still at risk,” McCraw said. “From the benefit of hindsight where I’m sitting now, of course, it was not the right decision. It was the wrong decision. Period.”

Speaking at a press conference, McCraw revealed new details about the massacre that left 19 children and two teachers dead. The local police have faced mounting criticism over their response to the active shooter situation, particularly from parents who accused officers of ""doing nothing"" while the gunman was inside the school.



""We're here to report facts as we know them now. Not to defend what was done or to criticize what was done or the actions taken,"" McCraw said.

According to the director, video evidence reveals that at 11:27 a.m. local time, a teacher had propped open an exterior door that police suspected the gunman used to enter the building.

At 11:28 a.m., the shooter crashed his vehicle in a ditch outside the school, exited, and then began firing at two males from a nearby funeral home who had come to investigate the crash. He did not hit either of the two men.

At 11:30 a.m., the teacher re-emerged from inside the school ""in panic"" and called 911 to report the car crash and a man with a gun.



By 11:31 a.m., the shooter had reached ""the last row of vehicles"" in the parking lot and started firing at the school building from outside.

Earlier reports that a school resource officer had confronted the gunman outside the building were inaccurate, McCraw said. That officer ""was not on scene"" at the time, but had ""heard the 911 call"" and ""drove immediately to the area.""

McCraw said the officer ""sped to what he thought was the man with a gun at the back of the school that turned out to be a teacher, and not the suspect. In doing so he drove right by the suspect, who was hunkered down behind a vehicle where he began shooting at the school.""

At 11:33 a.m., the gunman used the propped-open door to enter the building. McCraw said that audio evidence indicates the suspect fired more than 100 rounds after entering the school.

Three officers from the Uvalde police department went to the same door as the suspect at 11:35 a.m., and two received ""grazing wounds"" from the suspect while the door was closed, McCraw said. They were followed by four more officers, including a county sheriff, who responded to the scene.

Gunfire was heard intermittently during this time. At some point, the shooter had entered a classroom, where he massacred the children.



By 12:03 p.m. there were as many as 19 officers on scene and in the school hallway, McCraw said. The suspect fired again at 12:21 p.m. and was believed to be at the door of the classroom.

Law enforcement moved down the hallway and at 12:50 p.m. breached the classroom door using keys obtained from a janitor. At that time, they confronted and killed the suspect, the director said.



McCraw also shared new details about 911 calls made by students, including one who repeatedly asked the dispatcher to ""please send police now.""

McCraw said the gunman was found to have a history of discussing school shootings and buying a gun in Instagram chats in February and March of this year. In September 2021, he asked his sister to help him buy a weapon, but she refused.



Facing questions from reporters on why it took nearly an hour to stop the shooter, McCraw said police mistakenly believed the situation had changed from an ""active shooter to a barricaded subject.""

""The on-scene commander considered a barricaded subject and that there was time and that there were no more children at risk,"" McCraw said.

Police thought there was time to retrieve the classroom keys and wait for a tactical team with equipment to breach the door and take on the subject, McCraw said.

""The decision was made on the scene.""

"Ocasio-Cortez fires back at accusations she faked being handcuffed at protest, says she was fined only $50","Far-left progressive Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York fired back at accusations that she faked being handcuffed on Tuesday when she was escorted from a pro-abortion protest at the U.S. Capitol.

Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Wednesday that she was not trying to pretend that she was handcuffed, as many have accused.

""No faking here. Putting your hands behind your back is a best practice while detained, handcuffed or not, to avoid escalating charges like resisting arrest,"" she claimed.

Ocasio-Cortez aimed her ire at Rep. Nancy Mace, and added an insult against the Republican from South Carolina.

""But given how you lied about a fellow rape survivor for 'points,' as you put it to me, I don’t expect much else from you,"" she added, referring to a dustup between the two in February.

She and other Democratic lawmakers were briefly detained after they refused to comply with orders from law enforcement officials to stop blocking traffic. Both Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) appeared to pretend they were handcuffed as they were led away by police from the protest outside the Supreme Court.

Ocasio-Cortez added in an Instagram story that she had been fined only $50 for the incident.

The invisible handcuffs became fodder for critics of Ocasio-Cortez who posted memes and jokes ridiculing her effort. Among those mocking her were Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who quipped: ""She was shackled today in a way that's never been done before — with imaginary shackles.""

Some in the media were also excoriated for aiding the deception by publishing photographs making it appear that both she and Omar were handcuffed.

Ocasio-Cortez is under House ethics investigation over Met Gala appearance where she wore 'Tax the Rich' dress,"Socialist Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York was applauded by many on the left for wearing a dress bearing the message ""Tax the Rich"" to the Met Gala, but she's facing a House ethics investigation over her attendance.

On Tuesday, the congressional panel confirmed that it was investigating the incident from September 12, 2021.

Two complaints were filed to the Office of Congressional Ethics against Ocasio-Cortez about her attendance, specifically over the cost of the tickets for her and her partner.

The American Accountability Foundation sent a letter to the office noting that tickets to the lavish event reportedly cost between $35,000 to $50,000.

""If Representative Occasio-Cortez has used campaign funds to pay for this ticket, she has also violated FEC prohibitions on campaign funds being used for entertainment purposes,"" the group added.

Her office released a statement about the ethics probe.

""The Congresswoman has always taken ethics incredibly seriously, refusing any donations from lobbyists, corporations or other special interests. We are confident that this matter will be dismissed.""

Ocasio-Cortez faced ridicule over the bizarre juxtaposition of a dress with anti-wealth message at an exclusive and extravagant event only attended by the rich and powerful. She responded by accusing her detractors of being racist and sexist.

""I thought about the criticism I'd get, but honestly I and my body have been so heavily and relentlessly policed from all corners politically since the moment I won my election that it's kind of become expected and normalized to me,"" she wrote at the time.

""The irony is that when women in power take the prospect of criticism to be cautious in their actions, they are then criticized for being 'inauthentic' and 'too calculated.' Ultimately the haters hated and the people who are thoughtful were thoughtful,"" she concluded.

The socialist politician was later mocked and ridiculed for selling T-shirts on her website with the same ""Tax the Rich"" message.

Here's more about the ethics probe into Ocasio-Cortez:",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ocasio-cortez-fires-back-at-accusations-she-faked-being-handcuffed-and-says-she-was-only-fined-50,2022-12-08
Off-duty officer mobbed and robbed  while riding bike in New Orleans,"Just before 3:00 a.m. on August 8, an off-duty NOPD officer was allegedly attacked and robbed outside the St. Louis Market off Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter.

4WWL reported that an off-duty officer, 23, pedaled his bike past a large group of people outside the St. Louis Market. Security footage shows the officer speaking to persons in the crowd while still mobile. One suspect is said to have demanded the officer's bike. When the officer refused to comply, a struggle broke out.

Several young men can be seen attacking the officer within minutes of the initial interaction.

The officer regained his footing after being hurled to the ground and, at the top of the hour, allegedly swung back at his aggressors. Peripheral fights then allegedly broke out, engulfing the officer.

In the melee, the officer's personal handgun was reported stolen.

By 3:05 a.m., NOPD arrived at the scene and arrested a 16-year-old suspect. The suspect was reportedly later booked into the Juvenile Justice Intervention Center on charges of second-degree battery and simple robbery.



The officer's name has not been released because victims' names are not publicized in criminal incidents.

Local business owner Haytham Hamed, general manager of Vieux Carre Pizza, told KSLA that similar groupings of violent young men have prompted him to close his establishment early as well as to consider changing careers. ""Crime is high ... It's like we are in a war.""

Violent crime is on the rise in New Orleans. The city is rated a 2 on Neighborhood Scout's crime index (100 is safest), with a property crime rate of 47.13 and a violent crime rate of 13.6 per 1,000 residents.

There were 218 murders in 2021. 145 homicides had already been reported by June 30 of this year, setting the city on its way to having a homicide rate of 77 per 100,000 — one of the highest murder rates in the world, on par with gang hot spots in Honduras and Mexico. Chicago, by way of comparison, sees 18.26 murders per 100,000 population.

According to City Journal, this correlates with Soros-backed District Attorney Jason Williams' ""more selective"" approach to prosecuting violent offenders. The felony conviction rate dropped from 57% in 2019 to 21% in 2021, the year that Williams — under indictment for tax fraud — took office. Nearly 20% of the felony cases dismissed were violent crimes.

After being sworn in, Williams claimed: ""Being more selective about prosecutions will allow us to focus on the crimes that matter most to all of us.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ocasio-cortez-gala-dress-ethics,2022-08-11
"Ohio grand jury affirms 'Stand Your Ground' law, refuses to indict man who shot his daughter's ex-boyfriend, who had broken into their home","An Ohio man will not face criminal charges, even after he fatally shot his daughter's ex-boyfriend who had broken into their home.

On July 31 at approximately 11 a.m. local time, James Rayl stood on the front porch of his ex-girlfriend's house in Sidney, Ohio, about 40 minutes north of Dayton. Rayl rang the doorbell repeatedly, briefly left the porch, returned, and then began attempting to break through the door with his shoulder.

Meanwhile, the homeowner Mitchell Duckro stood on the other side of the door and asked Rayl to leave his property. He also warned the young man that he was armed. When Rayl finally managed to breach the deadbolt lock, Duckro fired his gun and shot Rayl three times, once in each shoulder and once in the back. Rayl then staggered to the driveway and collapsed.

He died within minutes.

The entire harrowing scene, including Duckro's warnings, was captured on a front door camera. His daughter, Allyson Duckro, can also be heard asking her father ""Dad, is he trying to kill me?""

After Rayl was shot, Allyson told her father, ""Dad, there’s nothing you could have done. You saved my life.""

Shelby County Prosecutor Tim Sell showed the grand jury the front door camera footage, as well as the 911 call tape. The grand jury voted 8-1 not to indict, citing Ohio's ""Stand Your Ground"" and ""castle doctrine,"" which affirm the rights of homeowners to use lethal force against those who threaten their safety or property.

Despite the evidence demonstrating that Rayl posed an immediate threat to the Duckros and their property, some in Rayl's family remain convinced that Duckro should have been indicted.

""You should absolutely be ashamed of your actions all around,"" Rayl's sister, Jessica Marie Colbert, wrote on Facebook. ""Every single one of you connected to the Duckro family that has no regard for my family whatsoever.

""Mitch shot him in the back and killed him. And we know more than just that Mitchy. I hope your days are more miserable than they've ever been. You're a disgusting excuse of a human being along with your daughter,"" she added.

According to Fox News, Allyson Duckro had broken up with Rayl about 18 months ago. The night before the incident, Rayl had called Allyson and left her a voice mail. The contents of the message are unknown.

Colbert shared on Facebook a YouTube video of an extended version of the front door camera footage. The YouTube account is called Justice for James Rayl.

Oklahoma man allowed to sue local school board members for cutting his mic because he spoke about God: 'Mr. Chaffin was removed because he was predicating his comments on a Biblical worldview',"A state judge in Oklahoma has refused to dismiss a lawsuit which alleges that a local school board turned off a public microphone because a man used ""a Biblical worldview"" to frame his comments.

Back in April, Brice Chaffin spoke at a public school board meeting in Stillwater, Oklahoma, about 65 miles north of Oklahoma City and the home of Oklahoma State University. Though the board had not planned to discuss rules related to bathroom use at schools, many in the audience, including Chaffin, elected to speak about the topic nonetheless.

Many residents wanted to weigh in on the issue since the board had recently updated its anti-discrimination policy to include ""gender identity,"" which meant that students could use the bathroom which corresponds to their ""gender [identities],"" rather than their biological sexes.

Chaffin began his comments by arguing for the reality of God and the necessity of accepting Jesus. When board members then asked Chaffin to speak about the bathroom topic at hand, Chaffin hinted at his opposition to ""gender identity"" as a concept and the related bathroom issue by referencing the Bible.

""So, I talked about physical laws,"" Chaffin said. ""We have spiritual laws. We also have natural laws. Natural law, for instance, one natural law is that on the day God created man, He made him in the likeness of God. He created them male and female. So, we have males and females.""

Chaffin then began to quote from the first chapter of the New Testament book Romans, a chapter often cited to denounce homosexuality.

At that point, school board members interjected once again and asked Chaffin to stay on topic. When he continued to read from Romans, the board silenced the microphone, and Chaffin's words became inaudible. Security then removed Chaffin from the meeting.

After the meeting, Chaffin, with the help of attorney Maria Seidler, filed a lawsuit against Stillwater Public Schools, members of the Stillwater school board, and Gay Washington, who was acting superintendent at the time.

Jenni White, president of the group Reclaim Oklahoma Parent Empowerment (ROPE), which is also listed as a plaintiff, issued a statement in support of the suit.

""Any member of the taxpaying community has the right to speak at a school board meeting,"" White wrote. ""If you watch the video, it was clear that Mr. Chaffin was removed because he was predicating his comments on a Biblical worldview. According to the First Amendment our speech is protected from interference by the government and a school board is a governmental entity.""

""I'd just like the school boards to uphold the Constitution as they're required to pledge upon taking office. Free speech must include religious speech,"" White added.

Though the judge dismissed the charges against the school board as a whole, the judge upheld the suit against the district and each individual board member. A pretrial hearing has been scheduled for November. Chaffin and Seidler are not seeking monetary damages from the defendants, but a public apology and remittance for attorney's fees.

State legislators have since changed state law to restrict students to using the bathroom which is in accords with their biological sex.

The entire meeting can be viewed below. Chaffin's speech begins at about 1:04:20.

Oregon pro-life pregnancy center set on fire in 'suspicious' attack,"Authorities said Friday they are investigating the suspected arson of a Oregon pregnancy center in what appears to be yet another attack on a pro-life organization ahead of the U.S. Supreme Court's highly anticipated abortion decision.

The Seattle Field Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Friday it was assisting police in Gresham, Ore., investigate a fire at the Gresham Pregnancy Resource Center. ATF said the fire was ""suspicious in nature.""

According to First Image, the Christian pro-life organization that owns the pregnancy center, the building was set ablaze at about 3 a.m. on Friday. Police and fire authorities said it appeared that an ""incendiary device"" was thrown through a window, First Image said in a post on its website.

The pregnancy center's alarm system alerted authorities, and firemen were able to extinguish the fire. The damage was mostly contained to one room, but it was extensive and there is additional water and smoke damage in other parts of the building, the group said.



Nobody was hurt.

“We don’t know who’s involved in this. But there’s enough to tell us that it is suspicious in nature,” Gresham fire chief Jason McGowan told KOIN-TV on Friday. “And that’s why we need to have multiple agencies looking into it and seeing what exactly happened this morning.”

This attack follows the alleged firebombing of a pro-life pregnancy center in Buffalo, New York, by pro-abortion terrorists and a string of vandalism and crimes against other pro-life groups.

""The kind of outrage that’s being directed at us is based on a complete misunderstanding and misrepresentation of who we are and how we have served the hundreds of thousands of people that have come to us over the decades,"" First Image CEO Luke Cirillo said. ""This moment in our culture is volatile, and the spillover into violence is deeply destructive to the fabric of our communities. We reject and refuse to have any part in the culture of hate. Jesus has modeled a different way. It’s the way of love. That narrow way includes, as a challenge to us all, the love of those who hate us.""

The U.S. government has been preparing for a potential surge in political violence once the Supreme Court releases its decision in a high-profile abortion case concerning Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban. A leaked draft opinion for the case indicated the court has voted to uphold the abortion ban and overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade opinion, which would end constitutional protections for abortion.

A terrorism advisory bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security issued last week said ""several high-profile events could be exploited to justify acts of violence against a range of possible targets.""

""Given a high-profile U.S. Supreme Court case about abortion rights, individuals who advocate both for and against abortion have, on public forums, encouraged violence, including against government, religious, and reproductive healthcare personnel and facilities, as well as those with opposing ideologies,"" the DHS said.

An internal memo circulated by the department last month said that law enforcement agencies have monitored threats on social media to burn down or storm the Supreme Court building and murder justices, as well as attack houses of worship or abortion clinics.



A man was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh at his Maryland home last week. He had brought a firearm to Kavanaugh's residence and confessed to police that he's been having suicidal thoughts and traveled from California to Maryland to kill Kavanaugh.

As the attacks on pro-life groups and the attempted murder of a Supreme Court justice demonstrate, the violence is no longer hypothetical and is escalating.

"Oregon's most populous county dropping charges against hundreds of people accused of various crimes, including hit-and-run incidents and assaults","Hundreds of suspected wife-beaters, burglars, drunk drivers, and berserkers of various intensity will not face justice in Oregon's most populous county, according to leftist Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt. For lack of public defenders, dangerous personalities are being set free under the justified impression that Portland, the slogan of which is ""the City that Works,"" is a legally dysfunctional city in a legally dysfunctional county.

What are the details?

Schmidt announced on Monday that in ""February of this year, a Multnomah County Circuit Court judge dismissed the first of what is now nearing 300 cases due to a lack of defense counsel over my objection on the basis of victims’ rights.""

The ardent BLM supporter indicated that every week since, judges have dismissed case hearings, meaning accused criminals are being cut loose.

Citing ""a lack of public defenders to provide counsel to defendants,"" Schmidt indicated that the ""courts are put in the position of releasing defendants without prosecutors having so much as an opportunity to request bail or release conditions. And it’s not getting any better.""

According to Schmidt, last week, ""a suspect that allegedly ran a car into a school bus of children, which subsequently had to be evacuated due to a leak caused by the incident, was released within 24 hours of his arrest due to lack of a defense counsel.""

It's not just potential maniacs driving into school buses who are going free under the leftist D.A.'s watch.

Between Feb. 24 and Oct. 31, 285 felony and misdemeanor cases were dismissed, including:



139 cases prosecuted by the A/B Unit, which deals with felonies, including property crimes and human trafficking offenses;

43 cases prosecuted by Unit C, which deals with major felonies, including vehicular assaults and gang-related offenses;

11 cases prosecuted by Unit D, which tackles felony assault cases;

Five cases (two assaults, one strangulation, one criminal mischief, and one coercion) prosecuted by the DV Unit, which deals with domestic violence cases;

One Multi-Disciplinary Team unit child abuse case; and

Six District Court Trial cases, dealing with misdemeanors that accompanied felonies as lesser charges.

80 of the property crime charges dismissed due to a lack of counsel were car thefts.

Nine assaults, six robberies, three hit-and-run felonies, and other personal crimes will go unpunished.

Two individuals who failed to register as sex offenders were also let off.

Stressing the system

11 days after being elected district attorney with the help of the scandal-plagued radical Shaun King, Schmidt made a name for himself by refusing to prosecute BLM rioters.



Courthouse News reported that the leftist D.A. refrained from ""pursuing charges of disorderly conduct, interfering with a police officer, criminal trespass and most charges of rioting.""

Schmidt had claimed that holding rioters to account would ""undermine public safety, not promote it.""

By Oct. 5, 2020, Schmidt's office had dropped charges in nearly 90% of the riot-related cases, reported KOIN.

Multnomah County has reportedly been facing the fallout of that soft-on-crime approach ever since. It doesn't help that Schmidt hasn't changed his ways.

Fox News reported in September that the Portland Police Bureau, financially gutted by the city council and suffering staff shortages since the BLM riots, has struggled to keep up with the rising crime under Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler's watch.



Last year, there were 90 homicides in Portland, 24 more than the previous record set in 1987.

Portland scores a three on Neighborhood Scout's crime index, where 100 is safest. The chances of becoming a victim of a violent crime are one in 187. In the Democrat-controlled state of Oregon, the odds are one in 342.

Things fall apart

Whereas in past years Schmidt elected not to prosecute various crimes, he now suggests the decision is out of his hands, with the ""complex chain"" strained by rising crime, understaffed police, and an insufficient number of public defenders.

In a March 27 opinion piece in the Oregonian, Schmidt wrote, ""Defense attorneys, prosecutors, judges and law enforcement officers are all links in the complex chain that is the criminal justice system. At every link in that chain, there are obvious signs of extreme stress, rapidly nearing the point of breakage.""



Schmidt suggested that attorneys were bailing out of his office as a result of ""the weight of crushing workloads driven by the pandemic, where case counts have increased by as much as 300%.""

The district attorney also claimed that case counts were up despite police — whose confidence in Schmidt has been low — allegedly only referring a small percent of crimes to his office.

The inability to try and convict criminals ""sends a message to crime victims in our community that justice is unavailable and their harm will go unaddressed,"" said Schmidt.

Schmidt added, ""It also sends a message to individuals who have committed a crime that there is no accountability while burning through scarce police and prosecutor resources. Every day that this crisis persists presents an urgent and continuing threat to public safety.""



Instead of a solution, Schmidt offered transparency, saying his ""office will publish every case dismissed or set over as a result of this crisis weekly until it is resolved.""

Accordingly, the public will know the nature of the alleged crimes that will go unpunished in their county.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oregon-pregnancy-center-suspicious-fire,2022-11-22
Florida city scrambles to backpedal after releasing message disparaging Independence Day celebrations,"The City of Orlando was forced to backpedal over the weekend after releasing a controversial message about the Fourth of July that questioned why anyone would want to celebrate Independence Day.

What did the message say?

In a newsletter message released on Friday, the city questioned ""why on earth"" any American would want to celebrate their country and sympathized with people who refuse to celebrate America.

The message said:

A lot of people probably don’t want to celebrate our nation right now, and we can’t blame them. When there is so much division, hate and unrest, why on earth would you want to have a party celebrating any of it?



But in all seriousness, you know in your heart, Fourth of July fireworks are amazing, especially when you are standing in 90° heat, 100% humidity, next to 100,000 of your closest friends. In that moment, something takes over and we all become united in an inexplicable bond. Yes, America is in strife right now, but you know what...we already bought the fireworks.

The message immediately prompted backlash.

""We do not share the same views as the City of Orlando and find their comments in inflammatory and in poor taste,"" said the police union that represents Orlando Police officers.

""Yikes. City of Orlando, is this your official position on our country and on 4th of July?"" reacted Christina Pushaw, spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).

Not everyone, however, was upset. In fact, many people, including Florida state Rep. Anna Eskamani (D), thought the message was appropriate.

""Y’all do not need to apologize — your first email captured the tone of how many Americans (and Orlandoans) are feeling right now. It’s ok not to be ok,"" Eskamani responded to Orlando's official Twitter account.

How did the city respond?

The City of Orlando released a statement on Saturday implicitly apologizing for the earlier statement.

""The city of Orlando sincerely regrets the negative impact our words have had on some in our community,"" the statement said. ""We understand these words offended some of our residents, which was not our intent.

""We value the freedoms we have in this country and are thankful to the men and women who fought and continue to fight for those,"" the statement added. ""We take pride in celebrating the 4th of July to express our gratitude to those men and women and honor the country we live in.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/oregons-most-populous-county-dropping-charges-against-hundreds-of-people-accused-of-various-crimes-including-hit-and-runs-and-assaults,2022-07-04
'Our city is in crisis': McDonald's CEO won't soon abandon Chicago despite 'corrosive effect' of widespread crime,"In his address to the Economic Club of Chicago on September 14, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski indicated that the company will remain headquartered in Chicago despite it being a city ""in crisis.""

Kempczinski explained how skyrocketing crime, not new to many neighborhoods but now ""seeping into every corner of our city,"" had adversely effected not just residents' safety and job prospects, but the company's own ability to recruit and retain talent. ""It's more difficult today for me to convince a promising McDonald's executive to relocate to Chicago from one of our offices than it was just a few years ago.""



Employees have expressed safety concerns and a general ""reluctance"" about taking public transit downtown amidst a surge in violent crimes and robberies. A lack of confidence in the ability to get to work unscathed is not the only thing that's changed in recent years.

""Every single person in this room has seen the corrosive effect that crime can have on the city, its psyche and its citizens,"" said Kempczinski. Businesses are not merely hurt but chased away. ""The fact is that there are fewer large companies headquartered in Chicago this year than last year.""

The executive mentioned the departures from Chicago of Boeing to Virginia, Caterpillar to Texas, and Citadel to Florida. Although each of these large businesses take with them thousands of jobs along with tax revenue, their leaving may be matched in significance by the flood of smaller businesses similarly leaving the city.

Ken Griffin, the billionaire who runs the hedge-fund firm Citadel, said this summer of his decision to leave Chicago: ""If people aren't safe here, they're not going to live here."" He suggested that some of his colleagues had been mugged at gunpoint and that one had been stabbed on his way to work.

Gary Rabine, founder of the Rabine Group, told Fox News Digital that ""We would do thousands of jobs a year in the city, but as we got robbed more ... it got expensive and it got dangerous.""

In addition to exposing workers to risk, increasing crime meant more expensive insurance and security for Rabine. These costs were passed onto customers and, in the case of utility services, taxpayers. Rabine assigned blame both to Democrat Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who he regards as ""a lousy leader,"" and to Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker (D).

Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin (R) suggested that Pritzker ""simply refuses to acknowledge what everyone sees, which is that his high-tax, pro-criminal administration is literally driving jobs and businesses out of state.""

Although committed to doubling down on Chicago, the McDonald's executive admitted it ""has become increasingly difficult to operate a global business out of the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois.""

Extra to the violent crime that deters corporate talent from joining his team in Chicago, Kempczinski suggested that McDonald's is ""seeing homelessness issues"" in the 400 restaurants it has in and about Chicago. ""We're having drug overdoses that are happening in our restaurants.""

Noting his travels across America and the world, Kempczinski stated, ""Everywhere I go, I am confronted by the same question these days: what's going on in Chicago?""

According to the Chicago Police Department, crime so far this year is up 38% over the same period last year. As of September 11, Chicago has already seen:

479 murders;

1,437 sexual assaults;

740 robberies;

4,158 aggravated battery arrests;

5,150 burglaries;

13,395 thefts;

Chicago has a ranking of 10 on the Neighborhood Scout crime index (100 being the safest). For two points of comparison, Democrat Mayor London Breed's San Francisco scores 4 on the index whereas Republican Mayor Bob Dyer's Virginia Beach has a score of 38.

"Dr. Oz hits Fetterman for requiring computer to understand reporter's questions, not being transparent on health","Pennsylvania Republican Senate nominee Dr. Mehmet Oz reacted to the interview his opponent Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D) gave to NBC News this week, which raised questions about Fetterman's health.

Fetterman, who suffered from a life-threatening stroke last May, struggled to speak and required a closed-captioning device to understand questions from NBC News reporter Dasha Burns in an interview that aired on Tuesday. Burns and NBC News observed that Fetterman had difficulty understanding her questions, which stoked outrage on social media from Fetterman's supporters, who accused the network of misrepresenting his health.

Oz, a celebrity doctor and television host, was asked about the computer device Fetterman used by Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo on Thursday.



""It's called closed-captioning, as you know, it's actually what he's requested in the only debate he's granted me, which would be in two weeks, so it's getting towards the end here. But finally I'm going to be able to talk to him,"" Oz said.

He expressed concern for Fetterman's health before criticizing him for refusing to be transparent with voters and release his medical records, a point that was brought up in the NBC interview.



""I've got tremendous compassion for John Fetterman,"" Oz said. ""I'm a doctor who's actually specializing in heart failure, irregular heartbeats, strokes, these are things he's been suffering from. And I'm glad that he's getting back on the campaign trail. But this isn't about me, or the reporter, or anybody else but the voters. They deserve transparency, and John Fetterman's team has repeatedly refused to release his medical records.""

""The question for the voters is: What's he hiding?"" he added. "" Be transparent about what you're up to. Either you've got a medical problem, which we can work through, or you're hiding a radical agenda, which is a bigger concern that I have.""

Burns had pressed Fetterman on his refusal to disclose his medical records. The Democrat insisted that his doctors have cleared him to campaign and that voters can see for themselves that he's ready to serve if elected by witnessing him on the campaign trail.



But Bartiromo asked Oz, “How is he gonna make decisions about Pennsylvania and fight for the Pennsylvanian people if, in fact, he needs to have a device alongside him?

""So is this just all the time he needs that device, or is it just during an interview? I don’t understand,” she said.

""No one knows,"" Oz responded. ""We’ve not been actually exposed to this before. It’s the first in-person interview, here we are, less than a month before the election. And I’ve been asking John Fetterman to answer questions on the campaign trail. Initially he wasn’t even on the campaign trail for the first couple months. But answer questions from voters, answer questions from reporters while you’re actually campaigning. That’s what we normally do in a democracy.""



He continued, ""The concern, of course, is if you don’t ever leave your home and answer questions, we don’t know the answers to the questions you’re asking. But I don’t think there’s closed captioning on the floor of the Senate, and maybe he doesn’t need closed-captioning when he’s actually moving around. But maybe he does. Again, lot of question marks, and voters deserve better.""

Oz and Fetterman are scheduled to meet on the debate stage on Oct. 25, just two weeks before Election Day on Nov. 8. Fetterman has requested a closed-captioning device to understand the debate questions.

"Man attacked a woman with a hammer, shot her in the face and then abducted her 10-year-old daughter, police say","A California woman was attacked by a stranger with a hammer and was shot in the face before he tried to abduct her 10-year-old daughter, police said.

The harrowing incident unfolded at about 10:30 p.m. on Sunday in Palmdale, a city about 60 miles north of Los Angeles. A man approached a woman at her apartment, saying that he needed help because he was being followed, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

She refused to allow him into her apartment, and that's when police said he tried to attack her with a hammer.

She tried to retrieve her handgun from her bedroom but was allegedly overpowered by the assailant who then shot her in the face with her own gun.

""Once he shot her, he dragged her out the house and that's how she got downstairs,"" said one resident to KABC-TV. ""Once she got downstairs, she was able to get away from him.""

At that point, he allegedly ran off with the daughter of the woman. The woman's husband tried to follow him, but he reportedly pointed his gun at him.

Police found the suspect several blocks later and said that he was pointing the gun at the head of the daughter. They were able to apprehend him and save the girl.

Investigators said the mother did not know the man before the incident, but residents of the apartments claimed they had seen him before and that some believed he was her ex-boyfriend.

The woman was hospitalized and is in stable condition, while her daughter was unharmed and was returned back to her family.

Neighbors said the area was very dangerous despite the apartments being gated.

Police later identified the man as 34-year-old Erin Mauldin. He was charged with attempted murder, kidnapping, and assault with a deadly weapon and was held on a $1 million bond.

Pat Benatar says she won't perform 'Hit Me With Your Best Shot' song out of deference to the victims of mass shootings,"Musician Pat Benatar said she refuses to perform her hit song ""Hit Me with Your Best Shot"" out of deference to the victims of mass shootings.

Benatar made the admission in an interview with USA Today while discussing why she chooses to cover other songs during her latest tour.

""And we’re not doing 'Hit Me with Your Best Shot,' and fans are having a heart attack. And I’m like, 'I’m sorry, in deference to the victims of the families of these mass shootings, I’m not singing it,'"" said Benatar.

""I tell them, 'If you want to hear the song, go home and listen to it.' (The title) is tongue-in-cheek, but you have to draw the line. I can’t say those words out loud with a smile on my face, I just can’t,"" she added.

""I’m not going to go on stage and soapbox – I go to my legislators – but that’s my small contribution to protesting,"" she continued. ""I’m not going to sing it. Tough.""

She also weighed in on her worries regarding the Supreme Court overturning the Roe vs. Wade abortion decision.

""I’m worried, like all of us, about fundamental autonomy rights. This is a slippery slope,"" she concluded. ""It’s not about abortion for me. I’m concerned that people are not paying attention to what this actually means.""

Benatar previously penned a feminist anthem in order to protest the election of former President Donald Trump.

The Rolling Stones made a similar decision when they stopped playing their very popular song, ""Brown Sugar."" The song is intended to document the horrors of the slave trade, but the tone of the lyrics is too celebratory.

Benatar is featured in the docuseries ""Women Who Rock"" by Epix, airing at the end of July. She is also going to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame later this year.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/palmdale-kidnapping-shooting-10yearold,2022-07-21
'Patriot Barbie' shows up to school board meeting in cat costume to troll transgender board member who 'wears his deceased wife's clothing',"An Arizona mom spoke at a local school board meeting dressed as a cat to point out the ridiculousness of so-called transgenderism in general and to direct public attention to one particular school board member, who identifies as transgender.

Lindsey Graham, who hosts a conservative podcast called ""Patriot Barbie,"" showed up at a Liberty Elementary School Board meeting some time last month dressed up in a cat costume, complete with ears, a printed suit, and whiskers. When it was her turn to speak, she pretended to be a cat in much the same way that so-called transgender individuals pretend to be a member of the opposite sex.

""I'm a cat. Meow, meow. I'm not a woman dressed as a cat. I am a cat,"" Graham insisted.

But then she challenged fellow meeting attendees to admit the truth: ""How many of you believe and confess that I'm a cat? How many of you believe that your child or a child from this school would believe that I'm actually a cat?""

No one raised their hands, not even a board member who identifies as transgender. Paul Bixler, 72, began identifying as a woman after his wife passed away in 2017. He still goes by the first name ""Paul.""

""I don't think I've changed at all,"" Bixler told a news outlet last summer. ""I think I am who I am. And I think I've always been who I am. And so my parents named me Paul. I've always liked being Paul. Paul Bixler's had a really good life.""

Graham — no relation to the male Republican senator from South Carolina, who shares the same name — does not accept Bixler's supposed gender transition. She appeared on Fox News' ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" on Tuesday to criticize Bixler's attempt at feminine cosplay.

""He’s a man, he’s very clearly a man,"" Graham noted.

""The only thing he does to identify as a female is put lipstick on,"" she continued. ""He grew his hair out a little bit, and he wears his deceased wife’s clothing to school, to sporting events, to school events to fundraisers, school events in front of the children.""





Graham stated that people like Bixler, who insist they're a member of the opposite sex, have a ""mental illness"" which can confuse impressionable school children.



""[S]omeone with this kind of mental illness can enjoy that mental illness all they want in the comfort of their home,"" Graham argued. ""But when you put them in charge of children, we’re talking about a new type of indoctrination, and that’s what’s really terrifying, is seeing these people in charge of our kids' education.""

Bixler — who spent decades as a teacher, coach, and principal in both Arizona and Texas — was never actually elected to the Liberty Elementary School District Governing Board, which oversees eight schools in the metropolitan Phoenix area. He was appointed to it in 2021, when the election was canceled. His current term ends in 2024.

For many years, Graham lived in Oregon but moved to Arizona after the Oregon state government attempted to shut down her beauty salon in 2020 and then fined her $14,000 when she refused to comply. She sued the state for $100,000. She then moved to Arizona and penned a book, entitled ""TARGETED: One Mom's Fight for Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness,"" about that experience.

""[O]bviously, you can’t just identify as whatever you want and demand that other people identify you as whatever you want,"" she told Watters.

""This is elementary school, so these are young vulnerable minds,"" she added. ""The teachers, the rest of the school board are identifying [Bixler] as 'Ms.' while he’s talking in just the deepest manly voice that he was born with. And so to see these parents take no responsibility for the education of these kids and to teach them true right and wrong and true biology and true facts and science and truths is just so alarming that we have this in the school system.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pat-benatar-mass-shooting-song,2022-12-15
"Paul Whelan speaks out, expresses frustration with Biden for not securing his freedom: 'I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here'","Detained American Paul Whelan expressed frustration on Thursday that President Joe Biden has not done more to secure his release from a Russian prison.

Hours after the U.S. government announced Brittney Griner had been freed in a controversial prisoner swap, Whelan spoke with CNN from the high-security penal colony where he is imprisoned in eastern Russia.

""I am greatly disappointed that more has not been done to secure my release, especially as the four-year anniversary of my arrest is coming up,"" Whelan said.

At the announcement of Griner's release, Biden claimed Russia is treating Whelan's case differently, and, according to CNN, Russia is refusing to negotiate Whelan's release. But according to Whelan, he was told negotiations had been moving in the right direction.

""I was led to believe that things were moving in the right direction and that the governments were negotiating and that something would happen fairly soon,"" he told CNN.

""I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here,"" he exclaimed.

The prisoner for whom Russia exchanged Griner is Viktor Bout — otherwise known as ""the Merchant of Death"" — a notorious international arms dealer who was imprisoned in the U.S. for conspiring to kill Americans and for providing material aid to a terrorist organization. The seriousness of Bout's crimes is precisely why Whelan, and most people for that matter, had believed Bout would be traded for Whelan.

Whelan has maintained his innocence.

""It’s quite obvious that I’m being held hostage,"" Whelan told CNN.

What do US officials say?

Government officials say that Moscow offered an ultimatum: Take home Griner in exchange for Bout or take home no one.

""This was not a situation where we had a choice of which American to bring home. It was a choice between bringing home one particular American — Brittney Griner — or bringing home none,"" a senior Biden administration official told CNN.

Whelan, a decorated former U.S. Marine, was arrested in December 2018 while visiting Moscow. He was later convicted of espionage, charges the U.S. claims are a sham, and sentenced to 16 years in a Russian prison.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/patriot-barbie-shows-up-to-school-board-meeting-in-cat-costume-to-troll-transgender-board-member-who-wears-his-deceased-wife-s-clothing,2022-12-08
Pelosi says Biden should run for reelection in 2024: 'He has a great record to run on',"On Sunday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told ABC's ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos that President Biden should run for reelection in 2024.



When asked by Stephanopoulos if she believes Biden should seek a second term, Pelosi replied, ""Yes, I do. I mean, President Biden has been a great president for our country. He has accomplished so much.""

Pelosi praised Biden for creating 10 million jobs by working with the private sector and moving America toward semiconductor independence by passing the CHIPS Act.

She also applauded Biden's passing policies ""with justice, with equity, with inclusiveness, with diversity, taking us to a new place.""

""He's put money in people's pockets, vaccines in their arms, children back to school, people back to work, for starters, creating 10 million jobs,"" Pelosi stated. ""He has been a great president, and he has a great record to run on.""

On Sunday, Stephanopoulos also asked Pelosi if she thought former President Donald Trump announcing a presidential bid for 2024 would be ""good news for Democrats.""

""I think it's bad news for the country,"" Pelosi replied. ""He's not been a force for good. So, I don't think his candidacy is a force for good for our country.""

In a September press conference, reporters asked Pelosi if Biden should run for reelection, but she refused to answer.

""He did a great service to our country. He defeated Donald Trump, let's not forget that,"" Pelosi replied. ""I'm not going into politics about whether the president should run.""

During a Wednesday press conference, Biden told reporters, ""Our intention is to run again.""

The White House has not made an official announcement that Biden will be seeking a second term. Biden speculated that a final decision would be announced next year.

""I think everybody wants me to run, but we're going to have discussions about it,"" Biden stated. ""I hope Jill and I get a little time to sneak away for a week between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and my guess is it will be early next year when we make that judgment.""

RootsAction, a progressive organization that supported Biden's 2020 election, recently launched a nationwide ""Don't Run Joe"" campaign to pressure the president not to seek a second term.

Pentagon formally ends COVID vaccine mandate for troops,"The Pentagon has formally rescinded its vaccine mandate, which coerced over two million troops into receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and forced nearly 8,400 service members out of the U.S. military.

Although both Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and President Joe Biden wanted to keep the mandate in place, Republicans made sure that the National Defense Authorization Act wouldn't pass without its elimination.

Austin forced to end forced vaccinations

Austin circulated a memo to senior Pentagon leaders Tuesday, stating that while the Department of Defense ""will continue to promote and encourage COVID-19 vaccination for all Service members,"" troops are no longer explicitly required to get shots or boosters.



The defense secretary originally announced the mandate in 2021, penalizing all service members who resisted.

Austin wrote, ""Section 525 of the NDAA for FY 2023 requires me to rescind the mandate that members of the Armed Forces be vaccinated against COVID-19, issued in my August 24, 2021 memorandum, 'Mandatory Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination of Department of Defense Service Members.' I hereby rescind that memorandum.""



In addition to no longer being forced to take the vaccine against their wills, troops will no longer be segregated ""on the basis of their refusal to receive the COVID-19 vaccination if they sought an accommodation on religious, administrative, or medical grounds.""

Soldiers' requests for exemptions and resulting letters of reprimand will be stricken from their records.

Although tens of thousands of service members who sought medical exemptions faced extreme obstacles, Austin retroactively claimed that ""service members have the right to observe the tenets of their religion or to observe no religion at all.""

While vaccinations are no longer mandatory, the Pentagon memo made clear that commanders can continue to discriminate on the basis of immunization status, particularly when ""making deployment, assignment, and other operational decisions, including when vaccination is required for travel to, or entry into, a foreign nation.""

Austin indicated that those soldiers who were kicked out of the service over their refusal to be vaccinated may be eligible for a general discharge, if ousted on under otherwise honorable conditions. To this end, former service members must ""petition their Military Department's Discharge Review Boards and Boards for Correction of Military or Naval Records to individually request a correction to their personnel records.""

Defense Department records indicate that 3,717 Marines, 1,816 soldiers, and 2,064 sailors were discharged for refusing the vaccine, reported Reuters.

Republican Sens. Ron Johnson (Wis.), Ted Cruz (Texas) and others had proposed that military members who had been discharged for refusing the vaccine would be reinstated, reported CNN. However, this amendment to the defense bill in the Senate did not pass.

Republican victory

National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in late 2022 that ""Secretary Austin's been very clear that he opposes the repeal of that vaccine mandate, and the president actually concurs with the secretary that we need to continue to believe that all Americans, including those in the armed forces, should be vaccinated and boosted for COVID 19.""



""The president supports Secretary Austin and the opposition to a repeal of the mandate,"" added Kirby.

Biden's opinion evidently had no bearing on Republicans' subsequent actions.

The Hill reported that 21 Republican governors, led by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, along with 13 GOP Senate lawmakers, urged leaders in Congress to repeal the mandate ""either through the National Defense Authorization Act or a standalone bill.""

Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) said, ""Congress should take action, and we’re taking action today by saying we will not vote to get on the NDAA – the defense authorization bill – unless we have a vote on ending this military vaccine mandate.""

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) stated on Dec. 4 that the NDAA would ""not move"" unless the military vaccine requirement was lifted.



House Democrats conceded in order to pass the 4,000-page bill. Biden signed it into law on Dec. 23, giving the DOD 30 days to drop the mandate.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) tweeted on Tuesday, ""One of the worst policy decisions affecting military readiness is finally over.""

Massie had previously introduced a resolution prohibiting any requirement that a member of the Armed Forces receive a COVID-19 vaccination.

Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Co.) called the repeal a ""HUGE victory,"" and suggested that ""it's time to make it right for the people whose lives were destroyed by this disgraceful mandate!""

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) concurred, calling on Defense Secretary Austin to ""take every step necessary to undo the harm done to service members and their families when they were forcibly discharged.""

Austin claimed that the DOD's ""COVID-19 vaccination efforts will leave a lasting legacy.""

"'Pervert' teacher, perhaps still under investigation for allegedly sexually harassing students at NYC high school, changes name and now teaches at another area school","One New York City teacher who has been accused of sexually harassing students at one local high school has since changed his name and joined the staff of another area school — at the recommendation of the city Department of Education.

According to the New York Post, Gabriel Mitey, 28, who previously taught social studies at the Lower Manhattan Arts Academy, now goes by Gabriel Torres and is teaching algebra and earth science at the Professional Performing Arts School in Midtown Manhattan, a school serving grades 6-12 and described by the Post as ""highly coveted.""

While Mitey was still at LoMA, several students reported seeing a photo of him posted to Snapchat. In the photo, Mitey is naked except for a towel loosely covering his groin. Several students who followed Mitey copied the image and shared it with others, according to the Post.

In addition to the disturbing Snapchat photo, at least two students reported that Mitey had behaved inappropriately with them. One male student, who is believed to have graduated from LoMA in 2020, reported that Mitey began flirting with him via text message after his AP government class went remote during the COVID shutdown.

""I could tell that he was flirting, it was very much flirting. He had an ulterior motive,"" said the unnamed former student. ""I felt so uncomfortable going to his Zoom classes.""

The student also alleged that after graduation, Mitey suggested the student come over to his apartment for a social — and possibly romantic — visit.

""He wanted to show me a book. We could have coffee at his place, maybe food. He basically asked me on a date,"" the student said.

The student claimed he rejected the invitation.

Another black female student, Jolissa Jones, alleged that Mitey invited her to read a selection on Galileo. He wanted to videotape the reading for a master's class and asked her to struggle with the passage deliberately and ""act mad."" She also claimed that he asked her to delete their Snapchat conversations, which also allegedly contained flirtatious messages. ""Chat has got to disappear,"" he supposedly told her.

LoMA did remove Mitey from the school for a time. When it attempted to reinstate him, both parents and students complained loudly.

""We don’t want any pervert teachers,"" one LoMA dad said.

Derek Premo, the LoMA principal who may have protected Mitey, has since resigned amid his own allegations of sexual harassment.

In all, the Special Commissioner of Investigation for city schools received five complaints about Mitey between 2020 and 2021. Three of those cases were closed and two were referred to the city DOE. Despite these investigations, the DOE allegedly recommended Mitey for the special education vacancy at PPAS.

PPAS principal Kevin Ryan and a guidance counselor confirmed that ""Mr. Torres"" and Mitey are the same person after one parent recognized his photo. However, Ryan then reportedly told concerned parents that he was unaware of Mitey's troubling history during the hiring process. Ryan further added that ""Torres"" ""came highly recommended"" to him from the DOE, parents said.

""[Ryan] feels the DOE played him,"" one father stated.

The Post reported that the SCI has not released any of its findings regarding Mitey, and the DOE has refused to comment on the cases against him, even to determine whether any of them remain active. A teacher named G. Torres is still listed on the PPAS website.

It is unclear whether Mitey has legally changed his name to Torres.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pentagon-formally-ends-covid-vaccine-mandate-for-troops,2022-10-31
That animal shelter that won't allow pro-gun people to adopt pets? PETA is having none of it: 'What counts is that adopted animals are treated well',"People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has taken issue with a controversial California animal shelter that refuses to let pro-gun people adopt its pets, Fox News reported.

What's the background?

TheBlaze previously reported on the Shelter Hope Pet Shop in Thousand Oaks and its strict policies against working with certain Second Amendment backers.

""We do not support those who believe that the 2nd amendment gives them the right to buy assault weapons. If your beliefs are not in line with ours, we will not adopt a pet to you,"" the shelter states. ""If you lie about being a NRA supporter, make no mistake, we will sue you for fraud. If you believe that it is our responsibility to protect ourselves in public places and arm ourselves with a gun -- do not come to us to adopt a dog.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

The shelter adds that ""if you are pro guns and believe that no background check is necessary, then do not come to us to adopt. We will grill you before you even get an appointment and visit our rescue. If we ask you 'do you care about children being gunned down in our schools?' If you hesitate, because your core belief is that you believe teachers need to carry firearms, then you will not get approved to adopt from us. If you foster for us and believe in guns, please bring our dogs and/or cats back, or we will arrange to have them picked up. Shelter Hope Pet Shop in no way will continue to operate if we are even remotely part of the problem. We support teachers, children, and businesses who provide services to the public, but we've had enough of all the senseless killing.""

What did PETA say?

Catie Cryar, assistant manager of PETA, told Fox News that the animal rights organization knows Shelter Hope does ""good work"" and is ""sure"" it has ""the best intentions, but from PETA’s perspective, because there is a homeless animal crisis, what counts is that adopted animals are treated well and cared for and that is the criteria we feel is important.""



'Fine, keep your money'

Shelter founder Kim Sill told NBC News some people have threatened to stop donating money if she doesn't drop the gun control inquiry from the pet adoption screening process.



""I say, fine, keep your money,"" Sill shot back, according to the network. ""If I go out of business, as a result, I go out of business. But I have to do something. And this is the only thing I can do to make the point that mass killings by people armed with guns have to stop.""

Kim Sill Image source: YouTube screenshot

Sill — who's also an actress — added to Fox News that she's well within her right to discriminate against the pro-gun crowd.

""Adoption facilities like mine turn people down for all kinds of reasons,"" Sill told the cable network. ""They can turn you down for the kind of dog food you tell them you're going to use on that dog you want, or the kind of cat litter. I mean, seriously, we are a private nonprofit, and we pride ourselves in trying to find the absolute best homes for the dogs and cats that we can.""

She continued telling Fox News that ""adding this question about gun control, I guess, has stirred up the conversation with those who don't believe that they should even have to tell me what their situation is. So I think that's the deal-breaker for most of them.""

Sill added to the cable network that ""your views on guns are relevant because, God forbid if you have a stroke, and your wife calls me up and tells me to come to your house and get the dog, I might not feel safe coming to your house, knowing that you are very radically opposed to me thinking it's not okay for an 18-year-old to have a gun.""

She added to Fox News that she's received hundreds of death threats about the new policy but said she forgives them.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pervert-teacher-perhaps-still-under-investigation-for-allegedly-sexually-harassing-students-at-nyc-high-school-changes-name-and-now-teaches-at-another-area-school,2022-06-17
Peter Doocy leaves new WH press secretary stumped with single question he is forced to ask three times,"Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy left White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stumbling on her first official day behind the lectern after Jen Psaki's departure.

The topic? Inflation and President Joe Biden's claim that raising corporate taxes will help the ongoing economic crisis.

What happened?

Referring to a tweet that Biden published last week, Doocy lobbed a softball question at Jean-Pierre, ""How does raising taxes on corporations reduce inflation?""

But the new press secretary appeared unaware that such a tweet from Biden existed, asking if Doocy was, in fact, referring to a specific tweet.

When Doocy informed her that Biden's official Twitter account made such a connection between corporate taxes and inflation last week, Jean-Pierre stumbled her way through recycling Democratic talking points about taxes and corporations paying their ""fair share.""

Look, you know, we have talked about — we have talked about this this past year, about making sure that the wealthiest among us are paying their fair share. And that is important to do. And that is something that, you know, the president has been, you know, working on every day when we talk about inflation and lowering costs. And so it’s very important that, you know, as we’re seeing costs rise, as we’re talking about how to, you know — you know, build an America that is safe, that’s equal for everyone, and doesn’t leave anyone behind, that is an important part of that as well.

05/16/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

Because Jean-Pierre did not answer the question, Doocy then asked again, ""But how does raising taxes on corporations lower the cost of gas, the cost of a used car, the cost of food for everyday Americans?""

This time Jean-Pierre invoked climate change and collective bargaining rights while injecting several mentions of a ""fairer tax code,"" but she still did not answer the question.

""Look, it is — you know, by not — if — without having a fairer tax code, which is what I’m talking about, then all — every — like manufacturing workers, cops — you know, it’s not fair for them to have to pay higher taxes than the folks that — who are — who are — who are not paying taxes at all or barely have,"" Jean-Pierre added.

Doocy then asked his question a third time and included criticism from Jeff Bezos. But Jean-Pierre, again, refused to answer the question and instead attacked Bezos and regurgitated debunked talking points about deficit reduction.

""It’s not a huge mystery why one of the wealthiest individuals on Earth — right? — opposes an economic agenda that is for the middle class, that cuts some of the biggest costs families face, fights inflation for the long haul — right? — and that’s what we’re talking about; that’s why we’re talking about lowering inflation here — and adds to the historic deficit reduction the president is achieving by asking the richest taxpayers and corporations to pay their fair share. That is what we’re talking about,"" she said.

Anything else?

Larry Summers, who has been highly critical of the Biden administration amid the inflation crisis, explained Monday that he actually agrees with Biden that hiking corporate taxes would positively impact inflation.

""I think @JeffBezos is mostly wrong in his recent attack on the @JoeBiden Admin,"" Summers declared. ""It is perfectly reasonable to believe, as I do and @POTUS asserts, that we should raise taxes to reduce demand to contain inflation and that the increases should be as progressive as possible.""

He added, ""I say this even though I have argued vigorously that excessively expansionary macro policy from the @federalreserve and the government have contributed to inflation.

Crooks take off without victim's SUV.","A Saint Joseph's University student who refused to give up his keys Tuesday night to a pair of carjackers in the Overbrook section of Philadelphia fought them and ended up getting shot in the knee and hit in the head with a gun, WPVI-TV reported.

The carjackers got away — but without the student's SUV, the station said.

What are the details?

The student — whose 21st birthday is Wednesday — was returning home from campus and had just pulled up to his apartment on Upland Way by Drexel Road in his blue Subaru Outback around 10:40 p.m., WPVI said.

Two masked men then exited a dark-colored minivan — possibly a Dodge Caravan — along the dark, tree-lined street and approached the student, Capt. John Walker told WCAU-TV. The pair also were wearing black hooded sweatshirts, WPVI said.

They announced the robbery to the student, who had just exited his vehicle, WPVI added, and the suspects tried to take the student's keys and get into his vehicle.

But the student fought back, Walker told WCAU.

The student was struck in the head with a handgun, Walker added to WCAU, and at least one of the would-be carjackers fired two shots, striking the student in the knee.

Police told WCAU the suspects got back in the minivan and fled toward Woodbine Avenue.

However, authorities added to KYW-TV that the suspects had the victim’s keys to his vehicle.

The victim was taken to Lankenau Medical Center in stable condition, WPVI said.

Investigators are checking for surveillance video, WCAU added.

Anything else?

Walker told WPVI police haven't seen similar crimes in the area.

""It's a relatively quiet area of Overbrook Farms, no instances here, just concerned obviously because this kid was at the school this evening, coming home ... for the rest of the evening,"" he added to the station. ""He had an event at the school in the morning, and he gets shot over the course of this attempted carjacking.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/peter-doocy-stumps-jean-pierre-inflation,2022-06-22
Phone scammer nabbed after threatening the wrong elderly couple. The husband happened to be a former FBI and CIA director.,"A phone scammer from Jamaica who made his living ripping off and threatening elderly couples was nabbed recently after targeting the wrong victims, KSAZ-TV reported this week.

William and Lynda Webster aren't your typical elderly couple. William was a longtime public official who formerly served as the director of both the CIA and FBI. In fact, he's the only person ever to have held both positions.

So when a phone scammer called him and his wife making outrageous claims — and later, threats — the Websters knew their rights and how to protect themselves.

They compiled evidence against the scammer and informed federal authorities, who tracked the caller to Jamaica. Later, when the scammer foolhardily entered the U.S. on a trip, agents were there to arrest him. Now, the Websters hope their story will help others put a stop to scammers, too.

In an interview with the local news outlet, Lynda Webster recounted, ""A scammer identified himself as David and called back repeatedly and told my husband he had won $72 million in a scam.""

In response, she flatly refused to send any money and warned the scammer never to call back. But instead of taking her advice, the scammer allegedly persisted. He even started to make violent threats against her and her husband.

""He said he would kill me, kill my husband, he was going to burn our house down and that our white brick house would look lovely with the brains of my head on the wall,"" Lynda recalled.

Thankfully, William said, ""we had a lot of cooperation from the FBI, so that made things easier."" It's also not every day that a scammer goes to such lengths as to make death threats.

The couple is now hoping to raise awareness about the prevalence of financial fraud schemes targeting elderly Americans. It's a growing number. According to the FBI's most recent Elder Fraud Report, in 2021, more than 92,000 victims were targeted, for total losses of approximately $1.7 billion.

That latter number is up a whopping 74% from 2020.

Lynda added that everyone can take part in helping to prevent such egregious fraud from occurring.

""You don't want to spy on Mom and Dad and Grandpa, but you kind of have to. You have to listen to the other end of the phone, peek at the mail and the checkbook occasionally,"" she told the outlet.

The FBI notes that elderly victims of fraud can report financial fraud by calling the National Elder Fraud Hotline at 1-833-FRAUD-11 (1-833-372-8311).",https://www.theblaze.com/news/philly-college-student-fights-carjackers,2022-05-17
"Frightening photos of Alabama prisoner go viral, but state DOC claims he won't cooperate with medical advice","The family of a prisoner in Alabama has taken to social media to share photos which they say demonstrate that the state Department of Corrections has neglected his health. However, the ADOC has since released other information which suggests the man may have defied the recommendations of those treating him.

Kastello Vaughan, aka Kastellio, 32, has been housed at Elmore Correctional Facility since July 2019, serving a 20-year sentence for first-degree robbery, breaking into a vehicle, and several other crimes he committed in Baldwin and Mobile counties. Family members visited him on July 24 of this year, at which time his sister Kassie Vaughan claimed he appeared ""in good condition."" However, they say that they recently received alarming photos which indicate that his health has deteriorated rapidly of late. They visited him again on Sunday and said they are now convinced that prison officials have neglected his care.

""He's looking terrible,"" said another sister, Kascie Vaughan, twin sister of Kassie. ""Just one word: terrible. He's feeling weak in spirit. He's really just, he's really feeling low. He doesn't look like Kastellio, the brother that we know.""

Kassie Vaughan shared the disturbing images on Facebook, and they have since gone viral. Kastello Vaughan's lawyers — Lee Merritt, Harry Daniels, and Ben Crump — claim that he has lost 75 lbs. in less than a month. He also has difficulty walking, they say, and must wear absorbent undergarments, which a fellow prisoner must help him change.





In another post, Kassie Vaughan wrote that her brother's feet are still discolored and ""swollen"" to ""the size of footballs,"" and that he ""is scared to lose his legs and his life."" She, other family members, and his legal team say they remain ""deeply concerned about his safety in that prison.""

However, the ADOC has released a statement claiming that Kastello Vaughan has been given ""a constitutional level [of] care,"" but that he has not followed the advice of doctors and nurses. Officials claim that he has received medical attention at least 11 times since July 30, including surgery for a bowel obstruction on August 5. This bowel obstruction, the statement asserted, was a continued complication stemming from a gunshot wound he sustained previously.

However, the statement continued, Vaughan discharged himself ""Against Medical Advice"" five days later. After he was treated again for the same issue on September 3, the ADOC said Vaughan once again discharged himself AMA four days later and then ""refused all medication.""

""The ADOC offers medical assessment and treatment to all inmates but does not force them to accept that care,"" the statement concluded.

Kassie Vaughan dismissed that statement as ""A LIE"" on Facebook and denied that her brother ever signed a waiver to release his medical records, as the ADOC claimed in its statement. She asserted that he ""is not in the correct mental state to sign anything.""

On her brother's behalf, Kassie Vaughan also reportedly created a GoFundMe account, which has already raised nearly $51,000 for further legal expenses.

""It doesn't matter what Kastellio did, why he was in jail,"" said his attorney Harry Daniels. ""Doesn't matter. As society as a whole, as human beings, we have a duty to one another. It doesn't matter what that person is imprisoned for.

""We need this man to get well, all right. We need him to get help. That's not asking for a whole lot.""

"Video: Pickaxe-wielding woman smashes neighbor's windows while grandmother inside saves newborn moments before glass shatters over bassinet – and attacker warns, 'I'll be back, get out'","On Monday afternoon in a Pasadena neighborhood, a 65-year-old woman wearing a flowing gown while wielding a pickaxe is captured on home security cameras shattering the front windows of her neighbor's home. The bizarre attack nearly injured a 6-week-old baby inside the home asleep in a bassinet next to the windows.



The homeowner, Arman Tchoukadarian, told KTLA that his mother-in-law was babysitting his newborn daughter when the terrifying event occurred. He explained that the grandmother was able to quickly grab the baby just moments before the woman smashed the window above the bassinet.

""If my mother-in-law didn't act as fast as she did, my daughter wouldn't be here,"" Tchoukadarian said.

The 65-year-old attacker caught on home security cameras was identified as Beverly Baker. She returned to the home several times over a few-minute period to cause more damage to the home.

""She broke one window, went back,"" Tchoukadarian said. ""My mother-in-law came out screaming and yelling to get my attention.""

At one point, Baker can be heard on the security camera footage stating, ""Questions? Questions, anyone? I'll be back, get out."" The woman then leaves the property and heads back toward her home a few blocks away, where she was later arrested.

Investigators said they believe Baker may be suffering from mental health issues.

""She needs to be in the right place, getting the right help,"" Tchoukadarian said. ""That's no excuse to go attack someone's family, attack someone's newborn and ruin their dream home, and ruin their life and sanity.""

According to the homeowner, when police found Baker, she seemed ""nonchalant"" and was ""walking with a pickaxe on her back.""

Baker refused to surrender to authorities for approximately 30 minutes but was eventually taken into custody and charged with felony vandalism.

""I feel like we lost our safe place,"" Tchoukadarian stated. He told KTLA that his family was traumatized by the incident and estimated that Baker caused approximately $20,000 in property damage to his home.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/photos-of-ala-inmate-go-viral-adoc-pushes-back,2022-10-26
Media explode over promotional video for Piers Morgan interview with Trump. Then Trump releases proof it was deceptively edited.,"Piers Morgan generated controversy Wednesday after publishing a promotional video for a recently recorded interview with Donald Trump that appeared to show the former president storming out of the interview.

However, Trump released audio showing that the promotional video for the interview was deceptively edited.

What happened?

Morgan interviewed Trump for his new show ""Piers Morgan Uncensored."" The interview is set to air next Monday.

Calling the interview the ""most explosive"" of the year, the promotional video stitched together various cuts from the interview that framed Trump as unhinged when Morgan challenged his claims about the 2020 election.

""Morgan vs. Trump,"" the narrator declares as the video shows Trump standing up from his chair and telling producers to ""turn the camera off"" while huffing, ""Very dishonest."" The montage included close-ups of Trump's sweaty face and dramatic background music.

But what really happened?

The video predictably spread like wildfire because it seemingly confirmed the media's caricature of Trump.

However, Morgan and his production crew were not the only people who recorded in the interview. In fact, Trump's team saved an audio recording of the interview in its entirety, which paints a much different picture from the one presented by Morgan.

According to NBC News, the interview ended cordially (friendly, even). Morgan said, ""That was a great interview,"" a comment Trump affirmed. Morgan then said, ""Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.""

Only after Morgan's concluding remark of gratitude did Trump say, ""Turn the camera off.""

Meanwhile, Trump's remark that Morgan was being ""very dishonest"" was related to his refusal to honor the time that Trump agreed to for the interview. Trump communications director Taylor Budowich told NBC News the interview was expected to last just 20 minutes — but Morgan asked questions for more than one hour.





Trump released a statement late Wednesday blasting Morgan.

""Piers Morgan, like the rest of the Fake News Media, attempted to unlawfully and deceptively edit his long and tedious interview with me. He wanted to make it look like I walked out on the interview when my time limit of 20 minutes went over by an hour,"" Trump said.

The former president added, ""[Morgan] went out of his way to deceptively edit an interview and got caught.""

Morgan responded to Trump's statement early Thursday morning by ignoring the fact that his promotional video was deceptively edited.

""Morning, Mr President! It was a great interview, thanks for all your time. Sorry you got so annoyed that I don’t believe the 2020 election was rigged or stolen from you, but as I said, where’s your proof? If you have it, show us — or accept the result and move on,"" Morgan said.

"Video shows SWAT team raiding Pittsburgh vacation rental during filming of rap video, 4 people arrested","A SWAT team raided a vacation rental home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and arrested 4 people during the filming of a rap video.

WPXI-TV reported that a warrant suspect was spotted on a deck at about 1:30 a.m. Monday and ran into the house where a rap video was being filmed during a party. He refused to come out of the home, and police believed that there were other warrant suspects in the home as well as weapons, so they called in a SWAT team.

The owner of the vacation rental spoke to WTAE-TV and released video from his Ring camera showing the SWAT team raiding the house.

The video shows 7 women leaving the residence during the raid. They were identified and released.

Police identified four males they arrested as 18-year-old Ricardo Crosby, 19-year-old Asaun Porter, 21-year-old Kelshon Lovelace, and 18-year-old Lawrence Strothers Jr. They were transported to Allegheny County Jail.

They indicated that the suspects were arrested based on previous warrants related to multiple charges including attempted homicide, firearms violations, and juvenile probation violations.

Investigators said more than a dozen weapons were confiscated at the residence following a search warrant.

""I believe they were using those weapons as part of the staging for the video they were shooting as well as the contents at the property, it was all to stage a music video,"" said the owner to WTAE.

The owner said he didn't want to be identified to protect the marketability of his property.

""It's very unfortunate because we work very hard to avoid any type of issues like this,"" he said.

He also said that the person who rented his property did so under an assumed name and violated the terms of the vacation rental.

No shots were fired during the raid, and no one was injured according to WTAE.

In April, a mass shooting at an AirBnB rental injured 11 people and killed two others. The company condemned the incident and said that parties were strictly banned from the rental platform.

Here's the video of the SWAT raid on the rap video:

Pizza restaurant worker learns unforgettable lesson after telling police officers to leave restaurant,"A San Francisco pizza joint fired one of its employees this week for telling police officers dining at the restaurant that they were not welcome to eat there.

On Sunday, several police officers entered the Pizza Squared restaurant in downtown San Francisco. But, according to the San Francisco Police Officers Association, one of the restaurant's employees told the officers they had to leave because ""they were not welcome in the restaurant.""

SFPOA President Tracy McCray told KTVU-TV that officers had frequented the restaurant but had never encountered such anti-police ""bigotry.""

The restaurant's owners — Christina and Ryan Siu — took swift action, firing the employee who had only been on the job for days.

""This employee was a trainee & on his third day. When our shift manager told us about the incident after it happened, we expressly told him we didn’t share his views & that he was out of line. He was fired at the end of the day. When we notified by SFPOA, we apologized,"" the restaurant wrote on Twitter.

In a complete statement, the owners explained:

Over the past weekend a trainee was working the counter when several San Francisco police officers patronized our store. Unbeknownst to us, the trainee mistreated the officers. We were since contacted by the Police Officers Association regarding the matter at which time we immediately gave our sincere apology for this unfortunate incident. The trainee was not hired because he was not a good fit. We at Pizza Squared want to make it abundantly clear that we would never refuse service to anyone based on their background, profession, race or gender. This is not political for us, we welcome anyone who comes through our doors with a smile.

The SFPOA praised the restaurant for taking immediate action and apologizing.

""We were pleased to receive an immediate response from the owners, including a sincere apology for their employee’s actions and a commitment to meet with the affected officers and make this unfortunate situation right,"" McCray said.

Poland will not take or pay for any more COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer,"Poland has informed the European Commission and the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer that it will no longer accept nor pay for any more COVID-19 vaccines for now, Poland's health minister said Tuesday.

The decision to stop taking vaccine doses will set up a legal battle under a supply contract the European Union has negotiated with vaccine manufacturers.

Poland and other EU member nations have been paying for and receiving vaccine doses under agreements between the European Union and vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer and Moderna. Pfizer is the chief supplier for Poland, Reuters reported.

Currently, the country has 25 million COVID-19 vaccines in storage and another 67 million to 70 million doses on order, according to the private news channel TVN24. But compared to other European nations, Poland has reported a below-average vaccine uptake. Just 59% of the country's 38 million people have been fully vaccinated, and only 31% have received a booster shot, below the EU average of 72.5% and nearly 53%, respectively.



As such, Poland's health minister said the country has a surplus of vaccine doses and does not intend to pay for any more.

""We asked both the European Commission and the main vaccine producing companies ... to spread these deliveries over 10 years and — most importantly — to pay when we receive vaccines,"" health minister Adam Niedzielski reportedly told TVN24 in an interview.

""Unfortunately, here we faced complete inflexibility on the part of the producers,” he said. “There was no way that we could seriously change the terms of this contract, and this contract was signed in a crisis situation.""

Niedzielski explained that Poland has triggered a clause in its legal agreement with the European Commission and Pfizer to stop taking additional vaccine doses.



""At the end of last week, we used the force majeure clause and informed both the European Commission and the main vaccine producer that we are refusing to take these vaccines at the moment and we are also refusing to pay,"" he said.



""Indeed, the consequence of this will be a legal conflict, which is already taking place,"" he added.



According to the health minister, Poland cannot directly terminate the contract with Pfizer because the agreement is between Pfizer and the European Commission.

Pfizer's contract to supply vaccine doses to Poland alone is worth more than 6 billion zlotys ($1.4 billion), with more than 2 billion zlotys spent on vaccines for 2022.

In a comment to Reuters, Pfizer said its contract to supply vaccines to EU member states is with the European Commission.

""Our discussions with Governments and the details of vaccine deliveries are confidential,"" Pfizer said.

European Commission health spokesman Stefan de Keersmaecker said Tuesday that member states were bound by contractual obligations to continue purchasing vaccines, but that the commission understands Poland's ""difficult position.""

""We continue to facilitate discussion between the Polish government and the company in order to find a pragmatic solution to this specific situation the country is confronted with,"" he said.

Niedzielski said that Poland and 10 other EU countries have petitioned the EU to loosen regulations on COVID-19 vaccine contracts to allow for flexibility to spend money on health care for refugees from the war between Russia and Ukraine.

""We, in particular, and I am talking about Poland here, currently have financial pressures related to the influx of refugees, so we also feel that, on the EU scale, we have a certain right to expect special instruments that will give us ... greater flexibility in the contracts,"" Niedzielski said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pizza-worker-fired-told-police-not-welcome,2022-04-19
Police bodycam video shows 4-year-old shoot cops,"Concerning bodycam video shows the moment a 4-year-old fired a gun at police as they were arresting his father at a McDonald's in Utah.

This week, the Unified Police Department released bodycam footage of the arrest of Sadaat Johnson, 27, during an incident around 1:30 p.m. on Feb. 21. McDonald's employees contacted police after Johnson allegedly brandished a gun in the drive-thru after his fast-food order was incorrect.

Police arrived on the scene and ordered Johnson to exit his white Honda Civic. Initially, Johnson refused to get out of the vehicle. He then cooperated with law enforcement and was physically extracted from the car by police officers.

Bodycam video shows police handcuffing Johnson.

Suddenly, an officer yells, ""Gun!"" Seconds later, a shot is fired from the car. A cop screams, ""Drop the gun!""

Another officer cautions, ""Kids! Kids! Kids! Kids!""

There were two children in the back of the car – a 3-year-old and a 4-year-old.

KTVX reported, ""The officer used his hand to sweep the gun away and the gun went off, hitting the upper part of the McDonald’s building. The officer then yelled at the person inside of the car to drop the gun, and after looking inside the car, realized that it was a small child.""

The police bodycam video shows the children crying as they exit the vehicle.

Police said the child told them, “I grabbed my dad’s gun and tried to shoot the police so he could be free and do what he wanted.”

The 4-year-old reportedly told police that he shot the gun because “he wanted his daddy back."" The child also informed police that during the altercation, Johnson told the children, ""The police officer cannot open the door.""

A preliminary investigation indicated that Johnson instructed his child to shoot at officers, according to police.

Johnson told authorities that this was not the first time his son had ""gotten a hold of his gun.""



Alexis Davis – Johnson's wife and the mother of their 4-year-old child – said in February, ""It kind of brought me to my knees because he put a loaded weapon in my 4-year-old's hand.""

Johnson told police that he ""blacked out"" for 30 seconds after he began arguing with the McDonald's employee over the fast-food order. Johnson denied brandishing the firearm, but surveillance video shows him doing so, according to court records.

In March, Johnson was charged with child abuse, aggravated assault, and interference with an arresting officer.

""To have an adult think it is okay to encourage a [4]-year-old to pull a firearm and shoot at police illustrates how out of hand the campaign against police has gotten,"" Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera said in February. ""This needs to stop and we need to come together as a community to find solutions to the challenges we face in our neighborhoods. Officers are here to protect and serve and we are beyond belief that something like [this] could happen.""

‘Put that sword down’: Bodycam footage captures intense moment police take down sword-wielding man accused of stabbing woman,"The Los Angeles Police Department released body camera footage from an incident that occurred Tuesday evening involving a man wielding a pair of swords accused of ruthlessly stabbing a woman.



The suspect, 23-year-old Eric Herrera, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 43-year-old woman suffered multiple stab wounds.

A family member identified the female victim as the suspect’s mother, KTLA reported. They also said Herrera had been troubled for some time and that an argument led to the gruesome attack.

Josh Gordon, a neighbor who witnessed the incident, told the L.A. Times that he heard the victim crying out for help and pleading with the suspect to stop the attack.

According to Gordon, who lives across the street from where the incident occurred, the victim said to the suspect, “I’m your mother.”

LAPD has not confirmed the relationship between Herrera and the victim.

“He did not seem to be in a lucid state,” Gordon stated about the suspect. “He was moving and walking slowly. My main concern was the woman’s safety. There was a real sense of helplessness watching it happen from across the street.”

Authorities received multiple calls about an assault with a deadly weapon. When law enforcement arrived on the scene around 11:20 p.m., they observed the suspect walking in the street holding a pair of swords.

Bodycam footage from the incident captured police telling the suspect to “put that sword down.” Officers repeatedly instructed the suspect to drop his weapons.

When the suspect refused to cooperate with the verbal commands, authorities used a Taser to restrain him and take the weapons.

At the same time, additional officers at the scene canvassed the area looking for the victim. When they found the woman, she was covered in blood. According to police, the victim suffered multiple lacerations to her arm.

While authorities rendered aid at the scene, the woman said that her daughter was still inside the house because she had instructed her to hide from the suspect. The victim stated that she believed her daughter was safe and had not been attacked by the suspect.

The victim was transported to a hospital, and a family member reported that the victim was in stable condition.

Eric Herrera was taken into custody, and his bail was set to $100,000, the LAPD reported on Thursday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-bodycam-video-utah-child,2022-10-21
Politico's founding editor calls for rewriting of Constitution to prevent 2024 Trump win,"Democrats' 2024 presidential prospects have been characterized as being ""increasingly bleak."" Among the many problems now facing the nation, the White House must contend with responsibility over a looming recession, an unprecedented border crisis, and a devastating opioid epidemic.

With the majority of the country disapproving of President Joe Biden's performance, 67% of voters sure the nation is headed in the wrong direction, and indications that former President Donald Trump may not only be able to win the GOP nomination but potentially the forthcoming presidential election as well, some liberals are contemplating extreme means to keep him off the ballot.

Politico editor versus the U.S. Constitution

John F. Harris, founding editor of the news site Politico, recently suggested in an op-ed that the same system that enabled Trump to get elected in 2016 and to four years later receive 7 million more votes than any sitting president in history must be changed.

Harris wrote that, on the one hand, Trump is ""an enemy of the Constitution."" Yet Harris also admitted that ""from a progressive perspective many of the most offensive features of his tenure were not in defiance of the Constitution.""

Despite presenting the former president as a ""constitutional menace,"" it is the Constitution and its ""problematic provisions"" that Harris intimated are the more menacing.



Harris called deference to the Constitution ""the indispensable foundation of American democracy,"" though suggested reverence would be going too far, particularly if it precludes Americans from drastically altering those foundations.

Harris argued ""a new constitutional consensus"" is needed in order to prevent Americans from voting for this candidate to whom he is personally opposed and to make progress ""on issues ranging from climate change to ensuring that technology giants act in the public interest.""

This consensus cannot be brought about just by stacking the Supreme Court with ""sympathetic justices,"" but by addressing ""more fundamental challenges embedded in the document itself — in particular the outsized power it gives to states, at a time when the most urgent problems and most credible remedies are national in character.""

The system as is will not provide the results so-called progressives desire, so a ""constitutional renovation"" is needed.

Extra to minimizing states rights, Harris observed an opportunity and need to ""clean up the infuriatingly murky language of the Second Amendment,"" to alter or abolish the Electoral College, and to impose ""term limits for the Court.""

The obstacles to the realization of the left's agenda are the result of, according to Harris, ""what progressives reasonably perceive as the infirmities of the Constitution.""

Harris likened the current moment to the latter part of the 19th century, drawing a parallel between former President Abraham Lincoln's abolishment of slavery in the Confederate states with progressives' potential elimination of America's ""outdated"" and ""intolerable"" Republican checks and balances.

He threatened that a refusal to transmogrify the Constitution to sate progressives' political ambitions might result in conflict — in civil war.



Harris ultimately claimed that improvisation (i.e., to the Constitution) would be one way to avoid kinetic civil strife. By abolishing the Electoral College and potentially securing the 2024 Democratic candidate a victory by way of the popular vote, war can be averted.

Sparing the demos a choice

Harris is not alone in looking for ways to bypass the electorate to ensure Trump is not elected in 2024.

Former Clinton campaign manager Dick Morris recently suggested that ""Democrats have given up opposing Trump politically ... They know he's going to run again, and they know that Republicans are probably going to win because the economy is in such terrible shape.""

Morris told NewsMax that one strategy they have adopted is to ""litigate him to death, persecution by prosecution.""

The August raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence and the corresponding classified documents investigation, E. Jean Carroll's defamation lawsuit, and New York Attorney General Letitia James' fraud lawsuit are three prongs of a broader litigious endeavor to take Trump down.

Earlier this summer, it was suggested in The Hill that testimonies given before the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, protests, could be used to justify the invocation of section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Accordingly, Trump would be formally accused of participation in an insurrection against the U.S. and disqualified from being president.

Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.), who sits on the committee, suggested earlier this year that the 14th Amendment might serve as ""a blockade for [Trump] ever being able to run for office again.""

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), the former DNC chair who publicly questioned the legitimacy of the 2016 presidential election, indicated she would ""continue to explore all legal paths to ensure that the people who tried to subvert our democracy are not in charge of it.""

If the 14th Amendment and the lawsuits aren't enough to keep the former president off the ballot, then Liz Cheney, who lost in a landslide to the Trump-backed Harriet Hageman, threatened to go so far as to deprive the Republican Party of her membership.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/police-command-suspect-drop-swords,2022-09-29
New poll shows how a Liz Cheney presidential run would 'single-handedly swing the election to Trump',"Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) confirmed last week that she is considering running for president in 2024.

But a new poll shows that if Cheney runs as an independent, her campaign would backfire and help former President Donald Trump if he is the Republican nominee against President Joe Biden.

What did Cheney say?

The day after her landslide primary loss to Republican Harriet Hageman, Cheney appeared on NBC's ""Today"" show and addressed rumors that she is eyeing the White House.

""That’s a decision that I’m going to make in the coming months. I’m not going to make any announcements here this morning,"" Cheney said.

""But it is something that I am thinking about, and I’ll make a decision in the coming months,"" she confirmed.

What does the poll show?

A new Yahoo News/YouGov poll released this week shows that if Cheney runs for president in 2024 as an independent — since she is making no friends in a Republican Party that continues to prop up Trump — she will help Trump win.

In fact, Yahoo News said Cheney would ""single-handedly swing the election to Trump.""

Specifically, the poll discovered that in a hypothetical matchup between Biden and Trump, Biden would win by three points, 42% to 39%; 20% of respondents said they are not sure who they would support.

But when Cheney is thrown into the race as an independent spoiler, Biden's re-election chances sink completely — and Trump is propelled to victory.

With Cheney in the race, Trump would win by eight points over Biden, 37% to 29%, while Cheney would secure 11% of support. Nearly one-quarter of respondents (23%), however, said they are unsure of who they would support in such a scenario.

The result makes sense because in theory, Cheney would siphon moderate voters who lean Republican from Biden but only support Biden because they refuse to vote for Trump. Thus supporting Cheney, who is an otherwise stalwart Republican, would be a conscience-acceptable vote for such Americans.

The Yahoo News/YouGov poll results confirm this thesis.

According to Yahoo News, ""a full 69% of Cheney’s support among registered voters comes from those who would otherwise support Biden on a two-way ballot. Just 15% comes from Trump supporters.""

"Video: College student wants to buy meal for homeless man, but Popeyes manager refuses to allow sale — and police are called on student","A Georgia State University student tried to buy a meal for a homeless man from an Atlanta Popeyes, but a manager at the fast-food restaurant refused to allow the sale — and police even were called on the student.

The GSU senior, Jo Ortega, recorded the incident on video and posted it last month on TikTok, where it's been viewed over 5 million times, according to WAGA-TV.

What are the details?

Ortega told WAGA she was picking up a DoorDash order from the Popeyes near Ponce de Leon Avenue when she noticed a man who looked hungry.

But when she tried to order him a meal, no dice.

According to Ortega's video, she was in a vehicle in the drive-through lane when she asked for a manager — who eventually appeared and refused the transaction.

""No ma’am, you can’t do it,"" the manager says.



""Why? He’s asking for food,"" Ortega protests.

""Ma’am, you can’t do it,"" the manager repeats before adding, ""I don't ... care about you recording me, baby.""

And that was that.

But then it got even worse. Police were called on Ortega.

""At that moment I was terrified,"" she later revealed to WAGA. ""I thought I was gonna get arrested. I was like, 'Maybe I should just call my family, and I might not be coming home tonight.'""

Image source: WAGA-TV video screenshot

Atlanta police confirmed to the station that officers responded to a call about a woman refusing to leave the drive-through, but police didn't do anything since Ortega didn’t break any laws.

Not only that, she told WAGA that officers complimented her.

""The officer pulled me to the side and was like, ‘I really thank you for doing that; thank you for buying him food. I appreciate that,’"" Ortega noted to the station.



Common sense prevails

Ortega told WAGA that a store general manager soon was contacted, and he felt terrible about what happened and then let Ortega and the homeless man order anything they wanted that night for free.

""My name's Jazz and thanks,"" the homeless man was heard saying as he waved to the camera outside Ortega's vehicle.

Popeyes told the station in a statement that it's ""committed to treating everyone with dignity and respect"" and that it has ""ensured all employees at this restaurant have been provided with retraining to help navigate a range of guest interactions, such as the situation highlighted in the video.""

Ortega told WAGA she started an online fundraiser to help Jazz find permanent housing: ""Oftentimes the homeless are treated like stray animals, stray cats. 'If you feed them, they’re gonna keep coming back, and we don't want them to keep coming back.' In all of this, I believe that people deserve to be treated like people.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/poll-liz-cheney-2024-helps-trump,2022-09-07
"CNN host has enough of DHS secretary's excuses, directly confronts him about border crisis: 'If that's not a crisis, Secretary, what is?'","Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas bent over backward Friday to prevent himself from admitting that the border crisis is, in fact, a ""crisis.""

What is the background?

Mayorkas has a history of downplaying the seriousness of the border crisis.

Despite a record number of migrants entering the U.S. under President Joe Biden's leadership, Mayorkas has repeatedly said throughout his tenure as DHS secretary that the border is ""not open"" but ""closed.""

What happened on CNN?

During an interview on ""CNN This Morning,"" anchor Poppy Harlow directly asked Mayorkas whether what is happening at the border qualifies as a ""crisis.""

But Mayorkas refused to acknowledge it as such.

""You know, we have seen the situation at the border managed in an orderly way,"" he claimed. ""We have seen it in extraordinary challenging circumstances as well. You can rest assured, Poppy, that we're doing everything that we possibly can to build a system that provides humanitarian relief in a safe and orderly way, while trying to persuade Congress to fix what is a broken system.""

His refusal, however, only emboldened Harlow to press the issue further.

""But just what you're seeing, what you've seen the 20 times you've been there — the record number of migrants at the southern border — and last year it was nearly 2.4 million,"" she responded.

""If that's not a crisis, Secretary, what is?"" she asked point-blank.

Mayorkas, in response, claimed the border crisis is a global issue that is ""reflective of the greatest level of displacement of people in the world since World War II.""

""It is reflective of a migration challenge that is gripping the entire hemisphere,"" he alleged.

""When I was in Colombia, I spoke with the president of the country, the foreign minister, the minister of security, and they spoke of 2.4 million Venezuelans in Columbia now. We're seeing Costa Rica's population increasingly formed by Nicaraguans,"" he continued. ""We're seeing a tremendous movement of people throughout the hemisphere.

""A regional challenge requires a regional solution, which is why President Biden has led the regional leaders in addressing it,"" Mayorkas defended.



Anything else?

Despite Biden announcing new immigration plans to finally address the border crisis — including the expansion of Title 42 expulsions — Mayorkas once again claimed on Thursday that the border ""is not open.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/popeyes-manager-refuses-to-allow-meal-purchase-for-homeless-man,2023-01-06
CBS reporter uses Mike Pence to take subtle jab at Biden — and asks WH for 'any reflections' on administration's stonewalling,"Does the White House regret how the administration handled President Joe Biden's improper handling of classified documents? That is the question CBS News reporter Steven Portnoy asked on Tuesday.

What is the background?

Last week, a lawyer for former Vice President Mike Pence discovered about a dozen classified documents at his private residence in Indiana. Pence initiated a search out of an abundance of caution, CNN reported.

Upon the discovery, the lawyer immediately notified the National Archives, which then notified the Justice Department. Pence's team then notified Congress and then the public.

The classified documents were stored in boxes that contained documents from Pence's days as vice president. Importantly, the boxes were taped when Pence's lawyer conducted the search, and thus it is believed that the boxes had not been opened since they were packed and initially sealed.

What did Portnoy ask?

The White House has repeatedly claimed it did ""the right thing"" regarding the disclosure of classified documents in Biden's possession. If that is true, Portnoy asked whether it is also true of Pence — especially given that Pence was even more forthcoming.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, however, refused to answer the question. Then Portnoy followed up with a certain jab at Biden, asking Jean-Pierre for ""any reflection"" on the White House's opaque disclosure process.

""One of the things that Pence team seems to have done in the last week is make public disclosure of the circumstance. They advised NARA but also advised Congress and now the public,"" Portnoy noted.

""Any reflections among the communications and press staff here as to how the Pence team handled it versus how you guys handled it?"" he asked.

Portnoy's question targeted a top concern about the Biden administration's disclosure process. It took more than two months after the first discovery of classified documents for the White House to say anything about it. Meanwhile, the second batch, which had already been discovered when the administration admitted to the first, was not disclosed until NBC News first reported on its existence.

But the press secretary was in no mood to offer penance. Instead, she referred Portnoy's question to the Justice Department and White House counsel's office.

When she finished responding, another reporter shouted out, ""Why did you not talk about it for two months?"" It's not clear who shouted the question. Jean-Pierre did not answer it.

San Francisco mayor to skip Pride Parade due to law enforcement uniform ban,"San Francisco Mayor London Breed said that she will not participate in the upcoming Pride Parade due to a ban against police wearing their uniforms while participating.

""I've made this very hard decision in order to support those members of the LGBTQ community who serve in uniform, in our Police Department and Sheriff's Department, who have been told they cannot march in uniform and in support of the members of the Fire Department who are refusing to march out of solidarity with their public safety partners,"" Breed said in a statement, according to the Los Angeles Times.

In a joint statement, the San Francisco Police Officers Pride alliance, the LGBTQ+ members of the San Francisco Sheriff's Office, and San Francisco Fire Department decried the police uniform ban and noted that they plan to skip the parade.

""We, the police officers of the San Francisco Police Officers Pride Alliance, stand firm in our decision that we will not be pushed back into the closet. We, the LGBTQ+ deputies of the San Francisco Sheriff's Office, will not hide from anyone who we are. In solidarity with their fellow first responders, the San Francisco Fire Department is standing with our law enforcement partners. Barring a reversal from SF Pride, SFFD will not be marching in the San Francisco Pride Parade,"" the statement declared.

""The San Francisco Fire Department, Police Department, and Sheriff’s Department stand with their LGBTQ+ employees and support their decision to not march in order to take a stand against the discriminatory actions of the board of the SF Pride committee,"" the statement said.

San Francisco Pride interim executive director Suzanne Ford said that members of law enforcement may don other garments, like a shirt emblazoned with an SFPD logo, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.



""We didn't ask anyone to hide, or not to denote who they were,"" Ford said. ""We just did not want full uniforms, out of harm reduction to marginalized members of our community.""

""We've asked for this gesture, (which) would say to some members of our community who don’t feel safe around police, that the police heard our concerns, and responded in a positive way,"" Ford said, according to the Chronicle.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/portnoy-asks-white-house-any-reflections-classified-docs-scandal,2022-05-24
Pro-Choice Caucus disseminates 'Abortion Messaging' guide,"The House Pro-Choice Caucus disseminated an ""Abortion Messaging"" guide to Democrats that lists the term ""Choice"" under the category of ""HARMFUL LANGUAGE,"" while listing the word ""Decision"" under the heading of ""HELPFUL LANGUAGE.""

Instead of saying ""Reduce abortion/'safe, legal, and rare,'"" the suggested terminology is ""Safe, legal, and accessible.""

The list categorizes ""Conscience clause/protections"" under the ""HARMFUL LANGUAGE"" header, but lists ""Refusal of care/denial of care laws"" as ""HELPFUL LANGUAGE.""

In response to a social media post about the messaging list, Jerry Dunleavy of the Washington Examiner tweeted, ""Pro-Choice Caucus decides its own name is harmful LOL.""



""I assume the Pro Choice Caucus will soon be renamed the Pro Decision Caucus? If we're talking language changes, maybe just stop the euphemism game and name yourself the Pro Abortion Caucus. Or even more accurate would be the Pro Dismembering and Poisoning Children Caucus,"" tweeted Noah Brandt, director of government affairs at the pro-life organization Live Action.

""These ridiculous talking points are good reminder -- the reason why the pro-abortion forces are on their heels now is because for decades they've put no intellectual energy into defending abortion and they're absolutely tone-deaf when it comes to defending it,"" Mark Hemingway of RealClearInvestigations tweeted.

While abortion has long been a topic of significant debate, the issue recently rose to the societal fore when a Supreme Court draft opinion for a pending case was leaked — the draft revealed that the high court may overturn Roe v. Wade later this year.



Leftists have been sounding the alarm about the potential Supreme Court ruling.

A group of liberal senators signed a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin urging him to ensure that military service members can travel to get an abortion if abortion is no longer available in their location after the high court issues an official ruling.

""At a minimum, you and your staff should consider implementing policy changes to allow servicemembers to obtain, for example, special liberty or permissive temporary additional duty permissions in order to travel out of state for reproductive healthcare and abortions if they are stationed in a jurisdiction that curtails these rights after the Dobbs decision is issued,"" the senators said in the letter.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pride-parade-mayor-uniform-police,2022-05-13
Pro-life news anchor fired for 'practicing partisan politics' — at her church,"An award-winning news director and co-anchor in Nebraska was recently fired from her job after her bosses discovered she had advocated for a pro-life initiative at a her own church.

Earlier this month, Melanie Standiford of Curtis, Nebraska, was fired from her job at NBC affiliate KNOP-TV, a gig she had enjoyed for five years, after executives at parent company Gray Television learned that she had helped collect signatures at St. John’s Lutheran Church and one other church in the hopes of making the small town of Curtis a ""sanctuary city for the unborn.""

The ballot initiative in Curtis is part of a larger network of similar initiatives circulating in six small Nebraska towns — Arnold, Brady, Curtis, Hershey, Paxton, and Wallace — to create a larger safe haven for unborn babies and pregnant women in the western area of the state. The initiatives are largely symbolic, as the closest abortion clinic is hundreds of miles away in Denver. However, if they pass, they will make a statement that these small towns — which have a total population of just over 3,500 people — are an abortion-free zone.

The Curtis initiative would allow for lawsuits against any medical professional who knowingly performs an abortion within the town limits or against those ""aiding or abetting"" a pregnant woman in procuring an abortion by, for instance, driving her to a distant clinic. Transmitting abortion-inducing drugs through the mail is already illegal in Nebraska.

Standiford, a 50-year-old mother of nine, said she has always been pro-life about abortion. ""It’s just right versus wrong in my mind,"" she said, though she also admitted that abortion has not always been one of her ""soapbox issues.""

However, her pro-life position became publicly known when an article about the pro-life petitions was published in the Flatwater Free Press. The reporter of the article, Natalia Alamdari, called Standiford and asked whether a journalist ought to gather signatures for a pro-life petition. Standiford replied, ""You’re probably right. I probably, maybe shouldn’t have even done that. But who knew it would be an issue?""

But Standiford said that she expressed her pro-life beliefs in detail to Alamdari, but that Alamdari isolated one comment — which Standiford thought was off the record — to ""attack"" her.

""The article was an attack, an attack directly on me,"" Standiford said.

""I told [Alamdari], 'This is in the privacy of my church. This is something that I did, acting as a Christian, in the privacy of my church,'"" Standiford continued.

The day after the Alamdari piece was published, Standiford was fired.

When her boss came in and reportedly informed her that she had been terminated for ""practicing partisan politics,"" Standiford recalled that she responded, ""I didn’t think I was being political with that in my home church, sitting in the pews in my church.""

KNOP general manager Shannon Booth confirmed Standiford's dismissal.

""Our long-standing company policy encourages civic involvement among our employees, so long as such activities do not give the appearance of interfering with journalistic impartiality,"" Booth said in a statement. ""In furtherance of that qualification, KNOP’s news personnel are not permitted, at any time and regardless of beliefs, to actively engage in any political activity for any candidate, party, or ballot initiative.""

Standiford said she had never heard of that policy and refused to sign her termination letter, thereby forfeiting a $4,000 severance payment. However, she said that she has no regrets about walking away from the money since doing so meant walking away from a non-disclosure agreement as well.

After years of practicing journalistic neutrality, Standiford said she now feels free to express her views openly and become more overtly political. And she has. She has already been appointed to be county chair of the Frontier County GOP, and she also confirmed that she would ""absolutely"" consider running for public office.

""In a heartbeat,"" she said.

Professor insists students mask up in class,"Jahred Adelman, associate professor and director of graduate studies at Northern Illinois University's Department of Physics, has demanded that students wear a mask in his class, warned that anyone who fails to comply will be asked to depart, and indicated that refusal to don a mask while indoors reflects both racism and ableism.

""Masks are required AT ALL times in PHYS 253. Here and in your labs,"" Adelman's course syllabus states, according to Young America's Foundation. ""It is not pleasant, but it is for your health and safety, my health and safety, and the health and safety of your friends and colleagues. If you do not follow this requirement, you will be asked to leave.""

Northern Illinois University allows teachers to decide for themselves whether they want to mandate masking in their classes.



""The university allows professors to set mask policy in their classrooms and laboratories. I cannot and would not tell students what to do outside of my class, but if I can do my part to keep everyone a little safer while we learn physics, I will do so. Of particular concern to me is protecting those students of color and those with special health demands and needs, whom studies have shown are disproportionately impacted by the virus,"" Adelman told Fox News via email.

YAF posted a photo of a message that declares, ""an important policy of PHYS 253 is an equitable and just atmosphere for all class members.""

""Refusing to mask indoors is a manifestation of ableism and racism,"" the notice delcares, calling this ""an exercise of individual privilege that tells the most vulnerable that their health and the health of their loved ones does not matter.""

That language is substantially identical to the language that Jessica N. Pabón, associate professor of women's, gender, and sexuality studies at SUNY New Paltz, posted on Twitter in August — Pabón noted that she was including masking in her syllabi, though she said that the language was not finalized. ""Refusing to mask indoors is a manifestation of ableism and racism, an exercise of individual privilege that tells the most vulnerable that their health does not matter,"" the text declared.

Later in August, Pabón posted what appeared to be another version of the statement on masking.



""Refusing to mask indoors is a manifestation of ableism (dismissing the risks for immunocompromised people and making the classroom unsafe/inaccessible) and racism (racial and ethnic minorities in the US have higher rates of infection and death caused by the COVID-19 virus than white people); refusing to mask while indoors is an exercise of individual privilege that tells the most vulnerable that their health does not matter, that their lives do not matter,"" Pabón's post declared.

The SUNY New Paltz website notes that the school ""will not enforce individual requests by faculty that students wear masks in specific courses. No conduct charges will be brought against students who fail to comply with such requests.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/pro-life-news-anchor-fired-for-practicing-partisan-politics-at-her-church,2022-09-01
College professor stops grading her students' work because it 'perpetuates inequity',"An English professor at the University of Richmond claimed recently that she has abandoned the practice of grading her students work as an exercise in social and racial equity.

What did she say?

In an op-ed for the Conversation published Wednesday, Dr. Elisabeth Gruner said she stopped grading written assignments four years ago — and her only regret is that she didn't start sooner. Apparently, the longstanding practice has become an outdated method of educational assessment, since it doesn't serve the student.

Grading, Gruner argued, is ""highly inequitable,"" ""demotivating,"" and ultimately serves only to ""increase students' stress."" Nevermind the litany of reasons educators have opted to grade students for centuries.

Now the professor uses a practice called ""ungrading"" to assess her students' educational performance. In the op-ed, she listed off three reasons for doing so.

One reason was that she wanted her students to focus on the feedback that she provided on their written assignments and claimed that ""removing the grade forced students to pay attention to my comments."" Another was that she selfishly ""hates grading"" and desired to be free ""from the tyranny of determining a grade.""

But Gruner offered a third reason for adopting ""ungrading"" as her method: ""I was concerned with equity,"" she said. This appeared to be her primary motivation.

""For almost 10 years I have been studying inclusive pedagogy, which focuses on ensuring that all students have the resources they need to learn,"" Gruner claimed, adding that her studies ""confirmed [her] sense that sometimes what [she] was really grading was a student’s background.""

""Students with educational privilege came into my classroom already prepared to write A or B papers, while others often had not had the instruction that would enable them to do so,"" she explained. ""The 14 weeks they spent in my class could not make up for the years of educational privilege their peers had enjoyed.""

What else?

Of course, Gruner acknowledged that she does ultimately have to determine and assign her students with grades at the end of the semester, as required by university rules.

To comply, Gruner refuses to grade individual assignments during the semester but offers feedback and ample opportunity to revise work. Then, at the end of the semester, students submit their full portfolio of work for a final assessment.

She also suggested that if one needs to grade, they should at least use the pass/fail method — which avoids letter or number grades but rather assesses whether or not a student ""passes"" or ""fails"" the class. The method was temporarily adopted by many educators and institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gruner celebrated the use of pass/fail as a way to reduce stress and address the pandemic's disproportionate affect on students of color. But she lamented how many ""later resumed grading, not acknowledging the ways that traditional assessments can both perpetuate inequity and impede learning.""

Anything else?

Gruner's perspective is likely to appreciated by many students. One allegedly thanked her for treating him and fellow classmates ""like adults."" But it remains to be seen if her patently less rigorous method produces more capable graduates.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/professor-demands-masks-racism,2022-04-27
Progressive prosecutor Andrew Warren sues Gov. Ron DeSantis over suspension – ‘DeSantis went too far’,"Andrew Warren, a Florida prosecutor and Democrat, was suspended earlier this month for announcing that he refused to prosecute cases that violated his political beliefs. On Tuesday, Warren filed a lawsuit against DeSantis for allegedly violating his First Amendment rights, the Associated Press reported.



The prosecutor was elected in 2016 and re-elected in 2020. DeSantis suspended Warren from office, accusing him of “neglect of duty” when Warren stated that he would not uphold the laws of the state in cases of abortion and child sex-change operations.

The Florida governor declared that prosecutors are allowed to use their discretion when deciding whether or not to prosecute a case but that a “blanket refusal” to pursue any cases involving abortion or gender reassignment surgery for children violates the oath of office.

Warren pushed back during a press conference the day after his suspension was announced, stating, “Just based on the governor’s track record with unconstitutional orders, I have a feeling that this is going to be just as unconstitutional.”

In Warren’s lawsuit, he stated that there was no legal justification for DeSantis to remove him from his position and that he should be reinstated. Instead, the prosecutor alleged that the suspension was nothing more than political retaliation for speaking out against the governor’s policies.

“DeSantis went too far. Employing the powers of his esteemed office as a weapon to suppress criticism and promote cronyism,” the lawsuit read.

Warren argued that “the First Amendment still applies even though DeSantis is the Governor of Florida and that the Constitution of the State of Florida means what the courts say it means, not whatever DeSantis needs it to mean to silence his critics, promote his loyalists, and subvert the will of the voters.”

Several examples of Warren’s political statements were cited in the case. One example stated, “We do not support the use of scarce criminal justice and law enforcement resources on criminalization of doctors who offer medically necessary, safe gender-affirming care to trans youth, parents who safeguard their child’s health and wellbeing by seeking out such treatments, or any individuals who use facilities aligned with their gender identity.”

One statement that did not make its way into the lawsuit was a joint letter by Fair and Just Prosecution that Warren signed in June. A group of prosecutors signed the statement, and it read, “We decline to use our offices’ resources to criminalize reproductive health decisions and commit to exercise our well-settled discretion and refrain from prosecuting those who seek, provide, or support abortions.”

In response to the lawsuit, DeSantis’ communications director, Taryn Fenske, said, “It’s not surprising Warren, who was suspended for refusing to follow the law, would file a legally baseless lawsuit challenging his suspension.”

The Associated Press reported that DeSantis’ team seemed unfazed by the lawsuit.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/professor-says-grading-perpetuates-inequity,2022-08-17
25 FBI agents with guns drawn reportedly raid pro-life activist's home to the horror of his family; he faces 11 years for pushing a man outside an abortion clinic,"A pro-life activist and author had his home raided by as many as 30 FBI agents with guns drawn, according to his wife. The sidewalk counselor and father of seven now faces up to 11 years in federal prison for allegedly pushing a man to the ground outside of an abortion clinic in Pennsylvania nearly a year ago. The pro-abortion man allegedly harassed the Christian man's young son.

Mark Houck is a Catholic author, lecturer, radio host, and co-founder of The King's Men – a club for men ""to unite and build up other men in the mold of leader, protector, and provider through education, formation, healing, and action.""

On Oct. 13, 2021, Houck allegedly went to sidewalk counsel at the Planned Parenthood Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center in Philadelphia. He brought his eldest son with him – who was 12 years old at the time.

An abortion clinic volunteer named Bruce Love and Houck allegedly got into an altercation outside of the Planned Parenthood clinic. Houck's wife claimed that her husband was on the sidewalk of the abortion clinic and not the property of Planned Parenthood.

Houck's wife, Ryan-Marie Houck, told LifeSiteNews, ""For 'weeks and weeks,' a 'pro-abortion protester' would speak to the boy saying 'crude … inappropriate and disgusting things,' such as 'you’re dad’s a fag,' and other statements that were too vulgar for her to convey.""

Houck's wife claimed that Love got into ""the son’s personal space"" and refused to stop saying ""crude… inappropriate and disgusting"" comments at the father and son.

Mark Houck ""shoved him away from his child, and the guy fell back"" and he hit the ground. Houck allegedly pushed the pro-abortion man to the ground outside of the Planned Parenthood clinic a second time. Love – a 72-year-old volunteer escort at the abortion clinic – reportedly suffered injuries that required medical attention.

Police were called, but Houck was reportedly not charged because there was a ""lack of evidence"" of an assault.

Ryan-Marie Houck claimed that Love ""tried to sue Mark,"" but the case was thrown out of court this summer.

Around 7:05 a.m. on Friday, the Houck's home was reportedly raided by 25 to 30 FBI agents and 15 government vehicles surrounded their house.

Ryan-Marie Houck said the FBI agents had their guns drawn and ""they started pounding on the door and yelling for us to open it.""

Mark Houck allegedly told the FBI agents, ""Please, I’m going to open the door, but, please, my children are in the home. I have seven babies in the house.""

When the front door was opened, Ryan-Marie said, ""They had big, huge rifles pointed at Mark and pointed at me and kind of pointed throughout the house.""

""The kids were all just screaming,"" she said. ""It was all just very scary and traumatic.""

Houck was arrested and taken away.

President Joe Biden's Department of Justice charged Houck with a violation of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.

The FACE Act prohibits ""force or threat of force or by physical obstruction, intentionally injures, intimidates or interferes with or attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person because that person is or has been, or in order to intimidate such person or any other person or any class of persons from, obtaining or providing reproductive health services.""

Houck, 48, faces a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and fines of up to $350,000.

U.S. Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero said, ""Assault is always a serious offense, and under the FACE Act, if the victim is targeted because of their association with a reproductive healthcare clinic, it is a federal crime. Our Office and the Department of Justice are committed to prosecuting crimes which threaten the safety and rights of all individuals.""

Jacqueline Maguire – Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Philadelphia Division – said, ""Put simply, violence is never the answer. Violating the FACE Act by committing a physical assault is a serious crime for which the FBI will work to hold offenders accountable.""

A GiveSendGo campaign was launched to raise funds for the family. At the time of publication, the crowdfunding campaign had raised more than $43,000.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/progressive-prosecutor-warren-sues-desantis,2022-09-25
Michigan man who shot elderly pro-life canvasser claims she was arguing with his wife and shooting was an 'accident',"The Michigan man who shot an elderly pro-life canvasser claimed that she was arguing with his wife at the time and that the shooting was an accident.

The incident unfolded on September 20 at a home near Lake Odessa in Michigan.

The 83-year-old volunteer for Right to Life said she was peacefully walking away from the home when she was shot in the back.

74-year-old Richard Harvey and his wife Sharon Harvey give a very different account. They told WOOD-TV that the woman got into an argument with Sharon Harvey about abortion and refused to leave their property when asked.

Richard Harvey claims that when he came and saw the woman arguing with his wife that he grabbed his .22-caliber rifle.

“It got louder and louder. My husband was in the barn and he heard it,” Sharon Harvey claimed.

“I’m in the barn. I hear a bunch of screaming going on,"" Richard Harvey said.

The woman was talking to people in the neighborhood to persuade them to vote against Proposal 3, a motion to keep abortion legal in Michigan after the pivotal Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade.

Richard Harvey said that he shot a warning shot into a pine tree when he saw the elderly pro-life volunteer.

“She is still ranting and raving and she’s got this clipboard. She’s waving it around,"" he claimed.

""I’m thinking she’s going to smack Sharon with it. So without thinking, I went to club it away with the rifle and my finger was still in the trigger guard. It went off and hit her,"" he added.



The victim told investigators she was stunned by the gunshot that went through her shoulder. She said she got into her car and drove to the police in fear that she would be shot again.

Michigan State Police are still investigating the matter and the prosecutor for Ionia County told WOOD that their office would wait until the police report was completed before deciding whether to press charges.

A spokesperson for Right to Life of Michigan condemned the incident.

“No one should fear violence while peacefully exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech,"" said Ann Visser. ""This 84-year old woman is hardly imposing, standing about 5-feet tall. The idea that shooting this woman is at all excusable is a dangerous claim for Americans across the country who engage in peaceful door-to-door canvassing.""

Harvey was asked if he thought he might face charges.

“It’s always possible,” he said. “I shot somebody. It was an accident.”

Psaki confronted over left-wing protesters intimidating SCOTUS justices — but she has no 'official US government position',"White House press secretary Jen Psaki refused on Thursday to condemn left-wing protesters who are intimidating Supreme Court justices by protesting near their personal residences.

What did Psaki say?

Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked Psaki about the Biden administration's position on the protesters — but all she did was affirm that they are ""peaceful"" protests.

""You guys had some time yesterday talking about what you think are the extreme wings of the Republican Party. Do you think the progressive activists that are now planning protests outside some of the justices’ houses are extreme?"" Doocy asked.

""Peaceful protest? No. Peaceful protest is not extreme,"" Psaki replied.

When Doocy noted that some of the Supreme Court justices have young kids, Psaki still refused to condemn the protests.

""Look, I think our view here is that peaceful protest — there’s a long history in the United States and the country of that, and we certainly encourage people to keep it peaceful and not resort to any level of violence,"" Psaki said.

The fact that protesters have even circulated the addresses of the justices online, which Doocy pointed out, did not stir Psaki to condemn the intimidation tactics.

Instead, Psaki focused on the ""sadness"" and ""fear"" that Americans have over U.S. abortion rights — which are among the most extreme in the world — potentially being scaled back.

""Look, I think the president’s view is that there’s a lot of passion, a lot of fear, a lot of sadness from many, many people across this country about what they saw in that leaked document,"" Psaki said. ""We obviously want people’s privacy to be respected. We want people to protest peacefully if they want to protest. That is certainly what the president’s view would be.""



""So he doesn’t care if they’re protesting outside the Supreme Court or outside someone’s private residence?"" Doocy fired back.

""I don’t have an official U.S. government position on where people protest,"" Psaki conceded.

""But I think we shouldn’t lose the point here: The reason people are protesting is because women across the country are worried about their fundamental rights that have been law for 50 years,"" she continued. ""Their rights to make choices about their own bodies and their own health care are at risk. That’s why people are protesting. They’re unhappy. They’re scared.""

The intimidation tactics have resulted in each Supreme Court justice receiving extra security. CBS News reported that, in addition to their homes being targeted, some justices have even received ""more targeted personal phone threats.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/prolife-shooting-michigan,2022-05-06
Psaki refuses to apologize when confronted over Biden administration smearing Border Patrol agents with debunked 'whipping' claims,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki repeatedly declined to apologize for the Biden administration when confronted on Monday over claims that smeared mounted Border Patrol agents.

What is the background?

The Department of Homeland Security launched an investigation into mounted Border Patrol agents last year after they were falsely accused of ""whipping"" Haitian migrants.

As outraged boiled over, President Joe Biden accused the agents of ""nearly running people"" over with their horses, promising the agents ""will pay"" for the ""outrageous"" incident. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas even claimed that images of Border Patrol agents corralling migrants ""conjured up the worst elements of our nation’s ongoing battle against systemic racism.""

Despite promising the investigation would be swift, officials have said nothing publicly about the probe.

However, National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd said the Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Personal Responsibility has completed its investigation, drafting a 500-page report on the incident. According to Judd, the investigation cleared the agents of criminal wrongdoing, though they could still lose their jobs.

What did Psaki say?

Considering the likely outcome of the investigation, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked a blunt question at Monday's press briefing, but Psaki repeatedly deflected.

""When is the president going to apologize to them?"" Doocy asked.

""There is a process and an investigation that’s gone to the Department of Homeland Security. I don’t have any update on that,"" she responded.

Doocy followed up by repeating Biden's accusations, which he noted ""would be a criminal offense."" Thus, if the agents are not going to be criminally charged, Doocy tried to ask again when Biden will apologize — but Psaki interrupted him.

""And there was an investigation into that. And I’ll let the Department of Homeland Security announce any conclusion of that investigation,"" she interjected.

Doocy then turned the tables on Psaki.

""You accused these officers of brutal and inappropriate measures,"" he began. ""Now that they’ve been told they will not be criminally charged, will you apologize to them?""

But Psaki again refused to apologize or acknowledge anything apart from the existence of the investigation.

""Peter, there was an investigation into their behavior, so that investigation is playing out. Whenever it’s going to be announced, the Department of Homeland Security will announce that. And then I’m sure we’ll have a comment on it after that,"" Psaki said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/psaki-no-position-protesters-supreme-court-justices-homes,2022-04-19
Psaki responds to Elon Musk buying Twitter by floating 'reforms' to combat 'misinformation',"White House press secretary Jen Psaki responded to Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter on Monday by reiterating President Biden's continued support for ""fundamental reforms"" aimed at combating the spread of ""misinformation"" on social media platforms.

The remarks appeared to foreshadow a potential future fight between the Biden administration and Twitter over content censorship practices.

Musk — a tech billionaire and free speech advocate — finalized a buyout of the platform on Monday following weeks of negotiations. He immediately emphasized that his goal in purchasing the company is to return it to free speech principles and end the blatant ideological censorship that has become prevalent on the platform.

Though Psaki refused to respond specifically to Musk's acquisition of Twitter, her overarching comments made the administration's feelings clear; that is, officials are not at all happy at the notion that Twitter will be run in an unbiased way.

""What I can tell you as a general matter, no matter who owns or runs Twitter, the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms, what they ... the power they have over our everyday lives, has long argued that tech platforms must be held accountable for the harms they cause,"" Psaki said during Monday's press briefing.

""He has been a strong supporter of fundamental reforms to achieve that goal, including reforms to Section 230, enacting antitrust reforms, requiring more transparency, and more, and he’s encouraged that there’s bipartisan interest in Congress,"" she continued. ""In terms of what hypothetical policies might happen, I’m just not going to speak to that at this point in time.""

Later, when pressed again on the White House's reaction to the acquisition, Psaki lent credence to concerns that ""misinformation"" will now run rampant on the platform and once again expressed that President Biden is open to making changes.

""I would say that our concerns are not new,"" Psaki said. ""We’ve long talked about, and the president has long talked about, his concerns about the power of social platforms — including Twitter and others — to spread misinformation, disinformation, the need for these platforms be held accountable.""

News of Musk's purchase of Twitter caused a widespread meltdown among liberals in the U.S., many of whom vowed to leave the platform as a result.



Twitter employees, too, went ""absolutely insane"" over the news, according to a report, as internal channels ran amok with outrage and panic.

""I feel like I'm going to throw up ... I [really] don’t wanna work for a company that is owned by Elon Musk,"" one Twitter employee reportedly told a New York Times reporter.

In a statement after his purchase, Musk said, ""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.""

""I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans,"" he added. ""Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/psaki-refuses-to-apologize-when-confronted-over-biden-administration-smearing-border-patrol-agents-with-debunked-whipping-claims,2022-04-26
"While happy to host drag queens, public libraries deny story-hour slot to Kirk Cameron for his new faith-based book: 'We have to start fighting back'","In libraries across the United States, toddlers are frequently invited to sit and listen to men dressed as women advance LGBT propaganda. Kids can show up at their local library to learn how to become drag queens.

American evangelist and actor Kirk Cameron has discovered that where public libraries across the nation are concerned, it is impermissible to alternatively share a children's book that celebrates faith, family, normalcy, and biblical wisdom.

'Queer-friendly' apparently means Christians need not apply

Cameron told Fox News Digital that at least 50 taxpayer-funded libraries have either denied or ignored his requests to host a story-hour program for parents and kids. These same libraries have, however, hosted drag queen story hours and ideologically charged all-ages LGBT events.

The evangelist's publisher, Brave Books, shared with Fox News Digital a number of the responses they have received from various libraries.

A library worker from the Rochambeau Public Library in Providence, Rhode Island, told Cameron and his publisher, ""We are a very queer-friendly library. Our messaging does not align.""

Accordingly, the library stated, ""No, we will pass on having you run a program in our space.""

When Brave Books pressed an official affiliated with the Providence library on whether the company could fill out an application anyway, the official responded, ""You can fill out the form to reserve space, to run the program in our space — but we won’t run your program.""

Rochambeau Public Library hosts ""Queer Umbrella,"" where kids ""can learn, discuss, and connect over queer history, art, community resources, and more!""

According to an event posting, ""Queer Umbrella"" is open to ""all members of the LGBTQ+ community who are 12+.""

The City Heights/Weingart Branch Library in San Diego similarly shot down the prospect of a reading by Cameron, suggesting that officials didn't ""think that's something that we would do.""

The library's representative reportedly cited the community's diversity as a determining factor.

A children's library representative affiliated with the Alameda County Library system in California flatly said, ""We are not interested.""

That same library location in San Lorenzo runs a ""special Kwanzaa storytime"" and, according to Fox News Digital, a legal workshop assisting people who want to change their gender on official documents.

A spokesman at the Indianapolis Public Library's central location all but said no, telling the publisher that ""we are really looking at authors who are diverse. Authors of color. That's really been our focus.""

After Brave Books explained that Cameron's book contains a diverse collection of stories and ideas, the library responded by saying, ""We are focusing on racial equity.""

'Battle for the hearts and minds of our children'

The book Cameron endeavors to read to children from is entitled ""As You Grow.""

Written by the father of six and illustrated by Juan Moreno, ""As You Grow"" tells of the upward journey of a tree and the ""words of wisdom that guided the tree.""

Instead of learning about sexually degenerate acts or alternative lifestyles, kids learn ""biblical wisdom and the value of producing the fruit of the spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, self-control.""

While there are thousands of public libraries Cameron has yet to call on in hopes of sharing this message with the next generation, the evangelist told Fox News Digital that the rejections thus far are ""proof that more than ever, we are getting destroyed in the battle for the hearts and minds of our children.""



""Publicly funded libraries are green-lighting ‘gender marker and name change clinics’ while denying a story time that would involve the reading of a book that teaches biblical wisdom. How much more clear can it get?"" he added.

Matt Walsh of the Daily Wire and others suggested online that were Cameron ""dressed in women's underwear and reading a book about sexuality for five year olds, then he'd have libraries lining up to host him.""

Brave Books CEO Trent Talbot said, ""It is devastating to discover that many of our publicly funded libraries have now become indoctrination centers that refuse to allow biblical wisdom to be taught to our children.""

Cameron suggested, ""We have to start fighting back, or we will lose our kids and this country.""



They key, suggested Cameron, is not just calling out evil and degeneracy, but displacing it. That means regaining some control of public spaces, including libraries.

He previously told Fox News that with six children and grandbabies to think about, he personally has a great deal at stake.

""Drag queen story hour and all of that — it's not a mistake that this is going after the children because everyone understands that whoever controls the textbooks controls the future,"" he said.

Cameron noted further that ""it's no coincidence that we're seeing these dangerous and toxic ideas such as gender theory and CRT and these kinds of things targeted toward our kids [today].""

Last week, Cameron told Fox News' Shannon Bream that ""there are so many people today who see evil and hope that it just passes by them, that it comes to them last. ... We should engage evil and defeat evil whether it's in our home, our children's school, our culturally, politically, [or] spiritually.""

Publisher refuses to cave to demands that Amy Coney Barrett's book be canceled: 'We remain fully committed',"Penguin Random House is refusing to cave to woke demands to cancel a forthcoming book written by Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

What is the background?

Nearly 700 writers, editors, and other workers in the publishing industry have signed an open letter demanding that Penguin Random House not publish Coney Barrett's forthcoming book.

The reason? Coney Barrett, who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, is guilty of an ""assault on inalienable human rights,"" referring to overturning the federal right to an abortion.

This is not just a book that we disagree with, and we are not calling for censorship. Many of us work daily with books we find disagreeable to our personal politics. Rather, this is a case where a corporation has privately funded the destruction of human rights with obscene profits. Coney Barrett is free to say as she wishes, but Penguin Random House must decide whether to fund her position at the expense of human rights in order to inflate its bottom line, or to truly stand behind the values it proudly espouses to hold.

Coney Barrett reportedly received an advance of $2 million from Penguin Random House for her book.

What did PRH say?

Sentinel, an imprint at Penguin Random House that publishes conservative titles, is standing by Coney Barrett's book.

""We remain fully committed to publishing authors who, like Justice Barrett, substantively shape today’s most important conversations,"" said Sentinel publisher Adrian Zackheim, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Zackheim added that Sentinel ""publishes books so that people can read them, and evaluate them on their own. In an intelligent free society we need to disseminate ideas in a robust form so that we can discuss them.""

A representative for Penguin Random House confirmed that Zackheim was relaying the sentiment of Penguin Random House.

Coney Barrett's book will likely not see bookshelves until 2024. Politico reported last year the book will be focused on how ""judges are not supposed to bring their personal feelings into how they rule.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/public-libraries-hosting-drag-queen-story-hour-deny-kirk-cameron-story-time-faith-based,2022-11-02
A superyacht believed to be Vladimir Putin's was just impounded by Italian officials,"On Friday, Italian authorities seized a giant superyacht that is said to be owned by Russian President Vladimir Putin after the Italian government recommended that the ship be impounded as part of the West’s ongoing campaign of sanctions against Russia.

The Daily Mail reported that Italian authorities said that the $700 million mega-yacht named “The Scheherazade,” is more than 450 feet long and contains spas, swimming pools, and two helicopter pads.

The giant yacht has been the subject of an ongoing investigation by Italy’s financial police since the end of this past March and has been docked at Marina di Carrara near Pisa since this past September as it undergoes a refit.

The Italian government’s seizure of the ship came late at night as Italian officials grew increasingly concerned that The Scheherazade was going to slip away from their jurisdiction and into international waters to avoid Western sanctions.

Reportedly, in recent days there has been a flurry of activity around the yacht. In March, the ship's majority Russian crew had been replaced with a British staff overnight.

Indicating that the ship had connections to Russia, The Italian Financial Police released a statement that said, “After verification by the fiscal authorities, it has come to light that there is a significant economic connection between the owner of The Scheherazade and senior elements of the Russian government.”

The statement continued, “On the basis of these elements, it has been recommended that the yacht be placed on the current European Union sanctions list, and the Minister of Finance in Rome has agreed.”

Mariateresa Levi, a member of the Italian Financial police, said, “I am not in a position to tell you who the actual owner is, but we are satisfied that the yacht should be seized, and in the next few hours, officers will board and impound her.”

The ship's captain has denied that Putin is the owner of the superyacht while refusing to disclose who the real owner is.

There have been claims that the vessel might belong to Eduard Khudainatov, a Russian oil tycoon who has previously been able to escape Western sanctions, unlike many other Russian oligarchs.

Despite this, activists and investigative journalists linked to Alexei Navalny, the imprisoned Russian opposition leader, are adamant that the ship belongs to Putin.

A probe into the vessel’s former Russian crew revealed that almost all of them worked for Russian secret service agencies charged with protecting the Russian president.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/publisher-refuses-to-cave-amy-coney-barrett-book,2022-05-07
CNN correspondent refuses to hide reality of sky-high inflation: 'I find myself shocked when I go to the grocery store',"Not even CNN is hiding the depressing reality that sky-high inflation is imposing on most Americans.

What are the details?

CNN Business correspondent Rahel Solomon explained Wednesday that American life is ""being shaped by the really high inflation,"" which topped 8.6% in May.

""Well, I think for a lot of Americans, their reality is being shaped by the really high inflation,"" Solomon explained. ""We know, under the hood of that number, it’s really high energy prices, really high food prices. The costs of new and used cars have gone up, pretty much everything broad-based has gone up. The cost of shelter has gone up, which has some economists really concerned.

""I think if you are an American at home, it’s really hard, perhaps understandably, to feel great about the economy right now, even though there are some silver linings, when you’re getting hit so hard with inflation,"" she added, referring to decreasing unemployment numbers.

Solomon then used a personal anecdote to highlight the everyday reality of inflation.

""Even personally, you know, I talked to economists and traders and analysts every day about this, and sometimes I find myself shocked when I go to the grocery store and look at prices and think, 'Wow, this costs this now?' And so, it’s understandable,"" Solomon admitted.

Solomon and CNN anchor Ana Cabrera were discussing a new Monmouth University Poll, which found that nearly 9 in 10 American adults believe the U.S. is heading in the ""wrong direction.""

The poll similarly found that inflation and record-high gas prices are the issues that Americans believe impact them most right now.

Those discoveries are particularly alarming for Democrats, who control the White House and Congress. Such polling, along with President Joe Biden's approval numbers, suggests Democrats will lose big in the 2022 midterm elections.

Anything else?

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has not yet released inflation figures for June. Unfortunately, the consumer price index will probably show yet another inflation increase, as inflation continued to skyrocket in Europe last month.

If inflation does increase, the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates, an action some economists believe could lead to a recession.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/putin-russia-superyacht-italy,2022-07-07
Rainn Wilson apologizes for 'mean crack about breastfeeding vs chestfeeding',"Actor Rainn Wilson of ""The Office"" fame issued and apology on Thursday, saying that he had posted ""a mean crack about breastfeeding vs chestfeeding"" on Wednesday.

""Yesterday I tweeted a mean crack about breastfeeding vs chestfeeding. After speaking with some Trans friends and educating myself a bit more I want to apologize for the tweet. It was adding to misinformation and meanness. I'm sorry,"" Wilson tweeted on Thursday.

The mea culpa came after Wilson had reportedly issued a tweet on Wednesday that said, ""TIL you can no longer say 'nursing or breastfeeding mother' you have to say 'chestfeeding person.' Just FYI.""

While some on social media praised Wilson for issuing the apology, others were less than impressed.

""Absolutely pathetic…"" tweeted Dave Rubin, host of BlazeTV's ""The Rubin Report.""

""Serious beta energy,"" NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck commented.

""I'm embarrassed for you,"" tweeted Seth Dillon, CEO of the Babylon Bee.

""Perhaps you should talk with some actual nursing mothers and educate yourself about why the term 'chestfeeding' is offensive and degrading to women. (Women, in case you are confused, are the humans who are able to breastfeed children),"" Stephen Miller tweeted. ""Woke Democrats are trying to erase women and erase the experiences of women,"" he added in another tweet.

Last year Wilson, who is widely known for playing the character Dwight Schrute on the television series ""The Office,"" said that individuals who declined to get vaccinated seemed to be the most angry that the government had not put an end to COVID-19.



""People who refuse to get vaccinated seem to be the angriest that the government hasn't 'fixed' or 'stopped' the virus by now. Please explain,"" the actor tweeted in December.

Wilson posted a tweet on Thursday that said, ""Here's why so many people who don't want 'government overreach' long for something approaching authoritarianism: … . I have no idea.""

Rand Paul goes after health institutions that refused critical care to unvaxxed patients,"Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky introduced new legislation on Tuesday that would prevent health care facilities that denied critical care to unvaccinated patients from receiving taxpayer dollars, Fox News Digital reported.



The proposed bill, ""The COVID-19 Vaccination Non-Discrimination Act,"" seeks to hold health care institutions accountable by blocking federal funding.

""I'm leading the charge to hold taxpayer-funded health institutions accountable for denying unvaccinated people critical care,"" Paul wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.

Paul told Fox News Digital, ""No American should be denied access to critical care based on a personal medical decision, yet tragically, many hospitals and other medical facilities continue to discriminate against those unvaccinated for COVID-19.""

""The COVID-19 Vaccination Non-Discrimination Act will protect the rights of vulnerable patients to make their own health care choices and ensure that federal taxpayer dollars do not support facilities that turn away patients based on their COVID-19 vaccination status,"" he added.

Republican Rep. Dan Bishop of North Carolina, who introduced the legislation in the House, called the withholding of critical health care based on vaccine status an ""injustice.""

""There's no reason that medical facilities should deny care to people based on their COVID-19 vaccination status, and there's certainly no reason for institutions that do so to receive any federal funding,"" Bishop stated.

There have been reported cases of health care facilities denying care to the unvaccinated, despite the American Medical Association instructing medical professionals to provide care to all patients regardless of vaccine status, according to Paul's office.

Duke University Hospital was recently accused of denying Yulia Hicks, a 14-year-old girl from Ukraine, a kidney transplant because she had not received any COVID vaccinations.

In December, Yulia's adoptive mother, Chrissy Hicks, told Fox News Digital, ""I said, 'So basically you're telling us if she does not get the vaccine, then she's not getting a transplant.'""

""And [the medical employee] said, 'Yes, that is the one thing that is holding us up,'"" Hicks stated.

Health officials at Duke University Hospital refused to comment on Hicks' case but said, ""Our hearts go out to all families coping with the serious illness of a loved one."" Officials added that the health care system is ""committed to making organ transplant accessible to as many eligible patients as possible.""

Trump for speaker of House? Democrat claims Republicans are 'repeatedly' pushing Trump for top post,"Democrats are floating the possibility that Donald Trump could become speaker of the House if Republicans manage to retake control of the House.

Wait — Trump?

Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) claimed on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that Republican lawmakers are considering installing Trump as House speaker.

In fact, Raskin claimed that Republicans have ""repeatedly"" discussed the possibility.

""It's a real problem for Kevin McCarthy now because there are certain pro-Trumpists within his House caucus who refuse to accept that he's really with Trump, and they want to get rid of McCarthy,"" Raskin claimed.

""We know that the hard-right Freedom Caucus people are in search of another candidate. And one potential candidate whose name has been floated is Donald Trump himself because the speaker of the House does not have to be a member of the House,"" he alleged. ""And they are talking about putting Trump right there.""

The Maryland Democrat cited Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) as one lawmaker who could support Trump for the post.

But Biggs has not indicated that he will support Trump. Instead, Biggs himself is going to campaign for speaker, the Wall Street Journal reported.

What is the bigger picture?

While some Republicans in the past have floated Trump as a House speaker candidate, Raskin provided no evidence to back his claim that Republicans are internally pushing for Trump now.

Since Election Day, not a single Republicans has publicly backed Trump for the position.

Raskin's rhetorical sleight-of-hand, however, is clear. Democrats understand the red wave never materialized because of Trump's influence in the 2022 midterm elections — hence why moderate Republicans often won reelection in landslides, while Trump-endorsed candidates either lost or won narrowly — so they will continue tying Republicans to Trump.

Still, Republicans are expected to win control of the House, albeit by a small majority. McCarthy is the favorite to become speaker, but his path will not be easy.

""All I’ll say at the moment is McCarthy doesn’t have 218, and there will be an alternative challenger,"" a spokesman for Biggs told WSJ.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rand-paul-goes-after-health-institutions-that-refused-critical-care-to-unvaxxed-patients,2022-11-14
Recall effort launched against Dem mayor after city labeled 'murder capital' – mayor criticized for using taxpayer funds for upgraded international travel,"New Orleans residents expressed their frustrations regarding Democrat Mayor LaToya Cantrell's lackluster leadership by rallying together to file a recall petition, Fox News Digital reported. The dissatisfied residents claimed that while the city was being crowned the murder capital, Cantrell was busy taking extravagant trips to Europe on the taxpayers' dime.



The petition was filed by Eileen Carter, Cantrell's former social media manager; and Belden Batiste, a former Democrat mayoral candidate.

According to Carter, Cantrell failed the city on many fronts, including the soaring violent crime rate, questionable expenditures, inadequate garbage removal, and broken streetlights.

Last month, Cantrell was slammed for using more than $50,000 in taxpayer funds to cover bodyguard services. She was also accused of spending $175,000 in campaign funds on a personal stylist and shopper.

Earlier this year, it was revealed that Cantrell used $29,000 in taxpayer money to pay for first-class tickets to Europe.

""My travel accommodations are a matter of safety, not of luxury,"" Cantrell stated in defense of the expenses. ""Anyone who wants to question how I protect myself just doesn't understand the world Black women walk in.""

The recall effort, which has been airing television advertisements and sending mailers to voters, hopes to gain at least 70,000 signatures supporting Cantrell's recall. The deadline for the petition is February 22, 2023, and it only requires around 53,000 valid voter signatures to pass.

Carter accused Cantrell of ""quiet quitting,"" a term used to refer to employees who only do the bare minimum, and cited the mayor's absence at several important city events and meetings.

""The national term 'quiet quitting,' that's what our mayor has done,"" Carter told Fox News Digital. ""Our mayor literally won't say the word 'crime.' She has disassociated herself from crime. She refuses to be involved it in at all.""

Cantrell defended her record by stating, ""The budget hearings that are underway right now speak to my work that my administration and team have done and continue to do for the city of New Orleans relative to public safety, relative to housing, relative to infrastructure, and I can literally go on and on.""

As of September, New Orleans was declared the murder capital of the country following a 140% increase in homicides in 2022. The New Orleans Police Department told Fox News Digital that the department investigated 248 murders this year, compared to 218 in 2021. Shootings, armed robberies, and carjackings are also up compared to last year.

Further exacerbating the crime issue is the city's law enforcement staffing shortage. In 2021, the New Orleans Police Department lost more than 150 officers. Additionally, the department's superintendent, Shaun Ferguson, announced his retirement last week.

The mayor has dismissed the recall attempt as a Republican-backed effort to ""undermine and discredit the first Black woman mayor of New Orleans.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/raskin-claims-gop-push-trump-house-speaker,2022-12-16
66% of Americans say US is in recession or worse: Poll,"While the White House refuses to say that the United States is in a recession, a significant majority of Americans say that the country is in a recession or something even worse, according to a new poll.

A recent Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll of 1,000 registered U.S. voters conducted between July 22 and July 25, 2022, asked participants if the U.S. economy is in an economic recovery, stagnation, recession, or depression.

Over 50% of respondents said the U.S. is in a recession, plus nearly 16% who declared that the country is suffering through a depression. There was an additional 18% who felt the nation was experiencing stagnation. Only 9% felt the U.S. was in an economic recovery.

The Biden administration has been lampooned for attempting to change the traditional definition of recession – which is widely accepted as two consecutive quarters of decline in a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Even left-leaning CNN mocked the Biden administration for attempting to change the definition of a recession.

Brian Deese – director of the National Economic Council –had his old definition of recession come back to haunt him this week as he tried to protect the Biden administration.

The survey found that 58% of Americans said that they were going out to eat less often because of inflation.

The sputtering economy has taken a toll on President Joe Biden's job approval.

A mere 15% of voters ""strongly approve"" of President Biden's job performance, while 55% of Americans ""somewhat disapprove"" or ""strongly disapprove.""

There were 46% of Americans who said they want a Congress who stands up to President Biden, versus 42% who want lawmakers who cooperate with the president.

With the midterm elections only 101 days away, Americans were asked what issues would affect their vote in November.

The top voter issue is the economy (20%), followed by abortion (15%), inflation and the cost of living (10%), and immigration (4%).

Gun control, climate change, and healthcare were all under 4%.

Voters were asked if Democrats and Republicans do a proficient job of representing the political views of Americans, or if a third party or multiple parties are necessary. There were 24% who said the two major parties were good enough, but there were 26% who said a third party is necessary and 33% who said multiple parties are necessary.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/recall-effort-launched-against-dem-mayor-after-city-labeled-murder-capital-mayor-criticized-for-using-taxpayer-funds-for-upgraded-international-travel,2022-07-30
Report says Democrat voters in GOP primary helped Georgia secretary of state win,"Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who surprised many by winning last week's Republican primary in the face of opposition from former President Donald Trump, may have had unexpected help in the election from an unlikely source: Democratic voters.

The state of Georgia has an open primary system, where anyone can vote in party primary elections, i.e. Democrats voting for Republicans in the GOP primary and vice versa. According to an Associated Press analysis of early voting records, more than 37,000 people who voted in Georgia's Democratic primary two years ago crossed over to vote in the GOP primary this year, an ""unusually high number."" The AP reported that these so-called crossover voters tipped the scales in several Republican contests, bailing out incumbents like Raffensperger who faced challenges from the right.

Raffensperger was one of Trump's top targets for defeat, since the former president holds a grudge against the secretary of state for refusing to go along with his false claims that the 2020 presidential election in Georgia was stolen.

Yet when the votes were counted last Tuesday, Raffensperger won more than 50% of the primary ballots, clearing the threshold to avoid a runoff election against Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.) by more than 27,000 votes. Hice was endorsed by Trump.

The AP's analysis found 37,144 former Democratic voters voted in the Republican primary, giving Raffensperger the push he needed to win outright. The AP reported that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp did not need Democratic votes to secure his blowout victory against the Trump-endorsed former U.S. senator David Perdue.

In a statement, Raffensperger's campaign denied that Democrats made the difference in the race.

“It is clear that Brad Raffensperger carried a majority of the Republican vote here in the state of Georgia and that there are people who stopped voting in Republican primaries after 2016 who are now reengaged,” campaign consultant Jordan Fuchs told the AP.

Trump, meanwhile, was not happy. He spoke out against open primaries while campaigning in Wyoming on Saturday, where he has endorsed Harriet Hageman against Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). Cheney has openly courted Democrats and independents to fend off her primary challenger.

“Don’t let the Democrats do what they did in another state last week,” he told supporters, urging them to support a change to state law that would ban crossover voting.

In March, Wyoming legislators failed to advance a bill that would have prohibited voters from changing their party registration on Election Day so they could vote in another party's primary election.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/recession-us-poll-biden-economy,2022-05-31
"Reporters show no mercy over Biden classified docs, Jean-Pierre begs them not to be 'contentious'","Reporters intensely grilled White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday over the classified documents found at President Joe Biden's former private office.

Important questions loom after the White House revealed Biden's personal attorneys discovered classified documents on Nov. 2, six days before the midterm election. The White House is stressing that Biden's team did the ""right thing"" and being transparent, but the administration is not answering why they waited more than two months to disclose the discovery.

CBS News reporter Ed O'Keefe pressed Jean-Pierre on that precise point.

""Why didn't he or someone in the White House inform the American people when these documents were discovered on Nov. 2?"" O'Keefe asked. ""Did it have anything to do — because people are asking this part of it — did it have anything to do with the fact that the election was just a few days away?""

The press secretary, however, refused to answer the question. But O'Keefe was not deterred.

""But here's another thing: There was nothing stopping the president of the United States from disclosing the discovery of these classified documents in his former office before it was under Justice Department review,"" the reporter followed up. ""So why didn't he disclose it?""

In response, Jean-Pierre did not answer the question and deferred to Biden's comments.

Earlier in her exchange with O'Keefe, Jean-Pierre begged him not to be ""contentious,"" saying, ""We don't need to have this kind of confrontation."" She promised to answer his questions, but only ignored them.

NBC News reporter Kristen Welker later confronted Jean-Pierre over Biden's promise to maintain a ""spirit of transparency"" as president.

""How is it possible that the White House did not reveal the presence of these documents prior to the election when they were found?"" she asked, suggesting the delayed action contradicts Biden's promise.

Jean-Pierre, however, refused to answer that question. She vowed not to ""go beyond"" what the White House counsel's office said on Monday and what Biden said on Tuesday while in Mexico.

When Welker pressed her point, Jean-Pierre stressed that Biden's lawyers ""did the right thing"" by turning the documents over to the National Archives. She still did not answer why, if the White House is being transparent and did the ""right thing,"" the administration waited two months after the election to disclose the discovery.

Finally, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy used Biden's own words to question Jean-Pierre about the classified documents, recalling what he said about former President Donald Trump.

""On these documents: How could anyone be that irresponsible? Isn't that what his president says about mishandling classified documents?"" Doocy asked.

In response, Jean-Pierre only said that Biden takes ""seriously"" proper handling of classified information and was ""surprised"" to learn that highly classified intelligence documents were stored at his private office.

Biden, of course, is so serious about classified documents that he allegedly mishandled them by retaining them in not just one, but at least two different locations. Details about the second batch of documents — including where they were stored, how many classified documents were improperly stored, and their level of classification — were not disclosed.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-says-democrat-voters-in-gop-primary-helped-georgia-secretary-of-state-win,2023-01-12
"Republican high school students can criticize abortion proposal during morning announcements, federal judge rules","Republican students at one Michigan high school may issue a morning announcement that criticizes a statewide abortion proposal on the ballot this year, a federal judge has ruled.

On Friday, Judge Paul D. Borman of the Eastern District of Michigan determined that administrators at Skyline High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of conservative students when they forbade the students to make an announcement that denounced Proposal 3, a proposal on the Michigan ballot this year that would make abortion a state constitutional right.

On October 21, the Skyline Republican Club and its president, a minor whose name has not been given, submitted the following message for the morning announcements:

""Attention Students: Are you interested in joining our efforts to protect the health of women and children by joining us in our fight to defeat Proposal 3? If proposal 3 is passed it would eliminate health and safety regulations, legalize late term and partial birth abortion, no longer require physicians to perform abortions, and eliminate informed consent laws. If so, email us at skylinerepublicanclub@gmail.com.""

However, school employee Laurie Adams told the group that day that their announcement would not be read because of its ""political nature."" School secretary Jefferson Bilsborrow reaffirmed that decision. Principal Cory McElmeel did as well in an email dated October 28.

Administrators still refused to air the message, even after the club later eliminated the phrase ""by joining us in our fight to defeat Proposal 3,"" which could be viewed as a political call to action. As a result, David Nielsen, his son, and the group sued the school for violating their First Amendment rights.

Judge Borman sided with the plaintiffs, arguing that the school sought ""to silence"" their ""appropriate speech"" against the proposal, even as the school had either directly or indirectly approved of student demonstrations in favor of it.



Court documents indicate that school administrators knew that a student chapter of the National Organization of Women had organized a ""walk-out"" in favor of Proposal 3 on school property during school hours on Nov. 7. ""Permitting students in favor of Proposal 3 to cut classes, and to demonstrate on school property in favor of Proposal 3,"" while at the same time rejecting the anti-Proposal 3 message from the Republican Club because of its ""political nature,"" violated the club members' ""rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution,"" Borman wrote on Friday.



With the midterm elections just days away, Borman ordered the school to read the amended version of the message, the one without the political call to action, during morning announcements on Nov. 7.

The Thomas More Law Center, an Ann Arbor legal nonprofit that represented the plaintiffs in this case, is celebrating the ruling as a victory for students and free speech.

""The Constitution protects a student’s right to have a different viewpoint from others and share it within the walls of a public school,"" stated TMLC attorney Erin Mersino, who is handling the case. ""How else will students learn tolerance toward opinions to which they disagree or how to thrive in our pluralistic society? The Supreme Court cautioned against viewpoint discrimination in the schools, warning it creates 'enclaves of totalitarianism.'""

""Public schools across our nation are stifling the free speech of conservative students and organizations,"" added TMLC president Richard Thompson. ""We are working to defend their constitutional rights — rights which the Supreme Court so famously said, they do not lose by merely entering the schoolhouse gate.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/reporters-grill-jean-pierre-classified-docs,2022-11-07
"Republican lawmakers call on NIH and NSF to stop funding 'reckless' EcoHealth Alliance, closely linked to communist Chinese Wuhan lab and gain-of-function research","On October 7, over 30 House and Senate Republicans sent letters to Lawrence A. Tabak, the director of the National Institutes of Health, as well as to Sethuraman Panchanathan, director of the National Science Foundation. Both letters called for the suspension of federal funding to EcoHealth Alliance.

The lawmakers stressed the urgency of ending the American agencies' ""grant relationship with EcoHealth to protect taxpayer funding and end dangerous experiments that jeopardize public health.""

Mixed signals

On September 21, one month after the NIH notified EcoHealth that its sub-award was terminated for ""material non-compliance with terms and conditions of the award,"" the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, run by Anthony Fauci, awarded a grant to EcoHealth valued at $653,392 for 2022.

Eight days later, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) introduced a bill to prohibit federal funding to the organization.

Ernst told the Daily Caller that ""[g]iving taxpayer money to EcoHealth to study pandemic prevention is like paying a suspected arsonist to conduct fire safety inspections.""

In the meantime, Republican lawmakers have sought to preclude federal agencies from giving additional funds to EcoHealth, delineating their reasons in two strongly-worded letters, the first of which was to the NIH.

The letter to the NIH

Republicans highlighted EcoHealth's ""lengthy history of reporting failures and collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV),"" noting that the WIV ""is a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) laboratory and the likely origin of the COVID-19 pandemic.""



Although the lawmakers indicated that EcoHealth's transmission of American tax dollars to the WIV for projects involved in gain-of-function research was itself problematic, they found its obstructionism and aversion to transparency even more troubling.

The letter referenced how, in 2020, Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth, called NIH requests that U.S. federal officials inspect the WIV ""heinous,"" and derided suggestions that the virus might have leaked from the WIV — to which his organization had directed a significant amount of taxpayer funds — as ""conspiracy theories.""

The authors of the letter did not hold back in their characterization of EcoHealth as undeserving of funding, suggesting the organization was dishonest, failure-prone, collaborative with the CCP, and exhibitive of a ""reckless disregard for federal laws and U.S. taxpayers.""

They recommended that the NIH turn off the spigot and end funding to the organization.



The letter to the NSF

Republican lawmakers called into question the NSF's recent decision to award a $1 million grant for a project that would include EcoHealth. Although EcoHealth is not the primary recipient, it is allegedly set to receive $90,000. The letter indicated that in addition to this sum, the NSF was planning also to give $263,801 to the controversial organization.

Unlike the letter to the NIH, which does not mention Peter Daszak by name except in a footnote, the letter to the NSF calls out Daszak for leading ""an unsubstantiated, coordinated effort to deflect blame from the WIV and EcoHealth.""

Republican lawmakers referenced an NIH letter condemning EcoHealth, suggesting its ""inability or unwillingness to provide ... documentation to us upon request raises questions about the quality and rigor of EcoHealth's record-keeping.""

The lawmakers added another excerpt from the NIH's letter, which stated, ""EcoHealth has demonstrated a history of failure to comply with several elements of the terms and conditions of grant awards.""

The lab



Much of Daszak's defensiveness and EcoHealth's spotty record is centered around its relationship with communist China's sometimes-bioweapons lab.

The U.S. State Department previously stated that, prior to the first identified case of the COVID-19 outbreak, ""several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019 ... with symptoms consistent"" with the virus, raising doubts about the ""the credibility of WIV senior researcher Shi Zhengli's public claim that there was 'zero infection' among the WIV's staff and students of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-related viruses.""

Suspicions were heightened after the CCP prevented independent journalists, investigators, and global authorities from interviewing researchers at the WIV, including those who first took ill in the fall of 2019.

Although there are myriad of reasons to suspect that the WIV was ground zero for COVID-19, the House Foreign Affairs Committee Minority Staff Report on the origins of the COVID-19 global pandemic emphasized several, including:

12 Republican senators vote for gay marriage bill,"A dozen Senate Republicans joined with Democrats to pass a piece of pro-gay marriage legislation in a 61-36 vote on Tuesday.

The 12 GOP senators who voted for the measure included: Roy Blunt of Missouri, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Susan Collins of Maine, Joni Ernst of Iowa; Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Rob Portman of Ohio, Mitt Romney of Utah, and Todd Young of Indiana.

Another version of the bill cleared the House chamber earlier this year with support from dozens of GOP lawmakers, so the Senate-approved measure will likely sail though the House of Representatives and head to President Biden's desk.

The so-called ""Respect for Marriage Act"" would bar states from refusing to recognize marriages from other states on the basis of factors like sex and race. The measure also stipulates that if marital status is a concern for any federal law, individuals should be viewed as married if their marriage was valid in the state it occurred.

Due to the Supreme Court's 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, states are currently required to allow and recognize homosexual marriages.

Earlier this year when the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v.Wade abortion decision, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion in which he suggested that other high court decisions, including the gay marriage ruling, should be struck down.

Thomas wrote that ""in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell."" He noted, ""After overruling these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question would remain whether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myriad rights that our substantive due process cases have generated.""

In a statement about the measure passing through the Senate on Tuesday, Biden said that ""the United States is on the brink of reaffirming a fundamental truth: love is love, and Americans should have the right to marry the person they love.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republican-lawmakers-call-on-nih-and-nsf-to-stop-funding-reckless-ecohealth-alliance-closely-linked-to-communist-chinese-wuhan-lab-and-gain-of-function-research,2022-11-30
Two Republicans huddled with Ocasio-Cortez — and revealed what McCarthy boasted behind closed doors: 'Would never do that',"Two Republican lawmakers — Reps. Paul Gosar (Ariz.) and Matt Gaetz (Fla.) — were seen conversing with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday, unusual meetings considering the ideological chasm dividing the lawmakers.

Reporters later learned the Republicans had huddled with Ocasio-Cortez to ensure that Democrats would not help Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) win the speakership.

What are the details?

Gosar reportedly told Ocasio-Cortez that McCarthy boasted in private meetings with Republicans that even if some GOP members refused to support his speakership bid, Democrats would eventually help him by not showing up to vote.

But Ocasio-Cortez told ABC News reporter Gabe Ferris that she confirmed with Gosar that Democrats ""would never do that.""

Current House procedure dictates that a candidate for speaker must earn a majority of roll-call votes to win the speakership. But if some members vote ""present"" or do not show up for the roll-call vote, then a speaker candidate may win by earning a plurality of votes, so long as there is a quorum of members present.

Ocasio-Cortez later revealed that Gaetz had relayed the same message — that McCarthy said Democrats would walk away from the vote to lower the number of votes he needs to become speaker — and she similarly denied it.

The Intercept reported:

Gaetz told Ocasio-Cortez that McCarthy has been telling Republicans that he’ll be able to cut a deal with Democrats to vote present, enabling him to win a majority of those present and voting, according to Ocasio-Cortez. She told Gaetz that wasn’t happening, and also double-checked with Democratic party leadership, confirming there’d be no side deal.



""McCarthy was suggesting he could get Dems to walk away to lower his threshold,” Ocasio-Cortez told The Intercept of her conversation with Gaetz on McCarthy’s failed ploy. “And I fact checked and said absolutely not.”

What is the problem?

A faction of about 20 Republicans are blocking McCarthy's bid for the speaker because they believe his leadership will empower the status quo of Washington.

The House will reconvene on Wednesday for more rounds of voting. The last time a speaker was not elected on the first roll-call vote happened in 1923, when it required nine ballots to elect a speaker. It remains unclear whether McCarthy can shore up enough support to prevent endless voting.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-back-gay-marriage-billrepublicans-back-gay-marriage-bill,2023-01-04
Republican senators push pro-gay marriage legislation,"Several Senate Republicans are prepared to join Democrats in approving a measure that would help advance the pro-gay marriage agenda.

While the Supreme Court already forced all states to allow and recognize same-sex marriages in its 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision, earlier this year, House lawmakers, including dozens of Republicans, passed the Respect for Marriage Act, a measure that would enshrine into law a prohibition against states refusing to recognize marriages from other states on the basis of factors such as sex and race.

The legislation would bar states from denying ""full faith and credit to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State pertaining to a marriage between individuals, on the basis of the sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin of those individuals,"" according to the measure.

A bipartisan group of senators is pushing an amendment to the Respect for Marriage Act, which includes language that is supposed to protect religious liberty. Those lawmakers, who include GOP Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Susan Collins of Maine, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, issued a statement promoting their version of the measure.

""The Respect for Marriage Act is a needed step to provide millions of loving couples in same-sex and interracial marriages the certainty that they will continue to enjoy the freedoms, rights, and responsibilities afforded to all other marriages,"" the lawmakers said in the statement. ""Through bipartisan collaboration, we've crafted commonsense language to confirm that this legislation fully respects and protects Americans’ religious liberties and diverse beliefs, while leaving intact the core mission of the legislation to protect marriage equality. We look forward to this legislation coming to the floor and are confident that this amendment has helped earn the broad, bipartisan support needed to pass our commonsense legislation into law.""

The Hill reported that GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah said that he would vote for the measure if the religious freedom amendment is added. ""If that amendment is attached to the bill, I'll vote for it,"" Romney said, according to the outlet.

If the measure clears the Senate, it will still need to clear the House before heading to President Joe Biden.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-meet-aoc-speaker-fight,2022-11-15
Respect for Marriage Act will 'expose religious schools and nonprofits to lawsuits': Conservative think tank spends $1M to run ads during NFL games against codifying new bill,"The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, is spending more than $1 million to run advertisements during the Thanksgiving weekend NFL and college football games to warn Americans that the new Respect for Marriage Act will ""expose religious schools and nonprofits to lawsuits,"" Fox News Digital reported. It is the biggest campaign the Heritage Foundation has ever launched.

The Respect for Marriage Act's final vote in the Senate is scheduled for Monday, which, if passed, will codify the right to same-sex marriage.

The Heritage Foundation argued that the bill is deceptively named because it does not give same-sex couples new rights. The foundation also warned that it would leave religious schools and nonprofits vulnerable to litigation, which could give the IRS grounds to revoke tax-exempt statuses from religious groups.

""America's religious liberty is under attack with this impending vote in the Senate,"" Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts told Fox News Digital. ""This legislation does not add one additional benefit to same-sex couples in the United States; it's an attack that sets the stage to take rights away from people of faith. What it does accomplish is deputizing radical activists to target Americans who cannot in good faith endorse anything other than a man-woman marriage. The American people deserve all the facts.""

The Heritage Foundation accused Democrats of ""hurrying to cram through their far-left agenda"" before Republicans take the majority in the House next year.

Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah proposed an amendment to the legislation to guarantee religious liberty protections, but Democratic lawmakers have refused to put the amendment to a vote.

""Republican senators claiming the bill protects religious liberty are misleading the public,"" Roger Severino, the Heritage Foundation's vice president of domestic policy, told Fox News Digital. ""Their refusal to require Sen. Lee's amendment is proof of their insincerity.""

Lee noted that he voted against the measure last week, calling the legislation's religious liberty protections ""severely anemic and largely illusory.""

""Religious Americans will be subject to potentially ruinous litigation, while the tax-exempt status of certain charitable organizations, educational institutions and nonprofits will be threatened,"" Lee stated.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/republicans-push-gay-marriage-bill,2022-11-23
"Restaurant cancels Christian group's event just before start time because eatery's staffers — many of whom are LGBTQ+ — felt 'uncomfortable,' 'unsafe'","A Virginia restaurant canceled a Christian group's event reportedly less than two hours before the start time last week, and the venue said the reason was because the eatery's staffers — many of whom are LGBTQ+ — felt ""uncomfortable"" and ""unsafe.""

What are the details?

The Family Foundation — a Richmond-based outfit affiliated with Focus on the Family — said Metzger Bar & Butchery, also in Richmond, ""refused to service our pre-reserved event, leaving us scrambling just moments before"" the start time Wednesday night.

The Family Foundation — which advocates for ""policies based on biblical principles that enable families to flourish at the state and local level"" — added that ""for weeks, we had planned a gathering of supporters and interested people in a private room to fellowship and receive an update on our work. About an hour and a half before the event was set to take place, one of the restaurant’s owners called our team to cancel the event.""

The Family Foundation said its vice president of operations explained to the restaurant that ""guests were arriving ... shortly"" and requested an explanation. ""Sure enough, an employee looked up our organization, and their wait staff refused to serve us,"" the Family Foundation added.

More from the group:

Welcome to the double standard of the left, where some believe Jack Phillips must be forced to create a wedding cake as part of the celebration of a same-sex ceremony but any business should be able to deny basic goods and services to those who hold biblical values around marriage.



At The Family Foundation, we believe individuals in private business should not have to violate their convictions, which for some Christians means not celebrating what God has declared sin (Romans 1:32). However, most, if not all, faiths not only allow for the provision of services, like food, to those with whom they disagree, but they also encourage it.

The Family Foundation noted that after being denied service, it was able to ""pivot to another restaurant in time to hold our event"" and that ""our witness will not be diminished, and we will not be silenced. We will speak out when we see this type of religious discrimination occurring in Virginia.""

What did the restaurant have to say?

Metzger Bar & Butchery posted an explanation Friday to Instagram:

The restaurant said, ""Recently we refused service to a group that had booked an event with us after the owners of Metzger found out it was a group of donors to a political organization that seeks to deprive women and LGBTQ+ persons of their basic human rights in Virginia. We have always refused service to anyone making our staff uncomfortable or unsafe and this was the driving force behind our decision. Many of our staff are women and/or members of the LGBTQ+ community.""

Anything else?

Also on Friday, the restaurant announced it was ""so grateful to our many guests and neighbors for their support the past few days"" and that to say ""thank you,"" it was donating all proceeds from those buying a particular cocktail that night to Equality Virginia, which calls itself ""the leading advocacy organization"" in the state ""seeking equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/respect-for-marriage-act-will-expose-religious-schools-and-nonprofits-to-lawsuits-conservative-think-tank-spends-1m-to-run-ads-during-nfl-games-against-codifying-new-bill,2022-12-05
Michigan prosecutor announces charges against man who shot elderly pro-life canvasser,"A Michigan man who admitted to shooting a pro-life canvasser was charged by prosecutors after a weeklong investigation.

Richard Harvey claimed that he fired off a warning shot and then ""accidentally"" shot the 84-year-old woman when he used the gun to bat her arms away. He and his wife also claimed that the woman was argumentative and refused to leave their property when asked numerous times.

She told prosecutors that she was walking away peacefully when she was shot.

On Friday, the Michigan State Police released a statement about the charges against Harvey.

""Following an investigation by the Michigan State Police Lakeview Post, Ionia County Prosecutor, Kyle Butler, has issued a three-count warrant for Richard Alan Harvey, age 74, of Lake Odessa,"" the statement read.

The man was charged with one count each of assault with a dangerous weapon: felonious assault, careless discharge of firearm causing injury, and reckless use of a firearm. The charges carry a sentence of four years in prison, two years in prison, and 90 days in jail, respectively, if he's found guilty.

He was given a bond of $10,000.

Joan Jacobson, the woman who was shot, spoke to the Detroit News about her version of the incident. She said that Sharon Harvey got upset during their interaction and told her to leave the property. Jacobson said she was complying with the request and was going to her car when she got shot.

""I realized that I saw a man, and the man was standing right beside her,"" Jacobson explained. ""And the next thing I knew, I heard a shot and I felt some pain. I was just stunned. The pain was in my back, and it was very severe.""

Richard Harvey told WOOD-TV that he accidentally fired while batting away the clipboard in Jacobson's hand.

""She’s waving it around. I’m thinking she’s going to smack Sharon with it. So without thinking, I went to club it away with the rifle and my finger was still in the trigger guard,"" he said.

Jacobson said that doctors told her the bullet narrowly missed her spine and she was very lucky.

Rick Scott challenges Mitch McConnell for Senate GOP leader,"Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida is mounting a bid to challenge Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for the position of Senate GOP leader.

""I'm writing to you today because I believe it's time for the Senate Republican Conference to be far more bold and resolute than we have been in the past. We must start saying what we are for, not just what we are against,"" Scott wrote in a letter to colleagues that has been posted by Fox News.

""We know that chief among our problems in races across America was a lack of Republican voter turnout. There may be many reasons for that, but after travelling the country to support our candidates I believe voters want a plan. They are begging us to tell them what we will do when we are in charge. Unfortunately, we have continued to elect leadership who refuses to do that and elicits attacks on anyone that does. That is clearly not working and it’s time for bold change,"" he wrote.

Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, made multiple pledges about how he would handle the role if elected to serve as Senate GOP leader, some of which included that he will never ask legislators to vote on a measure they have not had a chance to review and that he will never push them to vote in a manner that goes against the best interest of their state or the platform on which they ran for office .

""I will work tirelessly to help elect all Republican Senators, whether they are likely to support me or not,"" Scott wrote. ""I will never surprise you with legislation and ask that you vote on something you haven’t had an opportunity to review,"" he noted. ""I will lead the conference in developing a positive, aspirational agenda that outlines our legislative goals and what Senate Republicans stand for,"" he pledged. ""I will never pressure you to vote in a way that is counter to what you campaigned on or not in the best interests of your state.""

Democrats will maintain control of the U.S. Senate next year, so the Senate GOP leader will be the Senate minority leader rather than the Senate majority leader.

McConnell, a lawmaker from Kentucky who has served in the Senate chamber for more than three decades, has been either the Senate minority leader or majority leader since 2007.

Former President Donald Trump has been a strong critic of McConnell, referring to him in September as a ""lapdog"" for Democrats and an ""absolute Loser ... who folds every time against the Democrats.""

"Rifle raffle to raise money for youth football players, cheerleaders in N. Carolina community blasted with backlash — but then support rolls in from across country","A rifle raffle to raise money for youth football players and cheerleaders in a North Carolina community was blasted with backlash recently — but when the league's story went national, support for its endeavor rolled in from across country, Fox News reported.

What are the details?

The East Henderson Youth Football and Cheerleading League in East Flat Rock — about a half hour southeast of Asheville and with just over 6,000 people — offered the winner of its raffle an FN 15 Patrol Carbine M-LOK 16"", an ArmaLite 15-style rifle with a suggested retail price of $1,299, the cable network said.

Football players in the parent-run league range in age from 5 to 13 years old, and cheer team members range in age from 4 to 13 years old, Fox News said, citing the EHYFCL.

When word got out about the raffle, the cable network said the league was hit with criticism — yet refused to cave.

""We kicked off this fundraiser with the expectation that it would raise enough money to purchase a few new shoulder pads, some new padded football pants, which we are in desperate need of, and have enough funds to get us through to next season,"" a mother with the league told Fox News. ""What we never expected was for a parent to take her grievances to the local news station instead of having a conversation with us. That is particularly frustrating. We certainly didn't expect to be headline news across the nation.""

The parent said the rifle raffle is inappropriate for a children's league and told WLOS-TV, ""I was honestly shocked when I received the message that the children were going to be selling an assault rifle because of what’s going on at schools around the country."" The parent added to the local station, “I thought it was in very bad taste for them to choose a weapon that is being used against children.""

Pushback against the pushback

But the mother with the league told Fox News that initial stories about the raffle were full of ""false headlines, misleading reports, and inaccurate information,"" and that some articles ""took direct quotes from our page and changed our very own words to advance their own narrative.""

The cable network said in its Sept. 4 article about the backlash, the mother with the league indicated that the raffle met legal requirements — and that the rifle in question is not an assault rifle.

""Some reports even added information that puts our children in more danger than selling tickets to a legal raffle ever would,"" the mother added, according to Fox News. ""Our practice locations were broadcast in one article; other articles reported us as schools in our area. We've received hate mail, nasty messages, uninformed opinions, pushback ...""

Support starts rolling in

She noted to the cable network that once folks around the country started hearing about the attacks against the league and its raffle, support came rolling in.

""In a time when our world has felt so small, so godless, so dark and so lonely, our world grew brighter this past week,"" she told Fox News. ""From coast to coast there has been an overwhelming wave of support for not only [for] our league, but our community as well.""

The mother added to the cable network that ""there are not many states we haven't had at least one person reach out from.""

'We have far surpassed our goals'

She also told Fox News that the support has translated into tangible gains.

""We have far surpassed our goals and now have the ability to pass those blessings on to others in need,"" she added to the cable network. ""We have read every message, transaction note, and email that has come our way. The supportive messages are coming from both retired and active military personnel, law enforcement officers, firefighters, fellow youth organization leaders, teachers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, and grandparents trying to save our backwards society.""

The mother with the league also told Fox News that supporters deserve thanks for ""teaching [our children] to have a backbone, to stand up for what they believe in, to protect our constitutional rights, and to not back down to bullying. Everyone wants to talk about bullying, but no one wants to stand up against them. When someone finally does stand up, they are the ones who are punished, not the bully. We've all had enough.""

The popular artist confirmed the reports by posting a photograph of her holding a football to her Instagram account with more than half a million followers.

However, in 2019, she forcefully criticized the NFL when she was asked if she had turned down the opportunity to headline the half time show over the Kaepernick protest.

“Absolutely,” she said at the time.

“I couldn’t dare do that. For what?"" she asked. ""Who gains from that? Not my people. I just couldn’t be a sellout. I couldn’t be an enabler. There’s things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.”

Kaepernick used his prominent platform as an NFL quarterback to kneel down during the performance of the national anthem at games. Many on the left have accused the league of racism over his absence from any team's roster, but others have pointed out that most team owners likely want to avoid the inevitable controversy that would come from signing him.

Rap artist Cardi B also said that she refused to perform at the halftime show out of respect for the Kaepernick protest.

“You have to sacrifice that,” she explained. “I got to sacrifice a lot of money to perform. But there’s a man who sacrificed his job for us, so we got to stand behind him.”

Rihanna has been celebrated by many after she became the youngest self-made billionaire in the U.S. through a deal with her popular Fenty retail companies.

"RNC accuses presidential debate commission of bias, withdraws from process","Any Republican who wants to run for president will be required to sign a pledge that they will only appear in party-sanctioned primary and general election debates after the Republican National Committee voted unanimously Thursday to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates.

Republicans have for years complained that the nonprofit and self-described nonpartisan debate commission has been biased towards Democrats. Now the RNC has followed through on threats to pull Republican candidates out of the debate process. At a meeting in Tennessee, party leadership passed a resolution that reads in part: ""Any presidential primary candidate who does not agree in writing, or who participates in any debate that is not a sanctioned debate, shall not be eligible to participate in any further sanctioned debates.”

The Wall Street Journal reports that the RNC will form a working group to sanction debates based on input from presidential campaigns on the timing, frequency, format, media outlet, candidate qualifications, and whatever is in the ""best interest of the Republican Party,"" among other considerations.

“Debates are an important part of the democratic process, and the RNC is committed to free and fair debates. The Commission on Presidential Debates is biased and has refused to enact simple and commonsense reforms to help ensure fair debates including hosting debates before voting begins and selecting moderators who have never worked for candidates on the debate stage,"" RNC chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said in a statement.

""Today, the RNC voted to withdraw from the biased CPD, and we are going to find newer, better debate platforms to ensure that future nominees are not forced to go through the biased CPD in order to make their case to the American people,” she added.



The RNC's decision to withdraw comes after former President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign made several complaints about the debate process and the moderators selected by the CPD in the last election.

During the first debate between Trump and Joe Biden, for instance, moderator Chris Wallace singled out Trump with a question asking him to condemn ""white supremacists and right-wing militia,"" even though Trump had already done so publicly. The former Fox News host did not ask Biden about Antifa and did not push back when Biden later claimed during the debate that the radical anarchist group ""is an idea, not an organization.""

The Trump campaign also lodged complaints about the CPD's decision to switch the second debate to a virtual format because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and about the planned moderator, then-CSPAN anchor Steve Scully, because he had once interned in Biden's senate office as a college student. The second debate was ultimately canceled because an agreement on the format could not be reached.

Before the third 2020 debate, Trump's team loudly objected to the exclusion of foreign policy as a topic, alleging that the topics selected by moderator Kristen Welker were picked so that Trump could not attack Biden over his son Hunter Biden's business dealings in foreign countries.

But Republican and conservative complaints about presidential debates moderated by liberal-leaning journalists existed well before Trump. The second debate between then-candidate Mitt Romney and former President Barack Obama in 2012 became controversial after CNN moderator Candy Crowley came to Obama's defense after Romney claimed he had hesitated to call the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi an act of terror. At one point, it appeared as if Romney was debating Crowley and Obama at the same time. The late conservative talk radio legend Rush Limbaugh called the episode ""an act of journalistic terror.""

The RNC's statement made several accusations of bias against the CPD, which was formed in 1987 and sponsors general election debates between the major candidates for president and vice president every four years.

Republicans charged that the CPD showed bias by:

Waiting until 26 states had begun early voting before hosting the first presidential debate in 2020.

Making unilateral changes to previously agreed-upon debate formats and conditions, in some cases without even notifying the candidates.

Selecting a moderator in 2020 who had once worked for Joe Biden.

Failing to maintain the organization’s strict nonpartisanship, with a majority of its Board Members publicly disparaging the Republican-nominee.

In response to the RNC's announcement, Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison accused Republicans gross moral corruption.

""Typical CYA… you didn’t pass a party platform… your leader praises Putin… your members hang out at cocaine orgies… actively trying to destroy Medicare, ACA & Social Security… rampant voter suppression ... can fully understand why you don’t want a debate,"" Harrison tweeted.

The RNC's statement emphasized, ""we are not walking away from debates. We are walking away from the CPD.""

"'Night of rage' protests erupt into violence across the country: Fox News HQ targeted, fireworks shot at police, pro-life woman attacked, journalists assaulted","Protests erupted across the country following the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. In major U.S. cities, pro-abortion protesters violently clashed with law enforcement on Friday.

Washington, D.C.

Antifa-linked pro-abortion group Jane's Revenge vowed to undertake a ""night of rage"" after the Supreme Court's ruling on allowing states to make the final call about abortion. Black bloc protesters wielding umbrellas marched through the streets of Washington, D.C.

The group chanted slogans such as, ""If abortion ain’t safe, neither are you,"" ""If we don’t get it, burn it down,"" ""Every city, every town, burn the precinct to the ground,"" and ""F*** the church, f*** the state, we won't let them decide our fate."" The protesters burned American flags.

Footage from the protests were provided by Fox News associate producer Lisa Bennatan, Post Millennial correspondent Hannah Nighting, Washington Examiner's Matt Miller, and TPUSA contributor Drew Hernandez.

New York City

At least 25 people were arrested in New York City during protests on Friday night. The mob targeted the News Corp building – the headquarters of Fox News. Video from Oliya Scootercaster shows vandals scrawled graffiti on the News Corp building and chanted, ""Shame,"" and ""F*** Tucker Carlson!""





Los Angeles

Pro-abortion protesters shut down the 110 Freeway in downtown Los Angles. El American field journalist Anthony Cabassa captured the moment a vehicle drove through the blockade, and a man slams the car with a pole.

Pro-abortion activists clashed with LAPD officers. Fireworks were launched at police officers, and a man attempted to burn cops with a homemade flamethrower, Post Millennial editor Andy Ngo reported.

"DeSantis suspends progressive, Soros-backed state attorney who vowed not to enforce state laws on abortion and child sex operations: 'When you make yourself above the law, you have violated your duty'","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced on Thursday that progressive State Attorney Andrew Warren was suspended for neglect of duty and allegedly pledging not to uphold the laws of the state.

""We are suspending Soros-backed 13th Circuit State Attorney Andrew Warren for neglecting his duties as he pledges not to uphold the laws of the state,"" DeSantis' office said in a statement.

DeSantis targeted Warren, a Democrat, for vowing not to enforce state laws on abortion and child sex-change operations. DeSantis also noted that Warren promised a policy of ""presumptive non-enforcement.""

DeSantis made the announcement of Warren's suspension during a press conference in Tampa on Thursday morning.



""And so when you flagrantly violate your oath of office, when you make yourself above the law, you have violated your duty, you have neglected your duty, and you are displaying a lack of competence to be able to perform those duties, and so today, we are suspending State Attorney Andrew Warren, effective immediately,"" DeSantis stated.

Warren is the state attorney for the 13th Judicial Circuit, which covers all of Hillsborough County, including the city of Tampa.

""The constitution of Florida has vested the veto power in the governor, not in state attorneys,"" DeSantis said. ""We are not going to allow this pathogen that's been around the country of ignoring the law; we are not going let that get a foothold in the state of Florida.""

""Want to know why some people are moving to Florida? Because their communities are no longer safe, thanks to prosecutors that think they know better than the people's representatives, and they get to pick and choose which laws that they're enforcing,"" the Republican governor of Florida said.

“State attorneys have a duty to prosecute crimes as defined in Florida law, not to pick and choose which laws to enforce based on his personal agenda,” DeSantis declared. “It is my duty to hold Florida’s elected officials to the highest standards for the people of Florida.""

""We believe this is a law-and-order state; we are not going to back down,"" DeSantis proclaimed.

DeSantis claimed that money from outside Florida is ""really trying to push an agenda"" in the state.

""I don't think the people of Hillsborough County want to have an agenda that is basically woke, where you're deciding that your view of social justice means that certain laws should be enforced,"" the governor said.

DeSantis referred to how progressive, George Soros-backed San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin was recalled by mostly liberal voters after crime ran rampant in the city.

During the press conference, Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said the suspension of Warren wasn't political, noting it was about ""law and order.""



""There aren't Republican and Democratic victims – just victims,"" Chronister said. ""They matter, and they should be heard.""

Chronister accused Warren of being a ""supreme authority"" who ""single-handedly determines what crimes will be legal or illegal"" in the county.

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd listed the cities of Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York, Portland, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., as places where prosecutors are not enforcing the law and crime has been a major issue.

DeSantis spokesperson Christina Pushaw added, ""Progressive prosecutors backed by Soros have refused to enforce laws across the country. They treat criminals with deference & victims with contempt. This dereliction of duty is why crime is surging. But Gov. Ron DeSantis won’t stand for this. He just suspended the one in Florida.""

DeSantis suspended Warren under Article IV, Section 7 of the Constitution of the State of Florida, which empowers the governor to suspend state officials for reasons of misfeasance, malfeasance, neglect of duty, drunkenness, incompetence, permanent inability to perform official duties, or commission of a felony.



DeSantis replaced Warren with Judge Susan Lopez. She was appointed as a judge on the Hillsborough County Court in 2021 by DeSantis. Lopez previously served as assistant state attorney of the 13th Judicial Circuit for over 15 years and as staff attorney of the Second District Court of Appeal.



Lopez said, “I have the utmost respect for our state laws and I understand the important role that the State Attorney plays in ensuring the safety of our community and the enforcement of our laws. I want to thank the governor for placing his trust in me, and I promise that I will faithfully execute the duties of this office.”

The Tampa Bay Times previously described Warren as a ""frequent face touting progressive justice policies as Hillsborough County’s state attorney.""

On June 2, 2020, there was a George Floyd protest in downtown Tampa that escalated into property damage and violence. Police arrested 67 people for unlawful assembly.

Warren refused to prosecute those 67 individuals.

“I’ve said many times that criminal justice reform involves looking at each case as a problem to solve, not just a person to be punished,” Warren said at the time. “In these unlawful assembly cases, there is no value in filing charges. Prosecuting people for exercising their First Amendment rights creates problems rather than solving them. It can weaken the bonds between law enforcement and the community, while undermining faith in our system.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/roe-v-wade-protests-abortion-video,2022-08-04
Rookie Georgia police officer resigns after department bars him from expressing views on traditional marriage,"Rookie Georgia police officer Jacob Kersey resigned after his superiors threatened to terminate him for expressing his views on traditional marriage, the Daily Signal reported today.

""I never would have thought I would have been placed in a situation where I have to choose between my Christian faith and my dream job,"" 19-year-old Kersey said Wednesday in a Facebook post. ""I am grateful for the opportunity that I was given to be a police officer. I do not take that honor and responsibility lightly. However, my integrity and Christian beliefs are at the core of who I am, and I will not abandon them,"" he added.

Kersey's career in law enforcement was cut short following a brief Facebook post on January 2, 2023, the Daily Signal reported. In the post, he expressed a widely-held religious belief that marriage, designed by God, does not include homosexual unions.

""God designed marriage. Marriage refers to Christ and the church,"" Kersey said in the post. ""That's why there is no such thing as homosexual marriage,"" the post concluded.

The next day, Kersey's supervisor requested he remove the post; Kersey refused, and was warned he could be terminated if he did not comply, according to the Daily Signal's reporting. Shortly after that, Maj. Bradwick L. Sherrod ordered him to ""return everything he had that belonged to the city,"" and Kersey was placed on paid administrative leave while the city investigated, the outlet also reported.

After a week's worth of leave, Kersey faced a ""Sophie's Choice"" situation. He could either keep his job or keep silent on social media about his religious beliefs. Though he was told he would not be fired, he would also not be permitted to share his ""interpretation or opinion of Scripture if it was deemed offensive,"" the outlet continued.

Department leadership formalized its position in a letter to Kersey dated January 13, which was obtained by the Daily Signal. In the letter, Port Wentworth Police Department's Major Sherrod says, in part, ""After reviewing your Podcast and social media platforms. . .we did not find sufficient evidence to establish a violation of any policies. . . However, the posts, podcasts, and so forth found and considered in our investigation likely offensive to protected classes . . . please be reminded that if any post on any of your social media platforms, or any other statement or action, renders you unable to perform, and to be seen as able to perform, your job in a fair an equitable manner, you could be terminated.""

The Port Wentworth Police Department did not respond to Blaze Media's request for comment in time for publication.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg blamed for potential overturn of Roe v. Wade: 'Who to blame ... could not be more obvious',"Former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg became the target of sharp criticism on Tuesday after a leaked Supreme Court opinion draft indicated that Roe v. Wade will be overturned.

Chief Justice John Roberts later confirmed that the draft, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, is authentic.

What are the details?

Ginsburg was repeatedly pressured to retire when Barack Obama was president, thereby ensuring a left-leaning justice would replace her. But she refused to cave to political pressures. She passed away in September 2020, which meant then-President Donald Trump named her replacement: Amy Coney Barrett.

Now, critics of the forthcoming Supreme Court decision possibly overturning abortion precedents are blaming Ginsburg for the development.

Paul Quirk, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia, told Newsweek that admirers of Ginsberg may have to reassess their admiration if Roe v. Wade is ultimately overturned.

""Who to blame, from a liberal or pro-choice perspective, could not be more obvious: The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"" Quirk said.

""As an octogenarian cancer survivor during President Obama's second term, she rejected suggestions in 2014 and 2015 that she should retire to allow Obama to appoint her successor,"" he added. ""Obama notably refrained from putting pressure on her to do so. That Ginsburg's failure to retire would lead to the overturning of Roe, among other disasters from her own standpoint, was not entirely foreseeable. It was, however, fairly likely. The overturning of Roe, and more to come from the current Court, may lead liberals to revisit the adulation that was showered upon Ginsburg at the time of her death.""

David Bateman, an associate professor of government at Cornell University, also told Newsweek the possibility of Roe v. Wade being overturned represents ""the failure of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to prepare for the consequences of her mortality.""

Ginsburg, although she supported abortion rights, was a notorious critic of the Roe v. Wade decision itself. She once described the decision as ""heavy-handed judicial intervention [that] was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked, not resolved, conflict.""

What did Ginsburg say about not retiring?

In a 2014 interview, Ginsburg responded to critics who lamented her refusal to step down while a Democrat sat in the White House.

""Anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they're misguided,"" she told Elle Magazine.

Ginsburg reiterated that sentiment one year before she passed.

""When that suggestion is made, I ask the question: Who do you think the president could nominate that could get through the Republican Senate? Who you would prefer on the court than me?"" she said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/rookie-georgia-police-officer-resigns-after-department-bars-him-from-expressing-views-on-traditional-marriage,2022-05-04
"Abortion activists send 'special message' to Brett Kavanaugh's wife and children, post picture outside their school","Ruth Sent Us, the far-left group that publicized the addresses of conservative-leaning Supreme Court justices, sent the family of Justice Brett Kavanaugh a ""special message"" on Wednesday.

The message was delivered on the same day an armed man, Nicholas John Roske, was arrested near Kavanaugh's home. The man told authorities he wanted to kill Justice Kavanaugh.

What did Ruth Sent Us do?

After announcing more protests outside the homes of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Amy Coney Barrett, and Kavanaugh, Ruth Sent Us posted a picture of a billboard outside of the school where Kavanaugh's daughters attend.

""A special message for Ashley Kavanaugh and your daughters — this billboard was on your school grounds. We feel for you,"" the far-left org said.

The group added that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican lawmakers ""aren't worried for your safety.""

The claim is patently false. In fact, the Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan bill that would extend police protection the immediate family members of Supreme Court justices.

A special message for Ashley Kavanaugh and your daughters — this billboard was on your school grounds. We feel for you.@LeaderMcConnell and the GOP aren’t worried for your safety. They worry only for the expensive Supreme Court they rigged, and their own power. #SCOTUSpic.twitter.com/g3n5fgjNZW

— Ruth Sent Us 🪧 (@RuthSentUs) June 8, 2022





The message and picture generated even more outrage against Ruth Sent Us. The group was accused of ""targeting"" Kavanaugh's family.

House Democrats are blocking the Senate bill passed last month that would extend security protection to Kavanaugh's immediate family. Their refusal to pass the bill takes on new significance if pro-abortion activists begin to direct their ire at families of Supreme Court justices.

Anything else?

In a separate tweet, Ruth Sent Us denied sending the armed man that police arrested.

""We offer our thoughts & prayers to Brett & Ashley Kavanaugh after a California man arrived by taxi near their home, armed with a gun & knife, then called the police on himself to confess his murderous rage against the abusive alcoholic 'Justice'. We didn’t send him,"" the group said.

However, Ruth Sent Us infamously posted the addresses of conservative-leaning justices on the internet after a leaked opinion draft indicated the Supreme Court had indicated to overturn abortion precedents.

And while it is not clear if Roske found Kavanaugh's address through Ruth Sent Us, Roske told investigators he did, in fact, find it online.

""Roske stated he began thinking about how to give his life a purpose and decided that he would kill the Supreme Court Justice after finding the Justice's Montgomery County address on the Internet. Roske further indicated that he had purchased the Glock pistol and other items for the purpose of breaking into the Justice's residence and killing the Justice as well as himself,"" the arrest affidavit says.

"Sacramento homeowner fined $573,000 for working on old cars in his backyard","A retired homeowner in Sacramento, California, has been ordered to pay a whopping $573,000 in city code violation fines stemming largely from his penchant for working on old cars in his backyard, the Sacramento Bee reported.

Dan Altstatt, 83, recently lost his legal effort to challenge the fines when an appeals court judge ruled the city of Sacramento acted justly in imposing the penalties.

In his challenge, Altstatt argued the city's code enforcement actions infringed upon his constitutional rights as property owner and contended that the city's fines are excessive. He added that he is unable to pay the fines and would become ""homeless and penniless"" if his house was seized as a result.

But Judge Louis Mauro ultimately found Altstatt's arguments to be lacking, calling them ""unfocused and difficult to discern."" The judge also cited as precedent a 2000 San Francisco case in which courts ruled $663,000 in fees for continued code violations were not constitutionally excessive.

According to the Bee, Altstatt's case dates all the way back to 2014 when he brought a van and other vehicles into his backyard, triggering a code enforcement penalty.

In a blog post published in April, the city clarified that it began receiving complaints from neighbors about Altstatt's ""accumulation of junk and debris"" on the property, which included fruit from fallen trees as well as ""inoperable vehicles.""

City officials sent him a notice and ""order to abate the nuisances"" but when Altstatt refused to comply, they sued. In the meantime, the city was levying $250 per day fines on Altstatt that eventually amounted to more that $500,000.

In searches of Altstatt's property over the years, the city claimed that it discovered multiple violations of unlawful storage of excessive junk including ""metal objects, propane tanks, broken appliances, automotive parts, gasoline canisters, liquid cleansers and solvents, paint cans, and boxes full of miscellaneous trash and plastic waste.""

Altstatt has since removed the vehicles and cleared the junk, but he argues that the city has no right to exercise such control over his private property.

In an email to the Bee, he said, ""That the city can charge such exorbitant and unreasonable fees for having things in the backyard is beyond belief. I don’t know how they are able to do this. It is perplexing how disputed allegations of so-called 'junk and debris' in a person’s backyard can escalate to the point where the city owns your property.""

He subsequently told the outlet that he is prepared to appeal the decision to the California Supreme Court and take it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.

The city seems unflinching in its position against the homeowner. Yet, Tim Swanson, the city's media and communications manager, did claim in a follow-up statement that ""the City of Sacramento remains open to working with Mr. Altstatt and to resolving this issue in a fair and just way.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ruth-sent-us-message-brett-kavanaugh-wife-and-children,2022-06-02

School district that let biological male use girls' locker room reportedly punishes father of girl who spoke out because he misgendered trans student in question,"A Vermont school district that let a biological male who identifies as a female use a girls' locker room punished the father of a girl who spoke out against the move because he misgendered the trans student in question, the Daily Signal reported.

The father — Travis Allen — has been suspended without pay from his Orange Southwest Supervisory District job as coach of the Randolph Union Middle School girls' soccer team, the outlet said.

What's the background?

In late September, several members of the girls' volleyball team at Randolph Union High School spoke out against the biological male using the locker room, saying the trans teammate made an inappropriate comment while they were changing.

Action was taken — but apparently not in favor of the now-uncomfortable girls' team players.

Burlington's WCAX-TV noted that the entire volleyball team was banned from using the locker room while officials conducted an investigation into claims that the girls harassed their trans teammate.

Allen's daughter Blake is one of the girls who spoke out, and she reportedly said, ""I feel like for stating my opinion — that I don’t want a biological man changing with me — that I should not have harassment charges or bullying charges. They should all be dropped.""

Oh, and in case you're wondering what happened to the story on the matter from WCAX, the station actually deleted it.

WCAX news director Roger Garrity told local news outlet Seven Days the reason for pulling the story was ""to prevent others from using our reporting to attack people in the transgender community."" Garrity added to the outlet that ""we are now working with LGBTQ advocates on a message to the community acknowledging the harm that was caused.""



Facebook fracas

The Daily Signal said Melissa Sivvy — guardian of the trans student in question — told the outlet that the student under her care is a girl and deserves to be in girls’ spaces. Sivvy also asked in a Facebook comment for “justice for whoever was wronged,"" the outlet added.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Blake Allen's mother, Jessica Allen, replied that she would be “GLAD to have a conversation” on “this matter,"" the Daily Signal said.

Travis Allen also spoke up.

“I am the father of the girl you claim ‘made up a story for attention,’” he wrote in a Facebook reply to Sivvy, the outlet said. “The truth is your son watched my daughter and multiple other girls change in the locker room. While he got a free show, they got violated.”

He added, “You think this is fine and dandy. I wonder how you would feel if I watched you undress?” the Daily Signal reported.

Superintendent Layne Millington said in a Tuesday letter that Travis Allen was suspended without pay from this job as the coach of the middle school girls' soccer team because he “misgendered a transgender student in our district,"" the outlet said.

Here's a portion of the letter, according to American Thinker:

""While you have a right to your own opinions, you have chosen to publicly put yourself in opposition to the principles the district and its coaches are compelled to uphold. ... The district offered to work with you to make these matters right, the two possible solutions you offered were insufficient to re-establish the public trust you have damaged: avoiding using gender pronouns when communicating with transgender students and taking down the posts. The district recommended a public apology which you refused leaving the matter unresolved. Therefore, you have been suspended without pay for the remainder of the season. You were also offered the opportunity to change your mind at any time during the suspension in order to make things right and to earn back the public trust in your ability to support all students in your role as RUHS coach.""

The Daily Signal said Millington did not immediately respond to its request for comment.

Travis Allen did speak with the Daily Signal, saying that ""when he asked me to publicly apologize, I thought about it. I did pause and waited a few seconds. And I’m thinking, ‘If I say that I’ll apologize, I’ll be able to coach my youngest daughter for the rest of the season, but I’m going to, in turn, hurt my other daughter, because I’m not standing up for what we believe in, I’m just cowing to them like so many other people have done. And I just can’t do that.’”

'Coward': Schumer boasts that he refused to debate Tucker Carlson — but Tucker gets the last laugh,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer boasted Tuesday that he declined a request from Fox News host Tucker Carlson to debate a letter the New York Democrat sent top Fox News executives.

What happened?

On Tuesday, Schumer sent a letter to Fox leadership demanding the network ""immediately cease the reckless amplification of the so-called 'Great Replacement' theory.""

Schumer claimed the white supremacist conspiracy theory ""has been injected into the mainstream"" of American discourse because of ""a dangerous level of amplification"" by Fox News. Schumer did not cite any evidence to corroborate his claims. In fact, he only pointed to an Associated Press poll and a New York Times investigative story on Carlson.

Still, Schumer told Fox leadership, ""I implore you to immediately cease all dissemination of false white nationalist, far-right conspiracy theories on your network.""

After Schumer sent his letter and railed against Fox News on the Senate floor, Carlson's team reached out to him and invited him to debate the letter on Carlson's nightly show. But, for reasons unknown, Schumer declined the invitation.

"".@TuckerCarlson invited me on his show tonight to debate the letter I sent to @FoxNews. I'm declining. Tucker Carlson needs to stop promoting the racist, dangerous ‘Replacement Theory’,"" Schumer boasted.

What was the reaction?

While Schumer's stance may have won him brownie points within his tribe, the decision to reject Carlson's invitation left many others scratching their heads.

After all, if Carlson is promoting racism and Schumer is on the ""right side"" of the issue, why would he refuse the opportunity to enlighten Carlson and his more than 3 million nightly viewers?

""Why would you be afraid to debate Carlson if you really believe you have the facts, politics and morality on your side? Oh wait,"" one person said.

""Nothing says 'I have courage in my convictions' quite like refusing to discuss them publicly,"" one person mocked.

""okay…..but you understand that he is not going to stop, right? So basically you had the perfect opportunity to go give his crowd an alternate viewpoint and said no for literally no reason. Am I missing anything?"" another person said.

""I don't agree with either you or Tucker on everything, but it would be better if you went on and talked in good faith,"" one person observed.

""So you’re bragging about making accusations but being unwilling (afraid) to explain or defend them? I think we all know why,"" another person observed.

""So you turned down the opportunity to talk to 3.5 million Americans? Well you really showed them. That'll teach them,"" another person mocked.

""If @TuckerCarlson is as disgusting as you claim, why would you turn down the chance to prove him wrong in front of millions of his viewers? Oh, because you know you’re full of crap? Got it,"" another person reacted.

""Given the chance to confront the person Dems believe to be so dangerous, they opt instead to tweet and send letters. Profiles in courage,"" another person mocked.

""Isn't debating someone you disagree with the best way to sort out the issue? How does silencing the other side or refusing to engage help anyone? Seems very counterproductive,"" one person observed.

Carlson responded to Schumer on his show Tuesday evening, calling him a ""coward,"" and quipped of Schumer's ego, ""This is the only media appearance probably in history he's turned down.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/school-district-punishes-father-of-girls-volleyball-player,2022-05-18
Schumer gets torched online for adjourning Senate for Memorial Day recess after blocking GOP school safety bill,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) was torched online for allowing the U.S. Senate to adjourn into Memorial Day recess after blocking the passage of a Republican bill on school safety.

Schumer tried to excoriate Republicans for resisting gun control regulation in the wake of the horrific school shooting in Texas, but many thought it was a toothless attack when Democrats went on a week-long break.

The Democratic leader claimed that he wanted to give negotiations a chance to work out before forcing a vote on gun control.

“If these negotiations do not bear any fruit, the Senate will vote on gun safety legislation when we return. But our hope, even amidst our deep skepticism, is that during this week Democrats and Republicans at long last will come to agree on something meaningful that will reduce gun violence in a real way in America,” Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor.

He's also implied that there would be no gun control legislation and that people should vote in November for Democrats instead.

Schumer's attacks on Republicans before rushing off on vacation were criticized heavily on social media.

""Democrats are already rejecting calls for more security and single entry points for schools (refusing to concede single points of entry with multiple exits is possible). They only want gun control, which won't pass the Senate. That means they want the issue, not a solution,"" tweeted talk show host Erick Erickson.

""Nobody is making Chuck Schumer do this,"" responded Jim Geraghty of National Review. ""Gun control activists often complain that lawmakers squander momentum and public attention in the aftermath of horrifying mass shootings. But it isn't that the GOP has a secret mind control ray that influences Congressional Democratic leaders. Schumer, Pelosi, etc. choose this.""

""Chuck Schumer wants more school shootings to benefit his fundraising,"" replied Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim in the Parkland school shooting.

""Republicans put up a school safety bill. Democrat Chuck Schumer blocked it from a vote. But please, continue to tell me this isn't all political. They won't even debate it and put it up for a vote. Don't like the bill? Vote no,"" tweeted talk show host Jason Rantz.

Even some on the left were outraged that Schumer didn't press harder on Republicans.

""Pathetic. We grovel for Republican votes to pass legislative scraps rather than fight to force a few members of our own party to use their power to pass serious legislation to keep children from being slaughtered at school. Schumer has to go,"" said progressive activist Kai Newkirk.

""When this country suffers a horrible tragedy one thing you can always count on is that @SenSchumer will immediately break for another vacation without getting anything done,"" said progressive author Don Winslow.

While Schumer denied it in his last statement, some thought he was trying to protect some Democrats from having to defend a vote for gun control in challenging districts.

""Everything you need to know about how the Democrats privately see gun control: Schumer put the Senators on record about abortion, but won't do the same on gun control,"" Erick Erickson observed.

Scientologist actor to face new trial for rape after first trial ends with jury 'hopelessly deadlocked',"A former sitcom star and lifelong Scientologist will be retried for three counts of rape after his first trial ended in mistrial.

Last November, the case against 46-year-old Danny Masterson, best known for playing Steven Hyde on the 2000s sitcom ""That '70s Show,"" was declared a mistrial. The trial, which lasted more than a month and included disruptions for COVID and the Thanksgiving holiday, ended when Judge Charlaine Olmedo determined that jurors were ""hopelessly deadlocked"" on all three counts.

According to evidence presented at the trial, three unnamed women claimed that Masterson raped them in separate incidents which occurred between 2001 and 2003, when Masterson was at the height of his acting career. All three women claimed that they met Masterson through the Church of Scientology and that, on separate occasions, he drugged them at his Los Angeles home and raped them while they were in various states of consciousness.

One of the alleged victims had been in a five-year relationship with Masterson and was then living at his home when he supposedly attacked her. When she resisted his sexual advances, he allegedly struck her, raped her, and called her ""white trash.""

As all three were then members of the church, they reported the alleged attacks to church authorities. Two of the women claimed that church members discouraged them from going to police. One woman did make a report with the LAPD, but no charges were filed against Masterson at the time. By 2016, the three women had left the church and had discovered similarities between their alleged experiences with Masterson. They then made formal accusations once again, and this time, the district attorney filed charges.

All three women testified against Masterson last fall. While on the stand, two of the alleged victims broke down into tears, and a third stated she could not breathe.

Ultimately though, most of the jurors involved in the trial, including the two alternates, found the evidence against Masterson unconvincing. According to reports, by the time Olmedo had declared a mistrial, the jurors were leaning toward acquittal on all three counts: 10-2, 8-4, and 7-5. The jurors did not seem able to pronounce a unanimous verdict on any of the three charges, as Masterson's attorney noted when filing to dismiss them.

""Fourteen different people heard and deliberated on the evidence, and large number concluded that Masterson should be acquitted of all charges,"" defense attorney Philip KentCohen wrote in the filing. ""This outcome was not a fluke.""

Cohen also added that the court had ""no reason to believe a retrial will produce a different outcome.""

Cohen's arguments did not prevail with Olmedo, who dismissed that filing. When prosecutors motioned to retry Masterson, Olmedo agreed, noting that only 16 of the 36 witnesses slated to testify on behalf of the prosecution ever took the stand. ""A different outcome at a retrial is at least a possibility,"" she stated at the hearing on Tuesday.

""Mr. Masterson is charged with multiple counts of serious and violent felonies – forcible rapes,"" Olmedo continued. ""If true and Masterson is convicted, society would not only be protected from a violent felon, [but] should be protected from a violent felon.""

Masterson has been married to actress Bijou Phillips for more than 11 years, and the two have one daughter together. Jury selection for Masterson's second trial is scheduled to begin on March 29.

SCOTUS allows Yeshiva University to bar LGBTQ club — for now,"Yesterday, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor permitted Yeshiva University to refuse to recognize an LGBT student club that the Orthodox Jewish school said violates its religious values.

The stay — a court ruling that stops a legal action — issued by Sotomayor temporarily blocks a judge's ruling ordering the New York City-based school to allow the group. Yeshiva’s request for the order went to Sotomayor because she handles emergency appeals from a geographic region that includes New York.

The dispute began last year, according to SCOTUSblog, “When a group of students and former students filed a lawsuit alleging that Yeshiva’s refusal to recognize an LGBTQ advocacy and support club violated New York City’s human rights law.”

The law prohibits places that are open to the public – known as “public accommodations” — from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

The trial court agreed with the students and ordered the university to recognize the Y.U. Pride Alliance club. The court rejected Yeshiva’s argument that the law did not apply because the university is a religious institution, rather than a public accommodation.

Higher courts in New York refused to stay the trial court’s ruling, so Yeshiva brought the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court. The university argued that its decision should be protected under the religious freedom clause of the First Amendment.

""We are grateful that Justice Sotomayor stepped in to protect Yeshiva’s religious liberty in this case,"" Eric Baxter, a lawyer for Yeshiva at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty legal group, said in a statement.

Katherine Rosenfeld, a lawyer for the club, said the club remains committed to creating a safe space for LGBT students on the university's campus ""to build community and support one another without being discriminated against.""

According to The New York Times, Yeshiva president Rabbi Ari Berman said the school wants students of all sexual orientations and gender identities to feel comfortable on its campus, but also wants to uphold its identity as an institution grounded in Modern Orthodox Judaism.

Sotomayor’s ruling suggests that the Supreme Court may take up the university’s case to issue a final determination. In recent years, petitioners bringing claims under the First Amendment’s religious freedom clause have had a high success rate at the Supreme Court.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scientologist-actor-to-face-new-trial-for-rape-after-first-trial-ends-with-jury-hopelessly-deadlocked,2022-09-10
Justice Amy Coney Barrett shuts down bid to block Biden's student loan forgiveness program,"President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program was granted a reprieve Thursday when Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett refused a bid to block the controversial policy.

Barrett oversees emergency requests from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, and she shut down it down without comment and without noting whether it was referred to the rest of the Supreme Court justices.

The emergency appeal was filed by the Wisconsin Institute of Law and Liberty on behalf of the Brown County Taxpayers Association, but the federal government argued that they had no standing to make the request.

Seperately on Thursday, a federal judge denied a challenge to the forgiveness program from six Republican-led states. U.S. District Judge Henry Autrey in St. Louis said the states lacked standing for the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the Nebraska attorney general's office said they would appeal the decision.

Biden announced the plan to partially forgive student loans in August and sparked criticism that he was making a bid to buy the votes of those who carried the debt while burdening the taxpayer with the bill. The Biden administration has argued that it had the power to implement the program due to the state of emergency created by the coronavirus pandemic.

The federal government will be able to start forgiving the loans as early as this weekend.



Critics of the loan forgiveness program accuse Biden of acting unconstitutionally and say he doesn't have the power to act without Congress voting on it. Meanwhile, critics on his left have demanded he forgive all student debt in order to bolster the economy.

""It simply should not be the case that the president of the United States can unilaterally choose to spend 4% of the country's gross domestic product without clear congressional authorization,"" said Rich Eisenberg of the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty.

A report from the Congressional Budget Office found that the student loan forgiveness program could cost as much as $400 billion.

Supreme Court denies Trump request to intervene in Mar-a-Lago document fight with Justice Dept,"The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request from former President Donald Trump to intervene in his legal fight against the Department of Justice over classified documents seized at his residence in Mar-a-Lago.

The former president had called for the Supreme Court to review a ruling from the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit that allowed the DOJ investigation into his documents to continue.

The justices refused the request Thursday and did not offer any comment on their rationale. There was also no dissent noted.

Trump's legal team had previously requested a special master to independently review the documents seized in order to sort out whether some fall under the province of executive privilege or attorney-client privilege. U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon sided with Trump and appointed a senior judge in the Eastern District of New York as special master.

The Eleventh Circuit, based in Atlanta, ruled in favor of the Department of Justice and said the investigation could continue.

Trump has also said publicly that he personally declassified all documents that were brought into Mar-a-Lago, but his attorneys have not argued that in court.

About 100 documents were found with classified markings among the thousands that were seized by the FBI on August 8.

“Any limit on the comprehensive and transparent review of materials seized in the extraordinary raid of a President’s home erodes public confidence in our system of justice,” argued the former president's legal team to the Supreme Court.

“The Government has attempted to criminalize a document management dispute and now vehemently objects to a transparent process that provides much-needed oversight,"" it added.



The refusal came from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who oversees the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Supreme Court rules in favor of former public HS football coach who was fired after refusing to stop praying on field after games,"The United States Supreme Court on Monday ruled in favor of a now-former public high school football coach who was fired after refusing to stop praying on the field after games.

What are the details?

The high court ruled 6-3 for Joseph Kennedy, a Christian and former football coach at Bremerton (Washington) High School, the Associated Press said. Kennedy had been praying at the 50-yard line after games for years until Bremerton School District in 2015 told him to stop. When he refused, Kennedy said the district suspended him and then fired him.

The conservative justices on the Supreme Court, who hold the majority, voted in favor of Kennedy, while the liberal justices voted against his case, the AP said.

“The Constitution and the best of our traditions counsel mutual respect and tolerance, not censorship and suppression, for religious and nonreligious views alike,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority, the outlet noted.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion that the court's decision in favor of Kennedy “sets us further down a perilous path in forcing states to entangle themselves with religion,” the AP said, adding that she was joined in her dissent by Justice Stephen Breyer and Justice Elena Kagan.

In 2019, the court declined to take up Kennedy's case, the AP said — but only four conservative justices were on the court at that time. Amid a conservative majority, Kennedy's lawyers in January announced that his case finally would be heard. The high court heard arguments in late April, and the words of some justices signaled that the court would side with Kennedy.

Anything else?

Students often joined Kennedy in prayer, despite not being asked to do so, but that still troubled the school district, which asked him to stop, as he was still “on duty” as a coach after the game, the AP said.

""Just hours before what would be my last game as coach, the school district gave me an ultimatum: If I prayed after that night’s game, they would suspend me,"" Kennedy wrote in a Fox News op-ed. ""As a proudly retired U.S. Marine, something inside me stirred. I would have given my life defending the religious freedom of any American, and yet that very right was denied to me. That just seemed wrong and unjust.""

He added, ""I did pray on that chilly October night, leading to my suspension and termination. My only recourse at that point was to seek legal action to vindicate my rights of free speech and free exercise of my religious beliefs.""

Supreme Court unanimously sides with Christian group blocked from raising flag outside Boston City Hall: 'How did the city get it so wrong?',"The Supreme Court on Monday unanimously ruled in favor of a Christian civic organization that had its application to fly a flag outside of Boston City Hall rejected by city officials on religious grounds.

What are the details?

In a rare 9-0 decision, the court determined that the City of Boston violated Camp Constitution's constitutional rights to free speech by preventing it from flying a flag in the city plaza based solely on the fact that it was a ""Christian flag.""

At issue in the case, according to the court, was whether or not Boston's flag policy amounted to ""government speech."" If so, then the city may well be within its rights to prohibit the flying of the flag. However, if not, then its rejection of Camp Constitution's application was wrong.

The court ultimately assessed the latter to be the case.

""We conclude that, on balance, Boston did not make the raising and flying of private groups’ flags a form of government speech,"" wrote Justice Stephen Breyer in the court's opinion.

""Boston did not make the raising and flying of private groups’ flags a form of government speech. That means, in turn, that Boston’s refusal to let Shurtleff and Camp Constitution raise their flag based on its religious viewpoint 'abridg[ed]' their 'freedom of speech,'"" he added.

Additionally, the Court wrote, ""Here, Boston concedes that it denied [Harold] Shurtleff’s request solely because the Christian flag he asked to raise 'promot[ed] a specific religion' ... Under our precedents, and in view of our government-speech holding here, that refusal discriminated based on religious viewpoint and violated the Free Speech Clause.""

With the ruling, the nation's top court reversed a lower court's decision and remanded the issue back to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.

What's the background?

The rejected application that spurred the case, Shurtleff v. City of Boston, occurred in 2017 when the group's founder Harold Shurtleff sought permission to raise the flag in commemoration of Constitution Day.

The Christian Post previously reported that Boston City Hall Plaza features three massive flagpoles, two of which always fly the American flag and the Massachusetts state flag. The third pole typically flies the city's flag, however, residents are permitted to petition City Hall to raise other flags temporarily and often do.

In fact, between 2005 and 2017, almost 300 different flags were permitted to be flown — including the Turkish flag, the Vatican flag, the Communist Chinese flag, the transgender flag, LGBT flags, and more. Yet Camp Constitution's ""Christian flag"" was the only one the city ever rejected.

In its denial, the city argued that flying the flag would improperly serve as promotion for a particular religion. Shurtleff and his group sued.

But in February 2020, U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper ruled against Shurtleff's group, claiming that the city's flagpoles constitute ""government speech."" When Shurtleff appealed, a three-judge panel on the First Circuit sided with the city, again claiming that it was well within its rights to reject Shurtleff's request.

Anything else?

In addition to Breyer's, three other justices — Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, and Samuel Alito — filed concurring opinion's on the case.

In his concurring opinion, Kavanaugh wrote, ""Under the Constitution, a government may not treat religious persons, religious organizations, or religious speech as second-class.""

Gorsuch asked, ""How did the city get it so wrong?"" before tracing the matter back to a preceding case, Lemon v. Kurtzman, which devised what is known as the ""Lemon Test,"" or a one-size-fits-all assessment for resolving Establishment Clause disputes.

""It’s time to let Lemon lie in its grave,"" asserted Gorsuch.

Alito remarked that while he agrees with the court's ultimate opinion, he rejected the way in which the court analyzed the case regarding ""government speech,"" which he characterized as an often vague and illusory category.

""I cannot go along with the Court’s decision to analyze this case in terms of the triad of factors—history, the public’s perception of who is speaking, and the extent to which the government has exercised control over speech,"" he said, later adding that ""courts must be very careful when a government claims that speech by one or more private speakers is actually government speech. When that occurs, it can be difficult to tell whether the government is using the doctrine 'as a subterfuge for favoring certain private speakers over others based on viewpoint.""

""The ultimate question is whether the government is actually expressing its own views or the real speaker is a private party and the government is surreptitiously engaged in the 'regulation of private speech,"" he continued.

Mat Staver, the Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel, the religious liberty law firm that represented Shurtleff, said in a statement, ""This case is so much more significant than a flag. Boston openly discriminated against viewpoints it disfavored when it opened the flagpoles to all applicants and then excluded Christian viewpoints. Government cannot censor religious viewpoints under the guise of government speech.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/scotus-sides-with-praying-coach,2022-05-02
Screaming Democrats rush stage at Dave Rubin event with Ron DeSantis,"A Democratic candidate for Congress interrupted a live event with BlazeTV host Dave Rubin of ""The Rubin Report"" and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in Orlando, Florida, Thursday evening, demanding action on gun violence.

Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a March for Our Lives organizer who is running for the Democratic nomination in Florida's 10th Congressional District, stood up and shouted at DeSantis as he was speaking on stage at The Plaza Live, yelling that ""Floridians are dying!""

The governor was in the middle of an interview with Rubin, who hosted the event as part of his book tour for ""Don't Burn This Country,"" a book criticizing ""woke"" left-wing politics and calling for ""Americans to live the freest life possible.""

""Governor DeSantis, we're losing 100 people a day due to gun violence,"" Frost said. ""We need action on gun violence!""

A video the candidate shared to Twitter shows security personnel escorting him away from the stage and out of the room.



""Hey buddy, nobody wants to hear from you,"" DeSantis said as Frost exited while the audience booed at the interruption.

""I just asked @GovRonDeSantis to take action on gun violence so we can save lives. That we lose 100 people a day,"" Frost tweeted Thursday. ""His response? 'Nobody wants to hear from you!' We are dying and our Governor is too busy helping @RubinReport make money.""

Rubin responded on Twitter, observing that Frost ""didn't ask the governor anything.""

""He/him/his bum rushed the stage at a sold out event and started yelling. The entire night was about freedom and liberty. Find something better to protest, perhaps. But either way, thanks for buying tickets!"" Rubin said.



Other Democratic activists who had planned protests of the event interrupted DeSantis and Rubin to make demands for gun control, Business Insider reports.



A producer for Rubin's BlazeTV show said there were more than six interruptions throughout the night. Videos posted to social media show activists screaming at the governor, demanding ""why don't you care about my life?""

Anti-gun activists have made a fevered pitch for gun control after two recent mass shootings at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

DeSantis, who is running for re-election, is not the only GOP official to be heckled by left-wing candidates on the gun issue. Last week in Texas, Democrat Beto O'Rourke disrupted a press briefing on the Uvalde shooting held by Gov. Gregg Abbott (R), demanding new gun control laws.

Earlier Thursday, Rubin had welcomed peaceful protests of his event, provided they did not ""interfere"" with the proceedings. After it was all said and done, he brushed off the dirsuptions.

“They came. The screamed about a bunch of stuff that had nothing to do with the event and they were escorted out,"" Rubin told TheBlaze. ""Frankly, I think they just need better hobbies, and should look into moving to Seattle or San Francisco.“

"Seattle boss praised for hiking employee pay to $70k accused of sexual assault, blames opponents of his progressive advocacy","A left-wing entrepreneur who was widely praised for taking a pay cut in order to boost his employees' wages was accused of sexual assault, but he's blaming his support for progressive causes for the accusations.

Dan Price, the CEO and founder of Gravity Payments, is accused of assaulting a woman according to court documents obtained by the Seattle Times. Price is denying the allegations.

The woman told the Seattle police on Jan. 24 that she had met with Price after exchanging Instagram messages with him about work. After they had dinner, he invited her into his Tesla, she claims that he tried to kiss her against her will and grabbed her neck when she refused.

She also says that she was scared when he began driving erratically after drinking alcohol at dinner with her.

Price was later charged with fourth-degree assault with sexual motivation, and fourth-degree reckless driving in February. He has not been arraigned.

An attorney for Price released a statement denying the accusations.

""These allegations are absolutely false. Dan Price’s successful business leadership and advocacy for progressive causes have made him a target for all kinds of smears,"" read the statement.

""We have already obtained evidence that contradicts key details of the police report and raises serious doubts about the complainant’s credibility,"" it added. ""Mr. Price respects the legal process and is confident that he will be vindicated in court.""

Price's ex-wife previously accused him of numerous incidents of domestic violence against her, but she later walked back some of her damaging claims after he threatened to sue her. She maintains that she was still abused by him.

His company also faced many challenges stemming from the unusual wage policies he put into place.

Price is scheduled to appear in court on Friday.

"Seattle officials deliberately 'purged' thousands of CHOP-related text messages, despite 'legal obligation' to retain them: Federal judge","Several former and current Seattle, Washington, officials who were in office during the 2020 Capitol Hill Organized Protest or Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone — better known as CHOP or CHAZ — deliberately ""purged"" evidentiary text messages related to that event, a federal judge has determined. As a result, the jury that will eventually consider a lawsuit about that event may presume that the missing text messages were ""unfavorable"" to the city and to those officials.

The background

On June 8, 2020, a rogue group of leftist activists, some affiliated with Black Lives Matter, cordoned off about six or eight blocks in the Capitol Hill district of Seattle and declared the area an ""autonomous zone,"" a quasi-sovereign state that is separate from the U.S. However, infrastructure within the zone quickly collapsed as violence raged. By July 1, Seattle police had quashed the protest, and CHOP was dissolved, leaving two dead teenagers and several severely injured victims in its wake.

But physical violence was not the only harm CHOP caused. Businesses located within the occupied territory suffered serious injury to their bottom line, to say nothing of the integrity of their buildings, because protesters refused to allow employees and clients to access them. More than a dozen of those businesses quickly filed a lawsuit against the city, claiming that officials had supported CHOP by providing various accommodations to the protesters, including barriers, portable toilets and washing stations, and dumpsters. Now, a federal judge has determined that that lawsuit can go to trial.

The ruling

Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly sided with the plaintiffs on two key counts in the lawsuit, while dismissing three others. Zilly will allow a jury to determine whether city officials — including former Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan (D), former police Chief Carmen Best, fire Chief Harold Scoggins, and others — were culpable for ""taking"" the public's ""right to access"" those establishments.



However, the most crucial ruling Zilly seemed to give in his 39-page order relates to text messages missing from the ""City-owned"" phones that had been given to those public officials for government use. Though attorneys for the plaintiffs issued several letters to the city in June and July 2020 requesting that its officials retain their text messages as possible evidence, nearly all of the text messages in many of their phones were wiped clean.

The details

On August 21, 2020, a city attorney discovered that all of Durkan's texts had been deleted from both an old and a new phone. Durkan claimed that she'd dropped her phone in water on July 4. Though damaged, that phone retained enough function for Durkan to power it on and restore its data to the iCloud, but Durkan claimed she then performed a reset on her phone, at which time, she accidentally selected a ""Disable and Delete"" option that ended the synchronization between her data and the iCloud and began deleting all text messages that were more than 30 days old.

On July 7, she received a new phone, which ""someone"" set to continue the ""30-day delete"" option, causing more than 5,700 texts to be permanently lost. No backup of the data from her previous phone was ever made. Zilly asserted in his order that Durkan's ""various reasons for deleting her text messages strain credibility.""

A similar discovery regarding police Chief Best's phone was made six months after she tendered her resignation on September 2, 2020. According to the court document, Best manually deleted more than 27,000 texts before she surrendered the phone back to the city. Best later testified that she periodically deletes her text messages, but stated she did not recall deleting all of her messages before returning the phone. Best also claimed that she thought, like emails sent from city-issued email addresses, all of the data on city-issued phones always had a backup copy. Officials later blamed ""COVID work requirements"" for not discovering the missing messages until March 2021.

The texts on Scoggins' phone were not discovered missing until February 2021, several months after he'd input the wrong passcode too many times and locked himself out of the device. When he took the phone to an Apple Store to be serviced in October 2020, ""an employee reset the device, deleting all prior messages,"" the court document stated.

Though experts have been able to recreate more than 160,000 lost messages sent to other recipients, not a single text message exchanged between Durkan, Best, and Scoggins between June 8 and July 1, 2020, has been recovered.

Conclusions

""City officials deleted thousands of texts messages from their city-owned phones in complete disregard of their legal obligation to preserve relevant evidence,"" Zilly wrote on January 13.

""The Court finds substantial circumstantial evidence that the city acted with the requisite intent necessary to impose a severe sanction and that the city’s conduct exceeds gross negligence,"" he added.

For these reasons, the jury which will hear the case against the city officials on behalf of the plaintiff businesses ""may presume that the City officials' text messages (deleted after Plaintiffs commenced this action) were unfavorable to the City, and Plaintiffs will be allowed to present evidence and argument at trial regarding the City's deletion of the text messages,"" Zilly ruled.

He also ruled that the city must pay for the costs accrued in attempting to recover these text messages. Several plaintiffs also deleted evidentiary text messages, and Zilly ruled that Hunter Capital, the main litigant in the suit, must pay the costs associated with the investigation into deleted messages on the phone belonging to CEO Michael Malone. Malone's deletions may also be mentioned at trial.

Zilly dismissed the lawsuit's allegations of negligence, illegal taking of plaintiffs' property and civil rights, and the contention that the city violated plaintiffs' right to due process. The plaintiffs claimed that CHOP cost them $3 million in property damages and lost earnings.

"Senate Democrats adopted 'Don't test, don't tell' COVID policy to rush through inflation bill: 'You can bring your ventilator and still vote'","Senate Democrats allegedly adopted unofficial new COVID-19 protocols ahead of their push to pass the so-called Inflation Reduction Act.

What are the details?

The Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, unofficially adopted a ""Don't test, don't tell"" COVID-19 policy ahead of last weekend's marathon session that resulted in the Inflation Reduction Act being passed.

""They’re not going to delay it if a member has gotten COVID,"" a top Senate aide told Puck News before the vote. ""Counterparts are saying they’re not going to test anymore. It’s not an official mandate but we all know we’re not letting Covid get in the way. The deal is happening. Less testing, just wear masks and get it done.""

Another source jokingly told Puck News that if a Democratic senator caught COVID, ""you can bring your ventilator and still vote.""

The unofficial protocol modification is notable because the Senate, unlike the House, does not permit voting by proxy. Thus, in order to cast a vote, senators must be present in the Senate. Perhaps the protocol change became necessary after multiple Democratic senators tested positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks.

More positive tests would have derailed Democrats' plan to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, delaying any potential boost ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.

What does this matter?

The purported change underscores hypocrisy from Democrats, especially among those who were critical of Republicans for not enacting or abiding by strict COVID mitigation tactics.

In one specific instance, the Washington Post reported in October 2020 that a COVID outbreak among senators could have derailed the confirmation process of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. The Post reported the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was then controlled by Republicans, was considering holding a vote ""with ill senators voting from the visitors' galleries above the floor so they can maintain distance.""

At the time, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is now the Senate majority leader, blasted Republicans for moving forward with Barrett's nomination despite the alleged risks.

""The Republican leadership has truly lost touch with reality if it’s contemplating marching COVID-stricken members to the Senate to rush through a Supreme Court nominee who could strip health care from 20 million Americans,"" Schumer said.

""Instead of engaging in continuously more absurd and dangerous behavior, Chairman Graham should halt this already illegitimate nomination process, and if he refuses, he must put into place a thorough testing procedure that is in accordance with CDC best practices before hearings can take place,"" Schumer demanded. ""Every Senator and relevant staff must have negative tests on two consecutive days and have completed the appropriate quarantining period, and there should be mandatory testing every day of the hearing.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/seattle-officials-deliberately-purged-thousands-of-chop-related-text-messages-despite-legal-obligation-to-retain-them-federal-judge,2022-08-08
"Senate Republicans' report: COVID-19 'more likely than not' man-made, result of Wuhan lab leak","Over 1 million Americans have been killed by COVID-19. A new Senate report claims that those lives were likely taken, not as the result of some evolutionary mishap, but rather as the result of human meddling.

The report's primary conclusion stands in stark contrast both to the COVID natural-origins narrative advanced by members of the scientific establishment, the communist Chinese regime, and the media and to the assertion made in the 2021 Congress report, which claimed a lab origin ""extremely unlikely.""

Last year, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) announced a bipartisan Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP) effort to explore the origins of COVID-19. For the past fifteen months, Republicans on the committee have reviewed hundreds of studies, interviewed various experts, and analyzed numerous reports concerning the source of the virus.

The 35-page interim report, signed solely by Burr and released on Thursday, is the product of these efforts, evidencing Republicans' commitment to establish the full truth about COVID's origins as well as their refusal to soon forgive or forget.

What are the details?

For years, some suggested — especially those with vested interests in the alternative not being found true — that the COVID-19 virus came from a bat in the Wuhan wet market or from a bat cave. If that were the case, then those performing radical experiments on coronaviruses in a sketchy Chinese lab with U.S. federal funding could not be held responsible for tens of millions of deaths.

According to the Senate GOP interim report, those theories have been found wanting.

Among the reasons to doubt the natural zoonotic spillover hypothesis were:

The intermediate host species for the virus ""if one exists, remains unidentified."" Within six months of the first human SARS case, health officials found the intermediary species responsible (palm civets and raccoon dogs).

""Unlike SARS, the genomes of early COVID-19 cases from the first months of the pandemic do not show genetic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 having circulated in another animal species other than humans.""

""The low genetic diversity of the earliest SARS-CoV-2 samples suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is most likely the result of a single successful spillover of SARS-CoV-2.""

After detailing the untenability of the claim of natural origins, the report states that, based on the data publicly available, the ""COVID-19 pandemic was, more likely than not, the result of a research-related incident.""



The report reaffirmed that China's Wuhan Institute of Virology, where coronavirus gain-of-function experiments had been conducted for years, is the likely ""high-risk"" source of the virus. Numerous biosafety failures at the WIV were detailed, all ""relevant to the containment of an aerosolized respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2.""

New insights

Although much of the report restates with greater confidence claims and evidence previously reported on, Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University, noted that Senate Republicans broke new ground with their discussion of communist China's rapid vaccine development.

The report stated that ""it is unusual"" that communist Chinese researchers were able to hit early milestones in COVID-19 vaccine development quicker than the United States.

In the exhibits provided and the questions asked, HELP Republicans intimated that China had access to the full genomic sequence of the virus well in advance of January 11, 2020, when a professor in China uploaded it to a global virus database in violation of communist Chinese restrictions on sharing information relevant to the novel virus.

In addition to being suggestive of China's willingness to hide critical lifesaving information from the world, the foreknowledge of genetic information about the virus might indicate a working Chinese understanding of SARS-CoV-2 predating the outbreak.

Response and next steps

The report appears to vindicate those castigated in recent years for suggesting that the virus was synthetic and released from the Wuhan lab. The New York Times and the Washington Post both called the claim that COVID-19 came from the WIV a ""fringe theory.""

CBS News had denounced Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) as a conspiracy theorist.

Sen. Richard Burr said he hopes the report ""will guide the World Health Organization and other international institutions and researchers as they proceed with planned work to continue investigating the origins of the virus. Uncovering the answers to this critical question is imperative to our national and international ability to ensure that a pandemic of this size and scope does not happen again.""

Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) issued a statement on Thursday in which he lauded the HELP committee Republican staff ""for their evidence-based report that confirms the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted from a research-related incident.""



Marshall considered the domestic implications of the Republican members' findings and suggested that the ""lack of NIH grant oversight may have contributed to the horrible introduction of COVID-19 to the world.""

Having recently connected NIAID Director Anthony Fauci to EcoHealth Alliance's gain-of-function experiments in China, Marshall wrote, ""If Dr. Fauci is truly open minded, as he claims to be, then he will release all texts, emails, communications, and grant records completely and without redactions.""

Fauci has long suggested that the virus occurred naturally. He repeatedly dismissed the lab-leak theory, calling it a ""circular argument."" However, in recent months, he has reportedly adopted an ""open mind."" It may have been previously closed owing to the responsibility he might have to assume, having previously defended federal funding for research on bat coronaviruses at the WIV.

House Republicans have indicated that when they win a majority in November, they will hold Fauci accountable.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted, ""Dr. Fauci lost the trust of the American people when his guidance unnecessarily kept schools closed and businesses shut while obscuring questions about his knowledge on the origins of COVID. He owes the American people answers.""

ABC News reported that Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) stated in August, ""Retirement can't shield Dr. Fauci from congressional oversight.""

While the House prepares to press Fauci and others for answers pertaining to COVID-19's ""likely"" lab origins, the Senate will press on with its bipartisan investigation.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chair of the HELP committee, indicated that the bipartisan review of COVID's origins will continue. In a Thursday statement she said, ""It is absolutely critical we learn the lessons from this pandemic so that we never find ourselves in a similar situation again—and that, of course, includes undertaking a full examination of how COVID-19 first emerged.""

Senior suspended for wearing pro-2nd Amendment shirt to high school government class: Report,"Last fall, a high school senior in Iowa was suspended for wearing a pro-Second Amendment shirt to her government class, and now her mother is suing the teacher, the principal, and the district. On Monday, Janet Bristow of Johnston, Iowa, a northwest suburb of Des Moines, filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court alleging that the suspension violated her daughter's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

In late August 2022, Tom Griffin taught his government students at Johnston High School that their rights were ""extremely limited"" once they entered the classroom, despite the 1969 landmark SCOTUS ruling, Tinker, which affirmed that students and teachers do not ""shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate."" Griffin insisted that he would forbid students from wearing any clothing which depicts ""guns, alcohol, or any other 'inappropriate material,'"" the lawsuit states.

Bristow's daughter, identified in the lawsuit only as ""A.B.,"" was in that class and determined that Griffin had erred in his assessment. Two days later, on September 1, she went to school wearing a T-shirt with a picture of a rifle and the phrase ""What part of 'shall not be infringed' do you not understand?"" emblazoned on the front. Bristow alleged in the lawsuit that A.B. had worn that shirt before without incident and that the girl's older brother, who graduated from Johnston High School in 2019, also wore the shirt without a problem during his time at the school.





A.B.'s shirt Screenshot of the lawsuit

But Griffin had a problem with the shirt, and he dismissed her from class and sent her to the administration. Bristow soon afterward arrived and discussed the issue with Nate Zittergruen and Randy Klein, both associate principals, and Ryan Woods, the school's principal. Zittergruen told Bristow that the shirt could be perceived as threatening or offensive, and the administrative team gave A.B. the choice either to change her shirt or face suspension.

Chris Billings, the district's executive director of school leadership, supported the administration and claimed that the shirt violated school dress code. So after A.B. refused to change her shirt, she was issued an out-of-school suspension.

Later that evening, Bristow said she received an apology from Superintendent Laura Kacer as well as Billings, who said he had come to realize that the shirt is, in fact, ""political speech.""

While Bristow was grateful for the apologies, she does not believe that the issue has been resolved. For one thing, Griffin has neither apologized nor clarified the issue with his class, leaving the impression that ""A.B. was wrong and that her opinions were not welcome in the classroom,"" the document stated. A.B. also still has the suspension listed on her school record.

In the suit, Bristow is seeking the following forms of relief:

affirmation that clothing featuring firearms ""in a non-threatening, non-violent manner"" is protected under the First Amendment;

a permanent injunction which will prevent the defendants listed in the lawsuit from ever restricting such clothing again in the future; and

compensation for damages, the costs associated with the legal process, and any other ""relief"" the court deems ""appropriate.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senate-republicans-report-covid-19-more-likely-than-not-manmade-result-of-research-related-incident,2023-02-09
"Senior UN official decries meritocracy, demands inclusion of made-up term 'povertyism' in antidiscrimination laws","This week, a United Nations special rapporteur will propose to the general assembly his remedy for tackling wealth inequality.

While the West has significantly reduced absolute poverty in recent decades and the world has cut absolute poverty by over 58% since 1990, Olivier De Schutter's radical new proposal is not that we improve upon or sustain the underlying technologies, capitalist systems, or trends that made these monumental strides possible. Instead, his recommendation to the international community is that it embrace a new legal term: ""povertyism.""

Another -ism to save the day

In March 2020, Belgian legal scholar Olivier De Schutter was appointed the U.N. special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights by the Human Rights Council, the same council that recently voted against discussing the Uyghur genocide being committed by the Chinese communist regime. He began his three-year mandate in May 2020.

In an exclusive report, the Guardian detailed the conclusions to which De Schutter has arrived and will present them to the U.N. General Assembly on Friday. De Schutter wants ""povertyism"" — prejudice against the poor — to be included in antidiscrimination laws, which already include various other -isms, such as ""sexism,"" ""racism,"" ""ageism,"" and ""ableism.""



""Povertyism"" is De Schutter's preferred alternative to ""aporophobia,"" a neologism denoting fear of the poor that was hyped in 2017 by the Spanish publication El Pais. He is convinced that ""poverty will never be eradicated while povertyism is allowed to fester.""

De Schutter will tell the U.N. that the ""world is finally waking up to the injustices of racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination, and putting laws in place to stop them from destroying people's lives. Povertyism ... must be treated just as seriously.""

While various socioeconomic strata are permeable, particularly in the West — where a poor person can become rich and a rich person can become poor — the other protected identities De Schutter wishes to group the poor with are inflexible. For instance, a woman subjected to sexism cannot become a man, and an elderly man subjected to so-called ageism cannot transform into his younger self.



The Guardian indicated that De Schutter is fully aware that poverty is not similarly a fixed class. Nevertheless, he contends that poverty is ""a trap from which individuals may find it difficult to escape.""

Just as there are presently penalties for sexism and racism, particularly for businesses, anti-povertyist laws, if adopted, would inevitably subject offenders to various consequences.

HR class warfare

""Humiliation and exclusion"" will allegedly remain unless they are criminalized. No more will offenders be able to suggest to an indigent that, given their individual circumstances, they might benefit from adopting certain virtues and qualities, such as industriousness, diligence, self-control, and perseverance.



According to De Schutter, a landlord who refuses to rent to welfare beneficiaries would qualify as an offender, as would an educator who tailored advice to a student on the basis of their socioeconomic status.

It is unclear whether such laws would also entail censorship. For instance, the Bible states that in John 12:8, Jesus Christ said, ""You will always have the poor among you."" Would this passage constitute hate speech for positing a socioeconomic reality contrary to the aim of De Schutter's ""pro-poor affirmative action""?



While De Schutter may answer such questions later this week, it is clear that he holds meritocracy in contempt, reckoning it to be a way for elites to ""confirm their sense of superiority.""

""We have many studies showing that the belief in meritocracy is highest in those more unequal societies, and the U.K. is not faring very well in this regard for the moment, nor is the U.S. in fact,"" he said.

De Schutter anticipates backlash from ""the fringe of the politicians"" who are captive to the ""quasi-pathology that if you succeed in life, it is because you deserve [it]. And so if you fail, it's because somewhere you've [made] a mistake.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senior-suspended-for-wearing-pro-2nd-amendment-shirt-to-high-school-government-class-report,2022-10-26
"‘They want parents indoctrinated’: Several woke NYC private schools require parents to take ‘anti-racism’ training, sign pledges — or else","Several New York City private schools mandate woke training for parents — and some parents said if they refuse to participate in the controversial programs, their children will not be admitted to the schools.



The New York Post reported that at least five elite private schools in the city require parents to attend training in “anti-racism” and “diversity, equity and inclusion.”

One of the academies accused of pushing controversial theories is Brearley School, an all-girls private school in Manhattan. The student application states that “parents are expected to attend two diversity, equity, inclusion and anti-racism (DEIA) workshops per school year.”

Parents are also expected to write 500-word essays swearing their allegiance to those values, and should their child be accepted into the elite school, parents must sign an oath pledging their support of those values.

“We expect teachers, staff members, students and parents to participate in anti-racist training and to pursue meaningful change through deliberate and measurable actions. These actions include identifying and eliminating policies, practices and beliefs that uphold racial inequality in our community,” the pledge reads.

Andrew Gutmann, whose daughter had been enrolled at the school, wrote a public letter criticizing the private school for pushing critical race theory.

“They want parents indoctrinated the same way they want their kids,” he stated.

Chapin School held an “optional” panel earlier this month for prospective parents to discuss the academy’s “ongoing commitment to equity & inclusion, including our newest community-wide initiatives.”

According to one mother, the panel discussion was anything but optional.

“They take attendance, they have name tags, there is someone from the admissions office to keep track of who goes and who doesn’t,” the mom told the Post. “If you don’t go, your child is not going to go very far in the admission process.”

Another mother stated that she was “talked to” by school officials after her son said boys are physically more capable at sports than girls.

The mom said she was told her child “had to better understand the values of inclusion at the school, and I had to familiarize myself with the values of inclusion at the school and be clear with my child as to what they were so he arrived at school prepared.”

In 2020, Grace Church High School required students to sign an oath promising to stand against “racial propaganda” and to “interrupt biases.”

“Respect for differing viewpoints is a fundamental commitment of the school,” a Grace spokesman said. The school added that it no longer requires children to sign the pledge.

Spence School, another all-girls school in New York City, “invited” parents to participate in a “Courageous Conversation equity workshop” hosted by a DEI consulting firm.

“The opportunity to participate in the DEI program offered by PEG is strictly voluntary for parents,"" a Spence spokesperson said. ""These programs do not involve students.”

Horace Mann School, a college-preparatory institution, hosted a “family learning session” during which parents watched a presentation praising Robin DiAngelo, author of the book “White Fragility.”

“The workshop was designed to educate parents about what they were hearing not only in the news at the time but from their children. It was completely voluntary and if a parent rejected this instruction or the content, their children would be welcome at Horace Mann,” a spokesperson for the school told the Post.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/senior-un-official-decries-meritocracy-demands-inclusion-of-made-up-term-povertyism-in-anti-discrimination-law,2022-10-22
Sex offender allegedly executed and then buried his daughter's allegedly abusive boyfriend: Police,"A Minnesota man has been arrested and charged with the murder of his daughter's boyfriend, reports say.

According to a criminal complaint, which is no longer publically available, Michael Lee Laflex, 45, of Brainerd, Minnesota, shot and killed Bryce Brogle, 23, at a storage shed ""on or about the evening of"" October 26. The two had gone together to the shed rented by Laflex. Laflex's daughter, who may have been living with Brogle at the time, reported him missing two days later.

Police with the Crow Wing County Sheriff's Office say that a ""concerned citizen,"" already familiar to them, had spoken with a member of Laflex's family, who, in turn, had spoken with Laflex on Saturday. According to the family member, Laflex believed that Brogle had been physically abusive to his daughter. For that reason, he said he had shot Brogle at the storage shed and transported his dead body elsewhere using a sled. He further told the family member that he had buried Brogle's body, that the gravesite would never be found, and that he had cleaned up the crime scene using bleach, the complaint and probable cause statement said.

A subsequent investigation of the storage shed revealed a bottle of bleach and the presence of blood on the floor. ""There were also marks on the concrete floor of the storage unit that appeared consistent with something being dragged across the floor in a similar width to a sled,"" the complaint alleged.

Police then began searching public land in Crow Wing County and stumbled upon an area which appeared to be an unmarked grave. An excavation of the area unearthed human remains later identified as Brogle. The Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s Office determined that Brogle had died from ""a distant gunshot wound to the back of the head,"" the complaint stated.

The exact location of the burial site has not been disclosed.

The landlord over the property where Brogle and Laflex's daughter supposedly lived came forward and told police that Laflex had called him recently and inquired whether Brogle had ever abused his daughter. The landlord admitted to him that, at one point, he had seen her with two black eyes. The landlord then claimed that Laflex told him that he was going to kill Brogle and that he had already prepared a burial ""hole.""

Reports said that when questioned, Laflex initially told police that an unidentified law enforcement officer had arrested Brogle and confiscated his two cell phones. Laflex later changed his story and said that he had disposed of the two cell phones himself, dumping them in a gas station garbage can. Police said they ultimately recovered Brogle's cell phones.

On Saturday, Laflex was arrested and charged with second-degree murder with intent, but not premeditated murder, and on Tuesday, a Crow Wing County judge set an unconditional bail/bond at $2 million. Should Laflex post bail or bond, he will have to relinquish his passport.

The court did not appoint a public defender for Laflex, who expressed interest in hiring a private attorney.

Laflex is no stranger to law enforcement as he has already been convicted of two sexual offenses. In 1999, he pled guilty to third-degree criminal sexual conduct and was given supervised probation for five years. Then in 2018, he pled guilty to fourth-degree criminal misconduct with an adult considered mentally impaired or otherwise helpless. Records indicate that the victim, diagnosed as developmentally disabled, initially refused Laflex's sexual advances but later acceded to them at Laflex's ""insistence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/several-woke-nyc-private-schools-require-parents-to-take-anti-racism-training-sign-pledges,2022-11-04
Shawnee State University settles with professor who wouldn't use preferred pronouns,"A public university in Ohio will pay $400,000 to a philosophy professor who refused to use a student's preferred pronouns. The settlement arrives four years after the school punished the professor for not using a student's preferred pronouns. The legal team for the professor argued the university violated the professor's First Amendment rights.

During a political philosophy class in January 2018, Shawnee State University professor Nick Meriwether responded to a biological male student's question by saying, ""Yes, sir."" When the class ended, the student confronted Meriwether. The student declared to be transgender, and to be referred to as a woman, with feminine titles and pronouns.

""When Meriwether did not instantly agree, the student became belligerent and promised to get Meriwether fired,"" according to the Alliance Defending Freedom.

The student filed a complaint with the university, which triggered a formal investigation into the incident.

Meriwether said the pronouns would force him to speak and act ""contrary to his own Christian convictions and philosophical beliefs.""

Meriwether reportedly offered to address the student by the individual's first or last name, but the student insisted the professor use the preferred pronouns.

Shawnee State University also rejected Meriwether's compromise, and claimed that ""he effectively created a hostile environment."" The university also slapped the professor with a written warning in his personnel file and threatened ""further corrective actions"" unless he used the student's preferred pronouns.



Meriwether countered with a lawsuit, asserting that the Portsmouth-based school violated his First Amendment rights and his 14th Amendment right to due process.

The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2020, but was revived by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March 2021.

""[Shawnee State University] punished a professor for his speech on a hotly contested issue. And it did so despite the constitutional protections afforded by the First Amendment,"" a three-judge panel wrote in their unanimous opinion. ""The district court dismissed the professor's free-speech and free-exercise claims. We see things differently and reverse.""

On Thursday, the Alliance Defending Freedom announced that Meriwether had won his case against the university. Shawnee State University will pay $400,000 in damages and attorney’s fees to settle the federal lawsuit with Meriwether.

""As part of the settlement, the university has agreed that Meriwether has the right to choose when to use, or avoid using, titles or pronouns when referring to or addressing students,"" the ADF declared. ""Significantly, the university agreed Meriwether will never be mandated to use pronouns, including if a student requests pronouns that conflict with his or her biological sex.""

""This case forced us to defend what used to be a common belief – that nobody should be forced to contradict their core beliefs just to keep their job,"" ADF Senior Counsel Travis Barham said in a statement. ""Dr. Meriwether went out of his way to accommodate his students and treat them all with dignity and respect, yet his university punished him because he wouldn't endorse an ideology that he believes is false.""

""We're pleased to see the university recognize that the First Amendment guarantees Dr. Meriwether – and every other American – the right to speak and act in a manner consistent with one's faith and convictions,"" Barham said.

""Public universities should welcome intellectual and ideological diversity, where all students and professors can engage in meaningful discussions without compromising their core beliefs,"" said ADF Senior Counsel Tyson Langhofer. ""Dr. Meriwether rightly defended his freedom to speak and stay silent, and not conform to the university's demand for uniformity of thought. We commend the university for ultimately agreeing to do the right thing, in keeping with its reason for existence as a marketplace of ideas.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sex-offender-allegedly-executed-and-then-buried-his-daughter-s-allegedly-abusive-boyfriend-police,2022-04-17
"Sheriffs across Illinois are refusing to enforce state's gun ban, and the Democratic governor responds with a threat","Numerous sheriffs across Illinois are refusing to enforce the state's ban on semiautomatic weapons, signed into law by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who threatened those who dared to dissent.

The law bans the sale, manufacture, and possession of semiautomatic weapons in the state, leading guns rights advocates to accuse lawmakers of acting unconstitutionally.

Some sheriffs responded by saying they will refuse to enforce the law.

""Part of my duties that I accepted upon being sworn into office was to protect the rights provided to all of us, in the Constitution,"" wrote Sheriff Nicholas M. Petitgout the residents of McDonough County.

""One of those enumerated rights is the right of the people to keep and bear arms provided under the 2nd Amendment,"" he added. ""Therefore, as the custodian of the jail and chief law enforcement official for McDonough County, that neither myself nor my office will be checking to ensure that lawful gun owners register their weapons with the State, nor will we be arresting or housing law abiding individuals that have been charged solely with non-compliance of this Act.""

WGN-TV reported that 13 sheriffs issued similar proclamations of defiance, including those of the counties of Stephenson, Ogle, Lee, Knox, LaSalle, Logan, Dewitt, Kankakee, Grundy, and Winnebago.

Pritzker responded by threatening law enforcement officers who didn't enforce the law.

""There are of course people who want to politically grandstand, who want to make a name for themselves by claiming that they will not comply, but the reality is that the state police's response will for enforcement, as will all law enforcement all across this state,"" he said at a media briefing.

""And they will in fact do their job,"" he added, ""or they won't be in their job.""

Republicans also denounced the law and said it would make felons out of otherwise law-obeying taxpayers.

""These commonly owned semi-automatic firearms are used countless times every year to save lives and deter crime,"" read a statement from the Gun Owners of America.

""Banning them will only prevent law-abiding citizens from purchasing the best firearm to defend themselves,"" they added. ""Not to mention, the requirement to register currently owned firearms is vehemently unconstitutional.""

Shooter let off easy last year by Soros-boosted DA charged with murder in a repeat performance,"On Monday, 23-year-old Rashad Williams was indicted by a Chatham County grand jury with several felony charges, including malice murder. He is alleged to have shot two people in Savannah, Georgia, in May. Despite having committed a similar crime four years ago, he was spared a significant jail sentence and freed owing to a deal negotiated by the George Soros-linked Chatham County District Attorney's Office.

On May 8, at 2:30 a.m., Williams allegedly murdered 32-year-old Ashton Gibbs and shot a 30-year-old woman near Bull and Broughton streets in Savannah. The woman was reportedly taken to hospital and survived.

The Savannah Police Department characterized the shooting as a ""road rage incident,"" and indicated that it had been preceded by a ""verbal altercation.""

Williams was ultimately captured by U.S. Marshals in Columbus, Ohio, on July 14, and extradited to Savannah, where stood for his grand jury indictment on October 3.

WTOC reported that Williams allegedly committed the May 8 shooting while still on probation for a previous shooting conviction.



On August 8, 2018, Williams got into a fight with a woman in Savannah. He retrieved a gun from his car, issued threats and then shot at two witnesses. Although one of the witnesses was grazed in the shooting, neither perished.

According to WTOC, the Chatham County District Attorney's Office negotiated a deal whereby Williams would plead guilty to aggravated assault and in turn receive a 15-year sentence. 11 of those years he would serve not in jail but on probation.

It was also agreed that Williams would receive a first-time offender status, thereby having his felony record wiped clean upon the completion of his probation.

The judge who approved the deal reportedly expressed to Williams, no longer permitted to carry a gun, that he was ""lucky"" he didn't kill somebody.

This deal came together in August 2021, one year into Democrat Shalena Cook Jones' term as Chatham County District Attorney.

Jones ousted former Republican District Attorney Meg Heap in 2020 with the help of George Soros' Justice & Public Safety political action committee.

During the election campaign, Jones claimed not to know anything about the Soros PAC's investment of nearly $80,000 in advertising materials promoting her candidacy. She suggested that Soros didn't influence or impact her messaging, and that ""What I am advocating for at the end of the day is equality, justice, which are all great things.""

Savannah Morning News reported that Jones sought to ""find different ways to resolve misdemeanor crimes in order to streamline the courts.""

According to the Current, Jones' office, which cut the deal with Williams, made expungements more easily accessible, meaning criminals can have their past criminal charges obfuscated from the public view, and has given greater priority to rehabilitation contra prosecution and incarceration.

Part of her progressive approach to tackling crime is to spare youths facing gun possession charges jail or prison time, and instead provide them with housing support, job training, and education.

On September 25, Jones stated that ""putting people behind bars for extended periods of time ... is not keeping you safe, it is not keeping the citizens of America safe, and it is not keeping the citizens of Chatham County safe.""



The odds of becoming a victim of violent crime in Savannah is 1 in 190. Across the city, crimes are up 22% since 2020, when Jones took office.

Republican state Rep. Ron Stephens deemed Jones a ""Soros-funded district attorney"" who ""will not prosecute violent crime.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sheriffs-refuse-gun-ban-threat,2022-10-04
'Slam dunk win' for Canadian pastor who defied lockdown orders – Court of Appeal unanimously overturns finding of contempt,"Canadian Pastor Artur Pawlowski had a tremendous legal victory last week after being previously found guilty of contempt for holding church services during COVID shutdowns and refusing an Alberta Health Services (AHS) employee access to his church.

Pawlowski made headlines last April when he released a video of authorities demanding entry into his church. The cellphone video of the altercation with the Calgary police escorting a public health official went viral on Twitter.

Local law enforcement issued a statement expressing concern ""that the people in attendance were not adhering to the government's COVID-19 public health orders, which are in place to ensure everyone's safety.""

Following this first confrontation, authorities repeatedly attempted to gain access to Pawlowski's church during the COVID restriction period. The pastor was arrested several times for refusing to comply with the shutdown orders. Despite the intimidation attempts, Pawlowski kept his church open to the public and encouraged attendance.

The Alberta Court of Appeal decided to set aside the finding of contempt and the sanction order imposed on Pawlowski and his brother, Dawid. The $15,733.50 fine to AHS was dropped and ordered to be reimbursed.

Pawlowski's lawyer, Sarah Miller, shared the Court of Appeal's unanimous decision on Twitter last Friday.

During an interview with Rebel News, Pawlowski said, ""I just did what is the definition of my job. I'm a pastor. I opened the church.""

Restaurant owner of Whistle Stop Cafe Christopher Scott also won his appeal but did not walk away with a total victory. Scott's new sanctions cut his previous $20,000 fine in half. He also received three days in jail and eight months of probation. The court stated that the former provision violated his rights and amounted to ""an error in principle that requires us to consider afresh the appropriate sanction to address Mr. Scott's contempt.""

In the earlier lower court ruling, Artur Pawlowski, Dawid Pawlowski, and Christopher Scott were required to include a disclaimer anytime they spoke against the government. The addendum stated, ""I am aware that the views I am expressing to you on this occasion may not be views held by the majority of medical experts in Alberta."" These speech sanctions have since been thrown out.

""We're not criminals. Those that did that to us are the criminals. And I hope one day, we will be able to go after the real villains and charge them for the crimes that they have committed,"" stated Pastor Pawlowski.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/shooter-let-off-easy-last-year-by-soros-boosted-da-charged-with-murder-in-a-repeat-performance,2022-07-27
Small Texas police department stands up to social media mob over deputy's selfie with Kyle Rittenhouse,"A small town police department in Texas has refused to back down despite the social media firestorm that resulted from a selfie one of its deputies took with Kyle Rittenhouse.

On Thursday, the Facebook account of the Thrall Police Department in Williamson County, Texas, posted a picture of an unidentified deputy with Kyle Rittenhouse, the 19-year-old who last November, was acquitted of all charges in the shooting deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and the shooting of Gaige Grosskreutz during the Kenosha riots of 2020.

The initial Facebook post featured a picture of Rittenhouse with the officer and read: ""Make those stops, you never know who you might meet. Today it was Kyle Rittenhouse, welcome to Texas.""

A swarm of critical comments then ensued. However, rather than back down and cater to the mob's outrage, the police department doubled down and added the following message to the original post: ""I must have missed something, I believed that this young man was arrested, charged, indicted and then found not guilty by a jury of his peers. Is this not how our country works anymore? The hate in these comments is terrible, if you have information that is contrary to that I would honestly love to hear it.""









The post remains active and has garnered over 12k likes, 1.8k shares, and 1.7k comments as of Monday afternoon.

Rittenhouse was just 17 when he travelled from Illinois to Kenosha to protect area businesses which had been looted and damaged during the riots that came in response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Officer Rusten Sheskey shot Blake, who is black, during a domestic dispute in the summer of 2020. Blake admitted he had a knife in his possession at the time of the incident.

Fox Business reported that the riots that occurred as a result of the shooting caused an estimated $50 million in property damages in the Kenosha area.

It is unclear how the unnamed Thrall deputy and Rittenhouse met. Rittenhouse is allegedly studying at Blinn College, a junior college outside of Austin. He may also have aspirations of transferring to Texas A&M some day. He had plans to study nursing at Arizona State University, but reconsidered after his trial.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/slam-dunk-win-for-pastor-pawlowski-court-of-appeal-unanimously-overturns-finding-of-contempt,2022-08-15
"Small-town Texas restaurant gives adults with special needs the opportunity to learn job skills, independent living","A small-town restaurant in Texas is making a big difference in the lives of an underserved community: those with special needs.

Beneventi’s Italian Restaurant in Mingus, Texas, located about two hours west of Dallas, offers adults with special needs the opportunity to spend some time away from home and learn important job and life skills that may help them transition into independent living.

Jan Underwood, owner of Beneventi's, established the Each & Everyone Foundation in 2010 after she saw the positive impact that vocational training had on her son, Austin. Austin, who has Down syndrome, received a high school diploma in Texas but couldn't find a program in the state that would help him learn job skills since he struggles with reading and math. However, thanks to a program at Eastern New Mexico University, Austin was able to earn a ""vocational degree"" in just a year.

And he has put what he has learned to good use. Austin is the proud owner of his own hot dog food truck called Austin's Underdawgs, which has already sold about 50,000 hot dogs, according to Austin's estimates. Austin also owns his own home in Fort Worth.

His mother, meanwhile, has used her experience helping Austin gain his independence to help other adults with ""learning differences"" do the same. After applying through the Mingus Job Accelerator, participants travel to Mingus to learn how to perform some of the necessary tasks of the food service industry.

""We bring them in, just like any other employee, and we just train them,"" Underwood recently told Fox News.

""We refuse to compromise on quality in our restaurant,"" Beneventi's boasts on its website, indicating that program participants are held to high standards like all other employees.

In addition to job skills, program participants also learn independent living. They stay in their own private tiny house during their training, which lasts from one to four weeks. They receive pay for up to four hours of work each day they train.

The cost of the program is $700/week and includes all meals, though trainees are encouraged to practice preparing their own meals in the restaurant kitchen as well.

""I think people with special needs need to learn how to be just like me,"" said Austin, who introduced Rachel Campos-Duffy and the Fox News audience to his girlfriend, Jenny Stone.

""She makes my heart really nice,"" Austin said of Jenny. ""She's the one for me.""

""We're kind of like ... a celebrity couple,"" Jenny agreed.

'We will never back down in our defense of the 2nd Amendment': Smith & Wesson president and CEO says politicians push policies that worsen crime problem then scapegoat gun manufacturers,"Smith & Wesson president and CEO Mark Smith issued a statement in which he said that politicians who have denigrated the gun manufacturer have actually contributed to the nation's crime problem due to the policies that they support.

""A number of politicians and their lobbying partners in the media have recently sought to disparage Smith & Wesson. Some have had the audacity to suggest that after they have vilified, undermined, and defunded law enforcement for years, supported prosecutors who refuse to hold criminals accountable for their actions, overseen the decay of our country's mental health infrastructure, and generally promoted a culture of lawlessness, Smith & Wesson and other firearm manufacturers are somehow responsible for the crime wave that has predictably resulted from these destructive policies,"" the statement reads.

""But they are the ones to blame for the surge in violence and lawlessness, and they seek to avoid any responsibility for the crisis of violence they have created by attempting to shift the blame to Smith & Wesson, other firearm manufacturers and law-abiding gun owners,"" Smith continued.

Many politicians remain staunch advocates for gun control measures — last month the U.S. House of Representatives passed the ""Assault Weapons Ban of 2022,"" though the bill will probably not advance through in the Senate.

While the term ""gun violence"" has become a commonplace expression, guns do not commit crimes, people do.

""To be clear, a Smith & Wesson firearm has never broken into a home; a Smith & Wesson firearm has never assaulted a woman out for a late-night run in the city; a Smith & Wesson firearm has never carjacked an unsuspecting driver stopped at a traffic light. Instead, Smith & Wesson provides these citizens with the means to protect themselves and their families,"" Smith declared.

""We will never back down in our defense of the 2nd Amendment,"" he concluded.

The Second Amendment of the Constitution states, ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

"Some Pennsylvania teachers promise to defy district request that they use students' birth names, biological pronouns","At least five teachers in one eastern Pennsylvania school district have reportedly claimed that they will not abide by a district recommendation that teachers use birth names and biological pronouns with all students unless their parents have been made aware of their request for a new name and alternative pronouns.

According to a report first issued by the Bucks County Courier Times, two Central Bucks West High School teachers have gone on record denouncing the practice of so-called ""deadnaming"" supposedly transgender or otherwise gender-nonconforming students and to promise to defy any policy that requires it.

""A lot of us are distraught"" about the policy, said CBWHS English teacher Rebecca Cartee-Haring.

""I physically felt sick in that meeting,"" she continued, according to WHYY, ""listening to an administrator basically argue that we were going to protect ourselves by outing children … it’s heart-wrenching. … It’s just cruel.""

Cartee-Haring, who has taught at CBWHS for 16 years, also claimed to speak for many other teachers at the school as well.

""There are very few hills that teachers are going to die on,"" she said. “But in this case, most of the people I talked to said, ‘I’m willing to go in the line of fire, if I have to sit in a meeting with an angry parent, I’m going to do that.'""

One of her colleagues at CBWHS, David Klein, seems to stand in solidarity with Cartee-Haring about the new district recommendation. Klein has taught social studies at the school since 2000, and he indicated that his seniority gives him some protection to violate district policies with which he disagrees. The new gender recommendation is one such policy.

""There’s no way I’m hurting a kid. H*** no. I cannot be complicit in harming children,” Klein stated. ""...[T]his is the most at-risk, marginalized group of students. They need our support more than anyone else.""

WHYY reported that Klein raised his voice as he spoke. According to WHYY, he became even more emotional as he continued to express concern about the safety of LGBTQ students, whom he worries may not feel supported at home.

""Pardon me,"" Klein excused himself as he choked up.

WHYY claims to have interviewed another teacher who would not follow the policy, but that teacher preferred to remain anonymous. The Daily Caller also reported that two teachers at nearby Lenape Middle School likewise promised not to abide by the policy, though their names were not disclosed. Those teachers also reportedly stated that other teachers in the school promised defiance as well.

Despite all of the controversy, district superintendent Abram Lucabaugh claimed that the policy is merely a recommendation, not a requirement, and that schools will consider each situation on a ""case-by-case basis.""

""The district understands the importance and sensitivity of this issue. Every child is unique, every situation is different, and our school counselors — trained professionals — work with students individually, building relationships based on care and compassion,"" Lucabaugh said. ""Should a teacher receive a name change request from a student, teachers bring our school counselors into that conversation. We also understand that parents are stakeholders in these matters, too. We work with students and their parents/guardians on a case-by-case basis in seeking to reach an agreed-upon solution for each student.""

"South Dakota Republican accused of raping underage family member repeatedly, charged with felony child abuse: 'You promised you’d never do this'","Warning: Graphic content.



A Republican running for state Senate in South Dakota has been accused of heinous crimes: molesting, raping, and maniacally monitoring the actions of an underage female family member ""since she was a young child.""

On May 6, a woman, now 19, told police that Joel Koskan, a Republican running for the state Senate seat for District 26, began molesting her when she was just 12. The abuse continued off and on for years until she turned 17, when he began raping her, she alleged.

""She explained that ever since she was young, Joel [Koskan] would give her very long hugs, kiss her and have her sit on his lap,"" a retired agent with the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation wrote in a probable cause statement filed with the courts. ""[The woman] thought that it was ‘normal things’ that families were supposed to do.""

Koskan also owned the property where she lived, so he installed cameras to watch her in her home, she said, and tracked her movements through GPS monitors on her phone and in her vehicle.





When she was 14, the girl attended a faith-based summer camp, where she learned about inappropriate physical contact with adults. At that moment, something ""clicked,"" she said, and she began to question what she had experienced. She reported the alleged molestation to camp officials, who then reported the allegations to the Department of Social Services. However, she later refused to participate in an investigation by a social worker, and the case was dropped.

The visit from a social worker did curtail Koskan's behavior temporarily, she told police. However, after a few years, he began assaulting her once again, she said. After she took a shower, Koskan would allegedly ""require"" her to straddle him wearing only a nightgown, no underwear. He then began penetrating her with his fingers and eventually began forcing himself on her when she was 17.

After that, she claimed, Koskan initiated intercourse with her ""many times"" in many different locations throughout the state.

Koskan, interviewed with children Screen shot of New York Post video

During their investigation, police discovered a series of text messages that seem to corroborate the woman's story. One text message is particularly disturbing. When Koskan allegedly discovered, through GPS monitoring, that she had driven herself to the sheriff's office on May 6, he texted, ""You promised you’d never do this. I’m begging you, you don’t want to do this.""

On Thursday, Koskan, a farmer from Wood, South Dakota — located in the south central region of the state — was arrested and charged with a single count of exposing a minor to foreseeable harm, a class 4 felony that carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. He could also be charged with rape, sexual contact with a child under the age of 16, and aggravated incest-related child abuse, according to the New York Post.

He has a hearing scheduled for Nov. 7.

In light of the allegations, the Democratic Party of South Dakota has called for Koskan to ""end his campaign.""

""These allegations concerning Joel Koskan are deeply disturbing, and he should immediately end his campaign,"" party chairman Randy Seiler said in a statement. ""While he will still appear on the ballot, the choice for the voters of District 26 couldn’t be clearer. Partisan politics aside, Joel Koskan should not be voting in the legislature on issues that affect South Dakota kids — or any issues at all.""

The state Republican Party likewise released a statement, though stopped short of calling for Koskan to drop out of the race.

""The allegation against Joel Koskan is very serious, and the South Dakota Republican Party unequivocally opposes child abuse in all forms,"" South Dakota GOP Chairman Dan Lederman said. ""The South Dakota Republican Party trusts the justice system to work through the allegation.""

Koskan has not ended his campaign but has disabled his Twitter account and taken his campaign website private.

Spotify releases new metrics showing the attempt to boycott over Joe Rogan failed spectacularly,"Spotify released new data on Wednesday showing the attempt to sink the audio streaming platform earlier this year failed spectacularly.

What is the background?

Controversy erupted in January after Joe Rogan hosted several medical doctors on the ""Joe Rogan Experience"" who offered perspectives about the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID vaccines that deviated from the government's approved narrative.

Rogan was accused of spreading misinformation, sowing vaccine hesitancy, and he was even accused of being a ""menace to public health.""

Musicians like Neil Young and Joni Mitchell yanked their music from the platform, and users declared they were canceling their Spotify subscriptions because the platform continued to host Rogan's podcast, which is the biggest in the world. Despite the pushback, Spotify, which has an exclusive contract with Rogan, refused to cancel him.

What is happening now?

Spotify CEO Daniel Ek announced Wednesday that Spotify grew in the first quarter of 2022 despite the backlash and cancel campaign.

The company said paid memberships grew to 182 million from 180 million the previous quarter, which amounted to a 15% year-over-year increase. Monthly active users, meanwhile, rose to 422 million from 406 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, which amounted to a 19% increase in active users. Total revenue also increased year-over-year by 24%.

Spotify's metrics actually would have been even better had the company not withdrawn from the Russian market, which cut approximately 1.5 million users from the service.

""Excluding the impact of our exit from Russia, subscriber growth exceeded expectations,"" the company told shareholders.

Anything else?

Rogan disclosed on his podcast last week that all the attention the media devoted to smearing him actually caused his podcast to gain millions of new listeners.

""It's interesting, my subscriptions went up massively — that's what's crazy. During the height of it all, I gained 2 million subscribers,"" Rogan said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/south-dakota-republican-accused-of-raping-underage-family-member-repeatedly-charged-with-felony-child-abuse-you-promised-youd-never-do-this,2022-04-27
Chicago woman claims a squatter with a fake lease moved into her home and refuses to leave — and police say they can't do anything,"A Chicago woman is furious after an alleged squatter with a fraudulent lease moved into her newly-renovated home — and police told her they can't do much anything to make the intruder leave.

Homeowner Danielle Cruz told WLS-TV recently that she and her husband bought the Chatham, Illinois, home with the intention of fixing it up and selling it. But before they had the chance, a stranger entered in and took up occupancy.

Cruz said she first became aware of the intrusion when a contractor the couple had hired to make some final fixes called to tell them that all the locks had changed — and that someone was living inside.

""We honestly thought he was joking because we knew the house was vacant. My husband just repaired the house completely with his own money,"" she recalled. But when they went to check the place out, they discovered that the contractor was telling the truth: There was a young woman living in the home with all of her belongings.

The homeowners immediately called the police. But much to their shock and disappointment, officers said that not much could be done on their end.

Chicago woman says stranger moved into Chatham home, refuses to leave www.youtube.com

Cruz said the woman told police ""she saw an ad for the home online, signed a month-to-month lease with a so-called landlord, and paid $8,000 up front,"" the outlet reported. But Cruz claimed she had never met the woman and certainly did not lease the property to her.

Nevertheless, because officers were not authorized to determine whether or not the lease was fake, the matter would need to be resolved in court.

""They said unfortunately they couldn't prove she was trespassing. We have to go to court and follow the eviction process,"" Cruz told the local outlet. Adding to their complications is the current backlog of cases in Cook County's eviction courts.

Chicago real estate attorney Mo Dadkhah told WLS the whole process could take anywhere from six to 18 months. He added that, unfortunately, the problem is not a new one, and it's happening more and more.

""I definitely feel violated,"" Cruz said. 'We may not live here, but it's still our property. You know, I own this house, and it feels like if anyone can just break into your house and kind of take over. That's a scary feeling.""

Neighbors agreed.

""Well it's disgusting. It's stealing and it's not right,"" said Chiron Baux, who lives in the area.

Another neighbor, Quintara Smith, added: ""No one wants to come back and [find] someone is living in a property. It's frightening. I mean, that can happen to anybody.""

Dadkhah said the Cruzes could either wait it out in the court system and hope for a positive result, or pursue another speedy, but unfortunate, option: cash for key.



""Although it's a difficult pill to swallow to give money to somebody who is unlawfully in your property and refusing to leave, you have to think that $1,000 or $2,000, or whatever that number is that makes them leave, is less expensive in the long run,"" he said.

Cruz told WLS she'd be willing to negotiate with unwelcome tenant, but the woman hasn't agreed to speak.

Cruz said: ""You know, we're trying to live the American dream. They say own property, you know, we are trying to provide for our family. And then this happens, and it almost makes you never want to own anything. It's not worth it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/spotify-boycott-joe-rogan-failed,2022-06-08
Stacey Abrams loses again: Judge rejects suit claiming Georgia's 2018 election was mismanaged,"When Republican Gov. Brian Kemp defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams in Georgia's 2018 gubernatorial election by 54,723 votes, Abrams refused to concede. She suggested that doing so would make her ""complicit"" in a ""rigged"" system. While the delta in votes was too large to legally warrant a recount, Abrams — who will again face Kemp in this year's election — sought other ways to contest the democratic result.

After the election, Abrams' Fair Fight Action organization filed a lawsuit, claiming Georgia had ""grossly mismanaged"" the election, depriving some citizens of their right to vote. In particular, the group took issue with two facets of the state's voter verification processes, both designed to counter voter fraud.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Steve Jones in Atlanta rejected that lawsuit, finding for the defendants on all counts.

Rejected

Jones, appointed by former President Barack Obama, stated that although ""Georgia's election system is not perfect, the challenged practices violate neither the constitution nor the [Voting Rights Act of 1965].""

The trial, which was decided by judge rather than by jury, took place over the course of two months and 21 trial days. Jones suggested it may have ""been the longest voting rights bench trial in the history of the Northern District of Georgia.""

One of the issues at the heart of the trial was Georgia's ""exact match"" policy, whereby the information on a voter registration application must comport with the records kept by Georgia's Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration.

In the event that there is not a match, the applicant is notified by letter from the county board of registrars that the application has been assigned a pending status. The application can be completed thereafter by way of the applicant providing sufficient evidence they are who they claim to be.

Abrams' group claimed that this requirement disproportionately affected minorities and immigrants and violated the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act.

Fair Fight attorney Allegra Lawrence-Hardy advanced the claim that Georgia officials had made it ""harder to register, harder to stay registered and ultimately harder to vote"" and intimated that requiring voters to have valid documentation on hand was ""designed to keep certain people from voting.""

In his 288-page decision, Jones stated that the ""defendants have a compelling interest in preventing voter fraud"" and that ""the limited burdens placed on voters by Exact Match citizen verification are justified."" Furthermore, Jones indicated that Fair Fight failed to prove the policy violated either the First or 14th Amendments.

According to Josh Belinfante, a lawyer for state election officials, Abrams' group was motivated by a desire to turn Georgia into a blue state. Belinfante indicated that among the over 3,000 stories cited by Fair Fight, only a handful were from persons unable to cast a ballot in the 2018 election. Not one reported having an issue in the 2020 election.

Gov. Brian Kemp said Friday's ruling ""exposes this legal effort for what it really is: a tool wielded by a politician hoping to wrongfully weaponize the legal system to further her own political goals.""

Although Jones ruled against all the claims brought by Fair Fight, Abrams said in a statement, ""The conduct of this trial and preceding cases and legislative actions represent a hard-won victory for voters who have endured long lines, burdensome date of birth requirements and exact match laws that disproportionately impact Black and Brown voters.""

Notwithstanding Abrams' characterization of another loss as a win, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr suggested this rejection ""is existential to who Stacey Abrams has become as a public and political figure.""

""She put herself in the political spotlight nationally, potentially globally, all over the narrative that she lost the governor's race because of voter suppression,"" said Carr. ""And here you have a federal judge saying, it's all untrue. It didn't happen.""

Election denial

In a post-defeat speech on November 16, 2018, Abrams said, ""I will not concede because the erosion of our democracy is not right.""

Abrams, not opposed to criminal non-citizens voting in local elections, told MSNBC's Katy Tur that ""the election was stolen from the people of Georgia.""



On November 19, she told MSNBC's Chris Hayes that it was ""not a free and fair election.""

Abrams later told the New York Times in 2019 that the ""results were purely and fully attributable to voter suppression.""

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who contested the results of the 2016 presidential election, was joined by numerous other Democrats, including former Attorney General Eric Holder, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in reiterating Abrams' claim that the 2018 gubernatorial election had been stolen.

Clinton stumped for Abrams' election-denial narrative at a commemoration of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama, suggesting, ""Stacey Abrams should be governor, leading that state right now.""

Clinton also suggested that ""you can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you.""

Kamala Harris stated, ""Let's say this loud and clear: Without voter suppression, Stacey Abrams would be the governor of Georgia.""

Election reality

It wasn't only U.S. District Judge Steve Jones who has cast doubt on Abrams' allegations of election mismanagement and voter suppression.



The Heritage Foundation noted that ""Georgia was in full compliance with requirements of the National Voter Registration Act, which made it easy to register by mail, at the DMV, state public assistance offices, and at numerous other agencies and locations throughout the state.""

In fact, it had never ""been easier to register to vote in Georgia.""

Ahead of the election in which Abrams lost, the state had nearly 7 million registered voters, ""the most in Georgia's entire history.""

In a 2018 post-election analysis, FiveThirtyEight indicated that voter turnout was ""really big."" Whereas on average, ""roughly 40 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot in a midterm ... an estimated 55% of eligible voters exercised their right to vote, which is about 21 points higher than the state's 1982-2014 average.""

As for the 1.4 million voters reportedly taken off the voter rolls between 2012 and 2018, PolitiFact reported, ""Many died, moved away or lost their right to vote because they committed felonies."" Some were removed because they skipped previous elections and ""had no contact with the election officials.""

Sherman further noted ""that removal policy started in the 1990s under Democratic leadership.""

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said, ""Stolen election and voter suppression claims by Stacey Abrams were nothing but poll-tested rhetoric not supported by facts and evidence.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/squatter-refuses-to-leave-chicago-womans-home,2022-10-03
Stanford University professor of medicine who challenged COVID lockdowns: 'Academic freedom is dead',"A tenured Stanford professor who called into question the efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, lockdowns, masking for infants, and Dr. Anthony Fauci's recommendations throughout the pandemic gave a damning evaluation of the state of critical thought and academic freedom earlier this month, suggesting that they are not dying on campus but dead.

Thought crimes

Dr. Jay Bhattacharya is a tenured professor of medicine at Stanford University, where he directs the Stanford Center on the Demography of Health and Aging. He is also a research associate at the National Bureau of Economics Research and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research.

Earlier this month, Bhattacharya raised the matter of a censorious and dialogue-averse university community at the Academic Freedom Conference at Stanford's Graduate School of Business. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the conference was met with fierce opposition in the days and weeks leading up to the event.



The aim of the conference was ""to identify ways to restore academic freedom, open inquiry and freedom of speech and expression on campus and in the larger culture.""

A host of Stanford academics signed an open letter accusing the observers of trolling Stanford with their talk of academic freedom, claiming that the event would not leave the university ""unscathed.""

The letter called on Stanford to ""emphatically dissociate itself"" from the event, going so far as to accuse gay Pay-Pal cofounder Peter Thiel, who made remarks at the event, of homophobia and other speakers of racism.

Those opposed to the event were altogether unable to prevent Bhattacharya from joining a panel titled, ""Academic Freedom Applications: Climate Science and Biomedical Sciences,"" and stating, ""We live in an era where ... you have a scientific bureaucrat who ironically tells the world that if you question him, you're not simply questioning the man, you're questioning science itself.""

Bhattacharya was referencing Fauci's suggestion that by criticizing him — the scientist who ran the agency that funded dangerous gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab — ""you're really attacking not only Dr. Anthony Fauci, you're attacking science.""

""We have a high clerisy that declares from on high what is true and what is not true,"" Bhattacharya suggested, adding that the collapse of academic freedom has accelerated significantly in the last two of the 36 years he has spent at Stanford.

""When you take a position that is at odds with the scientific clerisy, your life becomes a living hell,"" Bhattacharya told the conference. ""You face a deeply hostile work environment.""



He emphasized that while the university prides itself on having academic freedom, nothing could be further from the truth, especially when ""academic freedom only matters when you take controversial positions.""

Bhattacharya expounded on his thinking in a recent interview with Fox News Digital, saying, ""The basic premise is that if you don't have protection and academic freedom in the hard cases, when a faculty member has an idea that's unpopular among some of the other faculty – powerful faculty, or even the administration ... if they don't protect it in that case, then you don't have academic freedom at all.""

""Power replaced the idea of truth as the guiding light,"" he added, noting how many scientific communities were cowed into uniformity and uncritical thinking during the pandemic.

Nothing against or outside the state's official narrative

Bhattacharya was one of three authors of the Oct. 4, 2020, ""Great Barrington Declaration,"" a document expressing ""grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies"" and recommending instead a ""focused protection"" approach.

According to the declaration, public resources should be focused on those most vulnerable to succumbing to COVID-19. Everyone else who is at minimal risk should build up natural immunity and ""resume life as normal.""

Anticipating the fallout of lockdowns and school closures, Bhattacharya and his co-authors recommended that schools and universities remain open for in-person teaching; extracurricular activities resume; and low-risk adults work normally, rather from home.



At the Academic Freedom Conference, he noted that the purpose of the document was to ""tell people that there was an alternative and that the scientific community had not coalesced around a single lockdown-focused policy ... that there was not a scientific consensus in favor of lockdown, that in fact many epidemiologists, many doctors, many other people – prominent people – disagreed with the consensus.""

For publicly doubting claims advanced by the Biden administration and the media about the good of lockdowns, he was roundly castigated.



Last year, CNN called him ""crazy"" and accused him of spreading ""dangerous COVID disinformation.""



Fox News Digital reported that extra to the media, he was also denounced by so-called health leaders, including National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, who deemed his declaration ""nonsense and very dangerous.""



In his talk, Bhattacharya referenced former National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Dr. Francis Collins' letter to fellow health bureaucrats imploring them to issue a ""quick and devastating published take down"" of the declaration's premises.

Bhattacharya previously told UnHerd that early in the pandemic, ""there was a debate going on inside the scientific community, and Tony Fauci and the federal government of the United States could not abide that […] because they implemented an extraordinary policy that required absolute consensus.""

While the government ""suppressed and censored and smeared"" independent thinkers and critical scientists, there was no support to be found on campus, only ""a chill.""

Bhattacharya said that one student who had sought to have the Stanford professor publicly discuss his declaration was reportedly met with ""reprisals,"" given the prevailing noting that ""platforming [Bhattacharya] was a dangerous thing.""

Bhattacharya suggested that what is actually dangerous is refusing to platform opposing or alternate views: ""If you have a legitimate scientific view, a legitimate policy view, to not speak of it ... sends a message that we do not care about the truth.""

He indicted the university, particularly its leaders, suggesting that their refusal to support those on campus with differing viewpoints made it abundantly clear that ""academic freedom is dead ... and if university leaders do not stand up for it, they do not deserve the positions they have.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/stacey-abrams-loses-again-judge-rejects-suit-claiming-georgias-2018-election-was-mismanaged,2022-11-21
Starbucks CEO demands employees come into the office at least three days a week after employees refuse to meet one day per week commitment,"Workers at Starbucks' corporate office in Seattle, Washington, will be required to work in-office at least three days per week, if within commuting distance, a memo from CEO Howard Schultz describes.

Starbucks is one of several large corporations putting their foot down about employees working from home over COVID-19 safety protocols, joining Disney, which announced in early January 2023 that employees need to go to work four days per week.

Apple recently instituted a three in-office days per-week policy, and Snapchat's parent company is requiring 80% of employee work to be done in-office, according to CNN.

Any employee who lives ""within commuting distance"" of the Starbucks Support Center will have to start heading to the corporate office three times per week, including Tuesday and Wednesday, starting Jan. 30, 2023.

The memo stressed that the company's culture of togetherness and in-person connection was damaged greatly by lockdowns, both at its headquarters and its stores.

""We have lost a true human connection at the SSC. We need to rebuild that. Failing to do so as we emerge from the pandemic puts us at a great loss,"" the CEO said.

Schultz says that the company members made a promise to return to the office but haven't, and as such, others have not been treated fairly.

""Partners in our offices have had the privilege of not coming into the workplace ... each of us made a promise to each other to be in the office between one to two days a week,"" the leader of the coffee giant remarked.

""From our badging data, it’s clear that a good number of SSC partners are not meeting their minimum promise of one day a week,"" he explained.

The main reason for the forced return, Schultz says, is a lack of speed and prioritization in operations.

""We are having a hard time operationalizing decisions quickly and thoughtfully,"" he said, describing the work-from-home atmosphere as working in ""silos.""

Executive Vice President and Chief Partner Officer Sara Kelly gave a speech at the headquarters stressing a ""cultural bubble"" that the company has lost. Kelly described a set of ""rituals"" that are unique to the company, such as coffee-tasting, story-telling and simply bumping into friends in between meetings.

Despite the issues, Starbucks stock rose over 5% in the first two weeks of 2023.

"State employees stole over $6.7 million in unemployment benefits, Georgia audit alleges","A recent Georgia audit revealed that nearly 300 full-time state employees may have fraudulently collected unemployment benefits in 2020 and 2021.



WSB-TV Investigator Justin Gray broke the story on Wednesday morning after Georgia inspector general Scott McAfee sent a letter to Governor Brian Kemp (R), warning that an internal investigation uncovered that at least 280 state employees were suspected of stealing more than $6.7 million in unemployment benefits.

The employees are accused of applying for and collecting benefits while still employed by the state of Georgia.

McAfee’s letter claimed that the investigation only included full-time employees still employed with the state. He noted that the reported number of alleged fraud cases was a “conservative estimate,” considering the investigation did not include part-time employees, those no longer employed by the state, or those who received less than $1,000 in unemployment benefits.

“These payments averaged $24,700 per employee and totaled over $6.7 million. And this is a conservative estimate,” the letter stated.

According to McAfee, the Office of the State Inspector General interviewed approximately 24 full-time state workers accused of fraudulently applying for unemployment benefits. As a result, “nearly all” were fired.

One of those employees included a Georgia Department of Labor unemployment insurance claims examiner who allegedly collected $31,220 in benefits. The letter stated that the employee repeatedly updated a fraudulent unemployment insurance account while working full-time with the GDOL.

The cases have been turned over to the Office of the Attorney General’s Prosecution Division.

“It’s shameful, in my opinion,” Georgia Labor Commissioner-Elect Bruce Thompson told WSB-TV. “The fact that we have state employees committing fraudulent acts while we have other people who can’t get payments due to them, that’s a big problem.”

“If you willfully do that, we should prosecute to the fullest, especially if you are a state employee,” Thompson added.

According to the inspector general, the Department of Labor refused to cooperate with the IG’s requests for information.

As a result of the alleged hindered investigation, McAfee’s letter requested that the General Assembly pass legislation allowing the Office of the State Inspector General administrative subpoena authority.

DOL Commissioner Mark Butler denied the accusation made against his department.

“They wanted a lot of personal information about state employees that we could not legally hand over to them, especially not based upon a fishing expedition,” Butler told WSB-TV. “It was not legally permissible.”

McAfee suggested to Kemp that the state extend the statute of limitations for prosecuting pandemic-related fraud to provide adequate time to investigate the remaining cases. To crack down on future theft, the IG also recommended quarterly checks to ensure state employees have not submitted fraudulent applications.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/starbucks-three-days-inoffice,2023-01-05
"Fox News host Steve Doocy rebukes Tim Scott, explains why DOJ wants FBI affidavit for Trump raid hidden from public","Fox News host Steve Doocy pushed back on Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) on Tuesday morning for demanding that Attorney General Merrick Garland release the FBI affidavit used to obtain a warrant for the search and seizure at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.

Scott is one of several Republican officials who have chastised the Department of Justice and the FBI for arriving unannounced at Trump's home on Aug. 8 and raiding his possessions in search of purported classified materials that Trump allegedly held at Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House.

On ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday, co-host Ainsley Earhardt noted that Republicans have argued there are ""inconsistencies"" in how federal law enforcement officials have treated Trump versus how they have dealt with Democrats accused of mishandling classified material, namely former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She referred to an interview Scott gave to Fox News on Monday in which he blasted federal law enforcement for ""the infrequent, inconsistent application of the rule of law as it relates to President Trump.”

""I can’t imagine how it feels to see a 232-year precedent go down the drain, over what? A dispute over what should or should not be included in our national archives,"" Scott said.

“To me, until we see specificity within the affidavit, we will not have the kind of clarity that the American people need to come to their own conclusion,” he told Fox News' Bret Baier. “And without that, this unprecedented, alarming raid remains at a high level of urgency to bring about real solutions that today are elusive because Merrick Garland refuses to cooperate in releasing all the information necessary to understand what happened.”

Garland announced last week that the Department of Justice would seek to unseal the search warrant, declaring it a matter of public interest because Trump and his supporters have accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the justice system against him. But the DOJ has asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart to keep the FBI affidavit that outlines what probable cause existed to obtain a warrant hidden from the public's view.

The government claims releasing the warrant would ""cause significant and irreparable damage to this ongoing criminal investigation."" Doocy pointed out that Scott should know this and also said, ""The senator knows that in a criminal investigation like this, they don’t release it until they’ve figured out whether or not somebody’s going to be charged or not.”

“And if they’re not charged, they don’t release it, so that they do not unfairly tarnish the reputation of an innocent person,” Doocy said.

Watch:



This wasn't the first time the ""Fox & Friends"" co-host was critical of rhetoric against the FBI and Justice Department since the raid at Mar-a-Lago.

On Monday, Doocy said ""it would be great"" if Trump would put out a statement condemning ""violent rhetoric"" aimed at FBI agents. Trump did so Monday evening in a statement to Fox News, in which he said he ""will do whatever"" he can ""to help the country"" and that ""the temperature has to be brought down"" after the FBI raided his home.

""The country is in a very dangerous position. There is tremendous anger, like I've never seen before, over all of the scams, and this new one — years of scams and witch hunts, and now this,"" Trump said.

""If there is anything we can do to help, I, and my people, would certainly be willing to do that,"" he added.

"White House hosts NBA stars in gun control roundtable, includes anti-gun activist coach Steve Kerr","On their recent celebratory visit to the White House, the NBA champion Golden State Warriors presented President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris with their own jerseys, but a few of the players also participated in a roundtable on gun violence, according to Deadline.

Players Klay Thompson and Moses Moody and coach Steve Kerr reportedly took part in the discussion with White House officials, with Kerr stating that they ""learned a lot about what this administration is doing to help create a safer environment in our country.""

""That is something that is very close to my heart,"" the coach added.

Kerr is a noted anti-gun activist who has over the years made many statements calling out Republican senators and politicians, even blaming party members for shootings.

They “refuse to do anything about the violence, the school shootings, the supermarket shootings,” and they put their “desire for power ahead of the lives of our children, our elderly, and our churchgoers,"" Kerr said in 2022.

Kerr also partners with gun control advocacy group the Brady Campaign, which outlines a 12-point plan to end gun violence.

The team, composed of the same core players as when Donald Trump was president, refused to meet the 45th president of the United States on two separate occasions after winning NBA titles.

Kerr even wrote an open letter to President Trump through Sports Illustrated in 2017, commenting on how easy it was to ""put politics aside"" when meeting previous presidents such as the Bush family, Obama, Reagan, and Clinton after winning NBA championships as a player and then coach.

""The truth is we all struggled with the idea of spending time with a man who has offended us with his words and actions time and again,"" Kerr said at the time, saying that if he were to go to the White House, he would demand a sit-down discussion with the president to discuss topical issues.

In the White House press room, many-time MVP Steph Curry thanked the Biden administration for ""hard work and diligence"" in exchanging a Russian arms dealer for WNBA player Brittney Griner, calling her a part of the ""basketball family.""

Schmidt claims DeSantis would 'kill his political opponents',"Steve Schmidt, who was one of the co-founders of the vehemently anti-Trump Lincoln Project, has claimed that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would murder his political opponents if afforded the opportunity.

Schmidt also called the Sunshine State's Republican governor ""a vicious man,"" ""a canker on the soul of"" the U.S., as well as ""A political sadist and constitutional vandal,"" and ""a bully and a weakling.""

""I'm going to say something. There is no hyperbole attached to it. I mean it. Every word. Anyone who thinks Ron Desantis wouldn't kill his political opponents given the chance doesn't understand who he is. He just proved it. The refusal to see that is stupid. Recklessly stupid,"" Schmidt tweeted on Thursday. ""The Desantis Martha's Vineyard stunt was a capricious act of cruelty built on a mountain of dehumanization,"" he added in another tweet. ""Desantis is a canker on the soul of this country. Voting is the penicillin necessary to rid ourselves of the Tallahassee infection. VOTE HIM OUT,"" Schmidt wrote.

DeSantis, who is currently running against former governor Charlie Crist during the state's 2022 gubernatorial election contest, has become a popular figure on the political right who many view as someone who could eventually mount a presidential bid.

Liberals have been up in arms over the news that migrants were flown to Martha's Vineyard on Wednesday — Taryn Fenske, communications director for the Florida governor, noted that the Sunshine State is behind the flights.

""Yes, Florida can confirm the two planes with illegal immigrants that arrived in Martha's Vineyard today were part of the state's relocation program to transport illegal immigrants to sanctuary destinations,"" Fenske told Fox News. ""As you may know, in this past legislative session the Florida legislature appropriated $12 million to implement a program to facilitate the transport of illegal immigrants from this state consistent with federal law,"" she noted.

NPR reported that flight trackers indicate that two flights departed from San Antonio, Texas — the outlet said that one of planes stopped in Florida and South Carolina prior to reaching Martha's Vineyard, while the other aircraft stopped in Florida and North Carolina before arriving at Martha's Vineyard.

While Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has been busing migrants out of the Lone Star State and into left-wing cities, Abbott's office noted that it was not involved in the flights to Martha's Vineyard on Wednesday.

""Our office has had conversations with Governor DeSantis and his team about supporting our busing strategy to provide much-needed relief to our overwhelmed and overrun border communities,"" a spokesperson for Abbott noted, according to NPR. ""Though we were not involved in these initial planes to Martha's Vineyard, we appreciate the support in responding to this national crisis and helping Texans. Governor Abbott encourages and welcomes all his fellow governors to engage in this effort to secure the border and focus on the failing and illegal efforts of the Biden-Harris Administration to continue these reckless open border policies.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/steve-kerr-warriors-whitehouse-roundtable,2022-09-15
"Students robbed of scholarship opportunities after top school hid academic awards for the sake of equity, refused to ‘focus on their achievements’","Two administrators at the highest-ranking high school in the nation robbed students of college scholarships and admission opportunities after they hid students' academic awards to push an equitable learning environment, the New York Post reported.



Many students at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia, earned National Merit awards, but the school never notified them. According to U.S. News & World Report, Thomas Jefferson is the highest-ranked high school in the nation.

Since students were never made aware of their National Merit awards, they could not use them to potentially receive millions of dollars in college scholarships and boost their college admission opportunities.

The school district chose to withhold this information to comply with its strategy of ""equal outcomes for every student, without exception.""

The Post uncovered that two school officials, Principal Ann Bonitatibus and Director of Student Services Brandon Kosatka, intentionally withheld notification of academic awards from students and families for years, possibly impacting up to 1,200 students during Bonitatibus' five years at the school.

According to the New York Post, Thomas Jefferson adopted an ""equitable grading"" policy that eliminated zeros and automatically gave students who attended class a minimum grade of 50%. In 2020, Bonitatibus failed to inform parents that she had lobbied to remove the school's merit-based admission test to support ""diversity.""

The National Merit organization only notifies the school when a student has been recognized for an award. When asked why the organization does not directly contact students or their families, a National Merit spokesperson told the Post that ""high school officials have consistently requested to be the first to announce and recognize their Semifinalists and Commended Students in the National Merit Scholarship Program.""

Shawna Yashar, a parent whose child received an award but was not notified by Thomas Jefferson, told the Post, ""Keeping these certificates from students is theft by the state.""

According to local parent advocate Debra Tisler, the school's decision to withhold the awards could be a civil rights violation since most TJ students are considered ""gifted"" and many are racial minorities.

Yashar stated that during a phone call, Kosatka admitted that the school intentionally withheld the award information.

""We want to recognize students for who they are as individuals, not focus on their achievements,"" Kosatka told Yashar.

Following pushback from the community, Kosatka sent an email to the parents of students who had been recognized. He apologized on behalf of the school and noted that officials would contact college admissions officers to correct the record.

""It was a mistake, to be honest,"" Fairfax County Public Schools Assistant Superintendent Fabio Zuluaga told the Post. ""A commendation sends a very strong message to the kid, right? Your work is meaningful. If you work hard in life, there are good benefits from that.""

A Fairfax County Public Schools spokesperson told InsideNoVa, ""FCPS understands the hard work and dedication of each and every student who competes for college acceptance and scholarship opportunities. Once the issue regarding the fall 2022 notifications was realized, counselors sent emails and made follow-up calls to each college where these students had applied and informed them of the National Merit Scholarship Commendations.""

"Suicidal thoughts, depression 'increased dramatically' among female, LGBQ+ teens: CDC report","A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey revealed that anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts ""increased dramatically"" among female and LGBQ+ teens in 2021, the New York Post reported.



On Monday, the CDC released its Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which tracks health-related trends among teens and adults, including sexual behavior, substance use, experiences of violence, mental health, and suicidality.

The CDC's survey indicated that sadness, hopelessness, poor mental health, suicidal thoughts, and attempted suicide among high school students increased in the last decade.

The report noted a decrease in risky sexual behavior, substance use, and school bullying.

""Unfortunately, almost all other indicators of health and well-being in this report including protective sexual behaviors (i.e., condom use, sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing, and HIV testing), experiences of violence, mental health, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors worsened significantly,"" the report stated.

The CDC found that more female students refused to attend school because of an increased safety concern about sexual violence. In addition, an increased number of male students also refused to attend school, citing experiences of electronic bullying.

According to the survey, nearly 60% of female students experienced ""persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness,"" nearly double the rate of male teens. Approximately 25% of females admitted to creating a suicide plan in 2021.

For comparison, in 2011, only 36% of female students reported feelings of sadness or hopelessness.

""Close to 70% of LGBQ+ students experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness during the past year and more than 50% had poor mental health during the past 30 days,"" it added. ""Almost 25% attempted suicide during the past year.""

More than 40% of high school students reported feelings of sadness or hopelessness that prevented them from participating in regular activities for at least two weeks during the last year. Approximately 10% of students reported having attempted suicide one or more times during the past year, while 18% admitted to making a suicide plan.

CDC Division of Adolescent and School Health Director Kathleen Ethier stated that the findings are ""alarming.""

""Many measures were moving in the wrong direction before the pandemic,"" Ethier stated. ""These data show the mental health crisis among young people continues.""

""Young people are experiencing a level of distress that calls on us to act with urgency and compassion,"" Ethier added. ""With the right programs and services in place, schools have the unique ability to help our youth flourish.""

"Sunny Hostin falsely claims 'good Samaritan' Elisjsha Dicken 'broke the law' by carrying a gun into Indiana mall, where he stopped a mass shooting","The co-hosts of ""The View"" attacked the ""good Samaritan"" who stopped an active shooter at an Indiana mall and got basic facts about the story wrong while dismissing the man's heroic actions as ""lucky.""

On Tuesday's show on ABC, Sunny Hostin falsely stated that 22-year-old gun owner Elisjsha Dicken ""broke the law"" by carrying his firearm at the Greenwood Park Mall, where he used it to stop an active shooter who killed three people and wounded two others with a rifle.

City of Greenwood officials called Dicken a ""hero"" and emphasized that he was ""lawfully carrying a firearm"" when he stopped the shooter.

But the ladies of ""The View"" criticized the argument that a good guy with a gun is the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun.



""They say that a good guy with a gun can control a bad guy with a gun. Well, we saw in Uvalde that that’s not true,” Joy Behar said, referring to a recent report that nearly 400 law enforcement personnel were at Robb Elementary School during the mass shooting in Uvalde, Texas but had failed to stop the shooter. Whoopi Goldberg added that the same was true for the mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York.

But Republican co-host Lindsey Granger pushed back on their narrative, mentioning that ""we saw that it is true in Indiana.""

""It was true in Indiana. That was a lucky moment,"" Behar said dismissively. ""And you know what? I feel like this: if you're a good guy with a gun you should not object to background checks or licensing or, you know, limitation on military-style weapons that kill thousands at once. Or hundreds at once. So, why can't they just pull that off?""



Later on in the discussion, Hostin criticized Dicken for taking action to stop the mall shooter, bringing up her own experience with firearms training.

""But with this good Samaritan thing. Listen, I was trained when I was at the justice department in firearms. And I was trained in defensive firearm training. It is very hard to hit a moving target,"" she said. ""It is hard for people that are trained to hit a moving target. It is very lucky that that good Samaritan hit that moving target in that way.""

She went on to falsely state that Dicken was carrying his firearm illegally.

""He had a gun permit, but he wasn’t supposed in the mall with a gun,” she said. ""So he broke the law, even though he was a good Samaritan.""

Indiana became what is known as a ""Constitutional carry"" state in March when Gov. Eric Holcomb (R) signed a law eliminating the license requirement to carry a handgun. Anyone who previously could obtain a permit to carry a handgun is legally permitted to do so without a permit in Indiana.

The Indianapolis Star reported that the Greenwood Park Mall had a no-gun policy, but attorney and firearms instructor Guy Relford told the paper Indiana's Constitutional Carry and Stand Your Ground laws protected Dicken's actions because he acted to save the people targeted by the shooter.

He compared the mall's policy to a ""no shoes, no shirt, no service"" sign, explaining that while a business could ask a customer that violates the policy to leave, no crime is committed unless the customer refuses to do so. In a case where the customer ignores the business' demand, he would be trespassing, which is a crime in Indiana.

""So the fact that (Greenwood Park Mall) had a no-gun policy creates no legal issue whatsoever for [Dicken],"" Relford said. ""And it certainly has no effect whatsoever on his ability to use force to defend himself or to defend the other people in the mall.""

This was a point Granger made to defend Dicken from Hostin's smear.

“The law of Indiana is different than the law of the mall, of Simon malls. And I would say that takes precedence when you save a life,” she said.

Supreme Court hears free speech case involving Christian web designer seeking to refuse to design same-sex wedding sites,"On Monday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the high-profile free speech case involving Lorie Smith, a Christian graphic designer from Colorado, seeking to refuse to create same-sex wedding websites, Fox News Digital reported.



Smith, owner of 303 Creative, filed the lawsuit in 2016 against Colorado's Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits a business from discriminating based on sexual orientation. According to Smith, being forced to create same-sex wedding websites would violate her sincerely held religious beliefs.

The high court's decision will determine whether all service providers will be forced to suppress their free speech rights in workplace environments. The justices presented multiple hypotheticals to determine whether ruling in Smith's favor would promote the First Amendment.

Smith was joined by her attorney, Kristen Waggoner of Alliance Defending Freedom, in an interview on Fox News' ""The Story"" Monday. Smith explained that Colorado is ""compelling and controlling"" her speech by ""forcing"" her to create custom artwork that goes against her Christian faith.

""I want to create unique one-of-a-kind expression and artwork, and I want to design websites – wedding websites, specifically – that are consistent with my faith,"" Smith stated.

""But the state of Colorado is compelling and controlling my speech, chilling it and forcing me to communicate a message through my custom, unique artwork,"" she continued. ""That violates the core of who I am, and at the core of this case is the right for all to speak freely, and that protects not only myself. [It] protects the LGBT web designer who should not be forced to create custom artwork that opposes same-sex marriage. The right to speak freely is guaranteed to each and every one of us, and a win for me is a win for everybody.""

Smith added that she does not believe anyone ""should be punished for communicating and speaking and creating custom artwork that goes along the lines of what they believe.""

""I serve people from all different walks of life, and I do have clients who identify as LGBT. I cannot create every message requested of me,"" Smith said. ""There are some messages I can't create no matter who requests them.""

Waggoner further clarified Smith's point and explained that she is not refusing service to anyone based on sexual orientation.

""What is important here is that Colorado even agrees that Ms. Smith serves all people,"" stated Waggoner. ""She does serve everyone. She has clients who identify as LGBT, and she serves them. And as the court many times today mentioned, her decisions turn on what the message is and not who the person is.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/sunny-hostin-falsely-claims-good-samaritan-elisjsha-dicken-broke-the-law-by-carrying-a-gun-into-indiana-mall-where-he-stopped-a-mass-shooting,2022-12-06
Marshal didn't request that justices sign sworn affidavits,"Supreme Court Marshal Gail A. Curley said in a statement on Friday that she spoke to the justices amid the investigation into a draft opinion leak, but she never requested that they sign sworn affidavits.

""During the course of the investigation, I spoke with each of the Justices, several on multiple occasions. The Justices actively cooperated in this iterative process, asking questions and answering mine. I followed up on all credible leads, none of which implicated the Justices or their spouses. On this basis, I did not believe that it was necessary to ask the Justices to sign sworn affidavits,"" Curley said in the statement.

The marshal's report on the investigation noted that the probe failed to uncover who was responsible for the leak of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization draft opinion. In May 2022, Politico published the draft, which revealed that the Supreme Court was poised to strike down the 1973 Roe v. Wade abortion ruling — the court's official opinion released in June 2022 did, in fact, overturnRoe.

The report on the leak investigation stated that ""all personnel who had access to the draft opinion signed sworn affidavits affirming they did not disclose the draft opinion nor know anything about who did."" The report also noted, ""A few of those interviewed admitted to telling their spouses about the draft opinion or vote count, so they annotated their affidavits to that effect.""

But the leak remains a mystery, with the report indicating that the investigation did not determine how the Politico obtained the draft.

""At this time, based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, it is not possible to determine the identity of any individual who may have disclosed the document or how the draft opinion ended up with Politico,"" the report read. ""While investigators and the Court’s IT experts cannot absolutely rule out a hack, the evidence to date reveals no suggestion of improper outside access. Investigators also cannot eliminate the possibility that the draft opinion was inadvertently or negligently disclosed – for example, by being left in a public space either inside or outside the building.""

Slate senior writer Mark Joseph Stern suggested that the marshal had not furnished a good rationale for choosing not to ask the justices to sign affidavits. ""If the marshal was so certain the justices weren't involved with the leak, she could've simply asked them to sign a sworn affidavit saying so, just like everyone else. It would not have been difficult. If she has a good reason for refusing to do so, she has not provided it!"" Stern tweeted.

""The logic is odd: Curley says she saw no reason to ask the Justices to sign affidavits because there were no credible leads implicating the Justices or their spouses. Were there credible leads implicating all of the Court employees who *were* asked to sign affidavits?"" tweeted Steven Mazie, whose Twitter profile indicates that he covers the high court for the Economist and teaches political science.

""Note Curley's use of the phrase 'spoke with.' Her report, in contrast, repeatedly used the terms 'interview' and 'formal interview' to describe her questioning of court staff. Not using those terms here suggests that her conversations with the justices were much more informal,"" SCOTUSblog editor James Romoser tweeted.

Supreme Court poised to side with Christian football coach fired for praying after games,"A former Washington state high school football coach who was fired for praying after games may finally be on track for a ruling in his favor after years of setbacks in the legal system.

Joseph Kennedy’s religious liberty case, Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, was heard on Monday by the Supreme Court, and based on the justices' lines of questioning, it appears the conservative-leaning court was sympathetic to his cause.

The Washington Post reported that the questions raised by the court’s conservatives ""indicated they believe the school district has misread the court’s precedents regarding government endorsement of religion, and perhaps were hostile to such demonstrations.""

For example, Justice Clarence Thomas questioned whether Kennedy would have been terminated or otherwise punished had he taken a knee during the singing of the national anthem in protest against racism.

Justice Samuel Alito piggybacked on of Thomas' question, asking what the school district's reaction would be if Kennedy had walked out to the center of the field after a game and waved the Ukrainian flag.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh pushed back on the school district's characterization of Kennedy as an attention-seeker who was using his position of authority to coerce students into praying along with him. Kavanaugh suggested that it would be difficult for a coach to do anything discreetly during a game and noted that Kennedy's postgame prayers were not required activities.

He also wondered how far a rule against government speech should be taken, asking, ""Could a school fire the coach for the sign of the cross right before the game?""

In general, the conservative justices seemed to be interested in deciphering what exactly the school district determined to be official government speech and what kind of reaction they would have to different types of government speech.

In response, the district's attorney, Richard Katskee, said the school could in fact punish a coach for engaging in those types of actions since it ""doesn’t want its event taken over for political speech.""

But Alito shot back, saying, ""Where is the school district rule that says that?""

The justice also went on to express some level of doubt regarding the notion that the district would have reacted in a similar fashion to those circumstances.

For years, Kennedy, a Christian and 20-year Marine veteran, has claimed that his First Amendment were violated when Bremerton School District ordered him to stop praying at the 50-yard line after games in 2015 and summarily fired him when he refused to stop.

But in subsequent court cases, the school district has defended its decision by arguing the coach was not exercising his religion in private.

The court's three liberal justices appeared sympathetic to this line of thinking and, generally, were concerned to protect the school district's authority to prohibit coercive practices. But their votes may not be enough, if most or all of the conservative justices side with Kennedy.

However, a case involving school prayer always presents a difficult balancing act, the Washington Free Beacon noted, and a narrow decision is perhaps to be expected.

The Supreme Court is set to issue a ruling on the case sometime this summer.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/supreme-court-marshal-justices-affidavits,2022-04-26
Liberals rail against Republican Susan Collins after she refuses to vote with Democrats to codify abortion rights,"Liberals continued their outrage about Roe v. Wade on Thursday when they railed against Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine for refusing to vote with Democrats to codify abortion rights.

Collins was asked by CNN's Manu Raju if she would join Democrats on the vote, and she said she would not because it would infringe on conscience rights of Catholic churches.

""That right has been enshrined in law for a long time,"" said Collins.

Many on the left disagreed and took to social media to assail Collins for her decision.

""Susan Collins wants you to know she supports abortion as long as she doesn't need to do anything to actually support abortion,"" responded Democratic strategist Max Burns.

""Susan Collins can go f*** herself,"" read one angry tweet with more than 10k likes.

""I heard the Capitol Police had to assist Susan Collins today because her uterus was desperately trying to get the f*** away from her,"" read another angry tweet.

""When Madeline Albright said ‘there is a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women’ - she was talking about Susan Collins,"" said another critic.

""Susan Collins is a despicable spineless shell of a former human hollowed out with a fascist slingblade and stuffed with the putrid malignant cells of dead racist nazi misogynistic concerned moralistic f***burgers drinking the runoff of nuclear waste cocktails,"" read another tweet with 800 likes.



Officials of the Biden administration are panicking about their inability to stop the Supreme Court from reversing the Roe v. Wade decision according to a report from the Washington Post Thursday.

In response to the passions arising because of the leaked decisions, officials have elected to set up a security fence around the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.

Susan Collins calls cops after pro-abortion rights message left outside her house,"Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) contacted police over the weekend after someone left a pro-abortion-rights message on the sidewalk in front of her home in Bangor, Maine, on Saturday night.

The message, written in chalk, said, ""Susie, please, Mainers want WHPA --> vote yes, clean up your mess,"" the Bangor Daily News reported.



WHPA refers to the Women's Health Protection Act, a bill introduced in Congress that would codify the right to abortion into federal law and ban state restrictions on abortion. The legislation has passed in the U.S. House, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has promised to soon bring it to the floor of the Senate.

Bangor police responded to a call to Collins' home in the West Broadway neighborhood of Bangor at 9:20 p.m. Saturday to investigate the chalk message, Bangor police spokesperson Wade Betters said.

""The message was not overtly threatening,” he said.

By Monday afternoon the message was gone, BDN reported.

Collins thanked the police department for its quick response in a statement.

“We are grateful to the Bangor police officers and the City public works employee who responded to the defacement of public property in front of our home,” Collins said.

Furious pro-abortion rights protesters have targeted Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices, GOP lawmakers, and even Christian church services after a leaked Supreme Court draft majority opinion last week indicated the court has voted to overturn the landmark abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade. While the court's decision is neither official nor final, were it to overrule Roe, there are 26 states with trigger laws that immediately put bans or severe restrictions on abortion into effect.

Democrats have called for Congress to codify Roe's abortion rights to prevent those trigger laws from taking effect.

Collins, a moderate Republican, is one of only two pro-choice Republican senators, along with Sen. Lisa Murkowski. She has previously voted against the WHPA, claiming the Democratic-backed bill to codify Roe goes too far and does not have adequate exemptions for Catholic hospitals that refuse to perform abortions for faith-based reasons.

Together with Murkowski, Collins has introduced an amendment to the WHPA that would prohibit states from imposing an ""undue burden"" on the ability of a woman to seek an abortion before her unborn child is viable outside the womb. The Collins-Murkowski amendment would also permit states to enact health or safety regulations on abortion procedures, so long as those regulations do not present a ""substantial obstacle"" to a woman seeking an abortion.

Collins has consistently said she would not vote to eliminate the 60-vote requirement to break a filibuster in order to pass legislation that would codify abortion rights.

"Attempted murder suspect freed from jail after allegedly plowing through 25 LA sheriff's recruits and leaving behind 'bodies everywhere, bones sticking out and bleeding'","The driver accused of plowing through a large group of 75 law enforcement recruits in Los Angeles County on Wednesday has been named, charged, and released. Investigators now believe the incident to have been intentional.

Building an 'ironclad, iron proof' case

In a statement on Nov. 17, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department indicated that 22-year-old Nicholas Joseph Gutierrez was charged with attempted murder on peace officers and that additional charges were pending.

CNN reported that while investigators have strong suspicions that the suspect meant to inflict harm on the recruits, they first need to shore up those suspicions with substantial evidence.

Since the department is usually required to present a case to the district attorney within 48 hours of a suspect's arrest, they provisionally cut Gutierrez loose after his initial arrest. According to the Los Angeles Times, Gutierrez's original arrest was deemed a detention.

LASD Deputy Deanna Mares told CNN: ""It's not like they arrested the wrong suspect. ... They just want to make sure the investigation is going to be complete.""

Sgt. Gerardo Magos similarly suggested that there was ample evidence but that law enforcement just wanted ""to make sure it's properly presented.""

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva suggested that part of the reason investigators are taking more time is that they don't trust the leftist district attorney to do his job.

The sheriff told NewsNation, ""We operate under prosecutor George Gascón. We definitely have grave concerns about his ability to prosecute. We are actually going to provisionally release him (Gutierrez) until we can have the case ironclad, iron-proof, and submitted to the DA for filing consideration. Right now, we want to tie up all the loose ends on the case and then present it to the DA.""

Gutierrez is reportedly due in court on Friday.

A 'deliberate act'

Gutierrez allegedly drove 30 to 40 mph the wrong way up a street near the sheriff's STARS Center Academy in Whittier, California, where 75 sheriff's deputy recruits were jogging. The suspect is said to have mowed down 25 recruits, some of whom reportedly lost limbs.



Twenty of the victims are with the LASD; two are with the Glendale PD; two are with the Bell PD; and one is with the Pasadena PD.

The Independent reported that were it not for a light pole, even more people could have been injured.

Captain Pat MacDonald said, ""Thank God for that light pole, because the vehicle ultimately hit it and stopped, as opposed to possibly hitting more recruits.""

Five recruits were left in critical condition. According to the Los Angeles Times, over a dozen others suffered ""life-altering"" injuries of varying severity.

Villanueva described the aftermath to NewsNation: ""It was a bedlam, chaos, you know, there were bodies everywhere, bones sticking out and bleeding profusely. It was a pretty traumatic scene.""

""In fact, the paramedics that were there had never seen something of that scale. It was almost like an airplane accident, but everyone was alive, thankfully,"" added Villanueva.

As of Thursday night, seven recruits were reportedly still in the hospital, two of whom remained in critical condition.

The LASD noted that homicide investigators would present the case to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office on Friday for filing considerations.

Villanueva believes the vehicular attack to have been a ""deliberate act.""

In one video of the incident caught on a nearby security camera, it appears as though the suspect oriented his vehicle toward the victims:

The sheriff said on Wednesday that there were no skid marks at the scene, suggestive of a failure or a refusal to apply the brakes when driving toward the recruits. After allegedly mowing down the prospective deputies, Gutierrez allegedly remained in the Honda CR-V with his foot still on the accelerator.

A field sobriety test indicated that Gutierrez was not drunk on the morning of the brutal incident.

"Disturbing video shows suspects punch, spit on NYC cops in reaction to arrest on Harlem street: 'Oh, she spit in his face!'","Cellphone video captured people punching and spitting on New York City police officers as they attempted to make an arrest Tuesday evening on an East Harlem street, the New York Post reported.

What are the details?

Felicia Davis, 32, was playing loud music on Madison Avenue near East 105th Street in Manhattan just before 6 p.m. when officers told her to stop, the Post reported, citing cops and police sources.



With that, Davis ran away but left her speakers behind, police told the paper.

When she returned a short time later and refused to provide identification to police, officers tried to take her into custody, authorities added to the Post:

A brawl then erupted as another woman and a man physically attacked the officers, police told the paper.

As police held on to Davis, another woman was seen in the video trying to pull police off her — and even apparently spitting on one of the officers:

One person who seems to be observing the fight can be heard remarking, ""Oh, she spit in his face!""

The officer can be seen recoiling from the apparent spitting and then quickly wiping his face with his hand.

The woman who apparently spit on the officer is soon seen punching another officer:

Tenured professor files a lawsuit against Southern Utah University alleging a violation of his free speech rights by requiring him to use nonbinary student's preferred pronouns,"A tenured professor at Southern Utah University filed a lawsuit against university leaders on Tuesday after they demanded that he use ""they/them"" pronouns when referring to a nonbinary student in his class. The professor accused SUU leaders of violating his free speech rights, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.



The public university theater professor, Richard Bugg, filed the complaint against SUU's president, the dean of the Department of Theatre, Dance and Arts Administration, and others. The nonbinary student was not named in the case.

According to the lawsuit, the student requested on the first day of class that Bugg use the student's preferred ""they/them"" pronouns. The professor said he tried not to address the student using ""she/her"" pronouns, but that he ""unintentionally did so two or three times.""

Bugg stated that instead of using plural gender-neutral pronouns, he would be willing to use any ""singular pronouns or proper name"" the student desired.

The lawsuit stated, ""Asking people to use plural pronouns to refer to individuals is one thing. Forcing them to do it is another and contrary to our rights of free speech.""

Six days into the fall semester, the student filed a complaint against Bugg with SUU's Title IX Office. Another student stepped forward and filed a second complaint against the teacher for refusing to address the nonbinary student with the student's preferred pronouns.

The complaints caused SUU to launch an investigation into Bugg five days later.

In the meantime, the nonbinary student encouraged others attending Bugg's class to boycott the course. The student requested that the school offer students a substitute ""shadow class.""

As a result of the investigation, university leaders concluded in January 2022 that Bugg had allegedly violated school policy by discriminating and harassing a student based on gender identity.

Three months later, the university accused the professor of sexual harassment for refusing to use the nonbinary student's preferred pronouns. University officials considered it ""conduct based on sex"" that was ""objectively offensive"" and violated the student's access to equal education, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Kevin Price, the university's assistant vice president of human resources, issued sanctions against Bugg. The professor was ordered to attend a course on gender-neutral language.

Price ruled that if Bugg continued to refuse to use ""they/them"" to refer to the student, additional sanctions would be implemented, including his termination. The university also stated that his pay would be reduced if the school had to open additional courses to teach students who refused to sign up for his classes.

The complaint requested that the university release statements saying that Bugg did not violate school policy or Title IX by refusing to use a student's preferred pronouns.

Atlanta man arrested for spray-painting swastika on LGBTQ rainbow crosswalk,"A SWAT team was sent to arrest a Georgia man who spray-painted swastikas on an LGBTQ rainbow crosswalk in Atlanta.

On Wednesday, the Atlanta Police LGBTQ Liaison Unit was first alerted about a ""symbol that appeared to be a swastika spray-painted"" at the intersection of 10th Street and Piedmont Avenue, according to Fox News.



The Atlanta Department of Transportation immediately scrubbed the hate symbol from the crosswalk. However, another swastika was spray-painted on the same LGBTQ rainbow crosswalk.

An unnamed man was caught on surveillance video and a dash camera spray-painting swastikas on a crosswalk branded with LGBTQ rainbows in midtown Atlanta.

Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum previously said, ""This is an unacceptable act in this city, anywhere in this city or in any form where citizens are targeted by hate. This department is aggressively looking now for the individual who did this.""

The Atlanta Police Department asked the public to help identify the suspect.

Investigators identified the suspect and went to his apartment around 12 p.m. on Friday. The suspect refused to respond to police officers.

""When the suspect wouldn’t come out, Atlanta police SWAT teams were requested to come to the scene and continued to try to make attempts to contact the suspect,"" WSB-TV reported. ""Roads in the area were blocked off as officers worked to get the man out safely.""



Around 5 p.m., the suspect was arrested and taken into custody without incident, according to Atlanta Police Department spokesperson TaSheena Brown.

Authorities did not reveal the identity of the suspect. It was unclear what charges he faces.

""When you have a swastika, when you have homophobic graffiti, of course it’s a hate crime,"" Schierbaum said. ""The motivation is to intimidate. The motivation is to spread hate, and this city doesn’t have any room for hate, and this police department doesn’t tolerate hate.""

A spokesman for Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens’ office thanked the city's employees ""for erasing the hate that has no place in our city in such a swift and efficient manner.""

The LGBTQ rainbow crosswalk was painted for the 2015 Pride festival.

The city of Atlanta made the LGBTQ rainbow crosswalk permanent as a memorial to the 49 victims of the deadly 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting.

The rainbow crosswalk represents ""symbols of acceptance, unity and tolerance representing the diversity of the LGBTQ+ community and its allies,"" according to the organization that called for the creation of the painted street.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/suu-professor-sues-university-pronouns,2022-08-21
Leftists blast Tampa Bay Rays' players who refuse to wear LBGTQ rainbow Pride colors because of religious beliefs: 'Absolute bulls**t',"Leftists on social media are blasting baseball players from the Tampa Bay Rays who cited religious reasons for refusing to wear rainbow colors on their uniforms for the team's LBGTQ Pride Night game Saturday against the visiting Chicago White Sox.

At least five players didn't wear the colors and instead peeled off the rainbow burst logo on their jersey sleeves and wore the team's standard cap instead of the Pride cap with a rainbow-colored “TB” on the front, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

What are the details?

“Our Pride Nights continue to grow both in terms of visibility and participation,” Rays' president Matt Silverman said, according to the Times. “By doing this, we extend an invitation not just for this game but for all of our games that the LGBTQ+ community is invited, welcomed, and celebrated.”

To that end, the franchise decided to make their LBGTQ support more visible by following the lead of the San Francisco Giants and adding rainbow-colored logos to their Pride Night uniforms, the paper said.

But not all the Rays' players wanted to participate, and the team allowed them that choice, the Times said. Among the players who didn't wear the rainbow colors were pitchers Jason Adam, Jalen Beeks, Brooks Raley, Jeffrey Springs, and Ryan Thompson, the paper added.

Team officials chose Adam to speak for the group who refused the rainbow colors, and he told the Times the decision was based on religious beliefs.

“A lot of it comes down to faith, to like a faith-based decision,” Adam said, according to the paper. “So it’s a hard decision. Because ultimately we all said what we want is them to know that all are welcome and loved here. But when we put it on our bodies, I think a lot of guys decided that it’s just a lifestyle that maybe — not that they look down on anybody or think differently — it’s just that maybe we don’t want to encourage it if we believe in Jesus, who’s encouraged us to live a lifestyle that would abstain from that behavior, just like [Jesus] encourages me as a heterosexual male to abstain from sex outside of the confines of marriage. It’s no different. It’s not judgmental. It’s not looking down. It’s just what we believe the lifestyle he’s encouraged us to live, for our good, not to withhold. But again, we love these men and women, we care about them, and we want them to feel safe and welcome here.”

WFLA-TV quoted Thompson as saying “those of us who decided not to wear the patch or hat spent a couple weeks in prayer and a deep dive into Scripture on the subject at hand to come to the decision that we did.”

The station said Thompson added, “if I believe the Bible is infallible and that everlasting life is attainable, yet I bow down to public opinion in the name of tolerance, is that love? I don’t think so.”

Thompson also told WFLA that the Rays as a franchise are “completely unified” in both love for the LGBTQ community and respect for each other’s opinions, views, and values.



But veteran outfielder Kevin Kiermaier did wear the rainbow cap and logo and told the Times that ""my parents taught me to love everyone as they are, go live your life, whatever your preferences are, go be you. I can’t speak for everyone who’s in here, obviously, but this is a family-friendly environment here at a big-league ball field. … We just want everyone to feel welcomed and included and cheer us on. No matter what your views on anything are.”

The paper said that during Saturday's Pride Night, the Rays included members of the LGBTQ community in pregame events, gave mini Pride flags to attendees, and made a $20,000 donation to Metro Inclusive Health, which provides diverse health and wellness services to the community.

The left-wing hammer comes down

LBGTQ sportswriter Cyd Zeigler posted tweets ripping Rays' players who chose to not wear the rainbow-colored logos.

In one Zeigler wrote, ""Will someone please show me the Bible passage that says 'Thou shalt not wear a rainbow on thou's clothing'..."" He also said ""players don't get to just choose what uniform they wear. That's the point of the word 'uniform.' Welcome to sports.""

"Teacher fired for assignment on Joe Rogan interview with doctor who pushed back on COVID vaccine, Dr. Robert Malone says","On Friday, Dr. Robert Malone, a scientist skeptical of mRNA vaccines, reported that a New York teacher was terminated from her position for assigning her students an extra credit assignment that involved listening to Malone's interview on Joe Rogan's podcast.



""Crazy times. . . . A teacher in NY was fired for having students listen to my interview with Rogan in an extra credit assignment. Commissioner of education demanded reinstatement with back pay, and evidently the district refuses to follow the order,"" Malone wrote.

Along with his Twitter post, Malone shared a link to the appeal from the New York State Education Department's website.

According to the appeal, students in Adrianne Rickson's high school criminal justice class were given the option to complete an extra credit assignment that involved listening to a ""podcast"" with Malone and then answering a series of questions.

Malone received backlash from the public in 2021 and 2022 when he challenged the government's narrative on COVID and mRNA vaccines.

One of the questions from the assignment included, ""Why was he banned from Twitter?""

Malone was booted from Twitter in December 2021 and recently reinstated by Elon Musk last month.

Another question asked students, ""Do you think our Constitutional rights are being upheld or violated[?] [E]xplain[.]” And, ""How did Sweden respond to COVID? What were the results?""

The respondent argued that Rickson's assignment ""had no valid curricular purpose"" and claimed that it was a ""misuse"" of her position. The respondent further contended that the assignment included ""leading questions … designed to push students into believing ... misinformation.""

Rickson claimed that the intent of the assignment was to encourage her students ""to think critically.""

The teacher's appeal noted that over 200 people, including students, signed a petition in her support.

One student stated, ""Mrs. Rickson was the most amazing teacher I had … she motivated me and helped me be a better version of myself and … totally turned my life around.""

Another said, ""Mrs. Rickson is a motivational educator in a field that is in need of caring, competent individuals like her. She inspires her students to do their best … She is an asset and BOCES is lucky to have her as a teacher there.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tampa-bay-rays-players-lgbtq,2023-01-03
Teacher says he was 'blacklisted' after being fired for refusing to use a transgender student's preferred pronouns: 'We're basically going more and more toward a totalitarian system',"A Virginia teacher who was fired for refusing to use a transgender student's preferred pronouns told Fox News Digital on Friday that he has since been ""blacklisted"" from securing another teaching job in the state.



What's the background?

Peter Vlaming was a high school French teacher at a public school in Virginia's West Point school district when he was terminated from his position for refraining from using pronouns that contradicted a student's biological sex. He argued that doing so would violate his religious beliefs.

Vlaming agreed to call the student by a preferred name and even encouraged all his students to choose a new French name for the class so the student would not feel singled out. However, the school did not think that was enough.

The West Point School Board unanimously voted to terminate Vlaming from his position in 2018. The teacher stated that since then, he has been unable to get another teaching job in the state.

""Sometimes it costs something to speak the truth, to not lie. Sometimes it costs something to do what is right,"" said Vlaming. ""We've come to a point where your job may be in the balance, but if people don't take a stand, then we're basically going more and more toward a totalitarian system where things that have nothing to do with the curriculum [that is] being required.""

Vlaming's pending lawsuit

On Friday morning, the Supreme Court of Virginia heard oral arguments in Vlaming's case that will determine whether teachers could be required to speak in a way that contradicts their own deeply held personal beliefs.

Vlaming's legal counsel, Caleb Dalton with Alliance Defending Freedom, told Fox News Digital that the court is addressing ""whether or not public schools will be allowed to fire teachers simply because they can't express and personally endorse an ideological belief.""

Dalton stated that the lawsuit was initially filed with the Virginia Circuit Court, but the case was dismissed.

""No government should be able to force an employee on pain of firing to lie and to violate their conscience,"" Dalton said. ""We're thankful that the Virginia Constitution protects his rights, and we're hopeful the Virginia Supreme Court affirms those.""

Vlaming noted that teachers all over the nation have reached out to him since the case became public.

""Teachers are being required to parrot beliefs that are – I would say, false on their face – but that many teachers don't hold,"" said Vlaming.

Dalton noted that Vlaming respects the right of the students and parents to have their own beliefs about gender ideology.

""All he's asking for is not to be compelled to say that he believes the same thing,"" he added.

The Commonwealth of Virginia filed an amicus brief in support of Vlaming, which urged the court to ""hold that Virginia's Constitution and Code forbid the government from forcing its citizens to express personal agreement with messages contrary to their deeply held religious beliefs.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teacher-fired-for-assignment-on-joe-rogan-interview-with-doctor-who-pushed-back-on-covid-vaccine-dr-robert-malone-says,2022-11-04
Teachers' union refuses to defend teacher threatened by school because he criticized CRT-like training,"A local chapter of a prominent national teachers' union has, without explanation, dismissed a grievance filed by a teacher who claimed he was targeted by his school after he criticized a woke training session.

According to the Washington Free Beacon, John Grande, a gym teacher for Hartford Public Schools in Hartford, Connecticut, who has taught for 30 years, claimed that his school threatened to fire him or force him to attend further ""sensitivity"" training after he criticized a mandatory ""privilege"" training.

Grande said that he filed a formal complaint against the district back in July but that American Federation of Teachers Local 1018 dismissed it without explanation.

""Our employee handbook explicitly states that no employee of the Hartford public school system will be disciplined for exercising their right to free speech,"" Grande told the Free Beacon. ""When asked for my reaction to the training, I expressed my disagreement and was punished for doing so.""

Images captured at the training and obtained by the Free Beacon show that teachers were forced to reflect upon the privileges they supposedly enjoy because of their race and sexual orientation, assumptions often made in critical race and gender theory.

""I can choose blemish cover or bandages in 'flesh' color and have them more or less match my skin"" and ""I can go home from meetings, classes, and conversations without feeling excluded, fearful, attacked, isolated, outnumbered, unheard, held at a distance, stereotyped or feared because of my sexual orientation"" are just two example statements that trainees were supposedly required to consider.

Grande said that he expressed his frustration about the training both in his feedback and in conversation with two of his colleagues, who then reported his criticisms to the district.

While Grande filed the complaint shortly after his school threatened to fire him, he had no means of forcing the district to address it since AFT 1018 has the exclusive power to arbitrate grievances with the district, and it has the power to determine which cases it will take.

""Officials are refusing to represent him simply because he isn't a member,"" said Nathan McGrath, president of the Fairness Center. ""John is just asking the union to do its job so he can continue doing his.""

Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect changes in reporting from the source material. The original article stated that John Grande paid some union dues for contract negotiations, even though he is not a member of the union. However, Grande does not pay union dues. Only full union members pay dues.

Ted Cruz checkmates top DOJ official for not enforcing federal law against pro-abortion protesters outside SCOTUS justices' houses,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) confronted an assistant attorney general on Wednesday over the Justice Department's refusal to prosecute protesters who demonstrated outside the homes of Supreme Court justices.

What is the background?

After Politico published a leaked opinion draft in early May showing the Supreme Court was planning to vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, pro-abortion activists began protesting outside the homes of the court's conservative-leaning justices.

While protesting government officials is generally lawful activity protected by the First Amendment, one federal law appeared to outlaw exactly what the protesters were doing.

Federal law 18 U.S.C. §1507 states:

Whoever, with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty, pickets or parades in or near a building housing a court of the United States, or in or near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge, juror, witness, or court officer, or with such intent uses any sound-truck or similar device or resorts to any other demonstration in or near any such building or residence, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

However, Attorney General Merrick Garland never enforced the statute, despite a barrage of pressure from lawmakers.

What happened with Cruz?

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Cruz grilled Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite Jr. over the Justice Department's inaction in prosecuting protesters under 18 U.S.C. §1507.

""Night after night after night protesters committed federal crimes on national television. Why has the Department of Justice refused to enforce 18 U.S.C. §1507?"" Cruz asked.

According to Polite, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland has, in fact, prosecuted an individual for ""unlawful conduct"" outside one Supreme Court justice's home.

""So one person?"" Cruz promptly followed up.

""To date, there has been one prosecution,"" Polite clarified.

""What about the hundreds of others, all of whom have violated the law on the face of it?"" Cruz shot back. ""It's not complicated. The law is very clear. Why does the DOJ pick and choose which criminal laws to enforce, and why does it seem to exactly follow the pattern of partisan preferences of the Biden White House?""

In response, Polite said the Justice Department has increased the resources for U.S. Marshals to better protect the Supreme Court justices, but said he disagrees with Cruz's charge that the DOJ is not enforcing 18 U.S.C. §1507.

""Final question: Was the one prosecution you referenced a [18 U.S.C. §1507] prosecution or was it something else?"" Cruz then asked.

""I don't believe it was under that statute,"" Polite admitted.

""So you haven't brought a single one?"" Cruz followed up.

When Polite responded by not answering Cruz's question directly, Cruz ended his questioning, saying, ""I think you need to follow the law.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/teachers-union-refuses-to-defend-dues-paying-teacher-threatened-by-school-because-he-criticized-crt-like-training,2022-08-03
Ted Cruz responds to false claims he supports defunding the FBI: 'Leftie Twitter is gonna lie',"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation needs a ""complete housecleaning"" and that the IRS should be defunded in comments captured on video by an undercover left-wing activist.

Lauren Windsor, a political activist and founder of the web-based show ""The Undercurrent,"" posed as a conservative and spoke to Cruz at rally in Atlanta hosted by Truth and Courage PAC on Saturday. Cruz attended the rally to support Herschel Walker, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia who is facing incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) in the November election.

Windsor secretly recorded their conversation and posted the video to Twitter, claiming that Cruz agreed to ""defunding the FBI."" But it is clear from the video that Cruz said no such thing.







Windsor began their interaction by thanking Cruz for ""all you're doing to fight for Herschel Walker and to take back the Senate. And I just think it's so important that, like, you guys are actually going to defund all those IRS agents."" Cruz did agree with that statement, responding, ""Absolutely."" He has previously called for the IRS to be abolished.

She continued, ""I think it's imperative that you really have to defund the FBI after all the witch hunts that are going on."" But Cruz started to shake his head side to side.

""It is horrific, the abuse of power at the FBI, and its wrong. And there needs to be a complete housecleaning that happens at the FBI,"" Cruz told Windsor. She followed up, asking, ""Are y'all gonna be able to do that when you retake the Senate?"" And Cruz said, ""I think we need to fight to do that and we need to fight to have real oversight.""

Cruz never agreed with the idea of defunding the FBI or said anything about defunding the bureau.

Steve Guest, a special advisor for Cruz's communications team, accused Windsor of ""brazen dishonesty"" for her framing of Cruz's remarks.

Cruz responded himself after several people shared Windsor's videos and accused him of being anti-law enforcement.

""Leftie twitter is gonna lie — it's what they do — but every word I said is true,"" Cruz tweeted Tuesday afternoon.

The senator's call for a ""housecleaning"" at the FBI is consistent with his criticisms of the FBI execution of a search warrant at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home on Aug. 8. The FBI has accused Trump of illegally taking classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago and refusing to turn those documents over to the National Archives.

Cruz called the FBI raid on Trump's home ""unprecedented"" and echoed the former president's accusations that the Biden administration had ""weaponized"" the Justice Department against its political opponents.

""Congress must demand answers. We need hearings; we need subpoenas. Dems in charge will refuse, but the American people deserve to know why Biden is using the FBI as his political enforcers. Tin-pot dictators do that, but that's not how America works,"" Cruz tweeted on Aug. 8.

Ted Cruz compares protests outside Justice Samuel Alito's home to Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said that the protests outside Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's home were just as bad as the riot that took place on Jan. 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol.



Protests have unfolded outside conservative justices' private homes following the leak of a draft opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade.

What are the details?

Cruz made the remarks during a Monday night discussion with Fox News' Sean Hannity.

The Texas lawmaker said that the media were also engaging in what amounted to blatant hypocrisy by refusing to express outrage over the pro-choice protests taking place outside the conservative-leaning justices' homes.

""It's complete hypocrisy, you see this in the corporate media, you see this among Democrats,"" Cruz said. ""On January 6 of 2021, you had tens of thousands of people peacefully protesting, and yet the corporate media and Democrats slander them with the made-up term 'insurrectionist,'"" Cruz told Hannity. ""And yet in this instance, they are not willing to call off their goons even now, even now, as this has the potential to escalate and escalate further.""

Cruz added that the protests are ""the latest manifestation of just how extreme"" and ""just how radical"" the Democratic Party has become.

He added, ""Today's Democratic Party believes in violence, they believe in mob rule, they believe in intimidation, just like Marxists and communists, they're willing to burn our institutions to the ground to get what they want. ... Once again, they're putting politics above everything else, including people's lives. And these radicals are inviting violence directed at our judiciary, and directed at the rule of law.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday said that the Biden administration supported the demonstrators' right to protest, but noted that any ""violence, threats, and intimidation"" had ""no place in political discourse.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-responds-to-defund-fbi-claims,2022-05-10
Tennis star Camila Giorgi among high-profile Italians accused of faking vaccine papers,"A doctor was arrested last year in northeastern Italy for allegedly doling out fake COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination certificates. Italian pro-tennis star and lingerie model Camila Giorgi, 31, is now under investigation on suspicion of being one of the doctor's high-profile clients.

If physician Daniela Grillon's admissions to investigators are true, then Giorgi competed in several international tennis competitions under the false pretense that she was was vaccinated.

What are the details?

Daniela Grillon was arrested in Vincenza in February 2022 and charged with doling out fake serums and vaccination records, reported Tennis365.



Grillon claims to have faked vaccinations for hundreds of people, including the popular Italian musician Francesca Calearo, who goes by ""Madame,"" and the Giorgi family.

The doctor said that she could ""confirm with [absolute] certainty that none of the vaccines against the Giorgi family have actually been administered.""



""The Giorgi family has been under treatment with me for a long time. Camila Giorgi suffered from the so-called 'tennis elbow,'"" Grillon told Corriere del Veneto. ""Shortly before the beginning of summer, she had come asking for the possibility of obtaining false proof of all the mandatory vaccines, as well as the COVID vaccine.""

Giorgi, who has over 400 wins on tour under her belt plus three singles titles, played in the Australian Open in 2022, which required athletes to produce vaccine certificates. She reached the third round, losing to Ash Barty, rated number one in the world.



Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic was precluded defending his title at the same competition, having been deported from Australia over his refusal to get a COVID-19 vaccine.



The BBC indicated that Djokovic was initially granted a medical exemption to enter Australia, having been naturally infected with the virus in December 2021. Despite his potential natural immunity, the country's border force detained him and had his visa revoked.

Extra to the Australian Open, which will now allow athletes to compete even if they test positive for COVID-19, Giorgi competed at several competitions, including the Grand Slam in Australia, the National Bank Open in Canada, and the US Open.

Both the U.S. and Canada required that travelers be vaccinated to enter the country at the time of Giorgi's entry.

While Giorgi is set to compete in the Australian Open on Jan. 16, proof that she provided false documents could get her ejected from the country.



The Women's Tennis Association is monitoring the situation and following the investigation by Italian police, reported Fox Sports.

Others, athletes included, have previously attempted to avoid being vaccinated.

In December 2021, former Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Antonio Brown and two other NFL players received suspensions for flouting pandemic protocols. Brown allegedly used a fake vaccination card.

In the same month, an Italian man tried to get a real vaccination certificate with a fake arm.

CNN reported that a 50-year-old in northern Italy tried to pass a silicone arm off as his own at a vaccination clinic. While the veteran nurse administering the shot jabbed the fake arm, she quickly realized her mistake and castigated her patient.

Chloe Mrozak of Illinois attempted to travel to Hawaii in August 2021 with a fake vaccine card, but raised eyebrows with a typo on the document. Moderna was spelled ""Maderna.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ted-cruz-scotus-protest-insurrection,2023-01-09
'Shameless and pathetic': Texas Democrat used doctored photo of Republican candidate Rep. Mayra Flores in anti-gun ad,"Democrat Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D) has been trying ardently to paint his opponent, Rep. Mayra Flores, in a negative light in hopes of securing Texas' 34th Congressional District in the midterm election. In his most recent reelection ad campaign, Gonzalez went so far as to transmogrify an image of Flores, providing her with an uncanny and aggressive expression that might unsettle some voters.

The doctored image first appears at the ten-second mark in the attack ad, posted to Gonzalez's campaign account on October 10.

While the original image depicted Flores smiling, holding a firearm, and adhering to good trigger discipline, the doctored image has been warped such that she has made to appear grimacing, with eyebrows downcast and elongated.

At the time of the ad's release, Gonzalez offered no indication that the image had been edited.

After invoking the Uvalde school shooting, the ad juxtaposed the image with Flores' voting record on the so-called ""Bipartisan Safer Communities Act"" and then with a dynamic image of children in a classroom. Flores, who is reputedly ""Pro-Life, Pro-Second Amendment, and Pro-Law Enforcement,"" did not support the bill, which enacts red-flag laws.

Although Gonzalez supports incentives for illegal aliens, including DACA and amnesty, and has opposed deporting criminal noncitizens, his ad castigated Flores for voting against keeping guns out of the hands of criminal elements from Mexico.

The ad concludes by calling Flores ""disgraceful"" and claiming that ""she does not represent South Texas values.""

Rachel Campos-Duffy of ""Fox & Friends"" suggested that ""Democrats fear conservative Latinas so much"" that they ""do things like this.""

Michael McAdams, communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, tweeted, ""More sexist behavior from scumbag @RepGonzalez. Dem candidate in key House race uses doctored photo to make female opponent look aggressive in campaign ad.""

Flores responded on Twitter, recalling how ""Vincente Gonzalez hired a racist blogger to attack me for my heritage"" and indicating that her opponent is now ""doing the dirty work himself with this shameless and pathetic photoshopping.""

The ""racist blogger"" to whom Flores was referring was Jerry McHale. The Texas Tribune reported that McHale was paid thousands of dollars by the Gonzalez campaign for ""advertising services.""

McHale called Flores, the first woman born in Mexico to be elected to the U.S. Congress, ""Miss Frijoles"" and ""Miss Enchiladas."" He also called her a ""cotton pickin' liar.""

With the Gonzalez campaign's financial backing, McHale wrote on May 13: ""DOES FLORES WANT TRUMP TO COME & TAKE HER P**SY??""

In response to McHale's comments, Flores stated, ""I am disgusted that Vincente Gonzalez has hired a creepy blogger to attack my Mexican heritage and sexually degrade me, but I won't let this distract me from my work. ... I came to Congress to represent my community's values: God, Family and Country. Vincente Gonzalez is an example of everything that's wrong with Washington.""

Extra to hiring McHale to go after Flores, Gonzalez also took to election denial. Last month, he claimed, ""They stole that last election,"" in reference to the June special election in which Flores defeated Democrat Dan Sanchez for an open congressional seat. Democrat President Joe Biden claimed last month that anyone who ""refuses to acknowledge an election ... is a threat to democracy.""

The Gonzalez campaign may have utilized visual disinformation to advance its interests, but it is not the first to do so in recent history.

Last year, CNN was accused of altering footage of Joe Rogan to make him ""look sickly.""

Rogan had uploaded a video to Instagram indicating he was using ""monoclonal antibodies, ivermectin, Z-Pak, prednisone, everything"" to combat COVID-19, which he had recently contracted. There was some question about whether the apparent drop in saturation and increase in yellow in CNN's version was the result of technical issues, while others indicated it was intentional and correlated with the network's desire to discredit Rogan.

"Gunman breaks into Texas home after midnight, so homeowner grabs his own gun and shoots intruder multiple times, killing him","A gunman broke into an east Texas home in the middle of the night over the weekend, but the homeowner was a little smarter and a little faster than the intruder, grabbing his own gun and killing the unwelcome guest with multiple shots.

What are the details?

Erik J. Hicks, 51, of Grand Saline, “unlawfully forced entry” into the Canton home around 12:30 a.m. Saturday, the Tyler Morning Telegraph reported, citing the Canton Police Department.

Hicks was armed with a handgun, KLTV-TV reported, citing a joint investigation by police and the Texas Rangers.

When the homeowner heard Hicks break in, he got his own handgun, police told the Morning Telegraph.

Police said after Hicks entered the residence, he made his way into the living area and confronted the homeowner, after which the homeowner shot him multiple times, the paper said.

Responding officers found the wounded suspect, who was taken to a local hospital and died a short time later, police added to the Morning Telegraph.

The homeowner has not been charged, the paper said, but the case will be referred to the Van Zandt County Grand Jury for review after the investigation concludes.

Hicks’ body was taken to the Southwestern Institute of Forensic Sciences in Dallas for an autopsy, the Morning Telegraph added.

"Texas judge rules that all adults, including 18-year-olds, have the right to open-carry a handgun","A Texas judge has struck down a recent state law that prohibits adult civilians between the ages of 18 and 20 from carrying a handgun, claiming that such a law is unconstitutional.

On Thursday, district court Judge Mark Pittman ruled that the law violated the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states that ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

Pittman also examined history and determined that prohibiting adults, though young, from carrying handguns openly had no historical precedent.

""The undisputed historical evidence establishes that 18-to-20-year-olds were understood to be a part of the militia in the Founding Era,"" Pittman wrote in the opinion.

The lawsuit against the state ban was first filed last November by two unnamed adults between the ages of 18 and 20, as well as the Firearms Policy Coalition, a self-described ""next generation"" gun-rights advocacy group that engages in ""litigation, research, scholarly publications, amicus briefing, legislative and regulatory action, grassroots activism, education, outreach, and other programs"" to achieve its aims.

This decision in Texas is believed to be the first major Second Amendment judicial ruling since the Supreme Court of the United States struck down stringent gun restriction laws in New York state in June. In his opinion on behalf of the 6-3 majority, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, ""We know of no other constitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need,"" thus gesturing to a broad understanding of the Second Amendment.

Pittman repeatedly cited the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen SCOTUS decision in his ruling to end the ban on open carry of handguns for adults 18 to 20.

That case marks the second time in less than a year that a ruling from Pittman has made national headlines. Back in November, Pittman determined that United Airlines had not violated the religious or civil rights of its employees by placing on unpaid leave those employees who refused to comply with the vaccine mandate. Some employees in the Dallas/Fort Worth area had sued the airline, claiming that the monetary loss from the unpaid leave caused them ""imminent, irreparable harm."" Pittman disagreed.

""United exempted plaintiffs from the mandate; plaintiffs are not required to violate their religious beliefs,” Pittman said in the opinion. “United’s employees claimed they faced an impossible choice: get the vaccine or endure unpaid leave. But they have chosen the latter. Their dispute thus centers on United’s response to their choice.""

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has since overturned that decision.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-homeowner-shoots-intruder-dead,2022-08-26
Texas lawyer found dead after allegedly firing shot at ex-girlfriend bartender just days before,"The Texas lawyer who police said pulled out a gun and fired a shot at his ex-girlfriend, who was working her bartender shift over the weekend, has been found dead, Fox News reported.

What are the details?

The Austin Police Department told Fox News Digital that officers found Gavin Rush's body around 4:25 p.m. Wednesday during a welfare check.

A police spokesperson didn't say how Rush died, the cable outlet reported — but the department noted that the ""death is not considered suspicious"" and that law enforcement will continue investigating.

What's the background?

Rush, 41, entered the Anderson Mill Pub after 11:30 a.m. Saturday to confront his ex-girlfriend as she worked her shift, KEYE-TV reported, citing an arrest affidavit.

Their three-year relationship ended about a month and a half before, KTBC-TV reported, adding that when she rejected his request to get back together, police said he sent several texts threatening to harm her and her new partner.

Police added that when she stopped answering Rush's texts — though informing him she was at work — he took a trip to the pub, KTBC said.

When she refused to talk to him, Rush pulled out a gun and pointed it at her — and a red dot from a laser sight was centered on her chest, KEYE said, citing the police affidavit.

KTBC said he fired a shot that narrowly missed her. The police affidavit indicates that one of the shots hit a bar mirror directly behind where Rush’s ex-girlfriend was standing, KEYE reported.

Two customers who knew the backstory tackled Rush and wrestled the firearm away, KTBC said, adding that he continued to shoot the gun during the struggle and tried to kill himself.

""It's hard to tell your story. In her case, it did work out that she was able to find some trusted people who did end up potentially saving her life,"" Nikhita Ved, vice president of community services at the SAFE Alliance, told KTBC.

Austin Councilmember Mackenzie Kelly posted surveillance video of the incident:

Anything else?

Rush was facing a felony charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon involving family violence, KEYE said, adding that the bond was set at $40,000, which typically means the suspect pays 10% — in this case, $4,000. Rush bonded out of jail, KTBC said. According to KEYE the bonding out happened within 48 hours.

What are the details?

Hidalgo County sheriff’s deputies and deputy constables responded to a home burglary in progress in the 5500 block of Nardo Street in rural Edinburg around 9:13 p.m., officials said. Edinburg is about 25 minutes north of McAllen near the Mexican border.

The homeowner said a man — identified as 36-year-old Carlos Garcia — had broken into the home through the garage and was trying to get into a bedroom in which the homeowner and her children had locked themselves, officials said.

The homeowner warned Garcia that police had been called — and that she had a gun, officials said.

When Garcia refused to leave and continued trying to get into the bedroom, the homeowner shot once through the door, officials said, after which Garcia fled the house.

What happened next?

Deputies searched the area with helicopter assistance and found Garcia about 100 yards away in an open field with a gunshot wound to his left arm, officials said.

Garcia was medically cleared and booked into the Hidalgo County Adult Detention Center for burglary of habitation with intent, officials said.

Jail records indicated Garcia was still behind bars Thursday morning. He's expected to be arraigned Thursday morning, KRGV-TV reported.

Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra gave kudos to the mother for her actions.

“You have the right to defend yourself in your own home against an intruder,” Guerra told the station. “I imagine she was in fear of her life…so she did what she had to do, and we support her.""

Guerra told KRGV that Garcia and the woman know each other but declined to elaborate on their relationship.

"The Atlantic gets ridiculed and ratioed for demanding 'amnesty' for COVID tyrants, claiming dehumanization 'wasn't a moral failing'","The Atlantic started the week off with an audacious demand in an article entitled, ""Let's Declare a Pandemic Amnesty."" Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University, wrote, ""We need to forgive one another for what we did and said when we were in the dark about COVID."" Oster's proposal was met with ridicule and contempt.

Judging by the overwhelmingly negative response to the article on Twitter, many are not yet ready to absolve those who for years championed and partook in oppressive and discriminatory pandemic laws and social conventions — laws and conventions that had family members die alone, persons wary about experimental vaccines lose their jobs, children isolated and academically stunted, and Americans segregated.

No consequences, thanks

In the article published Monday, Oster noted that she and her family had taken ""misguided"" precautions such as wearing bandanas as masks that ""wouldn't have done anything, anyway"" on empty hiking trails.

While largely ignoring the more severe measures taken and rules enforced in the name of public safety, Oster referenced the arbitrary closure of beaches and the unjustifiable closure of schools as two examples of ""getting it wrong.""

""We didn't know,"" Oster wrote, indicating that ignorance justified the rest.

Oster argued that in ""the face of so much uncertainty ... getting something wrong wasn't a moral failing.""

Meanwhile, she contended that some of ""the right people were right for the wrong reasons.""

Oster is keen not to treat ""pandemic choices as a scorecard on which some people racked up more points than others."" She wants to move forward.

Discussions about how some people were immediately ready to dehumanize their neighbors or castigate fellow citizens for exhibiting wariness about untested medications tend to be ""heated, unpleasant and, ultimately, unproductive"" so why, suggested Oster, have them?

Oster's solution: ""Put these fights aside and declare a pandemic amnesty.""

""We need to learn from our mistakes and then let them go. We need to forgive the attacks, too,"" Oster declared, suggesting that expecting accountability for the ""complicated choices"" some people made ""can lead to a repetitive doom loop.""

No, we insist

Oster got ratioed when she linked to her article on Twitter. The post received 2,300 likes and over 32,300 replies. Many of the replies indicated that justice must be given priority over forgiveness.

Oster had recommended forgiving but not forgetting. Fox News meteorologist Janice Dean indicated that she would do neither, writing, ""Many of us won't ever forgive or forget. Especially when it comes to the seniors who died in nursing homes after leaders flooded their residences with covid patients and never told us or protected them. They knew better. We deserve justice first.""

The rapper Nzube Olisaebuka Udezue (Zuby) wrote, ""People want justice and accountability. Nobody has properly acknowledged nor apologised for the immense pain, grief, and harm they caused to others. People who never wronged them at all. Including you. We have receipts.""

Libs of TikTok replied to Oster: ""I'll never forget what the Democrats did - how they destroyed thousands of lives by forcing school/business closures, people died alone in hospitals while nurses danced because they didn't allow visitors, thousands lost their jobs for refusing a vax, list goes on and on.""

Ukrainian-American podcaster Michael Malice noted that it is hard to forgive when those in apparent need of forgiveness have never apologized.

Turning Point USA contributor Laura Chen highlighted how the ""pandemic amnesty"" advocate had previously recommended the unvaccinated be shamed and segregated.

Others called the proposed amnesty into question, suggesting — in many cases with the aid of graphic videos depicting how people were treated for not wearing masks or being found without vaccine passports — that the offenses for which Oster demands forgiveness weren't simply a matter of not knowing ""any better.""

John Haar provided Oster with a reminder from Rasmussen Reports that some ""mistakes"" may prove too great for such swift and simple ""amnesty.""

The Rasmussen report referenced by Haar indicated that as of January 13, 2022, ""nearly half (48%) of Democratic voters th[ought] Federal and state governments should be able to fine or imprison individuals who publicly question the efficacy of the existing COVID-19 vaccines on social media, television, radio, or in online or digital publications.""

The report also revealed that ""Fifty-nine percent (59%) of Democratic voters would favor a government policy requiring that citizens remain confined to their homes at all times, except for emergencies, if they refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine."" 79% of Republicans were opposed.

Mary Harrington wrote in UnHerd that Oster's request and similar recommendations are driven by self-interest: ""Those who drove Covid policy presented themselves not just as people doing their best, but as the sole bearers of rational truth and life-saving moral authority.""

""Doubtless the laptop class would prefer that we judge Covid policy by intention,"" wrote Harrington, ""not results, lest too close an evaluation result in their fingers being prised from the baton of public righteousness.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-mom-shoots-home-invader-through-bedroom-door-as-she-hides-with-her-kids-from-culprit,2022-11-02
Major media figures claim that Josh Hawley is ‘transphobic’ because he thinks men can’t get pregnant,"Multiple prominent media figures took the side of Berkeley law professor Khiara Bridges, who accused Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) of being ""transphobic"" because he does not believe that men can get pregnant in a viral clip on Tuesday.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the impact of overturning Roe v. Wade, Bridges repeatedly used the torturous phrase ""people with a capacity for pregnancy"" as a gender-neutral substitute for ""women."" When Hawley called her out on it, highlighting the absurdity of erasing the word ""women"" from a discussion on abortion rights, Bridges told him that his ""line of questioning is transphobic.""

Bridges said Hawley was ""denying that trans people exist"" and opening them up to violence because he would not recognize ""that men can get pregnant.""

Some supposedly objective media outlets revealed which side they took in their coverage of the back-and-forth.

The Washington Post said Hawley ""refused to acknowledge that some transgender men can get pregnant,"" which is inaccurate. Hawley never said that ""transgender men"" can't get pregnant — his position is that ""transgender men"" are women, because women are the only people who can get pregnant.



Most mainstream news headlines reported that Hawley was ""called"" or ""accused"" of asking ""transphobic"" questions, framing the story more neutrally. But a CNN video used the headline, ""Hawley called out for 'transphobic' questions,"" which adopted the left's view of the exchange.

The U.K. Independent had more direct bias, writing that Bidges ""rebuked"" Hawley for his ""transphobic"" questions.

""In a series of extraordinary testimony to a Senate committee on the future of abortion in the US after the dissolve of Roe v Wade, an abortion rights advocate and law professor issued a sharp rebuke to Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who appeared to dismiss that transgender people could become pregnant,"" the Independent reported.

Meanwhile, progressive media declared unambiguous victory for Bridges over Hawley, who they insisted ""got owned.""

Salon and HuffPo each ran headlines that insisted the Missouri Republican was ""schooled."" Jezebel published a video titled, ""Berkeley Law Professor Eviscerates Sen. Josh Hawley at Post-Roe Hearing."" Heartland Signal said Hawley was ""put in place"" by Bridges.

Vox wrote that Hawley used ""transphobic rhetoric to rile up the GOP's base"" and sided with Bridges' contested claim that Hawley's language equates to violence.

""Bridges’s concerns reflect the fact that lawmakers’ political attacks on trans people — including denying their existence, and using legislation to limit their freedom of movement, access to activities, and availability of health care — have coincided with an increase in physical violence,"" Li Zhou wrote for Vox. ""According to a 2021 Time report, anti-trans violence has surged in the wake of an increase in legislation targeting trans people. A 2021 UCLA report also found that trans people, particularly Black and brown trans people, were significantly more likely to be victims of violent crime than cis people.""



Progressives on Twitter also praised Bridges and mocked Hawley.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said Hawley ""feigned shock at the recognition that he incites violence.""

""KA-BLOW"" tweeted Imani Gandy, the senior editor of law and policy for Rewire News Group, after Bridges declared Hawley was denying transgender people exist because he doesn't think men can get pregnant.

Many others ridiculed Hawley for his supposed embarrassment by a professor who thinks men can be women and women can be men, rendering the distinctions between the two sexes meaningless.



But Stephen Porter, the assistant editor for USA Today Opinion, urged progressives, ""Don't feign ignorance about Sen. Josh Hawley's 'questions.'""

""He was making a statement. His claim? That trans men & nonbinary people who can get pregnant are ~actually~ women. He's asserting that their reproductive organs define their gender,"" Porter tweeted.

""That's literally ✨transphobic✨,"" he said.

In a lengthy thread, Porter went on to say that Hawley ""derives some inhumane political benefit"" from making ""transphobic comments."" He demanded that people ""sympathetic to Hawley's message"" but who don't want to be labeled transphobic ""show us what you think it means to treat transgender people with kindness, dignity & respect.""

Responding to the hysterics Wednesday morning, Hawley told Fox News that Democrats ""have lost their minds.""



""The Democrats have become such extremists. Now their official line is men can get pregnant — and if you disagree, you’re violent,"" Hawley said. ""They have lost their minds and the whole country can see it.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-atlantic-gets-ridiculed-and-ratioed-for-demanding-amnesty-for-covid-tyrants-claiming-dehumanization-wasnt-a-moral-failing,2022-07-13
The Satanic Temple asks Boston to fly its flag following Supreme Court ruling,"The Satanic Temple in Massachusetts is asking the city of Boston to fly its flag after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that City Hall had unconstitutionally discriminated against a Christian group by refusing to fly its flag.

On Tuesday, the Satanic Temple tweeted a copy of a request the group filed to have Boston fly the flag for ""Satanic Appreciation Week"" July 23-29. The tweet indicated the request was filed in response to the Supreme Court ruling.

“Religious Liberty is a bedrock principle in a democracy, and Religious Liberty is dependent upon government viewpoint neutrality,” said Lucien Greaves, co-founder of the Satanic Temple in a statement to MassLive. ""When public officials are allowed to preference certain religious viewpoints over others, we do not have Religious Liberty, we have theocracy.”

A spokesperson from Boston Mayor Michelle Wu's office told CNN the city was ""carefully reviewing the Court's decision and its recognition of city governments' authority to operate similar programs.""

""As we consider next steps, we will ensure that future City of Boston programs are aligned with this decision,"" the mayor's office added.

Last week, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of Camp Constitution, a New Hampshire-based Christian organization that petitioned the city to hoist its flag in front of City Hall in 2017. The city refused, even though it had previously agreed to flags from a variety of private groups beforehand. The court ruled that City Hall had unconstitutionally discriminated against the Christian group based on its religious viewpoint.

""We conclude that, on balance, Boston did not make the raising and flying of private groups' flags a form of government speech,"" Justice Stephen Breyer wrote.

In response, the Salem-based Satanic Temple wants to raise its own flag, but has not determined which one.

“We have several flag designs that have already been in production, and have not yet discussed which might be best for this specific purpose,” Greaves told MassLive.

The Satanic Temple was formed in 2013 and is separate from the Church of Satan, which was created in the 1960s. The Massachusetts group describes itself as a ""religious organization dedicated to the practice and the promotion of individual rights."" It practices ""non-theistic Satanism,"" a secular religion that does not believe in the supernatural but instead celebrates Satan as ""a symbol of defiance, independence, wisdom, and self-empowerment.""

The group has been known to advocate for the separation of church and state and has made various ""faith-based"" claims to put Satanic displays next to displays from major religions or seek abortions.



In a recent letter to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the group claimed that abortion is one of its religious rituals and that laws preventing access to treatments that kill unborn children in the womb violate its religious liberty.

Reacting to the impending Supreme Court decision that could overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion, Greaves said, “I hope that with the leaked draft of the Supreme Court majority opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, more people will wake up to the fact that these efforts by The Satanic Temple are actually high stakes frontline battles to preserve the basic rights of all, and not merely clever ‘pranks’ to expose already well-known hypocrisies.""

'The View's' Sunny Hostin says Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg would 'obliterate' Trump or DeSantis in 2024,"""The View"" co-anchor Sunny Hostin called Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis a ""fascist"" on Tuesday and said that if Vice President Kamala Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg run as the 2024 Democratic ticket, they would ""obliterate"" whoever the Republicans nominate, including the governor or former President Donald Trump.

She made those comments during a discussion on prospective 2024 presidential candidates.

Guest host Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former White House communications director for the Trump administration, expressed her opinion that President Joe Biden is not the best candidate for Democrats to run against Trump, who has given no indication he will not run for the White House again in 2024. This led to a conversation about Biden's age, younger Democrats who may be better candidates, and Republicans who might challenge Trump for the GOP nomination.



""I hope it's not DeathSantis over in Florida, because I think he's a fascist,"" Sunny Hostin declared after Whoopi Goldberg said she's more interested in who Republicans nominate for 2024 than what the Democrats do.



""I think he handled COVID miserably, I think he is a fascist and a bigot,"" she said, using the nickname critics of the the Republican governor's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic invented.

""Those are his good points!"" Joy Behar quipped.

Hostin went on to say that she hates how people talk about Biden being too old to run for re-election when Trump, his presumptive challenger, would be pushing 80 in that election.

""If the former twice-impeached disgraced president thinks he's such a young spring chicken, I mean, he's going to be 78 when Joe Biden is 81,"" she said. ""And so I don't like this ageism argument.""



Hostin added, ""I do think there are plenty of Democrats that have tons of verve and energy. I like Gavin Newsom because he's really pretty to look at and I think he does a great job in California.""

Then she suggested Vice President Kamala Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg would be ""great"" as a ticket.

""Do you think they could win, really?"" Behar asked.

""Well, I would vote for them,"" Hostin enthused. ""I hope this country is ready for something like that. I think the brain power alone would just obliterate Trump or DeathSantis.""

The discussion came as Biden's poll numbers are flailing and some Democratic Party insiders are expressing concerns about his prospective 2024 re-election campaign. While the president insists he intends to run for re-election, Democratic strategist David Axelrod and others have stated his age would be ""a major issue"" in the next presidential campaign.

Republican donors are reportedly making similar complaints about Trump. According to the Washington Post, former Vice President Mike Pence and a host of other Republicans are planning to run in 2024 and challenge Trump for the GOP nomination. They are reportedly engaging with Republican donors who believe that voters might want a fresh face challenging Biden instead of a redo of the 2020 presidential election.



DeSantis, meanwhile, is consistently coming in second place or outright beating Trump in prospective 2024 straw polls of conservative activists. While the Florida governor has not said he wants to run for president, he remains extremely popular with Republicans for refusing to lock down his state during the COVID-19 pandemic and for fighting back against woke corporations that have attacked his policies.

When asked about his future ambitions, DeSantis tells the media his focus is on his re-election campaign and on Republicans winning in the 2022 midterms.

“I think you have the opportunity to have a really big red wave,” he said on Fox News Monday. He stated his desire to end Florida's reputation as a swing state and have Republicans ""take it off the board"" with decisive electoral victories at both the state and local levels.

'They reported the exact wrong thing': Trump threatens to sue unrepentant Pulitzer board for defamation over awards to 'Russia Hoax' journalists,"Former President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he will sue the Pulitzer Prize Board for awarding journalists who advanced the discredited ""Russia Hoax"" narrative as well as for doubling down on allegedly defamatory remarks. For over a year, Trump has insisted that the Pulitzer board revoke the prizes to the New York Times and the Washington Post because the awarded reporting ""have become worthless and meaningless.""

What are the details?

At his ""Save America"" rally in Robstown, Texas, on Saturday, Trump split his attention between the future and the recent past.

Concerning the future, Trump indicated he would ""probably"" run again for president in 2024, stating, ""In order to make our country successful, safe and glorious again, I will probably have to do it again."" He emphasized the need to focus first on the midterm elections and on securing a ""historic victory for the Republican Party this November.""

Regarding the recent past, Trump underscored how those who covered so-called Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election should not be permitted to keep their prizes for national reporting.

Rather than on individual journalists, Trump honed his critique on the Pulitzer Prize Board, which recently refused to rescind the awards that had been conferred to reporters for pushing the ""Russia Hoax.""

The awards in question went to the staffs of the New York Times and the Washington Post for what the Pulitzer Prize Board characterized as ""deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation’s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration.""

The former president said, ""They gave out the Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the Russia Hoax, reporting on Russia, Russia, Russia. So you have reporters from the Washington Post, the New York Times, that got Pulitzer Prizes, and they reported the exact wrong thing.""

Whereas the liberal media was awarded for ""wrong reporting,"" advancing and amplifying spurious claims that Trump and his team had colluded with Russia, the former president noted that ""other people should have gotten the Pulitzer Prize because, frankly, they got it right for years.""

Trump claimed that ""they don't do Pulitzer prizes"" for those who, in his view, got it right, such as Fox News hosts Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Jeanine Pirro, and Laura Ingraham.

Trump indicated that, in lieu of another request for rectification, he will now be ""suing the Pulitzer organization to have those prizes taken back"" within the next two weeks.

""By allowing these people that got Russia, Russia, Russia wrong [to get the award],"" said Trump, ""they're actually libeling me because they're saying they got it right and it turned out to be a hoax.""

The Pulitzer Prize Board's refusal to rescind



After it received the Pulitzer in 2018, the New York Times celebrated itself for ""changing the nation's understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 election.""

The Washington Post similarly ran an article at the time, boasting that the ""Post's revelations about Russia, including contacts between Russian figures and President Trump's associates and advisers, helped set the stage for the special counsel's ongoing investigation of the administration.""



That investigation, which the Department of Justice said cost $32 million, ended with Special Counsel Robert Mueller finding no evidence of Russian collusion.

Even after the Steel dossier was discredited (admitted in the pages of the New York Times), the NYT and the Washington Post both doubled down, suggesting as late as spring 2022 that the Russian investigation was not undercut.

Townhall noted in 2019 that ""Neither one of the newspapers' reporting was 'heavily sourced,' although it was 'relentlessly reported,' probably because they were trying to push their editorial agenda ... Now that we know there was no collusion, now that we know there was no obstruction, does this mean we get a 'redo' on this award?""



Trump has been asking the same question for years.

Lawsuit

The Hill reported that last October, Trump wrote to Pulitzer's interim administrator claiming that the award in national reporting, which had been given to the two liberal papers, was ""based on false reporting of a non-existent link between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.""

Facing similar demands from Trump and others, the Pulitzer board announced on July 18 that it had commissioned two independent reviews of the work for which prizes were awarded.

According to a statement issued by the board, the ""separate reviews converged in their conclusions: that no passages or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.""

On Oct. 13, Trump's attorneys Jeremy Bailie and R. Quincy Bird wrote to Marjorie Miller, the administrator of the Pulitzer Prize Board, concerning the board's July statement. In the letter, Trump's attorneys notified the board that ""a defamatory statement pertaining to President Trump was and remains published on the Board's website since July 18, 2022.""

The letter cautioned that ""the Board, including its individual members, may be subject to suit and exposed to a judgment for damages, including punitive damages, for defamation,"" demanding not only that the statement be taken down by Oct.18, but that ""a full and fair correction, apology, or retraction issued.""



Additionally, Trump's attorneys noted that ""rescinding the 2018 Pulitzer Prizes in National Reporting from their current recipients would necessarily be part of any full and fair attempt to right the wrong caused by the Board's conduct.""

The letter advanced the claim made by Trump on Saturday: ""The New York Times and The Washington Post were and are two of the foremost propagators of the Russia Collusion Hoax"" and that it was ""obvious that the 2018 Pulitzer Pries were intended to endorse the two mainstream media organizations' full, misleading body of work on the Russia Collusion Hoax.""

A hostile Pulitzer board

The Pulitzer Prize Board, 2017-2018, which conferred the awards for investigations into disproven Russian interference included a number of fierce Trump critics, such as Gail Collins, an opinion columnist at the New York Times.



Two years before determining whether reporting on so-called Russian interference as it pertained to Trump's election and presidency were deserving of an award, Collins referred to the president as, ""A dimwitted, meanspirited spawn embodying the nation's worst flaws, failings and nightmares"" and suggested prior to the 2016 election that undecideds should vote for Clinton.

Eugene Robinson, the Pulitzer Prize Board's chair in 2018, is a columnist and associate editor at the Washington Post, which also happened to receive the award. He also happens to be an outspoken critic of the former president.

In the year he was on the board, Robinson accused Trump of ""speaking the language of white supremacy,"" telling his Twitter followers to, ""Get mad, and then get even: Vote against his enablers in November.""

The chair of the Pulitzer Prize Board also accused Trump of being a ""Putin fanboy.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/the-view-s-sonny-hostin-says-kamala-harris-and-pete-buttigieg-would-obliterate-trump-or-desantis-in-2024,2022-10-23
Fox News pundit says election was 'searing indictment' of GOP — and Republican vote margins prove it,"Conservative writer Marc Thiessen implored the Republican Party to engage in deep introspection after failing to deliver the promised ""red wave.""

In a political environment unfavorable to Democrats, how could Republicans not decisively win nationwide, especially when they are generally on the favorable side of important issues like the economy and crime?

The result, according to Thiessen, is a ""searing indictment"" of the Republican Party.

""We had the worst inflation in four decades, the worst collapse in real wages in 40 years, the worst crime wave since the 1990s, the worst border crisis in U.S. history. We have Joe Biden, who is the least popular president since Harry Truman — since presidential polling happened — and there wasn’t a red wave,"" the Fox News contributor said late Tuesday.

""That is a searing indictment of the Republican Party,"" he continued. ""That is a searing indictment of the message that we have been sending to the voters. They’ve looked at all of that, and looked at Republican alternative, and said no thanks.""

Given the disappointing results, Thiessen said the GOP ""needs to do a really deep introspection look in the mirror right now"" to understand the ""absolute disaster"" of an election cycle.

GOP midterm results are an 'absolute disaster': Bush speechwriter www.youtube.com

Although he did not mention former President Donald Trump by name, Thiessen said the Republican Party needs to look to Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp as the future of the GOP.

Election Day seems to have proven Thiessen correct.

For instance, Kemp won reelection by 7.5%. But Republican Herschel Walker, whom Trump endorsed, trails incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock by nearly 1%. In Ohio, DeWine won by more than 25%, but Trump-endorsed Republican J.D. Vance won by less than 7%.

This proves that many people — likely independent voters — supported proven Republican leaders but refused to support Trump-endorsed candidates.

Meanwhile, Florida has become a deep red state under DeSantis, who has proven yet again that he can win support from groups of voters Republicans have historically struggled with.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/they-reported-the-exact-wrong-thing-trump-threatens-to-sue-pulitzer-board-for-awarding-journalists-for-discredited-reports-on-russia-hoax,2022-11-09
"'This is Michigan, not Moscow': Mayor sued by city residents who say she refused to let them speak during council meeting's public comment time","Four residents of Eastpointe, Michigan, filed a federal lawsuit against the city's mayor and the city this week, claiming the mayor is abusing her power and trying to silence her critics, the Detroit Free Press reported.

What are the details?

The paper added that Monique Owens also is accused of preventing the residents from speaking during a public comment time at a September city council meeting.

Mary Hall-Rayford, Karen Beltz, Karen Mouradjian, and Cynthia Federle filed the lawsuit Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Detroit, the Free Press reported, adding that the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression filed the lawsuit on their behalf.

Owens had no comment Thursday, the paper reported, adding that messages were left for the Eastpointe city attorney seeking comment.

“This is Michigan, not Moscow,” FIRE attorney Conor Fitzpatrick said. “Public officials are elected to serve the people, not silence them. The First Amendment prohibits the government from requiring citizens to offer praise in order to be heard. FIRE is suing Owens to ensure that she no longer censors Eastpointers or tries to protect herself at the expense of the Constitution.”

FIRE sues Michigan mayor who abused power, shouted down constituents youtu.be

Fitzpatrick said a preliminary injunction was filed Thursday asking the court to prevent Owens from suppressing criticism while the lawsuit proceeds, the Free Press said.



More from the paper:

Len Niehoff, a professor at the University of Michigan law school, said if a state entity — and that includes a municipality or city — violates the First or Fourteenth Amendment, that raises a federal question and federal courts have jurisdiction. He had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on its merits.



The situation dates back to June and a dispute between Owens and City Councilman Harvey Curley at the Cruisin' Gratiot car show, of which Curley is the longtime chairman. Curley, 85, a former mayor of the city, got upset that Owens spoke at the opening ceremonies.

The Free Press reported that Owens accused Curley of putting his hands in front of her face and cursing at her. In a petition for a personal protection order Owens filed against Curley, she said she feared for her safety. The paper added that Owens filed a police report, but the lawsuit says Curley was never arrested or charged.

A Macomb County Circuit Court judge ruled in September that Curley's behavior was ""childish and extremely inappropriate"" but denied Owens' request for a personal protection order, the Free Press said.

'You're not going to sit here and assault me, lady I never met!'

At the Sept. 6 council meeting, Hall-Rayford and Beltz tried to speak up for Curley during the public comment period, the paper said. But the Free Press — citing the lawsuit — said Owens repeatedly interrupted and shouted them down and claimed discussion of the dispute would ""revictimize"" her.



The suit also states that Owens yelled at Beltz — a 40-year-plus resident who had never spoken at a council meeting before — when Beltz said Owens' claims against Curley are ""outrageous,"" the paper said.

With that, Owens cut her off and hollered: ""You're not going to sit here and assault me, lady I never met!""

The lawsuit also claims the city attorney told Owens that members of the public have ""free rein"" to discuss whatever topics they choose, but Owens ignored his advice, the Free Press reported.

Soon, council members began to leave the meeting — after which Owens sat alone up front.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/thiessen-election-searing-indictment-gop,2022-11-11
Outrage mob demands university chancellor resign for 'racist anti-Asian' joke that generated audience laughter,"Thomas Keon, chancellor of Purdue University Northwest, is facing demands to resign after making allegedly racist remarks.

What did Keon say?

At the Dec. 10 commencement ceremony at Purdue University Northwest, keynote speaker James Dedelow, a radio host, spoke about a ""made-up language"" that he sometimes uses with his family.

When Chancellor Keon returned to the lectern after Dedelow's speech, he said, ""Well all I can say is—"" before spouting off Asian-sounding gibberish, clearly an ode to the subject matter that Dedelow's speech addressed. The audience laughed and Keon said, ""That's sort of my Asian version of his [speech].""

PNW Commencement Ceremony, December 2022 - Morning Ceremony www.youtube.com

It did not take long for the incident to gain attention online.



University of Minnesota Professor Richard Lee accused Keon of making ""a racist comment,"" while author Min Jin Lee condemned Keon for ""racist anti-Asian linguistic mocking/mimicking"" that she claimed is ""injuring Asian and Asian American students."" An online petition demanding Keon's resignation, meanwhile, has garnered more than 6,000 signatures.

Keon responded to the outage last Wednesday with contrition. He apologized for his remarks, which he described as ""offensive and insensitive.""

""I am truly sorry for my unplanned, off-the-cuff response to another speaker, as my words have caused confusion, pain, and anger,"" Keon said in a statement.

Is Keon resigning?

On Dec. 16, PNW's Faculty Senate Executive Committee unanimously voted to demand Keon resign. It condemned him, despite his apology, for behavior it said does not reflect the university's diversity values.

But Keon has not resigned.

Now, PNW's faculty senate plans to hold a no-confidence vote, WLS-TV reported.

Thomas Roach, chairman of the faculty senate, said he will continue pressuring Keon to resign because his apology is not enough. Nothing, in fact, is enough for Keon to retain his job.

""I'm going to continue putting pressure on the situation until he either voluntarily resigns or the Board of Trustees comes to their senses and forces him out,"" Roach said, WSL reported. ""Any apology is meaningless as long as he's still in in place of the university, he needs to resign or needs to be removed.""

The vote, however, is practically meaningless. If Keon refuses to resign, the only people with power to remove him are Purdue's board of trustees and its president.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/this-is-michigan-not-moscow-mayor-sued-by-city-residents-who-say-she-refused-to-let-them-speak-during-council-meetings-public-comment-time,2022-12-20
Thousands across the country 'finish Eliza's run' in honor of slain Memphis jogger,"Thousands of runners, athletes, and people of good will — many in pink tops and purple shorts — rose early Friday morning and went out for a jog to honor a young mother and teacher who was kidnapped while out on a run near the University of Memphis last week and subsequently murdered.

On September 2, Eliza Fletcher, a 34-year-old mother of two and a beloved kindergarten teacher, went out for her usual jog at 4:30 a.m. in Memphis and never returned. Surveillance footage showed that at some point during her run, Fletcher was attacked and forced into an SUV. On Monday, police discovered a body and confirmed on Tuesday that it was Fletcher.

She had been wearing a pink top and purple shorts at the time of her abduction.

Cleotha Abston, 38, a felon who served two decades in prison for kidnapping another prominent Memphis resident, was arrested and charged with kidnapping and murdering Fletcher. He is currently being held in the Shelby County Jail on a $500,000 bond. He appeared in court on Tuesday, but has otherwise refused to cooperate with the investigation.

Because of the viciousness of the crime and the sense of loss over the death of such an innocent victim, many around the country determined to honor Fletcher's memory and complete the run she began a week ago. The loosely-affiliated event, dubbed ""Finish Eliza's Run,"" has spread far and wide. There are reports of runners in Pittsburgh, Baton Rouge, Boston, Little Rock, Nashville, and even Memphis, all gearing up to run to remember Fletcher.

""We wanted to come together as a community to finish Eliza’s run but also to highlight the safety concerns for runners and women,"" said Maureen Stevens, one of the organizers of the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, event. ""Liza was a mom. She was a teacher. This is the only time she had to run.""

Many events, including the one held in Baton Rouge and the one held in Little Rock, Arkansas, began with a short prayer.









One Facebook group organized a run in Memphis which followed Eliza's favorite path, and WREG Memphis reported that ""thousands of women"" showed up to participate.

Fletcher, a seasoned athlete, typically ran 8.2 miles, a distance much too difficult for even regular joggers. To make ""Finish Eliza's Run"" accessible to more people, some event coordinators have simply encouraged participants to engage in some kind of physical exercise — running, walking, cycling, swimming — for any distance or length of time in honor of Fletcher.



""You can complete any distance you would like, any where you feel safe, at any time,"" one virtual event states.

Fletcher taught kindergarten at St. Mary's Episcopal School, where faculty and students lit candles to honor her memory. Her funeral will be held on Saturday.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/thomas-keon-controversy-anti-asian,2022-09-09
"Three vehicles, two counties, one blistering-hot pursuit: Chase caught on camera ends as deputies open fire on berserker","A suspect led police on a dangerous high-speed chase through two Southern California counties on Wednesday night, stealing multiple cars, ramming deputies, breaking into a house, and putting countless lives at risk. The suspect, who has been identified as 32-year-old Johnny Anchondo, made abundantly clear with his crime spree that he'd rather risk death than jail time. Over an hour later, deputies appeared ready to oblige him.

Act I



It all began at 4:45 p.m. in the northern Orange County city of Fullerton when police observed the Hispanic driver of a black Honda Civic committing traffic violations near Auto Center Drive and I-5. The L.A. Times reported that the driver sped off, inaugurating a police chase that would last for well over an hour.

CBS News reported that the suspect had stopped near Buena Park to try to steal a truck. Having proven unable, he got back into the Civic.

According to Capt. Jon Radus, spokesman for the Fullerton Police Department, the driver of the Civic led police into Anaheim, getting on and off state route 91 in a successful attempt to lose the squad cars on his tail.

Although officers briefly lost sight of the Honda, KTTV reported that they quickly managed to track the suspect down to an apartment complex parking lot in northern Anaheim.

Act II

The suspect traded in the Civic and stole a white van belonging to Josh Reynolds.

The trade-in appeared short-lived, as police quickly cornered the suspect in the parking lot and readied their weapons.

Despite the commands issued by police, the driver of the stolen van refused to surrender. Instead, he rammed the single police cruiser that had hemmed him in, performed a four-point turn, and pulled out of the parking lot.

Reynolds said, ""My refrigerated van was so heavy that he was able to push the police car out of his way by backing up and ramming it and squeezed out.""

Just as the suspect got out of the parking lot, additional police units began to arrive. The driver nearly smashed into one cruiser head-on, threading by and speeding down a residential street.

The suspect made his way to the city of Whittier in Los Angeles County.

Near Marquardt Ave and Imperial Highway, one of the stolen van's tires gave out. The van began to spew sparks as it rolled along on an exposed rim.

The suspect continued driving recklessly, trailing sparks right through a gas station.

On the other side of the station, another police unit managed to trap the suspect, pinning the wrecked van at Carmenita Rd. and Placid Drive. The suspect floored the gas, but rather than momentum, all he got was smoke and more sparks.

Once again police officers drew down on the suspect, and once again he evaded them, this time ditching the smoldering van and fleeing on foot.

Here is more footage of the van portion of the chase:

Police Chase: Suspect not giving up after tense pursuit in OC youtu.be

Act III

In a desperate attempt to evade the police now encircling the area, the suspect broke into a nearby house.

One of the residents, Andres Benitez, told KTTV that when the suspect stole into his house, Benitez confronted the man with a knife.

Benitez, who was disappointed the family's pit bull didn't make mincemeat of the intruder, escorted the suspect out of the home.

Benitez told reporters, ""I told him I'm going to have to stab you right now, bro. ... But my mom just kept screaming and screaming. He saw that my mom was holding me back and he just got out of the house.""

The suspect did, however, manage to steal the key to Benitez's pickup truck — a new acquisition he and his brother had made for their landscaping company.

The family can be seen on video frantically trying to stop the suspect as he steals Benitez's truck, nearly running over dogs on his way out of the driveway:

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department took over the chase, which saw the suspect driving the wrong way, over medians, onto curbs, and threatening countless lives as he blasted through crowded intersections.

After several close calls on South Hacienda Boulevard, where the suspect reached speeds over 70 mph, the truck's front left wheel gave out. Losing control of the car and the situation, the suspect crashed into a Jeep, resulting in heavy damage.

Notwithstanding the damage, the suspect continued to press his luck.

Approaching traffic stopped at a red light, the suspect punched through four vehicles, hammering one into the intersection. A police cruiser barreled into the pickup in an apparent effort to prevent the suspect from endangering more lives. Several other police units closed in.

The front tires on Benitez's stolen truck were all rim, yet the rear drive still proved capable of scraping it along and into another gas station. LASD deputies immediately stormed the gas station, guns drawn.

After nearly toppling a gas pump, the suspect reversed into a deputy's vehicle. At that point, deputies — who believed the suspect was armed — weren't taking any more chances, electing instead to light Anchondo up.

Deputies riddled the stolen truck with bullets, but reportedly missed the suspect.

They approached the truck with ballistic shields and took Anchondo into custody.

CBS News reported that one bystander was injured during the standoff and detained for refusing to get out of the line of fire.

Adrian Cruz had been sitting at the Hacienda Heights stoplight when the suspect drove into his sedan. A police cruiser rammed the white pickup, which in turn re-hammered Cruz's sedan.



Cruz said police began shooting at the suspect. ""It just sounded crazy, like a war zone.""

In total, three people were taken to the hospital with injuries caused by the suspect's reckless driving.

According to police records, Johnny Anchondo was previously charged with multiple felonies. He was arrested in November 2020, December 2020, January 2021, and February 2021, just in Los Angeles County.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/thousands-across-the-country-finish-eliza-s-run-in-honor-of-slain-memphis-jogger,2022-11-10
"Video: 4 juveniles brutally beat, rob elderly woman in San Francisco. When she tries to get away, they return — and beat and rob her again.","Surveillance video recorded the horrifying moments when four juveniles physically attacked and robbed a 70-year-old woman Sunday in San Francisco — one of them actually kicked her square in the face.

But when the terrified woman tried to get away and was unable to shut a door, the juveniles returned and beat and robbed her again.

What are the details?

The victim — who wanted to be referred to only as Mrs. Ren and was confined to a bed due to her pain from the brutally attack — spoke to KGO-TV so that viewers will be aware of dangers in the city, even in broad daylight.

Mrs. Ren told the station through an interpreter that the group asked her what time it was, and she recalled that she replied, ""5 o'clock"" and then showed them her watch because she wasn't sure they understood her.

""They search my body, and I quickly realize they're up to no good,"" Mrs. Ren told KGO, adding that soon, her attackers knew she had an iPhone 7.

Video Mrs. Ren's housing complex gave to police shows the suspects followed her into the elevator because she refused to give up her phone.

""They got really mad and pulled me down,"" Mrs. Ren told KGO, after which video shows one of the attackers kicking her in the face.

She added to the station that they punched her in the head several times, pulled her down, and repeatedly kicked her.

But when Mrs. Ren tried to hide in the hallway and was unable to close the door, the suspects returned yet again — and this time they were after her keys and decided to continue beating her, KGO said.

Mrs. Ren's daughter began to sob at that point of the retelling, the station noted: ""I never expected this to happen to us ...""

What's more, both Mrs. Ren and her daughter can't sleep as a result of their trauma, KGO said.

Anything else?

"Video: Gun-toting thugs demand Uber driver exit his car in broad-daylight heist; when he refuses, one of them shoots driver dead.","Surveillance video caught the moment when two hooded individuals approached an Oakland Uber driver's car around 11 a.m. Sunday and demanded he get out, KGO-TV reported.

But when 52-year-old Kon ""Patrick"" Fung refused to exit his vehicle in the 2000 block of 13th Avenue, one of the suspects shot him dead and ran away from the scene, the station said, adding that police are calling it an attempted robbery.

Victim's girlfriend speaks out

Fung's girlfriend of five years told KGO about her personal tragedy in the hopes it will lead to solutions to violence plaguing the northern California city and the Bay Area.

""She's afraid to even leave her house, and she can't sleep,"" an interpreter for Judy — she wanted only her first name used for the story — explained to the station. ""The whole incident happened in less than five seconds. In that span, she lost her boyfriend.""

She added in Mandarin, ""I'm so scared. I don't dare go outside. I just think of him dying,"" KGO said.

Judy was buying groceries in Oakland's Chinatown the morning of the killing, the station said, adding that her son heard the gunshot and told the rest of the family what happened.

She added that her boyfriend Fung was ""a hard worker"" and told KGO he even worked on Sundays: ""It's because of his job, his hard-working trade, that he got killed.""

Judy's home is near the city's Little Saigon neighborhood, the station said, adding that KGO covered a gathering there last month featuring dozens of business owners concerned about crime there and and in nearby predominately Asian areas.

""Why us? We are hard-working. We go to work, we pay our bills, but why are we being targeted over and over again? This has to stop,"" Judy told the station as she wiped tears away from her face.

Her interpreter told KGO that she ""wants more help from the city patrolling the neighborhood. She needs more resources to make sure the safety of this neighborhood is protected. She's pleading for help to catch the two perpetrators to bring them to justice as soon as possible.""

The Oakland Chinatown Improvement Council — whose president, Stewart Chen, helped translate for Judy — is assisting with a GoFundMe to pay for funeral expenses, the station said.

The Oakland Police Department released video footage of the killing in the hopes that the pair of suspects can be identified, KGO said, adding that police and CrimeStoppers of Oakland announced a reward of up to $12,500 for information leading to an arrest.

Reporter grills Tim Cook over Apple's cozy relationship with China. Only footsteps broke his deafening silence.,"Apple CEO Tim Cook was grilled Thursday over Apple's cozy relationship with the Chinese government — but he refused to answer any of the questions.

""Hi, Mr. Cook. Do you support the Chinese people’s right to protest?"" Fox Business reporter Hillary Vaughn asked Cook as he walked through a hallway on Capitol Hill.

Cook, however, refused to answer. But Vaughn was undeterred.

""Do you have any reaction to the factory workers that were beaten and detained for protesting COVID lockdowns?"" she followed up, referring to an incident that happened last month.



Cook still remained silent.

""Do you regret restricting AirDrop access that protesters used to evade surveillance from the Chinese government?"" Vaughn then asked.

Cook again did not answer.

""Do you think it’s problematic to do business with the Communist Chinese Party when they suppress human rights?"" the reporter questioned.

Cook, of course, refused to answer. Instead, he walked into a room to get away from Vaughn.

What is the background?

Protests across China are intensifying as the Chinese government forces onto its people intense ""zero-COVID"" lockdown policies.

The protests have attracted global attention because they represent one of the strongest repudiations of the Chinese Community Party's dictatorial policies under President Xi Jinping’s leadership.

To squash the unrest, China relies on internet and social media censorship. The government's job became easier after Apple, just weeks before the protests began, limited an important iPhone feature — AirDrop — that has proved critical in previous protests.

Fast Company explains the significance of the change:

Earlier this month, Apple quietly added restrictions to its AirDrop feature for users in China, preventing customers from leaving their devices open to receiving files from passersby. In effect, the tech giant has eliminated Chinese activists’ ability to reach strangers using the widely available peer-to-peer communication tool.



AirDrop allows users to semi-anonymously send files directly using Bluetooth to other Apple users nearby, as long as recipients have their devices set to be discoverable by “everyone.” Before Apple’s update, Chinese activists could use AirDrop to disseminate information to strangers in crowded areas without revealing their own personal details, or going through a centralized platform.



Apple’s new update, shipped with iOS 16.1.1 on November 9, has quashed this tactic. Now, Apple users in mainland China will only be able to set their discoverability to “everyone” for 10 minutes before they automatically switch back to “contacts only.” That means the vast majority of Apple devices in China will be unable to receive strangers’ AirDrops even if their users want them.

Apple, unfortunately, has a history of implementingchanges to users in China that coincidently help the government exercise control over its people.

The technology giant has not publicly commented on its AirDrop change for Chinese users. Bloomberg, however, reported that it will be rolled out to all iPhone users next year.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/thugs-fatally-shoot-uber-driver,2022-12-02
"CNN anchor gives top Dem Senate candidate many chances to support abortion limits, but he refuses","Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, who is battling Republican J.D. Vance in Ohio for a United States Senate seat, refused on Sunday to support restrictions on abortion.

What happened?

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" anchor Dana Bash noted that Ryan is fiercely critical of Vance for appearing not to support abortion exceptions.

""I want to ask about your position: What restrictions, if any, do you believe there should be on abortion?"" Bash then asked.

What followed was a two-minute exchange in which Ryan repeatedly said the abortion decision ultimately rests with a mother and her physician. At no point, however, did Ryan endorse abortion restrictions, even as Bash pressed him on the issue.

""Ultimately, this needs to be a decision between the woman and her doctor,"" Ryan said.

""And, of course, we don't support abortion at the end of term, unless, of course, there is an extraordinary circumstance where, you know, you're eight months into a pregnancy and something very tragic is happening in that pregnancy, where, you know, you have a room, you have bought toys, you have clothing for the baby, everyone's excited, you know, and then something tragic happens,"" he continued. ""That needs to be left up to the doctor, not to J.D. Vance or Ted Cruz or anybody else.""

""But, as a legislator, you have to have some idea of what you want to do when you're not a doctor. So should there be some restrictions when it comes to the law of the land?"" Bash pressed.

""Well, ultimately, I think the decider has to be the woman and her doctor,"" Ryan said again. ""We can't account for every single scenario.""

Bash then pointed out the obvious. Ryan had dodged her attempts to explicitly state whether he supports placing limits on abortion.

""It sounds like you're saying no restrictions,"" she told Ryan.

Ryan, however, again declined to state that any legal restrictions should be enacted on abortions, only saying that no one supports abortion ""towards the end.""

""I think they're — no one's supporting abortion towards the end, absolutely. No one's for that. That rarely happens,"" Ryan hedged.

""But what we're saying is, are we going to preserve the woman's right to choose at the end to save her own life? I mean, come on,"" he added. ""Like, should the government really be in there? That sounds very anti-American.""



What does Vance say?

Vance indeed last year argued against abortion exceptions for cases of rape and incest, which compose a tiny percentage of abortions in America.

However, Vance told NBC News after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade that he supports individual states choosing which direction to take on the controversial issue.

""I think it makes sense right now to let the states decide this stuff,"" Vance said",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tim-cook-grilled-apple-china,2022-08-29
Democrat Tim Ryan makes revealing admission about his own party: 'The Democratic brand ... is not good',"Rep. Tim Ryan — the Ohio Democrat who is battling J.D. Vance for a United States Senate seat — admitted this week he does not embrace his Democratic political identity because it is a political liability in his state.

What did Ryan say?

Speaking with CNN reporter Manu Raju in a recent interview, Ryan admitted the Democratic Party is not a popular ""brand"" in his neck of the woods.

""You don't advertise that you're a Democrat. Is that because it's an implicit recognition that it's a liability here?"" Raju asked.

""Yes,"" Ryan admitted.

""Well, I mean, the Democratic brand, as we know, and you and I have talked about this for a long time, is not good in a lot of these places,"" he explained. ""And I tell people, look, I'm an American. You're an American.""

'Where's J.D.?:' Vance's Ohio Senate campaign prompts GOP concerns youtu.be

The CNN report noted how Ryan often boasts in his TV ads that he has voted against the agenda items of Democrats, including former President Barack Obama. But what the ads do not emphasize is that ""he is a Democrat and often votes with President Biden.""

""You ran against her, Nancy Pelosi, but then you voted for her,"" Raju noted.

""What I want people to know is in this environment, do you have the guts to take on your own party? And from my vantage point for me, it's a resounding yes,"" Ryan responded.

Why is this significant?

Once the bellwether of presidential elections, Ohio is becoming an increasingly conservative state. Barack Obama won the state in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. But Donald Trump managed to flip the state red, defeating both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden by a whopping 8%.

Ryan's admitted reluctance to embrace his Democratic political identity suggests he understands the shifting political winds hitting his backyard.

In fact, Ryan is now publicly breaking with Biden on some issues. For example, after Biden announced his controversial plan to forgive student loan debt, Ryan said Biden's plan ""sends the wrong message"" to Americans.

""[W]hile there's no doubt that a college education should be about opening opportunities, waiving debt for those already on a trajectory to financial security sends the wrong message to the millions of Ohioans without a degree working just as hard to make ends meet,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""Instead of forgiving student loans for six-figure earners, we should be working to level the playing field for all Americans.""

Ryan's break with Biden comes as his lead over Vance evaporates.

Just one month ago, Ryan enjoyed a roughly five-point advantage over his opponent. That advantage now? It's under one point, according to FiveThirtyEight.

For Ryan, that means he has his work cut out for him. Vance has Trump's endorsement, and he is aligned with Ohio's shifting political ideology. After all, how will Ryan explain his far-left position on abortion?

Indeed, over the weekend, Ryan refused to endorse any limits on abortion access, a position radically out-of-step with the majority of Americans. And in conservative Ohio, such positions are a disaster for Democrats and a godsend for Republicans.

And no matter how hard Ryan tries to paint himself as a blue-collar moderate, his record in Congress tells the real story: He's a Democrat through and through.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tim-ryan-abortion-limits-cnn,2022-09-02
Twitter reactions to Time magazine promoting neopronouns,"Time magazine was raked over the coals for promoting an article by using befuddling and progressive pronouns to promote the author of a controversial book targeting minors. Time magazine's use of ""absurd,"" woke preferred pronouns was quickly skewered in Twitter reactions.

Time magazine interviewed Maia Kobabe, the author of the book ""Gender Queer."" The heavily disputed book has been thrust into the culture wars after parents discovered it in high school libraries across the country. Parents say the book has ""graphic"" illustrations of sexual situations, and it has been described as ""soft porn.""

In 2020, the American Library Association named ""Gender Queer"" as a winner of an Alex Award – ""books written for adults that have special appeal to young adults, ages 12 through 18.""

Kobabe is a nonbinary, queer author and illustrator who uses the preferred pronouns of e/em/eir. Kobabe's pronouns are known as ""Spivak pronouns"" – named after 1990s mathematician Michael Spivak, who introduced the neopronouns in the manual ""The Joy of Tex,"" according to Psychology Today.

Simon & Schuster described ""Gender Queer"" as ""Maia's intensely cathartic autobiography charts eir journey of self-identity, which includes the mortification and confusion of adolescent crushes, grappling with how to come out to family and society, bonding with friends over erotic gay fanfiction, and facing the trauma and fundamental violation of pap smears.""

The New York Times interviewed Kobabe in May and decided not to use the author's pronouns in the article. The New York Times reportedly received blowback for not using Kobabe's preferred pronouns.

The Hill reported, ""The New York Times is facing backlash from readers after an interview with Maia Kobabe — the author and illustrator of the graphic memoir 'Gender Queer' about Kobabe’s coming out as nonbinary — failed to use Kobabe’s preferred gender-neutral pronouns, e, eir and em.""

The Hill noted that the New York Times style guide encourages writers to ""take care to avoid confusion for readers"" when using nontraditional pronouns.

Time magazine used Kobabe's preferred pronouns in the article reacting to the news that a Virginia judge had recently struck down an effort to prohibit ""Gender Queer"" from being sold to minors. The lawsuit argued that the book was obscene and unfit for children.

Time magazine used Kobabe's preferred pronouns throughout the article, which some readers said made it difficult to read.

Time magazine promoted the article on the media outlet's official Twitter account with the caption: ""TIME spoke to 'Gender Queer' author and illustrator Maia Kobabe on about eir work, the efforts to restrict access to eir writing, and what ey make of the current cultural moment.""

Reactions on Twitter quickly ridiculed Time magazine for using the ""absurd"" pronouns.

Author John Hawkins: ""Why are you using imaginary words?""

Journalist Kim Iversen: ""What’s with the 'eir' and 'ey'? Are we making up new pronouns now?""

Author Frank J. Fleming: ""I mean, people are free to use whatever crazy pronouns they want for themselves, but the idea that everyone else is supposed to keep a pronouns spreadsheet based on the whims of every narcissistic weirdo seems unsustainable.""



Evolutionary biologist Colin Wright: ""Using these absurd neopronouns isn't just silly and weird, it helps normalize a regressive pseudoscientific ideology that is inflicting enormous harm on society. Do not comply.""

Author Helen Joyce: ""I’m certain that when TIME 1st decided to use 'preferred pronouns' it justified it on grounds of kindness & respect. It didn’t occur to anyone that there was no stopping place; that their failure to put accuracy and the reader’s comprehension first meant they were now powerless. To deny ANY ludicrous, narcissistic demand for control by a subject or interviewee over how they are referred to.""

Colorado State Senator Nathan Dahm: ""Language is an important part of a culture. Leftists want to destroy every aspect of us including our culture. That’s why they’ve redefined the meaning of vaccine, recession, and woman. This is utter nonsense. And we’re under no obligation to encourage these delusions.""

Senior fellow at Independent Women's Forum Beverly Hallberg: ""How can we insist children learn and use proper grammar when this is mainstream?""

Singer Phil Labonte: ""I use the pronouns people prefer. I will call a trans woman 'she' or a trans man 'he'. I’ll do it all the time, and I'll do it with courtesy, respect, and charity. I refuse to use these narcissistic neo-pronouns.""

Investigative journalist David Steinberg: ""TIME magazine is promoting a lunatic narcissist who draws explicit pornographic comics for tweens.""

Author Adam B. Coleman: ""What the hell is an 'eir'? I thought Time was having mini strokes as they were typing this out or something.""

Columnist Karol Markowicz: ""Ey think yeir stupid.""



Podcast host Katie Herzog: ""For a second I thought TIME was tweeting in German.""

Conservative commentator Matt Walsh: ""My pronouns are kwioaljfnaueakjnfkak/ealjnuaepasnfjnweounaljsnflajnelfnakjaf/ajnfoenfoiefnkjnfiuouenafef03910394. Please refer to me accordingly.""

Editor Ben Kew: ""People may laugh, but I actually find it pretty sad to see a publication as iconic as TIME Magazine reduced to this.""

Time magazine was recently blasted for a ""sycophantic"" cover of President Joe Biden and belittling Helen Keller as ""just another privileged white person.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tim-ryan-democratic-party-brand-not-good,2022-09-01
Tom Brady apologizes for comparing playing in the NFL to a military deployment: 'A very poor choice of words',"Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady apologized after receiving some backlash for comparing playing in the NFL to deploying in the military.

Brady addressed the issue at the beginning of his weekly media briefing on Thursday.

""Before we start, can I say one thing? Earlier this week I made a statement about playing football and the military and it was a very poor choice of words,"" said Brady to reporters.

""And I just want to express that to any sentiments out there that people may have taken it in a certain way. I apologize,"" he added.

He was asked to explain his comments by a reporter, but he refused.

""To be honest, I don’t really want to expand on it too much,"" Brady responded. ""I have a tremendous amount of gratitude to everyone who served. In the end, we play a game, and the military is defending our country. It’s two different things and I shouldn’t have made the comparison.""

The superstar quarterback made the comments about the military on the ""Let's Go!"" podcast released on Monday.

""I almost look at like a football season like you’re going away on deployment in the military,"" Brady said on the podcast. ""And it’s like, ‘Man, here I go again.’ And there’s only one way to do it.""



Some veterans and their families were offended by the comments and took to social media to express their displeasure.

""Hey @TomBrady Did you ever get shot at during practice? Blown up? Have your teammates get wounded or killed?"" tweeted U.S. Army veteran Richard Ojeda. ""Did you ever finish a practice and wonder how you were able to make it through alive??? YOU PLAY A GAME. Worst case scenario is you lose a game. Not a life.""

""Tom Brady's reference to his career as being deployed is a prime example of some detached brat who has no freakin' idea what military and their families go through during war. He owes an apology to say the least,"" tweeted a woman who identified as a combat veteran spouse.

Brady's third season with the Buccaneers is off to a slow start with three victories and three losses. He's also been plagued by reports of marital problems with his supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen.

Tom Cotton drops mic on woke Kroger CEO for running to Republicans to save merger from Democrats: 'Best of luck',"If Kroger and Albertsons thought Republicans would rescue their plan to merge, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) made it clear last Tuesday that support for the merger among Republicans is anything but certain.

What is the background?

Kroger announced in October plans to acquire Albertsons for $24.6 billion.

The plan was not exactly celebrated. Instead, it triggered immediate antitrust concerns, especially among Democrats who are suspicious of massive corporations. After all, Kroger is the nation's second-largest grocery store chain and Albertsons is the fourth-largest.

If the acquisition were approved, Kroger could potentially rival Walmart.

What happened with Cotton?

At a hearing before Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights last Tuesday, Cotton blasted Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen for running to Republicans for support while at the same time enacting woke corporate policies.

Specifically, Cotton grilled McMullen over a religious discrimination lawsuit the federal government brought against his company for forcing two Arkansas employees to wear a uniform adorned with a rainbow heart. The employees were eventually fired because they refused to wear a uniform with an LGBT symbol on it. In October, Kroger settled a religious discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of the fired employees.

Shockingly, McMullen told Cotton that he was not aware of the case.

Going even further, Cotton zeroed in on Kroger's ""allyship"" guide, in which employees are told not to use words like ""sir"" and ""ma'am"" because they are not ""inclusive.""

Tom Cotton Grills CEO Over Firings Of Employees Who Refused To Wear 'Gay Pride' Symbol www.youtube.com

At every point, McMullen defended Kroger. That decision — to force woke policies onto employees — will not earn Kroger any sympathy from Republicans, Cotton said.

""This situation reminds me a little bit of the situation Big Tech companies have found themselves in. ... They come to Washington because they fear regulation from our Democratic friends or action by the Biden administration, and they expect Republicans, who are traditionally more supportive of free enterprise, to come to their defense,"" Cotton said.

""I've cautioned them for years that if they silence conservatives and center-right voters ... if they discriminated against them in their company, they probably shouldn't come and ask Republican senators to carry the water for them whenever our Democratic friends want to regulate them or block their mergers,"" he continued.

After explaining that he knows Democrats will highly scrutinize Kroger's acquisition, Cotton then dropped the mic.

""I'll say this: I'm sorry that's happening to you. Best of luck,"" he said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/tom-brady-military-deployment-apology,2022-12-07
CBS anchor talks over GOP guest to implicate Republicans for political violence — then he corners her with media hypocrisy,"Margaret Brennan, moderator of CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" tried on Sunday to blame Republican rhetoric for the attack on Paul Pelosi.

But Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) refused to let it happen.

What happened?

Last week, Emmer posted a video to social media that showed him firing a rifle.

The caption said, ""Enjoyed exercising my Second Amendment rights with @KellyCooperAZ & General @JackBergman_MI1. 13 days to make history. Let’s #FirePelosi.""

So after questioning Emmer about election denial, Brennan grilled him over the video. ""Why is there a gun in a political ad at all?"" she asked.

But the problem is, as Emmer quickly pointed out, his video was not a political ad.

""It wasn't an ad. I was tweeting out— I was tweeting out something that I had just done,"" he responded as Brennan talked over him.

""Wouldn't a pink slip be more fitting, if it's about firing her?"" she said. ""Why a gun?""

Sensing that Brennan was trying to connect his video and GOP rhetoric to political violence, Emmer called out the media's hypocrisy, namely that they did not blame Democrats when Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) and other GOP lawmakers were nearly assassinated by a far-left Bernie Sanders supporter in 2017.

""I never heard you or anyone else in the media trying to blame Democrats for what happened,"" Emmer pointed out.

After more back-and-forth in which Emmer was forced to say the obvious — that he was simply exercising his Second Amendment rights — Brennan finally arrived at her point: She believes his video incites violence against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.



""Do you not understand that [the video] is suggestive to people who are in a bad state and, in this current environment, how risky it is? As you're talking about the importance of lowering the rhetoric — why do you leave that up?"" Brennan said.

""Well, I disagree with you,"" Emmer shot back. ""Again, I never saw anyone after Steve Scalise was shot by a Bernie Sanders supporter trying to equate Democrat rhetoric with those actions. Please don't do that.""

""OK,"" Brennan conceded.

"At least 46 illegal aliens found dead in a trailer in San Antonio, and death toll may climb higher","A horrendous scene was discovered by police in San Antonio, Texas, in a tractor-trailer where at least 46 illegal aliens were found dead, and the death toll could climb higher.

The 18-wheeler vehicle was found on Monday at Quintana road and Cassin road in a secluded area in the southwest of the city.

Local news outlets reported a large law enforcement response of at least 20 emergency vehicles to the incident at about 6 p.m. Multiple sources from the San Antonio Police Department told KSAT-TV that 16 others were found alive and transported to hospitals for treatment.

A KSAT crew also documented a mass casualty evacuation ambulance at the site.

At least five victims were reported in critical condition at Baptist Medical Center hospital.

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott responded to the tragedy on Twitter and blamed it on the lax border enforcement policies of President Joe Biden.

""These deaths are on Biden. They are a result of his deadly open border policies. They show the deadly consequences of his refusal to enforce the law,"" he tweeted.

A similar horror unfolded in July 2017, when a trailer full of illegal aliens was abandoned at a Walmart in San Antonio. Eight of the nearly 40 migrants were found dead from the heat, and two others later died at hospitals in that incident.

""They were very hot to the touch. So these people were in this trailer without any signs of any type of water,"" said San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood at the time. ""It was a mass casualty situation for us.""

The driver of the truck was later sentenced to life in prison over the deaths.

Trans activists chanting 'no hate here' shut down a 'Let Women Speak' rally after viciously assaulting female demonstrators,"Kellie-Jay Keen, a women's rights supporter, was forced to shut down her ""Let Women Speak"" rally in Tacoma, Washington, on Wednesday afternoon after far-left activists harassed, assaulted, and injured attendees.



Keen told Fox News that the rally's purpose was to give women their voices back from the trans movement.

""Women are being silenced all through tech. So, we're taking our voices back to the public square,"" Keen continued. ""When many of those women attended, they've lost their jobs, they've lost their livelihoods, they might have lost their children to this pernicious cult.""

Anti-women trans activists flooded the rally and stood around the event waving transgender flags and signs that read ""crash the cis-tem"" and ""trans women are women.""

At the start of Keen's event, the trans activists shouted over the speakers by chanting, ""No hate here."" Due to the noise, the rally attendees moved to the other side of the venue, but the disruptive activists followed.

Keen noted that many of the trans activists in the crowd were men. During the rally, April Morrow was allegedly assaulted by a far-leftist male activist who grabbed and crushed her hand.

""April got her fingers crushed by a man's bare hands. He literally got her hand in his and crushed it and broke her fingers,"" Keen explained.

Following the assault, the attacker allegedly stole Morrow's phone and smashed it, Keen told the Daily Wire.

""The USA is failing to uphold the First Amendment at the behest of this odious and most insidious quasi-religious cult called transgenderism,"" Keen stated. ""Women must be protected to speak about the erasure of our spaces, our rights, and the words we use to define ourselves.""

A video of the event posted on Twitter captured a trans activist aggressively rushing up behind a speaker at the microphone. The protester then shouted, ""Nobody cares. Get the f*** out of here.""

Another video of the rally captured a woman being ambushed by a group of trans activists. According to the Post Millennial, the victim sustained an arm injury from the attack.

Content warning: Language:

Keen decided it would be best to end the event after she claimed the Tacoma Police Department ""failed to show up until the 23rd call for help.""

As Keen was wrapping up the rally, she told the crowd, ""If there's any police here, there's a man in a yellow hat that said he's gonna f***ing kill someone.""

""We aren't going to let any more people be assaulted, and the police aren't coming,"" Keen stated. ""Much love to you all, please donate if you'd like to see us have f***ing security at the next event. Thank you.""

Keen criticized the local police for not protecting the women at the event. However, she later noted that one of the reported assaults led to an arrest.

""The Tacoma Police Department had officers on scene monitoring the event,"" TPD public information officer Wendy Haddow told the Daily Wire. ""Police responded to calls from victims wanting to report a crime. This included a victim who reported an assault and damage to a cell phone.

Haddow reported that after the rally, the police department was informed that a victim had allegedly been pepper-sprayed.

'Bad ass black trans' activist fired from own LGBTQ center for allegedly diverting funds to 'unknown' bank accounts,"A transgender activist known as a leading voice for transgender people in Chicago, Illinois, has been fired from the LGBTQ center the activist founded after allegedly diverting the organization's funds to ""unknown"" bank accounts.

LaSaia Wade founded the Brave Space Alliance, touted as the first and only community center on Chicago’s south side led by a black person and a transgender person. Wade said that the organization grew during the pandemic into a multimillion-dollar operation.

In a Facebook post from the organization, the board of directors of said in a statement that an independent forensic accountant had uncovered “substantial questionable spending of BSA funds"" that led to Wade's ouster.

“We are very disappointed that this happened,” Brave Space Alliance chair Channyn Lynne Parker said in the written statement. “We are working hard to make sure BSA survives and thrives.”



The statement said that they had sent the forensic report to the Illinois attorney general’s office. A deputy press secretary for the attorney general’s office confirmed that they were reviewing the report, according to the Chicago Tribune.

The 35-year-old refused to comment on the accusations to the Tribune.

“I pushed our organization through pandemic years, and we got over a hump,” Wade said.

One annual report from the organization said it had raised $3.3. million in revenue in 2021. The group got a boost from the Obama Foundation in 2021. The former president's organization posted a quote from Wade on its official social media account and praised the activist for working for the LGBTQ agenda.

""We need to actually invest and also believe in femme, black women, and trans women's leadership,"" read the quote from Wade.

Wade self-identifies as a ""bad ass black trans woman"" and lists preferred pronouns as ""she"" and ""they.""

"Transgender deputy's civil lawsuit against Georgia county goes to trial, seeking monetary damages because health insurance did not cover gender reassignment surgery","Court continued on Monday for a civil trial involving a sheriff's deputy seeking monetary damages from Houston County in Georgia. The deputy, Sgt. Anna Lange, alleged that the county's health insurance illegally denied coverage for Lange's gender reassignment surgery.

The lawsuit seeks damages for emotional distress, attorney fees, and repayment of over $10,000 in out-of-pocket medical costs. Lange claimed that the medical costs were incurred due to the county's insurance plan refusing to cover gender surgery.

In June, U.S. District Court Judge Marc Treadwell determined that Houston County's rejection to cover the surgery was illegal sex discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Judge Treadwell found that Lange's surgery was ""medically necessary."" His court order cited a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that determined a Michigan funeral home could not fire an employee for being transgender.

""This just shows that justice will prevail and bigotry and ignorance won't win,"" Lange said following the June ruling. ""Hopefully this will send a message to the trans community and their employers who withhold trans healthcare that this won't be tolerated.""

The lawsuit claimed that the county and superiors intentionally discriminated against Lange. Treadwell wrote in his June order that in 2018, the sheriff and other county officials were told that Lange wanted to start dressing as a woman at work. At that time, Lange inquired whether the health insurance policy would cover gender reassignment surgery.

According to Lange, Sheriff Cullen Talton responded that he did not ""believe in sex changes."" Nevertheless, Talton granted Lange permission to dress as a woman.

Houston County's health plan has excluded gender surgeries since 1998. In 2016, the county's insurance company recommended that the health plan be updated to include the surgery, stating that refusing to cover it is considered discriminatory under the Affordable Care Act. Regardless, the county chose to continue opting out of the coverage.

The judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support the lawsuit's claim that the county intentionally discriminated against Lange. Instead, Treadwell ordered a civil trial where the jury could decide if Lange should be awarded damages from the county.

Houston County argued that refusal to cover the surgery was not meant to be discriminatory towards Lange but rather to keep health insurance costs low.

Lange told WMAZ-TV, ""Now that I've been through it and felt it, I know it certainly it takes everybody to stand up when they see something that isn’t right where people are being treated a certain way and just say, 'You know, enough.'""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/trans-lasaia-wade-financial-fraud,2022-09-26
Judge finds Catholic hospital violated Obamacare when it canceled a hysterectomy for a transgender man,"A federal judge ruled against a Catholic hospital that canceled a hysterectomy for a transgender man, saying it violated Obamacare.

Jesse Hammons filed a lawsuit against the University of Maryland St. Joseph Medical Center when it refused the operation on the basis of religious identity of the hospital.

The judge ruled that the hospital violated the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, when it discriminated against Hammons.

The hospital released a statement to WJZ-TV that said it had offered to have Hammons receive the hysterectomy at another hospital but that he refused.

""The University of Maryland St. Joseph Medical Center and the University of Maryland Medical System are carefully reviewing the decision from Judge Chasanow,"" said the statement from the hospital.

""We dispute many of the conclusions that were reached in this decision and may be in a position to comment further after additional analysis of the ruling. Legal disagreements aside, we sincerely wish the very best for Mr. Hammons and we support his efforts to seek the highest quality healthcare. We may disagree on certain technical, legal points but compassion for the patients we serve remains foundational to our work,"" it added.

""This legal claim stems directly from, and is traceable to, a surgeon mistakenly scheduling a procedure that could not be performed at UM SJMC,"" the statement explained. ""Although our offer to perform gender affirming surgery at a different location was declined by Mr. Hammons, the University of Maryland Medical System remains committed to meeting the unique medical needs of transgender individuals and patients who are routinely scheduled by physicians for appointments and procedures at UMMS member organizations.""

Hammons was represented by ACLU senior staff attorney Josh Block.

""The government has no business running a religious hospital and enforcing religious doctrine,"" Block said in a statement to WJZ. ""The hospital needs to be following secular laws and that's not the right place to be having a religious institution.""

The judge said that damages will be rewarded at trial.

Critics of Obamacare warned that provisions included in the overreaching legislation would infringe on the rights of institutions and individuals to express their religious beliefs.

Transgender woman calls on Canadian Human Rights Commissioner after gym refuses entry to women-only location,"A Transgender woman called on the Canadian Human Rights Commissioner to investigate a gym that refused entry to a women-only location and instead pointed the person to a co-ed gym.

Brigid Klyne-Simpson said the Bodyworks Fitness gym in Parksville, British Columbia, was initially very welcoming.

“One of the trainers there greeted me, and she was extremely kind and she could basically tell I was trans right away and said I would be welcome there, and explicitly said I would be safe as well, even gave me a hug,” Klyne-Simpson told Chek News.

Klyne-Simpson purchased a membership and worked out at the women-only location of the gym. Days later, the gym called.

“Then on Monday, I got a call from the same person basically saying, ‘Sorry, we made a mistake, you’re not actually allowed to be here, but you’re more than welcome to use the co-ed facility,” Klyne-Simpson said.

Bodyworks Fitness has two locations, one for only women and the other for both sexes.

Klyne-Simpson said it was devastating.

Dale Nagra, the owner of the gym, explained the company's rationale for their decision to Chek News.

“We want them to be comfortable, but we also have to worry about the young girls that this gym is set up for and the women, and how are their parents gonna feel that they’re in there, then this person walks in with a male voice and big person,” Nagra said.

He went on to say that no matter what, someone is going to be uncomfortable.

""And so, do we pick the comfort of the transgender person, and they may not be as comfortable with the co-ed gym but at least that’s an alternative, or do we pick the comfort of the young girls that are working out there that might not feel comfortable?” he asked.

Nagra also said that other transgender people already use the co-ed gym, and his business does not discriminate against transgender people.

Klyne-Simpson says there is a simple answer for people who disagree with the transgender agenda.

“All it takes is education. Once you understand trans women are women, trans men are men, non-binary people are who they say they are, it’s as simple as that,” said Klyne-Simpson. “If you still feel uncomfortable after that, that’s on you, it’s not on me. I am who I am, it’s as simple as that. I just look different. That’s all.”

Transsexual admits to burning down 118-year-old Christian church in Portland: Report,"A 27-year-old transsexual has reportedly admitted to burning down a historic Korean church in Portland, Oregon, underscoring how he wanted to ""take credit"" for this act of apparent anti-Christian hatred.

What are the details?

The 118-year-old, 3,000-square-foot Portland Korean Church at Southwest 10th and Southwest Clay Street, formerly the First German Evangelical Church, was set ablaze around 5:30 p.m. on Jan. 3.

In response to multiple reports indicating that the structure was fast becoming an inferno, 12 fire engines, six ladder trucks, four battalion chiefs, and 75 Portland Fire and Rescue Personnel arrived on the scene.



Portland Fire and Rescue indicated that the church was not occupied when the three-alarm fire broke out.

According to the Multnomah County District Attorney's office, by 5:40 p.m., the south side of the church had partially collapsed along with the roof. The fire had also spread to a neighboring home, which was evacuated.



KOIN reported that demolition crews began tearing down the remainder of the church this week.

The toppling of its 35-foot steeple, which reached a height of 70 feet, was captured on video:



Mike Schmidt, the leftist Multnomah County District Attorney who made a name for himself by refusing to prosecute BLM rioters and other violent suspects, announced that 25-year-old Cameron David Storer was arraigned on four charges, including two counts of arson in the first degree, one count of arson in the second degree, and two counts of burglary in the second degree.



Storer, a transsexual who prefers to be called by a woman's name, reportedly walked into the Multnomah County Detention Center on Jan. 4 to confess to setting the fire, claiming that he wanted to ""take credit"" for the attack and detailing how he had gone about doing so with a Bic lighter.

Court documents indicated that Storer lit papers on fire in the church, waited nearby to make sure it had spread, then walked over to Plaid Pantry to observe his handiwork.

The alleged arsonist claimed to have taken 10 oxycodone daily and to have been addled by schizophrenia. He also suggested that voices had told him to burn down the church.

Andy Ngô reported that the bearded suspect is currently being jailed in a co-ed medical dorm in a single cell.



In light of Schmidt's recent admission that Multnomah County can't bring all dangerous criminals to justice — letting alleged stranglers, domestic abusers, sex offenders, human traffickers, child abusers, and berserkers of various intensities off without any penalty for their misdeeds — it is presently unclear if Storer will ultimately be penalized for the alleged crimes for which he has taken credit.

The Portland Korean Church, which the Oregonian noted was owned by Hadi Nouredine, a Beaverton and Lake Oswego dentist, was also targeted in September 2020.

Christian churches have been routinely targeted in Portland, primarily by leftist marauders.

A transsexual Antifa militant was charged with a Nov. 3, 2020, attack on Saint André Bessette Catholic Church — a church known for housing, cleaning, and feeding the city's poor.

Father Tom Gaughan said, ""The actions of this one individual has forced us to cease our outreach and its hundreds of people we normally give food to.""

In April 2021, the First Christian Church was targeted in an attack, having its windows shattered.

At least four Catholic churches were vandalized by radicals with threatening and vulgar remarks in summer 2021.

The century-old Portland Stake Tabernacle in southeast Portland was abandoned in summer 2022, after its Mormon congregants fled the state, citing the leftist violence plaguing the city.



The Democrat-run city scores a three on Neighborhood Scout's crime index, where 100 is safest. The chances of becoming a victim of a violent crime are one in 187. In the Democrat-controlled state of Oregon, the odds are one in 342.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transphobic-gym-canada-parksville,2023-01-08
"Transsexual who butchered his parents no longer serving his 40-year sentence in men's prison, now listed as a 'female' in medium-security prison","On account of legislation sponsored and approved by Democrat politicians, the 24-year-old transsexual who butchered his parents and family dog on Halloween in 2016 — claiming they provoked him by refusing to indulge his fantasy of being a woman — has received a ""female"" designation and is no longer in a men's-only prison.

What are the details?

Andrew Balcer, now 24, was held at the Long Creek Youth Development Center in South Portland, Maine, prior to his conviction in 2018 for the murder of his parents. A program manager at the secure juvenile facility testified in court that Balcer demanded to be called ""Andrea"" while in custody and further requested that people use female pronouns when describing him, reported the Kennebec Journal.

After receiving his sentence, Balcer was sent to the Maine State Prison, a maximum-security facility for men. However, it appears that the double murderer has since had his accommodations upgraded.

The feminist publication Reduxx reported that Balcer now resides in the Maine Correctional Center in Windham, a mixed-sex medium-security facility where he is likely kept with real women.

According to the MCC website, the facility is Maine’s primary adult reception facility for both male and female residents and is where ""residents sentenced to less than five years are directly admitted.""

The Maine Department of Corrections lists Andrew Balcer, a biological male looming at over six feet tall and weighing in at over 245 pounds, as a ""female"" with the alias ""Andrea Balcer.""

Andrew Balcer Maine Department of Corrections, inmate profile

Reduxx noted that the so-called ""Act to Protect the Rights of Certain Incarcerated Individuals,"" sponsored by Democrat state Rep. Charlotte Warren and approved by Democrat Gov. Janet Mills in 2021, enables men to be housed with women in the event that the men identify as women.

The act ""provides to a person residing in a correctional or detention facility the right to have that person's consistently held gender identity respected and acknowledged and to have staff and representatives of the correctional or detention facility use the pronouns, titles and names identified by the person.""

Extra to affirming the inmate's supposed gender dysphoria, housing and search procedures must be consistent with the inmate's gender identity.

In addition to potentially residing with real women, Balcer is also permitted dysphoria-affirming apparel.

Fox News Digital noted that MDOC Commissioner Randell Liberty rolled out a policy in 2020 requiring state-run prisons to provide clothing that aligns with an inmate's so-called gender identity, meaning that men can be given bras and women can receive chest binders. Balcer would be eligible to receive such gear.

The murders



WGME reported that on Oct. 31, 2016, Balcer murdered his parents, Alice and Tony Balcer, and then slaughtered the family's chihuahua because it kept barking.

In a 911 call played in court, Balcer confessed to the murders, saying, ""I snapped. I took my little Ka-Bar [U.S. Marine Corps combat knife] there and I drove it straight into my mother’s back.""

Balcer later told Maine State Police detectives that he had stabbed his mother when she came over to give him a comforting hug.

The murderer noted at the time of the 911 call — which was punctuated by his apparent laughter — that his mother's corpse was lying on the floor, ""messy.""

""My father came up because he heard her screams and I stabbed the f*** out of him,"" said Balcer. ""I stabbed the dog too. She was barking.""



Alice Balcer was reportedly stabbed nine times and Tony Balcer was stabbed 13 times.

The murderer reportedly asked his brother Christopher Balcer if he wanted to die, but ultimately permitted him to escape unmolested.

Judge Eric Walker said, ""The only possible motive for the murders appears to be Andrew’s perception that his parents were unwilling or unable to deal with his transgender issues. We will never know if Antonio or Alice Balcer would have been accepting, because they were ambushed and murdered by Andrew.""

Contrary to the murderer's claims, Alice Balcer's brother Carl Pierce said, ""There was no hatred. There was no malice. There was no ill will. There was resignation to be sure but ultimately there was acceptance.""

The murderer's brother Christopher Balcer similarly suggested that the victims had been accepting of their killer's identity, reported the Sun Journal.



Christopher Balcer also suggested that the murderer's claims of abuse at the hands of his parents were similarly lies, calling the allegations ""the most absurd I've ever heard in my life.""

Christopher shared a letter he sent to his brother in jail with the Kennebec Journal, in which he wrote, ""I still hear our dearest mother’s screams, every night as I fall asleep. Every morning as I awaken, they echo in my head. Her screams as she was stabbed by the son she doted on so much, the son she only wanted the world for, and would accept nothing less.""

""I remember the foul things you accused her of, and the looks of horror upon the family’s faces as they heard about them. You are an inhuman creature and the fact that you continue to pretend otherwise sickens me,"" added Christopher.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/transsexual-admits-to-burning-down-118-year-old-christian-church-in-portland,2022-12-29
Louisiana trucker suing city over ordinance preventing him from flying flags with vulgar message against Biden and his supporters,"A Louisiana trucker is suing a town over its new ordinance preventing him from flying a flag displaying a vulgar insult against President Joe Biden and the people who support him.

Ross Brunet is demanding a court declaration that he was engaging in free speech when flying his flags. He is also seeking an unspecified amount of damages from the city of Grand Isle, a town on the barrier reef in the Gulf of Mexico.

Brunet works at the city as a contractor for Cut Off.

The trucker was cited by the city four times for flying the vulgar flags, but he defended himself successfully in court. He was then cited three more times by the city, which later dropped those citations.

The town nevertheless adopted a decree against signs on vehicles containing ""language deemed offensive and vulgar [or] obscene in nature and [that] contain language that describes a sex act.”

Brunet filed a federal lawsuit alleging that the city was infringing on his freedom of speech.

“Mr. Brunet’s speech has in fact been chilled,"" read the lawsuit. ""He is fearful of and refrains from engaging in his protected political speech in Grand Isle, out of fear of government punishment or further retaliatory action.”

Brunet is being represented by the Tulane First Amendment Law Clinic.

“Speech that is offensive, vulgar or that references a sex act is protected by the United States Constitution,” read the lawsuit. “Indeed, core political speech is often offensive to the listener, and yet is a highly protected form of speech.”

The lawsuit names as defendants the mayor of the town, the police chief, the town attorney, the police officer who issued the citations, and a Grand Isle magistrate judge.

The city would not comment on the lawsuit.

A similar case unfolded in a neighborhood in Roselle Park, New Jersey, in 2021 when a woman refused to take down her expletive-filled anti-Biden flags despite objections from her neighbors.

""I'm not giving up. I don't care what it costs me, I'm not giving up. I'm standing my ground,"" said Andrea Dick about her flags.

Here's more about vulgar, anti-Biden free speech:

Trump suggests jailing reporters if they won't reveal source,"Former President Donald Trump is calling for the journalists who were involved in publishing a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion last year to be jailed if they decline to divulge the identity of their source.

The Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization draft opinion published by Politico in May 2022 revealed that the high court appeared poised to overturn Roe v. Wade — the court did just that with its official opinion in June 2022.

The Supreme Court Marshal's report about the investigation into the leak noted that the probe had failed to uncover the culprit.

Trump, who announced last year that he is running for president again, said the reporter who broke the news about the leaked draft opinion should be thrown in jail if they refuse to disclose the identity of the leaker. Politico's Josh Gerstein and Alexander Ward authored the piece last year about the leaked draft opinion. Trump also suggested imprisoning the editor and publisher as well if they do not identify the source.

""They'll never find out, & it's important that they do. So, go to the reporter & ask him/her who it was. If not given the answer, put whoever in jail until the answer is given. You might add the publisher and editor to the list. Stop playing games, this leaking cannot be allowed to happen. It won't take long before the name of this slime is revealed!"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. ""Arrest the reporter, publisher, editor - you’ll get your answer fast. Stop playing games and wasting time!"" he wrote in another post.

The questions surrounding the leak remain a mystery — the investigation did not produce the identity of the leaker or determine how Politico obtained the draft.

""At this time, based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, it is not possible to determine the identity of any individual who may have disclosed the document or how the draft opinion ended up with Politico,"" the Supreme Court Marshal's report read.

""No one confessed to publicly disclosing the document and none of the available forensic and other evidence provided a basis for identifying any individual as the source of the document. While investigators and the Court’s IT experts cannot absolutely rule out a hack, the evidence to date reveals no suggestion of improper outside access. Investigators also cannot eliminate the possibility that the draft opinion was inadvertently or negligently disclosed – for example, by being left in a public space either inside or outside the building,"" the report stated.

Trump reportedly is texting after longtime 'resistance' to it. NYT says his associates are worried over what might pop up on screen from former president.,"Former President Donald Trump has finally started texting, the New York Times reported, citing three people with knowledge of his newfound pursuit.

Trump's texts recently have hit the phones of ""surprised recipients,"" the Times said, according to the sources.

The reason why it's all so head-turning is that Trump to this point has consistently refused to communicate by text or email, the paper said.

Trump's disciplined avoidance of texting in particular apparently had been a maddening habit in the minds of those looking to bring him down.

More from the Times:

The former president’s resistance to texting frustrated investigators for the House Jan. 6 committee as they tried to track his thoughts and actions when he worked to overturn the 2020 election. In his testimony before the committee, the former president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said he texted the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, during the Capitol attack because his father “doesn’t text.”

The paper said there was a shift around the start of 2023, when ""friends, confidants, and even people not especially close to Donald Trump began receiving text messages from his cellphone, most of them described as innocuous, such as new year greetings or political observations. A spokesperson for Trump declined to comment.""

Not that Trump never used his phone, of course — far from it. But the Times said he had been willing only to speak on his phone and send tweets from it. The paper added a rather humorous aside, noting that ""the former aide who helped set up his Twitter account once told Politico that when Trump, who initially relied on aides to write his posts, began to tweet on his own, it was akin to the scene in the film 'Jurassic Park' when the velociraptors learned to open doors.""

Worries

The Times reported that a text-savvy Trump ""has caused alarm among some of his associates, who are concerned about what he might say.""

It's quite a shift, apparently, as the paper noted that individuals who have worked for Trump in the White House and elsewhere said he believed he was “smart” for ""leaving almost no documentation of his communications and discussions in meetings.""

The Times noted an occasion during which he actually took possession of physical notes created by someone during a meeting — and Trump reportedly ripped the likes of John Bolton, his former national security adviser, for taking notes during meetings.

Legal scholar posts viral rebuttal to Jean-Pierre's claim that Biden is being 'transparent' about classified docs,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre repeatedly claimed last week the Biden administration has been ""transparent"" about several discoveries of classified documents that President Joe Biden improperly retained.

But according to George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley, the only thing Jean-Pierre has been ""transparent"" about is a refusal ""to answer questions.""

What did Turley say?

The constitutional scholar published a viral Twitter thread on Friday about the Biden administration's secrecy.

""It is increasingly painful to watch Karine Jean-Pierre as she argues that they have been 'transparent' by being transparently unwilling to answer any questions,"" Turley wrote.



""Nothing prevents the White House from answering basic questions about the scandal,"" he explained. ""It will not undermine the Justice Department for the White House to confirm the President's position and recollection. The silence protects the President not the investigation.""

According to Turley, the reaction of the Biden administration — refusing to answer basic questions about the discoveries of classified documents"" — only serves to protect Biden, not inform the American people.



""The White House has already stated that the documents were inadvertently removed but refuses to answer questions on the basis or meaning of that defense,"" Turley said.

""I can understand the desire of a criminal defense attorney for Biden to remain silent,"" he added. ""However, the refusal to answer basic questions is not to protect the 'independence of the Justice Department' or the investigation. It [sic] meant to protect the President as an individual.""



What about KJP?

NBC News reported on Friday that Democratic strategists believe the Biden adminstration ""should consider is naming a dedicated person to field questions about the documents"" to take heat off of Jean-Pierre.

""The White House should consider appointing a separate spokesperson to handle all questions related to this matter,"" one Democratic strategist, Karen Finney, who served in the Clinton administration, told NBC. ""If someone else is handling questions related to that matter, you still have a press briefing where you’re able to communicate the issues of the day that you’re trying to get out.""

Twitter sues Elon Musk to force $44 billion deal,"The popular social media company Twitter filed a lawsuit against entrepreneur Elon Musk to force him to follow through on the $44 billion deal he agreed to in April to acquire the platform.

Twitter filed the lawsuit on Tuesday.

Musk indicated in a letter on Friday that he was withdrawing from the massive deal to buy Twitter over the number of fake accounts on the platform.

""Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information,"" the letter read. ""Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk's requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information.""

The company has estimated that about 5% of the users on the platform are fake or bots, but Musk claimed in June that as many as 20% or more of the users aren't real.

In the lawsuit against Musk, lawyers for the platform accuse him of breach of contract.

""Musk apparently believes that he — unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law — is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away,"" the complaint reads.

""Since signing the merger agreement, Musk has repeatedly disparaged Twitter and the deal, creating business risk for Twitter and downward pressure on its share price,"" the company added.

Musk had reportedly agreed to pay Twitter $1 billion if he pulled out of the deal.

After he said he was pulling out of the deal, Musk tweeted a meme implying that Twitter would be forced to reveal how many users were fake during the discovery phase of the trial. That tweet quickly went viral.

The billionaire appeared to comment about the development in a simple tweet Tuesday.

""Oh the irony lol,"" he tweeted.

Cybersecurity attorney Leeza Garber told Neil Cavuto on his Fox News show that the only people who will win are the lawyers through their billable hours. Garber also said that it is very unlikely that the court will force Musk to follow through on the multi-billion dollar deal.

Twitter temporarily suspends Libs of TikTok again,"Twitter has slapped the Libs of TikTok account with another temporary suspension, and Libs of TikTok is warning again that it will pursue legal action if the social media company ever permanently suspends the account.

""Twitter has once again hit Libs of TikTok with a 7-day suspension for 'hateful conduct.' No specific tweets were flagged. We've since fired off another letter to Twitter (attached). They're on notice that we will sue them if they permanently suspend us,"" Seth Dillon tweeted on Wednesday.

""Twitter claims I have violated their 'hateful conduct policy,' but like my last suspension, they have provided no explanation as to how I violated this policy,"" Libs of TikTok noted in a Substack post.

Chaya Raichik is the woman behind the Libs of TikTok account, which shares videos and other content to expose the actions and musings of the radical left, such as content related to radical leftist gender ideology.

""As you know, we represent journalist Chaya Raichik who reports under the name Libs of TikTok. This past Sunday, Twitter again wrongfully suspended our client's Twitter account for another seven days. We are writing Twitter once again to request that your company reinstate the @LibsofTikTok account,"" James R. Lawrence, III of Envisage Law wrote a September 27 letter to Vijaya Gadde of Twitter. ""In this latest suspension, as with the last, Twitter did not specify the content your company deemed to violate its hateful conduct policy.""

""If Twitter refuses to live up to its own words and aspirations, and permanently bans our client's account, LOTT will have no choice but to ask a court to order Twitter to live up to its own statements,"" the letter declared.

That letter follows a September 1 letter that also warned of legal action in the event that Twitter moves to permanently suspend the Libs of TikTok account.

""We write regarding Twitter's suspension of our client's Twitter account for alleged violations of your company's hateful conduct policy. We understand that the suspension is set to lapse on September 3. Nevertheless, we demand that Twitter immediately reinstate the account, which your company should have never suspended in the first place,"" the September 1 letter declared. ""LOTT is not interested in litigating against Twitter, but rather in doing journalism. That said, if Twitter follows through on its threat to permanently suspend our client’s account, LOTT will have no choice but to sue Twitter. In addition to suing for breach of contract, our client would bring claims under California state law and the California Constitution.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/twitter-sues-elon-musk-deal,2022-09-29
Former UFC fighter Phil Baroni accused of murder of girlfriend in Mexico,"Former UFC fighter Phil Baroni allegedly beat his girlfriend to death in Mexico after she admitted to cheating on him, according to reports.

A woman was reportedly found dead in a Mexico hotel room on New Year's Day after Baroni informed police that his girlfriend was unresponsive. Mexican news outlet Tribuna de la Bahía reported that the woman was naked and had multiple bruises on her face and body. She reportedly had ""no vital signs.""

Baroni reportedly told Mexican authorities that he engaged in a fight with his girlfriend after she confessed to cheating on him with another man. During the argument at a hotel room in San Pancho, the New York native ordered the woman identified only as ""Paola"" to take a bath. The girlfriend refused, so Baroni allegedly threw the woman into the shower. Baroni reportedly told law enforcement that he had been smoking marijuana and drinking beer before the incident.

The Tribuna de la Bahía reported that the woman from Mexico City hit her head after she fell into the bathtub.

Baroni claimed that his girlfriend recovered from the alleged domestic violence confrontation. Baroni allegedly said he helped the woman into bed and put a sheet on her after the woman said she was cold. She later asked the former mixed martial arts fighter to buy her cigarettes and beer. The former UFC fighter allegedly said that when he returned from the store, Paola was unresponsive.

Mexican law enforcement launched an investigation into the woman's death.

Baroni was arrested in Mexico, the prosecutors' office in the Pacific coast state of Nayarit said on Wednesday. Baroni is being held in custody in Valle de Banderas.

The first hearing on the woman's death will begin on Monday.

Baroni – nicknamed the ""New York Bad Ass"" – has been a professional MMA competitor since 2000.

Baroni started fighting in the UFC in 2001, retired in 2011, and had a record of 13-13. The MMA fighter also competed in Pride, Strikeforce, Bellator, and One Championship. Baroni was knocked out during a World Bare Knuckle Fighting Federation bout in 2018. Baroni's final fight happened in 2019 in China during the Rebel Fighting Championship. Overall in his professional MMA career, Baroni had a record of 16-19.

This is the second violent incident for the UFC in Mexico this week.

Video was released this week of UFC president Dana White getting into a physical altercation. The couple, married for 26 years, was celebrating New Year's Eve in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. White was caught on video slapping his wife after she hit him first.

White apologized for his actions and said he was ""embarrassed.""

The decision not to grant either a ceasefire or concessions to end Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine came as Russian forces intensified their attack in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, and the Russian government decided to stop exports of gas to Finland, the New York Post reported.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, “The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult.” He made clear to his constituents that while the Russian army is trying to take the cities of Sloviansk and Sievierodonetsk, Ukrainian forces will dig in and work to hold off the Russian advance.

Russian forces were able to outlast the weekslong resistance by Ukrainian fighters in the southeastern city of Mariupol. Whoever controls Mariupol has strategic access to crucial waterways.

With full control of Mariupol, Russia will also have command of land routes linking the Crimean Peninsula with mainland Russia and other areas of eastern Ukraine that are of interest to the Russian government.

Russian forces are now waging a major offensive in Luhansk in the Donbas region. Russian-backed separatists already controlled large swathes of territory in Luhansk and the neighboring Donetsk. Reportedly, the Russian government wants to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-controlled territories in Donbas and forcibly annex the region.

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, ruled out the possibility of Ukrainian officials agreeing to a ceasefire with Russia and said that the Ukrainian government would not accept any deal with Russia that involves the transfer of territory. Podolyak theorized that making any concessions to Russia would result in Russia renewing attacks on Ukraine shortly after the fighting breaks.

In a recent interview, Podolyak said, “The war will not stop (after concessions). It will just be put on pause for some time. They’ll start a new offensive, even more bloody and large-scale.”

Podolyak’s statements contradict calls for a ceasefire made by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.

Heightening tensions with Western nations, Russia’s state-owned gas company said it would be halting all gas exports to Finland in response to the Finns refusing to pay for Russian oil with rubles.

Last Wednesday, Finland and Sweden applied for membership in the NATO military alliance which will likely exacerbate Russian frustrations.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ufc-fighter-phil-baroni-murder-mexico,2022-05-22
Trump and Republicans react to Biden's ultra-MAGA insult concocted by research,"Last October, an NBC Sports reporter attempted to go into damage control when a crowd was chanting ""F*** Joe Biden"" at a NASCAR race. The reporter claimed that the crowd was showing support for the winning driver, Brandon Brown, by shouting, ""Let's go Brandon!""



The phrase ""Let's go Brandon"" instantly became a rallying call for detractors of President Joe Biden. ""Let's go Brandon"" has been chanted at sporting events, heard in rap songs, and seen on license plates, restaurant signs, shirts, flags, luggage, face masks, and even golf balls.

Democrats may have undertaken an extensive quest to discover their own version of the ""Let's go Brandon"" slogan.

The Washington Post reported this week that Democrats have spent six months attempting to develop a catchphrase to try to hurt Republicans heading into the 2022 midterm elections. The final result from the six months of research is ""ultra-MAGA.""

The ""ultra-MAGA"" term was the strategy developed by the liberal group Center for American Progress Action Fund – which is headed by top Biden aide Anita Dunn.

Polling and focus group testing done by the Hart Research and the Global Strategy Group indicated that potential voters saw the term ""MAGA"" more negatively than other labels such as ""Trump Republicans.""

""In battleground areas, more than twice as many voters said they would be less likely to vote for someone called a 'MAGA Republican' than would be more likely,"" the Washington Post reported. ""The research also found that the description tapped into the broad agreement among voters that the Republican Party had become more extreme and power-hungry in recent years.""

Navin Nayak – the president and executive director of CAP Action Fund – told the Washington Post that ""ultra-MAGA"" is a ""versatile epithet"" because ""all of that extremism gets captured in that brand.""

""We are not trying to create a new word,"" Nayak added. ""This is how they define themselves.""

President Joe Biden first employed the phrase on May 4, while speaking to reporters about deficit reduction at the White House. Biden said ""ultra-MAGA"" and ""MAGA"" on 10 different occasions – mostly used in an attack on Sen. Rick Scott's (R-Fla.) ""Rescue America"" plan.

""This MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history, in recent American history,"" Biden told reporters.

While giving a statement on the economy on Tuesday, Biden used ""ultra-MAGA"" or ""MAGA"" five more times in reference to the popular campaign slogan of former President Donald Trump.

During a fundraising event in Chicago on Wednesday, President Biden uttered the focus group-approved lingo three more times.

""But we have to take on the — MAGA Republicans — 'Make America Great Again' Republicans. I think they’re the most extreme party,"" Biden said at the Democratic National Committee fundraiser. ""And that’s what the Republican Party is now. Not everybody Republican believes that. But the fact of the matter is, they run the show — the MAGA Republicans.""

Also on Wednesday, President Biden addressed the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers 40th Annual Conference – where he recited the phrase five more times. Biden even called Trump ""the great MAGA king.""

""Under my predecessor, the great MAGA king, the deficit increased every single year he was president,"" Biden said of Trump. ""The first year of my presidency — the first year, I reduced the deficit — literally reduced the deficit by $350 billion.""

Ashley Parker – who wrote the Washington Post piece – noted, ""Trump 'absolutely loved' co-opting Biden’s new nickname for him — 'the great MAGA king' — and has privately mocked Biden and Democrats’ 'ultra MAGA' taunt as coming from bad branders, who don’t understand the art of marketing.""

Trump reacted to being called the ""great MAGA king"" by sharing a meme of him photoshopped on the cover of a ""Lord of the Rings"" movie on his Truth Social platform.

Trump also thanked Biden for the compliment, “The Great MAGA King is the name Joe Biden is now using to describe me. Thank you, Joe. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) also embraced the supposed barb, and declared, ""I am ultra MAGA, and I'm proud of it.""

Meanwhile, other Republicans are capitalizing on the Democrats trying to make the ""MAGA"" phrase great again.

The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) is giving away 1,000 ""ultra-MAGA"" t-shirts away.

Trump's Save America Joint Fundraising Committee is offering ""ultra-MAGA"" t-shirts in exchange for a $45 contribution.

The Washington Post report that the phrase was developed by focus groups seems to contradict a claim by former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki.

On Tuesday, Psaki claimed that ""ultra-MAGA"" was ""the president's phrase and the president made those comments himself."" Psaki said that President Biden added ""ultra"" to give ""MAGA"" a ""little extra pop.""



""But I can tell whether it’s tomorrow or in days and weeks ahead, you will all continue to hear him talk more about his concern about ultra-MAGA Republicans and their agenda,"" Psaki told reporters.

Other Democrat leaders have also adopted the ""MAGA"" messaging at the same time President Biden did.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) used the phrase ""MAGA Republicans"" on Tuesday, ""For MAGA Republicans, this has never been about states’ rights. It has always been about getting rid of abortion altogether. Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act to protect abortion rights. We will see where every single senator stands.""

Democratic Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said on Thursday, ""The single most patriotic thing a person can do is fight for their rights. You better believe I’m going to fight for women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights and every other freedom the MAGA crowd or Supreme Court is trying to take away.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ukrainian-leaders-rule-out-a-ceasefire-and-will-not-cede-territory-to-russia-to-end-fighting,2022-05-14
"Woke employee refuses to do his job while 'in mourning' over Roe v. Wade reversal, blasts his employer — and bitterly complains after getting fired","A now-former employee of a major record label admitted to refusing to do his job since he was ""in mourning"" over the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade reversal, which came down June 24.

Michael Lopez also ripped his employer — Universal Music Group — for allegedly supporting ""anti-abortion"" politicians.

Lopez added in a LinkedIn post — which was deleted Tuesday morning — that he soon was fired. In the post he also bemoaned that a ""queer brown person"" got canned ""during Pride month for speaking up in defense of abortion rights.""

Say what?

When Roe v. Wade was overturned, Lopez said he was ""devastated by the news of the Supreme Court's attack on abortion rights.""

""Paired with the flood of anti-queer and anti-trans legislation, it's been hard to process how [companies] expect us to be productive while our rights are being stripped away,"" he added.

Lopez explained in his LinkedIn post that on Fridays one of his tasks for UMG is to ""process reports for upcoming releases,"" which is done in an email to 275 people. But Lopez said he sent the following email instead:

Subject line: UMe Schedules

Message:



I didn't do them today.



I'm in mourning due to the attack on people with uteruses in the US. Federally guaranteed access to abortion is gone.



Vivendi and Universal Music Group must stop donating to anti-abortion, anti-queer and anti-trans politicians. Politicians like Marsha Blackburn, Ken Buck, Victoria Spartz, etc. Or expect more unproductive days.



Yours in fury,

Michael Lopez

What happened next?

Lopez added in his post that he received ""several supportive emails from other co-workers and a manager calling to tell me to take the rest of the day off."" He also said he was ""proud of letting allies know that our company has been donating to these politicians.""

But the positivity didn't last.

Lopez said he got fired in the wake of his email and added a paraphrased reason from the powers that be: ""Not doing your job, disrupting the day of 275 people, and poor judgement.""

Figuring he'd soon be locked out of his computer, Lopez said he sent a follow-up mass email:

Hey ya’ll,



Just got fired for this email from Friday, so they’re letting you know where they stand on employees speaking out on politicians that support marginalization for folks like me.



A brown queer person terminated during Pride month speaking in support of abortion rights. Seems like that’s exactly what America is all about right now.



Peace out,

Michael Lopez

What did Universal Music Group have to say?

UMG told the New York Post that Lopez's claims aren't true: ""As a matter of policy, we can’t discuss an individual’s personnel record. We can say that what was posted on social media is inaccurate.”

The music label added to the paper that it ""has a long record of support for women’s issues"" and that after the SCOTUS abortion reversal, it ""extended its efforts to assure that these important healthcare services remain accessible to employees."" UMG noted to the Post that ""we also financially support non-profit groups working in this area and offer a match for employee’s contributions to those groups, as well.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/ultra-maga-democrats-research-republicans-trump,2022-07-05
"UC Berkeley student law groups rally behind anti-Semitic cause, prohibit 'Zionist' speakers","Student groups at UC Berkeley School of Law have recently amended their bylaws to ""sanction"" and prohibit speakers supportive of Israel or Zionism. The Jewish Journal reports that this would amount to a ban on 90% of Jewish students speaking, as well as Berkeley Law's progressive Zionist dean, Erwin Chemerinsky.

According to the group promoting this segregation, ""Free speech and the exchange of ideas cannot be romanticized ... The action of affinity groups ... choosing not to platform Zionists, who are either active or complicit in causing harm to Palestinians, from being platformed in their spaces is absolutely a tenable action.""

The nine groups supportive of the amendments include the Queer Caucus, the Berkeley Law Muslim Student Association, the Middle Eastern and North African Law Students Association, Women of Berkeley Law, and the ""Womxn of Color Collective.""'



Anti-Semitism's promotion on campus

In a August 21 Instagram post, Berkeley Law Students for Justice in Palestine (BLSJP) thanked these groups and others for ""refusing to be complicit in Israeli apartheid by adopting a pro-BDS bylaw.""

Each group that embraced the so-called pro-BDS bylaw is henceforth ""committed to providing a supportive community space for all indigenous peoples globally, including movements for Palestinian liberation.""

These groups have bound themselves to boycott, sanction, and divest funds ""from institutions, organizations, companies, and any entity that participated in or is directly/indirectly complicit in the occupation of the Palestinian territories and/or supports the actions of the apartheid state of Israel.""

Explicit in this commitment is the promise not to ""invite speakers that have expressed and continued to hold views or host/sponsor/promote events in support of Zionism, the apartheid state of Israel, and the occupation of Palestine.""

Despite requiring these student groups to prohibit speakers who have an affinity for or link to Israel, the BLSJP emphasized its commitment to ""equality and inclusion.""

The law students now barring most Jews from speaking also agreed to participate in a ""Palestine 101"" training seminar. The seminar, which last took place on September 21, details ""the goals of the Palestinian liberation movement, and ways the broader Berkeley Law community can be involved.""

The group putting on the seminar has elsewhere claimed that Israel ""was established — just like the United States — through the genocide and displacement of indigenous people.""

The response

In an August 27 statement, the Jewish Students Association at the school expressed concern over ""the impact this by-law is having on our Jewish community ... This by-law alienates many Jewish students from certain groups on campus.""

The group suggested that students ""can advocate for Palestinians and criticize Israeli policies without denying Israel the right to exist or attacking the identity of other students. To say otherwise is antithetical to the dialogue around which our educational community is built.""

Noting that many Jewish students' ""identities are intertwined with the existence of Israel as an ancestral homeland,"" this bylaw amounts to denigration and exclusion.

The dean of the law school, Erwin Chemerinsky, was reportedly prompted to comment when members of Women of Berkeley Law came to him, expressing great uneasiness. He said that it is ""the First Amendment right of students to express their views on any issues,"" although it ""is troubling to broadly exclude a particular viewpoint from being expressed.""

Kenneth Marcus, a Berkeley Law alumnus and chairman of the Louis D. Brendeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, wrote on September 28 that the students ""should be ashamed of themselves ... [a]s should grownups who stand quietly by or mutter meekly about free speech as university spaces go as the Nazis' infamous call, judenfrei. Jewish-free.""

Marcus previously said that, unlike previous ""wrongheaded political nonsense,"" this latest student initiative ""is different, because it's not just a political stunt. It is tinged with antisemitism and anti-Israel national origin discrimination.""

The trend

The University of California is not the only academic hotbed for anti-Semitism in the nation.

A recent watchdog group's report regarding anti-Semitism on U.S. college and university campuses gave Columbia University, New York University, Swathmore College, CUNY's Brooklyn College, and the University of Southern California failing grades. Berkeley also received an F-rating. These ratings were conferred on the basis of protection, ""allyship,"" identity, and policy measures.

The problem is not limited to students or student groups, although it has been suggested that anti-Semitism will graduate with them. The New York Post reported that this year's commencement speaker at the taxpayer-funded CUNY's Brooklyn College was Nerdeen Mohsen Kiswani, an advocate for ""Intifada revolution"" and the complete eradication of Israel.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/umg-employee-fired-abortion-lgbtq,2022-09-30
Unruly restaurant patron takes Taser from off-duty cop working security — and shoots cop with it. But troublemaker runs out of luck when officer pulls his gun.,"An unruly Texas restaurant customer took a Taser from an off-duty cop who was working security at the establishment and then shot the officer with the Taser. But the cop still had a gun on him and shot the man in question.

What are the details?

The 29-year-old officer from Somerset was working a security job Saturday night at a Twin Peaks restaurant in San Antonio when a man and his friends were behaving in a belligerent manner and appeared to be intoxicated just before midnight, police told MySanAntonio.com.

Restaurant staff asked the man to leave, KHOU-TV reported, adding that when he refused, management asked the off-duty officer to remove the customer from the premises.

Police told MySanAntonio the man got angry while the off-duty cop was moving him to the parking lot; KHOU said the man began to resist the officer. Soon the man took the officer's Taser before sprinting away, MySanAntonio said.

Following a short pursuit, the man pointed the Taser at the officer and shot the officer with it, the outlet said.

With that, the officer grabbed his own gun and shot the man in the chest, the outlet added.

What happened next?

Emergency medical services were called to the scene and took the 34-year-old man to a hospital where he was in critical condition, San Antonio police told the outlet, adding that the off-duty officer was taken to a hospital as a precaution.

Officers continued to secure the area after the incident and located witnesses, MySanAntonio said.

The night criminal investigation department also was notified about the incident and began an investigation while the crime scene investigators processed the scene, the outlet added.

San Antonio police said the department's Shooting Team will lead the investigation, MySanAntonio reported.

Unvaccinated blood matchmaking service developing global network,"A Swiss nonprofit is building a vast network of unvaccinated individuals with the short-term goal of connecting blood recipients with unvaccinated blood donors across the world. Should its membership hit critical mass, Safe Blood Donation hopes to create an mRNA vaccine-free blood bank.

Blood pressure

""Horrified"" by the vaccinated blood he has allegedly studied and convinced that ""the whole vaccination thing"" is mainly about ""controlling people,"" Swiss naturopath George Della Dietra seeks to provide people with a choice about the kind of blood that flows through their veins.



Dietra told Vice News, ""We want to be a platform for people who want to have the free choice of blood donors. ... Whether they think there is a real conspiracy theory going on, that the New World Order [is happening], or if they simply say ‘I just don't want it’ for whatever reason.”

This may be a tall order, especially since Dietra's organization would not bar vaccinated persons from becoming members. After all, there is presently limited supply.

According to the New York Times, roughly 71.1% of the world population has received a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

Dr. Michael Busch of the Vitalant Research Institute indicated that ""less than 10 percent of the blood we collect does not have antibodies.""

A September 2021 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 83.3% of donated blood had combined infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies.

The supermajority of prospective donors consequently have blood affected for good or ill by the controversial vaccines or by prior COVID-19 infection.

Newsweek reported last summer that some patients who had successfully forgone receiving a COVID-19 vaccine demanded blood transfusions only from unvaccinated donors.

A New Zealand couple may reportedly lose custody of their 4-month-old son on account of their insistence that he receive blood from unvaccinated people ahead of his lifesaving heart surgery.

Like the boy's parents, patients presently do not have a choice when it comes to vaccinated or unvaccinated blood.

Dr. Louis Katz, chief medical officer for ImpactLife, told Kaiser Health News that as of August 2021, he knew of ""no one who has acceded to such a request, which would be an operational can of worms for a medically unjustifiable request.""



Even if this ""can of worms"" were opened, the choice of blood would presently be uninformed since blood centers do not keep data regarding donors' vaccination status and are not required to by the Food and Drug Administration.

Safe Blood Donation's apparent answer to this problem is its searchable database of anonymous, unvaccinated members. Members can also search by region.

The organization claimed that as ""soon as we have enough medical partners (for application, collection and processing of the blood), we will start with the mediation.""

Far from functional

In its FAQ, Safe Blood Donation noted that it is far from realizing its goal of becoming a blood bank and will first need to acquire 100,000 more members so that ""the politicians and lobbyists can no longer avoid taking us seriously.""

In the meantime, the organization has advice for those who would like avoid vaccinated blood.

The nonprofit advises members to stipulate in their wills that they are against receiving canned blood, but also recommends against mentioning vaccination, noting that ""it is actually not advisable to come out as an opponent of vaccination, because then you are immediately 'the enemy', and no one is interested in helping you.""

""Write further that you indicate a relative (if you have one) as a potential blood donor who can be contacted immediately (or who is present in person at a scheduled surgery) who has the same blood type. If you do not have a relative, write to us immediately when the hospital gives the green light to your plan – then we will find one,"" said the FAQ.

Kaiser Health News noted that persons requiring transfusions can also donate their own blood ahead of time.

While it appears as though Safe Blood Donation intends to work covertly in the interim, it anticipates members might one day be able to produce their membership cards with instructions concerning blood type and have their requests respected.

Vice reported that the nonprofit already has members in at least 16 countries, although Safe Blood Donation's website suggests it has members in over 60 countries worldwide, with at least 25 pumping blood in the U.S..

The initial joining fee is around $50 and approximately $20 per year thereafter.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/unruly-restaurant-patron-takes-taser-from-off-duty-cop-working-security-and-shoots-cop-it-but-troublemaker-runs-out-of-luck-when-officer-pulls-his-gun,2022-12-05
"US Circuit judge denounces 'cancel culture,' vows not to hire Yale law clerks: 'Yale not only tolerates the cancellation of views — it actively practices it'","A federal appeals judge has decided to take action against so-called ""cancel culture"" by denying clerkships to those educated by a place he considers to be a major cancel culture supply line: Yale Law School.

Judge James C. Ho of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, recently spoke to the Kentucky Chapters Conference of the Federalist Society and openly castigated the intolerant practices promulgated by Yale Law and its graduates.

""Yale not only tolerates the cancellation of views — it actively practices it,"" he said.

To illustrate his point, Ho cited several recent examples that have affected the legal community. Back in late January, a would-be Georgetown Law senior lecturer, Ilya Shapiro, was placed on administrative leave after he tweeted criticism of President Joe Biden for selecting a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court based on the immutable characteristics of race and sex. Ketanji Brown Jackson, a black woman, was sworn in to the Court last week, but Shapiro ultimately resigned his position at Georgetown back in June because he said that he could not abide a ""place that excludes dissenting voices."" Shapiro did not work one official day on the job.

For more evidence of the intolerance propagated at Yale Law, Ho also pointed to an event held at Yale itself. Back in March, more than 100 Yale Law students loudly disrupted a free speech presentation headlined by Kristen Waggoner of the Alliance Defending Freedom and Monica Miller of the American Humanist Association. The activist students caused such a disturbance that nearby classes complained, and police had to escort the speakers safely out of the building and into a police vehicle after it was over.

Ellen Cosgrove, an associate dean at Yale Law, attended the entire event, Ho noted, but ""did nothing"" to punish the petulant protestors for their behavior.

""It turns out that, when elite law schools like Yale teach their students that there are no consequences to their intolerance and illiberalism,"" Ho said, ""the message sticks with them.""

However, in addition to referencing numerous examples of intolerant bullying perpetrated by Yale Law students, Ho also suggested that judges have in their control one possible solution to the problem: Refuse to hire these same students as law clerks.

""We’re not just citizens,"" Ho reminded his audience. ""We’re also customers. Customers can boycott entities that practice cancel culture. ... I wonder how a law school would feel, if my fellow federal judges and I stopped being its customers.""

He added that his intention is not to participate in cancel culture per se, but to give cancel culture participants a taste of their own medicine.

""I don't want to cancel Yale,"" Ho insisted. ""I want Yale to stop canceling people like me.""

Even a Mother Jones writer agreed with the premise of Ho's new policy, if not with Ho's reasons. ""The highest levels of the federal judiciary have for too long been dominated by graduates of the same handful of select law schools,"" wrote senior reporter Tim Murphy, ""and it’d be a mistake to say we’re better for it.""

Former President Donald Trump nominated Ho, who graduated from the University of Chicago School of Law, to the federal bench in 2018. According to Reuters, Yale declined to comment on this story.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/unvaccinated-blood-matchmaking-service-developing-global-network,2022-10-03
US Supreme Court declines to take up case concerning the personhood of unborn babies,"On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to rule on whether babies in the womb are people and therefore entitled to constitutional rights and protections in the wake of the June Dobbs ruling, which overturned Roe v. Wade. The appeal that the court declined to hear was in response to a lower court's May 4 ruling, which found that unborn babies did not constitute ""persons"" who could bring legal claims.

A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Diane Messere Magee, wrote on Tuesday, ""While we are extremely disappointed with this outcome, we are confident that #SCOTUS will eventually have to answer the question in the future.""

Steven Brown the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island said the court's declination ""could not be more timely. It ensures that, no matter what the US Supreme Court does, abortion will remain safe and accessible in this state ... The ACLU will continue to fight for the protection and expansion of this fundamental right.""

Rhode Island denies babies' personhood

A pro-life organization, Catholics for Life, along with several individuals including Michael Benson and Nichole Leigh Rowley, filed a lawsuit challenging Rhode Island's 2019 so-called Reproductive Privacy Act, which enshrined expansive abortion measures into state law.

Former Democrat Gov. Gina Raimondo signed the bill into law, which went into effect despite an attempt by Catholics for Life to block its passage by way of a temporary restraining order.

This case, heard by the Rhode Island Supreme Court, was originally kicked up from the state's superior court, which had dismissed the plaintiffs' lawsuit filed in June 2019.

The plaintiffs argued that they should have an opportunity to vote against the law in a state referendum. Two of those advancing the lawsuit did so on behalf of their unborn babies, who they claim were unjustly bereaved of their legal rights.

Rhode Island's Supreme Court issued its decision one month before Roe v. Wade was overturned. It heavily relied upon Roe, writing, ""The United States Supreme court in Roe held that the word 'person,' as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn.""

The court determined that ""the unborn plaintiffs fail to assert a legally cognizable and protected interest as persons.""

Since the court did not recognize the babies as persons who could bring legal claims, and argued that ""Baby Doe and Baby Mary Roe have been born since initiation of this action,"" it found no harm had been done.

Appeal to a higher power

Diane Messere Magee, a lawyer who acted on behalf of the plaintiffs, indicated that, owing to the lower court's heavy reliance upon Roe and Roe's subsequent overturning, ""Baby Mary Doe and Baby Roe are appealing their case, challenging RI's so-called Reproductive Privacy Act, to the US Supreme Court.""

Citing Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the pro-life plaintiffs requested that the Rhode Island Supreme Court approve a writ of certiorari.

The petitioners said the supreme court ""should grant the writ to finally determine whether prenatal life, at any gestational age, enjoys constitutional protection - considering the full and comprehensive history and tradition of our constitution and law supporting personhood for unborn human beings.""

The petitioners argued that no state can answer the question; that not only is it ""solely for this Court to interpret and say what the Fourteenth Amendment means,"" but neither ""the principles of federalism nor the Tenth Amendment's reservations of powers give cover to avoidance of this paramount issue.""

Referencing the Rhode Island ruling, they claimed: ""In the absence of an explicit textual definition of the words 'any person' in the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court should grant the writ in order to establish its meaning and scope relative to abortion laws.""

The so called Productive Privacy Act, which was passed in Rhode Island's House of Representatives with a vote of 21-17, permits abortion any time and for whatever reason up until ""viability,"" and permits the killing of viable human beings ""when necessary to preserve the health or life of that individual.""

Viability is defined under the law as ""that stage of gestation where the attending physician, taking into account the particular facts of the case, has determined that there is a reasonable likelihood of the fetus' sustained survival outside of the womb with or without artificial support.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-circuit-judge-ho-yale-clerks,2022-10-12
"'Out here in West Texas, that's what we do': UTEP basketball coach drives stranded Pitt football players 9 hours on Christmas Day so they could make their bowl practice","The Christmas season has a way of bringing people together, even people who might see one another as rivals in other situations. Christmas Day 2022 was no different. That night in Dallas, the University of Texas-El Paso men's basketball coach rented an SUV large enough to transport himself, his family, and three complete strangers who desperately needed to get to El Paso.

On Sunday, Coach Joe Golding was just one of thousands of people at Dallas Love Field Airport whose flight had been canceled due to inclement weather. Golding, his wife, and their two kids walked over to the car rental area so that they could find a way home to El Paso. While there, Golding overheard three sizable young men wearing University of Pittsburgh apparel discussing a similar predicament. The three men turned out to be Pitt football players who needed to find a way to get to El Paso for a bowl game later this week.

""I see these three guys, and they have Pitt bags on, and they start talking about playing in the Sun Bowl and having to get to El Paso,"" Golding said on Monday.

Unfortunately, many folks were scrambling for the few remaining rental cars, so the chances that the three Pitt guys — redshirt freshman quarterback Jake Frantl, freshman defensive lineman Samuel Okunlola, and redshirt junior defensive back Hudson Primus — would find one in time were slim. So Golding decided instead to demonstrate true Southern hospitality to his forlorn brethren from Pennsylvania.

""Out here in West Texas, that's what we do,"" Golding stated. ""I didn't even really think twice about it.""

Golding walked up to the players and extended them an offer they couldn't refuse.

""I was like, 'Hey, if we can find a big enough car, I'll take you guys home,'"" Golding recalled.

It turned out that there was a Ford Explorer large enough to accommodate all seven passengers. So the players contacted their coaches and parents, explained the situation, and hastily agreed. The whole group then grabbed ""dinner"" at a local gas station, piled into the SUV, and hit the road sometime between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m.

The distance between Dallas and El Paso is over 630 miles and takes over nine hours to traverse in a car. But the unlikely companions found a way to pass the time well.

""I educated them on West Texas, they educated me on Pitt football and Stack’d burgers!"" Golding tweeted on Monday.

The group made just one stop — in Pecos, Texas — to reload on caffeine, and they all arrived in El Paso just a few minutes before 6 a.m. Monday morning, plenty of time for Frantl, Okunlola, and Primus to make their 9:00 a.m. meeting and 10:30 a.m. team workout.

""They even got a two-hour nap, I think,"" Golding joked.

Pitt head coach Pat Narduzzi made sure to thank Golding and his family publicly for rescuing his stranded players.

""Yesterday afternoon, we had a couple guys get delayed with their flights and got stuck in Dallas,"" Narduzzi mentioned on Monday. ""Joe Golding, head basketball coach for Texas-El Paso, him, his wife and child picked up and took our three guys, drove them 'cause the flight was delayed.

""They got here late last night, and I just wanna give a shoutout to those guys,"" Narduzzi added.

Frantl shared his appreciation for the Golding family publicly as well.

""Great man and awesome family! Will never forget this Christmas story,"" Frantl tweeted Monday evening.

'You don't believe in white supremacy?!' Conservative triggers progressives in Vice News Asian-American panel,"Vice News put together a panel of Asian-Americans to debate topics such as the ""model minority"" issue and ""Asian hate.""

The panel of nine consisted of Japanese, Indian, Hawaiian, and other ethnicities that the host describes as part of the ""Asian-American and Pacific Islanders group,"" or ""AAPI.""

""What does it mean to be Asian in America?"" the caption reads. ""From hate crimes to the model minority myth to affirmative action, a politically divisive panel hashes out the most controversial issues facing the AAPI community today.""

One of the panelists was Vince Dao, editor in chief of American Virtue, a conservative organization that says it stands for ""order, justice and liberty."" Dao, who says he is 75% Vietnamese, quickly faced scrutiny from some of the other panel members for his refusal to agree with progressive talking points surrounding Black Lives Matter or the threat of ""white supremacy.""

""Do you believe white supremacy exists?"" a female panel member named Ellen, who describes herself as Korean-American, asks Dao.

""I think there's people who believe in it. I think there's people who all believe that their race is superior,"" Dao responded.

Dao's disagreement that the leftist purview of white supremacy is the cause of all cultural and socio-economic issues immediately sparked an onslaught of progressive litmus test questions.

""So you don't believe in white supremacy,"" another woman asks. ""Do you believe America is a white supremacist state?"" another man asks.

""No, not at all,"" Dao responds. ""No white supremacist state would even allow us to be doing this,"" he continued.

The same man, named Ziad, who was the only panel member to mention pronouns upon introduction (he/him), then began inferring that the minorities that are seen in New York do not have the same general access to wealth that white Americans do.

""Are they making the same amount of money? Are they getting the same access to opportunity?""

Later the group discusses Black Lives Matter, with Dao pointing out that many Democrats ""literally bent the knee"" to BLM and George Floyd. The panel again immediately took issue with this viewpoint, spawning familiar questions such as ""so black lives do not matter"" and ""do you ever say all lives matter?""

Vice's Krishna Andavolu, hosting the panel, competently directed discussion toward Kamala Harris and her various identities, affirmative action, and the idea of ""stop Asian hate,"" a movement that accelerated after a string of attacks on Asians in New York City.

During the panelist's closing statements, where some were shown using coloring books, one man revealed his shock when hearing that others didn't support BLM. ""I found it hard to believe that people think Black Lives Matter is looked at in some way as fake,"" he remarked.

Other panelists revealed their support for Donald Trump, with Dao stating that he feels ""the term Asian-Americans should be erased.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/utep-basketball-coach-drives-stranded-pitt-football-players-9-hours,2022-12-15
Video: Brawl breaks out involving LA councilman who refused to resign following racist remarks on leaked audio,"Los Angeles City Councilman Kevin de León (D) got into a physical altercation with a community activist on Friday evening at a holiday event, KABC reported.



What's the background?

In October, de León faced heavy criticism following a leaked audio recording from a closed-door meeting with fellow Democrat councilmembers. In the recorded audio, the group can be heard making offensive and racist remarks about colleagues.

The meeting, which took place last year, included de León, former Council President Nury Martinez, former Federation President Ron Herrera, and Councilmember Gil Cedillo. De León and Cedillo were the only two involved who chose not to resign from their positions.

Since the scandal, Cedillo lost his reelection campaign, and his final day as city councilmember is Monday. De León has apologized for the offensive language but refuses to resign.

What are the details?

On December 9, a 10-second video of a scuffle between de León and an activist identified as Jason Reedy was posted online.

The short video showed de León clutching Reedy's jacket and pushing him down onto a table. De León then pulls Reedy up from the table and pushes him down a hall while still holding onto his jacket.

The video, which only showed a small portion of the incident, was posted to Twitter by the local activist groups RootsAction and J-TOWN Action and Solidarity.

Another, longer video was posted on Saturday, which showed the moments leading up to the fight. That video captured activists surrounding de León as he attempted to leave the room and close the door behind him.

Reedy is seen forcing his way into the room, where he uses his body to back de León against the wall. The councilman and Reedy are both seen holding their hands up; however, Reedy bumps his head against de León's.

The video then captures the councilman grabbing Reedy's jacket, and the scuffle ensues.

According to Los Angeles Police Department, law enforcement received a call around 6:30 p.m. about a ""large fight"" at a toy giveaway and Christmas tree lighting in Lincoln Heights.

""While participating in a local community event, Councilmember De Leon was approached by multiple community members, who blocked his path of travel as he attempted to leave the building,"" the LAPD stated Saturday. ""It was during this encounter that an allegation was made of one male, identified as Jason Reedy, headbutting, pushing, and punching Councilmember De Leon.”

""Councilmember De Leon and Reedy continued the altercation outside of the building, where Reedy left before officers' arrival,"" authorities continued. ""Shortly after the incident, officers completed a battery report for Councilmember De Leon. Several hours later, Reedy also completed a battery report at a local police station, where an allegation was made that Councilmember De Leon grabbed and threw Reedy.""

According to de León's office, Reedy and the other activists instigated the Friday altercation. The council member stated that Reedy headbutted him, a staff member was elbowed in the face, and a volunteer was also harmed during the fight.

Following the altercation, de León told KABC on Friday, ""When he headbutted me is when I grabbed him. And I grabbed him and put him on the table. I held him on the table there for maybe five to 10 seconds. Then, at that moment, I let him go. Another melee ensued. He turned a corner. He threw a punch at me – full-blown punch. It hit me right in the face. Threw a second punch at me, missed me.""

Reedy's attorney, Shakeer Rahman, claimed that de León and his supporters were the ones who escalated the incident.

""Video footage clearly shows him and his supporters initiating this assault while Mr. Reedy stands with his hands up,"" said Rahman. ""Not only has Kevin de León lost all political legitimacy, his claims that he was the one attacked here simply underscores how he's lost touch with reality.""

"Video: Cop appears to punch protester in face, knock protester to street as demonstrators scuffle with police, refuse to disperse","A Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, police officer was caught on video apparently punching a protester in the face and knocking the protester to the street as demonstrators in the Pittsburgh-area borough scuffled with police and refused to disperse over the weekend.

What are the details?

Saturday's protest was for Jim Rogers, a homeless man who died last year after Pittsburgh police repeatedly tased him, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. The Justice for Jim Rogers organization also called for firing and charges to be filed against officers and EMS workers involved the day Rogers was arrested, WTAE-TV reported.

The march began in Pittsburgh and then crossed into Wilkinsburg, where video shows protesters stopping in an intersection and blocking traffic while a police officer on a loudspeaker says it's an ""unlawful assembly"" and that protesters ""will be arrested"" if they don't keep the march moving.

With that, a number of protesters converged upon a police vehicle and cursed out the officer, telling him ""F*** you!"" and ""Let her speak!"" and ""We're not scared of you!""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Failing to get the protesters to disperse from the intersection, the officer gets help from colleagues. As police move in and apparently try to arrest several protesters, a scuffle breaks out.

Soon an officer appears to deliver a punch to a protester's face:

Here's video that begins with protesters refusing to disperse, then shows the scuffle and apparent punch, and ends with several arrests. (Content warning: language):

Who is the protester the cop apparently punched?

The Pittsburgh City Paper said the apparently punched protester was identified as Vuestro Merced. According to a Post-Gazette editorial, ""Vuestro Merced then shoved Officer Taylor, who responded with a left cross that knocked the protester to the ground.""

The City Paper, citing a Twitter post, said Merced was later released from police custody.

Another Twitter user called Merced a ""friend"" as well as a ""trans activist"":

Here's a 2021 tweet mentioning Merced:

Wilkinsburg Mayor Dontae Comans offered WPXI-TV the following statement after the incident: “The footage being shared shows what we do not want to see or experience when a community is expressing its hurt over police sanctioned violence...I have been in touch with the police chief and our officers body cameras were on, which will be used to investigate next steps.”

Video: Drag queens perform during Milwaukee Bucks 'Pride Night' halftime show. But not everyone is gleeful about it.,"Drag queens performed for the crowd at halftime during ""Pride Night"" at the Milwaukee Bucks' home game Wednesday against the Denver Nuggets, Fox News reported.

What are the details?

Here are a couple of clips:

As you might imagine, not everybody was happy about the drag queens doing their thing:

""As a bisexual woman I'm disgusted by the extremists in our community along w/the sports orgs & businesses who promote Drag Shows at family events,"" one Twitter user commented. ""Since when has it become acceptable to sexually victimize children?! This is not the time or place for adult entertainment.""

""Are there any gay persons out there insulted that your community is being conflated with drag queens and trans grooming?"" another commenter wondered. ""Is that the public image you want to cling to? Is that really all you have to be 'proud' of? Is that the best you can do? Sure seems like it.""

""Damn they really gotta shove gay in everyones' faces like that, seems a bit much,"" another user observed.

""NBA grooming kids and being used as a tool to desensitize kids,"" another commenter said. ""This is why I don’t watch sports anymore.""

Doug Russell, sports director for iHeart Radio Milwaukee and Madison, was peeved at the ""pearl-clutchers"" concerned about kids being in attendance during the drag show. But St. Louis-based conservative radio talk show host Mark Reardon challenged Russell's argument:

But wait, there's more!

If you assumed the drag queen show was the only thing happening in relation to the Bucks' ""Pride Night,"" have we got a surprise for you! For starters, the first 10,000 fans through the door were to receive a Bucks pride beanie:

The arena was duly adorned with rainbow lights:

If you were in the mood to hit the Bucks' pro shop, you could snag yourself one of the shirts depicted in the tweet below, the back of which read: ""LGBTQIA: Activist, Lesbian, Mentor, Advocate, Gay, Confidant, Bisexual, Pride, Teacher, Transgender, Two-Spirit, Counselor, Queer, Family, Intersex, Pansexual, Ally, Partner, Asexual, Friend.""

Bucks players advocated for the LGBTQ community in a prepared video for ""Pride Night"":

""The power of sport can bring everyone together, right?"" guard Pat Connaughton said. ""It doesn’t matter your gender. It doesn’t matter your ethnicity. It doesn’t matter [your] political views, and it definitely doesn’t matter your sexual identity.""

Forward Joe Ingles added that it's ""very important for fans and athletes and everyone in this world to make sporting events and any event for the LGBTQ community more accessible and more welcoming.""

After the game, you could ""keep the Bucks Pride Night Celebrations going"" at a postgame party featuring ""DJ Boyfrrriend"":

Anything else?

Just last week, Philadelphia Flyers player Ivan Provorov was raked over the woke coals for refusing to take part in the hockey team's pre-game warm-up featuring players with rainbow colors on their uniforms and sticks. Provorov cited his religion — Russian Orthodoxy — as his reason for opting out of the warm-up.

The author of ESPN's story about the controversy — Greg Wyshynski, senior NHL writer for the sports network — blasted Provorov on Twitter for his refusal to take part in the warm-up. E.J. Hradek — senior reporter for the NHL Network — suggested that Provorov return to Russia and even fight Ukraine if he didn't want to ""assimilate into his group of teammates and in the community and here in this country.""

"Woman in hoodie leaps across Burger King counter in Bronx, tries to steal register cash. Workers drag her toward kitchen, but soon, she just casually walks out.","A woman donned in a hoodie and sunglasses was caught on video leaping across the counter of a Burger King in the Bronx to try stealing cash from the register — but after an employee pulled her off the counter and toward the kitchen, the woman soon was able to casually walk out of the restaurant.

What are the details?

The suspect placed an order inside the Burger King on Grand Concourse near East 150th Street in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx around 3 p.m. Tuesday, police told the New York Post.

Video shows her retrieving cash and handing it to the worker behind the counter — but the Post said that when the employee opened the register to look for change, the woman lunged for cash in the drawer and got about $250, police and the video indicated.

Violent felon is now representing himself in the Waukesha Christmas Parade massacre trial,"On November 21, 2021, hundreds took to the streets of Waukesha, Wisconsin, for the city's annual Christmas Parade. The good cheer and wholesome revelry was cut short when a red Ford Escape pulled onto the parade route and powered through the crowd, injuring nearly 50 people.

18 kids were among those badly hurt. Six people were killed, including eight-year-old Jackson Sparks, who had been marching in the parade along with his baseball team. Four of the victims were members of the Dancing Grannies, elderly women known for dancing in parades.

The trial for the individual believed responsible, 41-year-old Darrell Brooks Jr., began on Monday.

Brooks faces six counts of first-degree intentional homicide and 61 counts of felony reckless derangement. Prosecutors have indicated that an overwhelming amount of evidence stacked against him, including over 300 videos of the parade, a witness list 32-pages long, and testimonies from grieving parents, police officers, and FBI agents.

'Playing games'

Last week, Brooks withdrew his insanity/not-guilty plea and filed a motion to represent himself. He didn't offer the court any insight into the motivation behind his decision, stating only, ""I have my own reasons why.""



Although she warned about ""what he's getting into,"" Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow ultimately decided on September 28 to permit Brooks to represent himself in court, noting that he was both ""competent"" and ""coherent"" enough to do so.

The defense attorneys who Brooks subsequently dismissed, Jeremy Perri and Anna Kees, had ""no comment.""

Tom Grieve, a Madison-based criminal defense attorney, told the AP, ""You have a defendant who feels like he has nothing to lose. He's going to try to make as big a mess as possible and force a fumble by the prosecutors or judge and try to force a mistrial or build an appeal.""

Former federal prosecutor Phil Turner expects a breakdown when it comes to the cross-examinations. Turner suggested that ""there's going to be an appeal, no matter what.""

Seven minutes into the trial, earlier suggestions concerning Brooks' ability to derail proceedings proved true, as the defendant was ejected from the court and sent back to his holding cell for repeatedly interrupting Dorow.

The judge told Brooks subsequent interruptions would result in him watching the proceedings from an adjacent courtroom.

Three hours into the trial, the court was on its sixth recess due to Brooks' interruptions.

Brooks repeatedly asserted that he was a ""sovereign citizen,"" refusing to answer Dorow's questions. Dorow characterized this assertion and its implicit rejection of the court's jurisdiction as an ""obstructionist tactic.""

Brooks also demanded that prosecutors provide ""verified proof"" that he is an American citizen.

Former Waukesha County District Attorney Paul Bucher suggested that Brooks is delaying the inevitable and keen now just to waste everyone's time. ""He's playing games, and I think he enjoys it,"" said Bucher.

Bucher indicated further that it's ""going to be terrible for the victims and the witnesses.""



Throughout the process, Brooks has been regarded as a volatile.

In August, Brooks fell asleep, having complained that he was ""bored."" When he awoke, he yelled at the judge and then tussled with the bailiff.



Last week, Brooks' interruptions were so frequent as to prompt the frustrated judge to adjourn until the next day.

History of violence

Brooks is a convicted sex offender, who, when aged 39, preyed upon a 15-year-old girl. In addition to impregnating the minor, he has a long track record of violent crimes.

Fox 6 reported that in September 1999, Brooks was convicted of substantial battery and intentionally causing bodily harm. Despite a two-year prison sentence, he served three year's probation and only six months in the House of Correction.



In January 2003, he pled guilty to resisting an officer.

In February 2010, he was convicted on a strangulation charge only to serve 90 days in jail.

In 2011, Brooks fled from a police traffic stop and resisted arrest.



In 2020, Brooks was charged with firing a gun at his nephew.



In November 2021, just days before the Waukesha Christmas Parade massacre, Brooks was released on $1,000 bail, having allegedly run over the mother of his child at a Milwaukee gas station.

A BLM-supporter and an advocate for knocking ""white ppl [the f***] out,"" Brooks routinely employed violent rhetoric online.



He claimed in his songs, ""yeh we terrorists,"" and boasted about being a ""killer in the city."" In addition to writing a song criticizing former President Donald Trump, Brooks repeatedly shared anti-police and anti-Semitic messages.

The massacre

According to the police complaint filed on November 23, 2021, despite numerous attempts by police to stop Brooks, he allegedly increased his speed as he drove into the crowd and over pedestrians.



The complaint alleges that one officer who had been assisting with crowd control observed Brooks' vehicle intentionally moving side to side as it rammed through the crowd, ""striking multiple people ... bodies and objects were flying from the area of the vehicle.""

One witness said, the vehicle ""continued to drive in a zig zag motion ... There was no attempt made by the vehicle to stop, much less slow down.""

Another witness stated that it had appeared the suspect drove as with ""a direct intent to hit as many parade participants.""

He fled the scene, and was captured by police trying to get into a nearby house.

Each of the six murder charges Brooks faces carries a life sentence.

Virginia home sells for $805K despite listing that a stranger is living in the basement,"Homebuyers in in the Washington, D.C., suburbs are getting desperate. Case in point: A residence in Fairfax, Virginia, sold this month for over the asking price despite its need for some significant renovation and a bizarre clause noting that a stranger is living in the basement.

What are the details?

According to property records, the five-bedroom, four-bathroom colonial-style residence was purchased on April 15 by an unnamed buyer for for $805,000. NBC News reported that the house received five cash offers and the sale closed less than a week after listing.

Apparently the new buyer didn't mind that his or her new digs would be coming with an unwanted guest. At least it did not come as a surprise, as the property listing made the home's downsides quite clear.

""CASH OFFERS ONLY,"" it stated, adding that prospective buyers would not be afforded the opportunity to view the basement.

""NO ACCESS to see lower level and Home sold AS IS ONLY with acknowledgement that home will convey with a person(s) living in lower level with no lease in place,"" it said.



Not surprisingly, the sought-after property generated quite a reaction on social media last week, especially after being picked up by popular Instagram account Zillow Gone Wild.

""On the next season of NETFLIX’s MYSTERY TENANT,"" one commenter joked.

Another added: ""800k for 5 bd, 4 ba, and your own serial killer.""

""Is the basement haunted? Feels like the basement is haunted,"" one person commented.

Still another guessed, ""This is how they finally get rid of their 32yo deadbeat son.""

What's really going on?

But the real story appears to be much more tragic than the social media commenters suggested.

According to the New York Post, the home's previous owner is a sick, elderly man who was being taken advantage of by a squatter.

Zinta Rodger-Rickert, the listing agent with RE/MAX Gateway, told the outlet that ""three years ago, a woman was cleaning the senior owner’s house and she convinced him that she needed a place to stay. So he offered her the basement, but then she never left. And she does not pay rent.""

""It is essentially an individual taking advantage of a senior who is ill and currently in the hospital. He will likely end up in hospice,"" Rodger-Rickert said.

Prior to the April 15 purchase, the home had been owned by a man named Thomas Burke, who bought the house for $319,000 in 1997, the Post said. It added that Burke, now 79, does not have a will and his family did not have the resources to hire a lawyer to work on the squatter's eviction.

""We are hoping the next owner will want to deal with that process,"" Rodger-Rickert said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/violent-felon-is-representing-himself-in-the-waukesha-christmas-parade-massacre-trial,2022-04-25
Virginia Dem lawmaker wants parents to face criminal charges if they refuse to affirm a child's sexual orientation and gender identity,"A Democratic Virginia state lawmaker wants to pass legislation that would make parents face criminal charges if they refused to affirm their child's sexual orientation and gender identity.

Delegate Elizabeth Guzman said that she will introduce the proposal in the next session of the Virginia legislature. The social worker said that the new law is meant to be a rebuke of Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin's issuance of new rules on transgender students in schools.

“The day that Governor Youngkin wanted to implement this policy, I immediately texted the policy lead of that committee and said, this is how we're going to push back,” Guzman said to WJLA-TV.

Guzman's bill would include refusal to accept gender and sexual identity in the definition of child abuse.

“If the child shares with those mandated reporters what they are going through, we are talking about not only physical abuse or mental abuse, what the job of that mandated reporter is to inform Child Protective Services,” Guzman explained.

“And then that's how everybody gets involved,"" she added. ""There's also an investigation in place that is not only from a social worker but there's also a police investigation before we make the decision that there is going to be a CPS charge.”

She said the punishment could have deep consequences for the parental offenders.

“It could be a felony, it could be a misdemeanor, but we know that CPS charge could harm your employment, could harm their education, because nowadays many people do a CPS database search before offering employment,"" Guzman said.

When challenged that the proposed law might infringe on parents' religious freedom, Guzman claimed the Bible says everyone should be accepted.

“The Bible says to accept everyone for who they are. So that's what I tell them when they asked me that question, and that's what I will continue to tell people,"" she responded.

Watch: Virginia veteran who defied COVID orders has his restaurant stormed by armed agents — 'You're shutting down a man's livelihood',"A Virginia restauranteur and military veteran, who attracted national attention for refusing to comply with former Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's COVID orders, had his establishment raided on Friday morning.

Matt Strickland, a Virginia state Senate candidate who runs the popular Fredericksburg restaurant Gourmeltz, filmed his confrontation with the Virginia state troopers, local police officers, and Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Authority (ABC) agents who descended on his establishment, saying, ""If you've got children, you're setting them up for failure by not standing up now.""

What are the details?

Gourmeltz lost its health permit in February 2021. Strickland was sued by the Virginia Attorney General's Office the following month.



The Center Square reported that Gourmeltz had allowed patrons to sit at the bar during the pandemic without wearing masks or social distancing in defiance of Northam's orders.

A judge denied the state's request for an injunction to immediately close Strickland's restaurant.



The Attorney General's Office ultimately dropped all charges against Strickland, and the Department of Health reinstituted his license, reported WUSA.

This victory was partial, however.

Strickland's license to sell alcoholic beverages, suspended in September 2021, remained a sticking point for the ABC.

Townhall reported that while Northam has been out of office for ten months, the board members he appointed to the ABC board, including board chair Maria J.K. Everett and board CEO Travis Hill, are apparently keen to continue doing his bidding — in this case, hobbling Strickland's business.

While the ABC put a stay on the enforcement of the order, giving Strickland an opportunity to appeal, in November 2022, the Circuit Court of Spotsylvania County reportedly ruled in favor of the ABC and against Gourmeltz.

Following the court's ruling, the ABC ordered Gourmeltz to stop serving alcohol for 90 days effective Nov. 15.

The ABC offered to reduce the suspension to 15 days and a $4,000 penalty plus investigative costs, but Strickland was not interested in capitulating. After all, the restauranteur figured that having won back his health department license in court, the ABC should have restored his liquor license as well.

According to a statement issued on Friday by the ABC, ""The establishment failed to comply with ABC’s Board Order and continued to serve beer, wine and mixed beverages to customers"" despite ""administrative proceedings and the final order of the Circuit Court of Spotsylvania County affirming Virginia ABC’s decision to suspend Gourmeltz’s wine/beer on and off premises and mixed beverage licenses.""

The raid

WUSA reported that ABC agents accompanied by members of law enforcement stormed Gourmeltz on Friday morning, executing a search warrant issued for the business' sales records and for information pertaining to ""possession of alcoholic beverages without a license, maintaining a common nuisance and the illegal sale of alcoholic beverages.""

Strickland recorded a portion of the raid, in which he can be heard asking officers, ""How do you feel about coming to shut a man's business down for not following COVID mandates that are not constitutional?""

At one point in the video, after one officer explained that ABC agents were looking into whether Gourmeltz was selling liquor without a license, Strickland, ""I'm telling you to your face, right now, I'm selling alcohol.""

When some of those on the scene suggested they were just doing their jobs, Strickland suggested that excuse had been worn out in Hitler's Nazi Germany and was no longer viable.

Strickland said, ""You're shutting down a man's livelihood for not following COVID mandates that didn't do anything to prevent COVID.""

""It set our kids back so many years, these mandates. It set small businesses back so many years. It destroyed small businesses. It destroyed 'em. It destroyed families. It destroyed our community. And it destroyed our country,"" he added.

The Free Lance-Star indicated that while it is presently unclear what sort of punishment Strickland could face, selling alcohol without a license can carry a penalty of up to one year in jail.

Not backing down

Last year, Strickland said, ""I'm not afraid of the state, I'm not afraid of the federal government. ... I spent most of my adult life fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have no problem coming home and fighting here in Virginia.""



Strickland uploaded a video to Twitter on Monday indicating that he is staying the course, having realized early on ""that these COVID mandates were more about control than they were health and safety.""

The restauranteur told reporters over the weekend that the allure of his establishment is that when patrons come in, ""they're stepping back into what the United States of America used to be: free. They're stepping into freedom.""

Strickland is running against Delegate Tara Durant (R-Fredericksburg) for the area's 27th District state Senate seat.

The veteran supports: mitigating government overreach; improving border security; combatting ""Defund the Police"" rhetoric; ending the scourge of critical race theory and buttressing parental rights; upholding the Second Amendment ""at all costs""; and lowering taxes.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/virginia-parents-crime-trans-sexuality,2022-12-05
Report: Over 100 'visibly Jewish' travelers barred from boarding plane in Germany after a few Jewish passengers on previous flight refused to wear masks,"According to a report in the Jewish Chronicle, more than 100 ""visibly Jewish"" travelers were barred from boarding a Lufthansa plane in Germany after a small number of Jewish passengers on a previous flight refused to wear masks.

Lufthansa confirmed that travelers weren't allowed to board a Wednesday flight from Frankfurt to Budapest for not wearing masks but didn't say those who appeared Jewish were specifically targeted.

What are the details?

A Lufthansa spokesperson told the Jewish Chronicle that on an earlier flight from New York City to Frankfurt, ""some of the passengers with the planned onward journey to Budapest had repeatedly refused — even after repeated requests from the crew — to wear masks and to follow the safety regulations during the flight.""

The outlet said at least 127 Jewish people apparently were prevented from boarding the connecting flight to Budapest. Lufthansa said ""the flight to Budapest took off with a slight delay [with] just under 30 passengers on board,"" the outlet added.

""It is claimed by passengers that Lufthansa employees at Frankfurt Airport took action to bar all passengers who appeared visibly Jewish from boarding the connecting flight,"" the Jewish Chronicle wrote.

The group was headed to Budapest on an annual pilgrimage to commemorate a Hasidic rabbi, the outlet added.

'Jewish people ... were the mess ... made the problems'

A now-viral video shows a Lufthansa staffer explaining to a traveler why Jewish passengers were barred from the connecting flight, the outlet said.

The traveler calls the action ""anti-Semitism"" and ""gruesome,"" after which the employee appears to say that ""everybody has to pay"" the penalty ""for a couple"" of violators.

“What do you mean everybody? Everybody from that race?"" the traveler replies. ""No, everybody else on the flight went ... the non-Jewish people on the flight went, so why are only the Jewish people paying for other people’s crimes?”

The staff member answered that it was because of ""Jewish [people] coming from JFK [airport].”

“Oh, so Jewish people coming from JFK are paying for the crimes of a few people?” the traveler asks.

Soon the employee says sharply that ""it was ... Jewish people who were the mess, who made the problems.”

The traveler replies, “So, Jewish people on the plane made a problem, so all Jews are banned from Lufthansa for the day?”

The airline employee answers, “Just for this flight.”

One individual tweeted that ""I was on the flight and wore a mask the whole time like most ppl. You banned me and my daughter from all flights for the day cuz I am a Jew & u were upset at a few Jews. Shameful to categorize ppl based on religion and race. I thought we were past that.""



What else did Lufthansa say?

""We apologize to all guests for the inconvenience this has caused, including those who were unable to travel on this particular flight,"" Lufthansa also told the Jewish Chronicle, adding that the airline ""is currently investigating the events of May 4th in order to clarify the exact processes and background of the incident.”

Here's another clip apparently recorded at the gate in Frankfurt:

The above video also shows police at the gate, and the Jewish Chronicle said a spokesman for the federal police at Frankfurt Airport indicated that “Lufthansa called us and said that some of this group from JFK were not following the rules — putting on seat belts, wearing masks, etc. They said they had decided not to take them any further when they arrived in Frankfurt, and so ... they called us simply as a security measure.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/virginia-veteran-who-defied-covid-orders-has-his-restaurant-stormed-by-armed-agents,2022-05-09
Voters in 5 states support ballot measures to protect access to abortion,"On Tuesday, citizens in five states voted to back a series of ballot measures solidifying access to abortion, Fox News reported.



The Supreme Court's decision earlier this year to overturn Roe v. Wade handed decision-making power back to the states regarding abortion access. In response, several states across the nation added abortion issues to the ballot.

In yesterday's midterm elections, California, Michigan, Vermont, Kentucky, and Montana voted on abortion access.

Pro-abortion advocates in Michigan showed up at the polls in overwhelming numbers to pass a ballot proposal to add abortion access to the state's constitution. The initiative passed by double digits, according to the Michigan Board of Elections. At the same time, voters elected to strike down a 1931 abortion ban law.

Michigan's constitutional amendment will allow the state to regulate abortion after fetal viability but not to ""prohibit an abortion that, in the professional judgment of an attending health care professional, is medically indicated to protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant individual.""

The term ""fetal viability"" is not precisely defined in the initiative's language, only stating that it is up to the ""professional judgment of an attending health care professional"" to determine.

Abortion access was also added to the California and Vermont state constitutions.

Vermont's state constitution will be amended to establish the right to ""personal reproductive autonomy.""

In response to the election results, California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) stated, ""We affirmed we are a true freedom state.""

While the results are not official, Kentucky voters largely rejected a ballot measure to amend the state constitution to declare that it does not protect abortion access and to prohibit government funding of abortion procedures.

If the Kentucky measure is passed, the state constitution will be amended to state, ""To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.""

In Montana, voters were asked to decide if the state should adopt the Born Alive Infant Protection Act, which states that children born alive after failed abortions are legal persons. In addition, the ballot proposal would impose criminal penalties on health care providers who fail or refuse to take ""medically appropriate and reasonable actions"" to preserve the lives of infants born alive after botched abortions.

At this time, the ballot initiatives in both states have not been officially struck down but are leaning toward rejection.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/visibly-jewish-passengers-barred-flight,2022-11-09
Walmart ordered to pay $4.4 million in racial profiling lawsuit,"Michael Mangum, an Oregon man, filed a lawsuit against Walmart after claiming an employee ""spied"" on him while he was shopping. A verdict was reached last week, ordering Walmart to pay Mangum $4.4 million in damages for racial profiling and harassment, reported KGW-TV.



Mangum accused Joe Williams, a Walmart loss-prevention employee, of watching him while he shopped at Oregon's Wood Village store in 2020. Williams asked Mangum to leave the store, but Mangum refused, claiming he had not done anything wrong. Williams called the police non-emergency phone number and said that a customer was refusing to leave.

According to Mangum's lawyer, Williams told Mangum that he would lie and tell the police that Mangum had threatened to ""smash him in the face."" Mangum stated that he never threatened Williams.

On the phone with authorities, Williams claimed that he was walking by Mangum when ""he started flipping out on me."" Williams said that is when he asked him to leave. The lawsuit stated that Williams confirmed to authorities that Mangum was not activating violently and did not appear intoxicated or impaired.

Multnomah County sheriff's deputies arrived on the scene but ""refused to take action against Mangum."" Mangum's lawyer claimed that Williams had provided ""shifting explanations"" to authorities and had gained a ""reputation for making false reports to police.""

Mangum told KGW-TV, ""People of color should be able to go into a store and shop and not be profiled."" The complaint alleged that Williams had intentionally tried to cause Mangum to feel ""harassed, humiliated, or embarrassed.""

The day after the incident, the director and the assistant manager of the Wood Village Walmart were approached by MCSO Sergeant Bryan White and an unnamed deputy. According to the complaint, authorities told management that Williams had ""provided false information about customers"" on previous occasions and that he was ""not to be trusted.""

""Walmart knew they had a guy making false police reports, and he stayed on,"" stated Mangum's attorney, Greg Kafoury. ""News about this guy went all the way up to the corporate headquarters. Nothing happened.""

Williams remained employed by Walmart following the incident. However, he was terminated several months after for ""mishandling $35 of Walmart property.""

The lawsuit fell under a new Oregon law allowing people to take action against someone who summons police with improper intent (ORS 30.845). A Multnomah County jury ordered Walmart to pay Mangum $400,000 in non-economic damages and $4 million in punitive damages.

Kafoury said that his client ""lives the same message of self-respect that he teaches to young people, 'stand up for yourself when you know you're right.' Because of his courage, we were able to show the jury an unconscionable failure of responsibility by the world's largest corporation.""

A senior director for national media relations for Walmart, Randy Hargrove, released a statement to KGW-TV regarding the outcome of the verdict. ""We do not tolerate discrimination. We believe the verdict is excessive and is not supported by the evidence,"" stated Hargrove. ""Mr. Mangum was never stopped by Walmart's Asset Protection. He interfered with our associates as they were surveilling and then stopped confirmed shoplifters, and then refused to leave despite being asked to repeatedly by our staff and Multnomah County deputies. We are reviewing our options including post-trial motions.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/voters-in-5-states-support-ballot-measures-to-protect-access-to-abortion,2022-08-23
Obama ethics chief blasts Biden for retaining classified docs: 'Inexcusable neglect of the most basic security protocols',"Walter Shaub, ethics chief in the Obama administration, called out President Joe Biden on Tuesday for improperly retaining classified documents.

Biden, according to Shaub, demonstrated an ""inexcusable neglect of the most basic security protocols."" Still, Shaub downplayed the seriousness of Biden's actions by drawing a comparison to former President Donald Trump.

""It's nothing like Trump’s deliberate refusal to return classified records demanded by the National Archives,"" Shaub told Fox News, ""but Biden’s own retention of classified records reflects an inexcusable neglect of the most basic security protocols.""

Shaub, moreover, knocked the White House for not disclosing the second discovery of classified documents — those at Biden's private Wilmington, Delaware, residence — when it admitted to the first discovery at Biden's private office in Washington.

Biden's private attorneys allegedly discovered the first batch of documents on Nov. 2 and the second on Dec. 20. But when they disclosed the first last Monday, they neglected to mention the second.

""The fact that the White House didn't mention that records were found in more than one location when first asked about them was a breach of trust with the public and a self-inflicted wound,"" Shaub said.

Shaub added that he is ""glad"" that Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel — former U.S. attorney Robert Hur — to investigate Biden, but claimed it is ""unlikely"" that Biden is ""at risk of any of legal consequences.""

What crimes are on the table?

While the Justice Department has said nothing about criminal charges, the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents is a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison.

But Watergate prosecutor Nick Ackerman explained on Tuesday that Biden could be free and clear because the statute of limitations for unauthorized retention of classified documents is five years. It has been six years since Biden left office as vice president.

However, it's not clear when the documents found improperly in Biden's possession were retained, neither is it clear what the motive was for the retention and subsequent failure to return the documents.

City in Washington weighs fining and jailing homeless people who refuse help,"A city in Washington state is considering adopting a bold measure to combat the rampant homelessness that has endangered residents and plagued quality of life in the community.

What are the details?

Members of the city council in Edmonds, Washington, this week debated a new ordinance that would punish someone who illegally camps on city property and refuses services such as overnight shelter with a fine and potential jail time.

According to KING-TV, the ordinance's text recommends first-time violators be fined $1,000 and face up to 90 days in jail, or both. Those who violate the ordinance a second time in five years would face a misdemeanor in addition to fines and imprisonment. Third-time violators would face the same penalties but with $500 of the fine and five days of imprisonment not suspended or deferred.

If a violator is unable to pay the fine, they would be required to complete community service.

The ordinance's text claims the measure ""seeks to establish a compassionate approach to assist the unhoused residents of our city by first offering human service, including available shelter, and only causing the penalty provisions to be enforced when available shelter is refused.""

What else?

But critics claim the legislation is anything but compassionate. Rather, they argue it violates homeless people's constitutional rights.

In a letter sent to the city council, the National Homelessness Law Center wrote, ""Both public policy and constitutional precedent advise against policies that punish people for being unsheltered and that prevent them from life-sustaining activities such as sleeping. We are eager to work with the mayor's office and city council on replacing this proposal with policies and practices that effectively and humanely address homelessness in your community.""

Edmonds Mayor Mike Nelson shot back, insisting that the organization is misinterpreting what the ordinance would do.

""I'm confident in what our city attorney and staff have done to put together an ordinance we believe is lawful and humane,"" Nelson told KING.

City Council President Vivian Olson added that the ordinance would be a last resort and a tool for law enforcement in instances where things get really out of hand.

Anything else?

The council welcomed public comment and engaged in a back-and-forth debate about the ordinance on Tuesday, but the matter could not be settled by the time the meeting adjourned, My Edmonds News reported. It is set to be addressed again at a future meeting.

The ordinance was reportedly drafted in response to an incident in the Lake Ballinger neighborhood last year, when a homeless woman camped out for weeks and refused to leave.

Neighborhood resident Janet Atchison recalled to KIRO-TV, ""It was just horrible for all the neighbors. I took a bag of food over there because I felt sorry for her. I was really worried she was going to be there forever. I mean, it was just so sad, all of her stuff piled all around her.""

The woman allegedly grew more and more aggressive over time and eventually became a public safety risk, neighbors claimed. But there was little they could do resolve the issue.

"Washington DC refuses to grant 3 black men concealed-carry licenses — so they're suing, alleging discrimination","Three black men are suing Washington, D.C., alleging discrimination after district police refused to give them concealed-carry licenses, the Washington Post reported.

The suit — filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September — claims D.C. not only wrongly said the plaintiffs have violent histories but also that it misjudged their criminal records, the paper noted. In addition, the suit says D.C. police have unreasonably refused licenses to those with minor criminal convictions and arrests with no convictions — and sometimes unfairly used their involvement in violent incidents against them, the Post said.

What are the details?

D.C. security guard Sanu Millard, 24, tried to get a concealed-carry license from D.C. police in 2019, but his request was denied, the paper said.

Millard carried guns at work in the District, Maryland, and Virginia, the Post reported, adding that he'd been trained in gun safety as a teenager and had legally registered two weapons.

Despite having no criminal record and never having been arrested, police said his involvement in domestic violence incidents disqualified him, the paper said.

Thing is, Millard told the Post he and his mother were victims in those incidents.

More from the paper:

The litigation comes in the wake of a major Supreme Court decision this year that found Americans have a right to carry guns outside the home — a ruling that has proved challenging for some cities as they try to manage increasing gun violence.



Millard and other Second Amendment activists, however, say gun control will not stop gun violence. By preventing people from protecting themselves, laws limiting gun rights only make cities more dangerous, Millard says.

“I have a clean background,” he told the Post. “I’m not willing to break the law. … I’m a victim because of gun-control laws.”

The paper said a D.C. police spokesperson referred questions to the D.C. attorney general’s office, adding that a spokeswoman there declined to comment on the litigation.

What about the other plaintiffs?

The suit also says another man was denied a concealed-carry license because he fired a gun in self-defense in 2019 but was never charged, the Post reported. In a 2020 incident, the man was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and carrying a pistol without a license, but the paper — citing the suit — said the assault charge was dropped, and then the case was dismissed and his plea withdrawn after the man pleaded guilty to a lesser weapons charge and completed community service.



Though he has not been convicted of a crime, D.C. police won't issue him a concealed-carry license, the Post said, citing the suit.

The suit adds that another man had repeated involvement in violent incidents and contacts with law enforcement, the paper reported. In 2017, he witnessed a threatened shooting, the Post said, citing the suit. In 2020, he took a shooting victim to a hospital; in 2021, he was arrested in two incidents and charged with assaulting a police officer and possession with intent to distribute marijuana while armed, the paper said, citing the suit.

But the Post said all those charges were dropped. Yet though he was never charged with a crime by a prosecutor and already had a concealed-carry license, the suit says his license was revoked, the Post added.

Anything else?

As for Millard, the paper said police maintained that his involvement in domestic incidents makes him unsuitable for a license — yet there’s no indication Millard instigated those incidents.

The suit says the boyfriend of Millard’s mother pushed him and bloodied his lip in one incident — and in another told police Millard had “mental health issues,"" the Post reported.

Millard — who was never arrested or charged with a crime — told the paper, “They didn’t even put handcuffs on me.""

More from the Post:

Millard said D.C. gun regulations have left him defenseless on city streets. Armed security guards who can’t take their weapons home might be targeted when they clock out, he said.



D.C. policy just doesn’t make sense when he can carry a weapon at work, Millard said. On a sunny fall Sunday, he stood near the water taxi landing on Old Town Alexandria’s waterfront in Virginia, his Glock 19 in a holster strapped to his waist. This was perfectly legal, and no one seemed to notice.

“It’s only dangerous when I’m not there,” he told the paper.

Joseph Scrofano, one of Millard’s attorneys, told the Post that the ""existing process gives the chief [of police] unfettered discretion to pick and choose who gets to carry and … disproportionately disqualify African-American men.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-city-considers-homeless-ordinance,2022-11-01
"'Not going to turn this ... into a grievance session': Washington Post CEO confirms newsroom layoffs in tense meeting, then bolts","The chief executive of Jeff Bezos' Washington Post held a town hall on Wednesday, informing panicked staff that under ten percent of the workforce would be getting the boot.

Fred Ryan, the paper's CEO and publisher, noted that the the cuts, which will likely affect the newsroom, will take place in the first quarter of 2023.

The announcement comes just two weeks after the paper revealed it would be scrapping its stand-alone Sunday print magazine and ousting 10 newsroom employees plus a dance critic, citing ""economic head winds.""

What are the details?

Ryan said in a company-wide meeting Wednesday that the coming layoffs will likely amount to a ""single-digit percentage,"" but provided hope to those in positions ""no longer serving readers"" that they might take refuge in new roles.



""For those people whose positions will be eliminated, this will be a difficult time,"" Ryan suggested.

The paper's chief communications officer, Kathy Baird, later stated there would not, however, be a ""net reduction in Post head count,"" reported Deadline.

When the CEO began angling for the exit, staff yelled out concerns and questions.

Ryan made it clear he had no intention of engaging, saying, ""We’re not going to turn the town hall into a grievance session.""



“Fred, you talked about positions getting eliminated. What are you going to do to protect people’s jobs? Are they going to be treated like the magazine staffers were?” asked one employee, referencing the abrupt firing of the Sunday print magazine's employees.

""We'll have more information as we move forward,"" answered Ryan, as he moved forward and out the door.

In a subsequent statement, the paper's guild said, ""This behavior is unacceptable from any leader, but especially the leader of a news organization whose core values include transparency and accountability.""

The guild, whose Twitter banner image demands a ""Diverse, Inclusive & Fair Washington Post,"" tweeted that its members ""won't let"" Ryan ""turn his back on workers with urgent questions and valid concerns.""

""Washington Post employees ... must be part of any transformation to this company. Stay tuned,"" wrote the guild.

While Axios indicated the paper — whose slogan is ""Democracy Dies in Darkness"" — is not expected to turn a profit this year, it will still manage to keep the lights on.



Baird added in her statement, ""We are planning to direct our resources and invest in coverage, products, and people in service of providing high value to our subscribers and new audiences.""

The Washington Post, bought for $250 million by Bezos in 2013, has approximately 2,500 employees.

According to Axios, the paper's newsroom doubled in size during Ryan's time as CEO and now exceeds 1,000 employees.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-dc-police-refuse-to-grant-3-black-men-concealed-carry-licenses-so-theyre-suing-alleging-discrimination,2022-12-15
"Watch: Parolee begs climate protesters to quit blocking traffic so he can get to work, says he could go back to jail","Fourteen people were arrested after far-left climate protesters blocked several lanes of traffic on a Maryland highway, causing severe travel delays in the Washington, D.C., area on the Fourth of July.

Climate protesters dressed in yellow reflective safety vests sat down on the road and blocked all lanes of traffic on the inner loop of I-495 in Montgomery County, Maryland, near Exit 30 for Colesville Road/U.S. Route 29 in the afternoon Monday, WTTG reported.

Maryland State Police responded and made the arrests, a spokesperson said. The protesters were charged with disturbing the peace and hindering passage, as well as failure to obey a reasonable/lawful order.

Rockville Barrack troopers responded at approximately 12:30 p.m. after receiving a report of a group of people blocking all lanes of traffic on the inner loop of the beltway.

The protesters were asked to move to the shoulder, police said. Those who did not comply with the order to disperse were arrested.



Four of the 13 protesters were also charged with resisting arrest. At least one counter-protester was also charged with second-degree assault and resisting arrest.

Video of the protest taken by the D.C.-based online media outlet News2Share shows a driver confronting the protesters and pleading with them to open up at least one lane of traffic. The man said he was on parole and could be returned to prison if he was late for his job.

As police arrived, the man claiming to be a parolee became increasingly agitated and got physical with the protesters who were blocking traffic.

Police arrested him before proceeding to arrest the 13 climate protesters.

Police said that all lanes of traffic had been reopened by approximately 1:45 p.m.



A radical far-left group called ""Declare Emergency"" claimed responsibility for organizing the protest in a statement demanding that President Joe Biden ""immediately declare a national state of climate emergency.""

""Today there were almost two dozen Declare Emergency campaign supporters on the road, coming from as far away as Oregon, Washington and Florida to make their voices heard here in DC/MD/VA area. A total of thirteen ordinary citizens have been arrested today while acting in nonviolent civil resistance, raising the alarm on the climate crisis,"" the group said.

""Our action is an expression of our fear for our families, for the future of humanity and life on Earth. We are acting upon what thousands of scientists tell us, because our government is refusing to. Many other groups around the world are taking similar actions as a part of a global coalition called the A22 Network. Declare Emergency is currently centered around Washington DC and is inviting everyone from all disciplines, classes and beliefs, to join us on the road.""

Watch: John Bolton responds to 'snowflakes' upset that he helped topple foreign governments,"Former national security adviser John Bolton responded to his critics Wednesday after admitting on CNN that he has helped organize coups d'état in other countries.

Bolton was being interviewed on Newsmax when anchor Bianca de la Garza asked him about his controversial statement.

“I do have to ask you also, your comment yesterday on CNN about coups and orchestrating them. It’s getting a lot of play, as you know. What would you like to say to that? Obviously, the U.S. is a world superpower, and were you surprised that some of the pick-up there was about, you know, your talk? Obviously, you’ve written about Venezuela a lot in your book,” de la Garza said.

“Well, I think there are a lot of snowflakes out there that don’t understand what you need to do to protect the United States,” Bolton answered, refusing to back down in the face of criticism.

“I’m not going to get into specifics. I did write about Venezuela in my memoir. And I think that any president that’s not willing to do what it takes to protect the interests of the American people, it needs to have some, some counseling,” he said.

Watch:



On Tuesday, Bolton sent shockwaves through the media when he let slip that he's helped plan the fall of foreign governments in the past during a conversation about the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Bolton told CNN's Jake Tapper it was a ""mistake"" to believe that the Capitol riot ""was a carefully planned coup d'état aimed at the Constitution.""

""That's not the way Donald Trump does things. It's rambling from one half-vast idea to another. One plan that falls through and another comes up. That's what he was doing,"" Bolton said.

When Tapper pushed back and asserted ""one doesn't have to be brilliant to attempt a coup,"" Bolton strongly disagreed and cited his firsthand experience doing so.

""As somebody who has helped plan coups d'état — not here, but other places — it takes a lot of work. And that's not what [Trump] did. It was just stumbling around from one idea to another,"" Bolton said.

It was a shocking admission from a former high-level government official who served in four presidential administrations.

Bolton served as Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security during the George W. Bush administration form 2001-2005. He then served as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2006. He was called back into the government during the Trump administration to serve as President Donald Trump's National Security Advisor from 2018-2019, before leaving after several heated policy disagreements with the president.

"Watch: John Fetterman reads reporter's questions off a computer to understand them, insists his stroke won't have 'impact' if elected to Senate","Pennsylvania lieutenant governor and Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman's health was the focus of a conversation he had with NBC News on Tuesday, during which he struggled to speak and understand the questions he was asked.

With Election Day just over three weeks away, Fetterman insisted that a near-fatal stroke he suffered in May wouldn't affect his ability to serve in the United States Senate should he defeat Republican Mehmet Oz.

“I don’t think it’s going to have an impact,” he told NBC News' Dasha Burns in his first in-person sit-down interview since the stroke. The Fetterman campaign required NBC to provide closed-captioning technology so that the lieutenant governor could read the questions as they were asked in order to understand and respond.

“I sometimes will hear things in a way that’s not perfectly clear. So I use captioning so I’m able to see what you’re saying on the captioning,” Fetterman explained.

NBC News noted that he occasionally stuttered and had trouble finding words during the interview. At one point he couldn't articulate the word ""empathetic"" and instead said something that sounded like ""emphetic."" But he denied that this was a difficulty.

""It was just about having to be thinking more, uh, sl, uh — slower — to just understand and that sometimes that’s kind of the processing that happens,” Fetterman said.

Fetterman suffered a stroke in May caused by a blood clot from his heart formed by atrial fibrillation. Doctors surgically implanted a pacemaking device with a defibrillator to monitor and regulate his heartbeat. At the time, Fetterman said doctors insisted there was ""no cognitive damage,"" but in subsequent campaign appearances he's made several verbal slips that Republicans have called attention to while raising questions about his ability to serve.

Fetterman admitted to NBC News that his recovery ""changes everything.""

“But it gets much, much better where I take in a lot. But to be precise, I use captioning, so that’s really the maijing — that’s the major challenge. And every now and then I’ll miss a word. Every now and then. Or sometimes I’ll maybe mush two words together. But as long as I have captioning, I’m able to understand exactly what’s being asked,” he said.

Pennsylvania's battleground Senate race could determine which party will control the Senate next year, with Democrats currently holding a 50-50 majority and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking tie votes. Both parties have poured millions of dollars into the contest



Republican candidate Dr. Oz has sought to make Fetterman's health a major issue in the race. Oz has consistently trailed Fetterman in polls, but he has cut what was a double-digit lead for Fetterman in some surveys after the Senate primary in May to just a 3.7-point average differential by the end of September. He has attacked Fetterman for refusing to share his medical records with reporters and for only agreeing to one debate.

Burns pressed Fetterman on his refusal to disclose his medical records.

""If my doctor teams already said I'm fine, I'm not really sure that's much more beyond transparent,"" he replied, but Burns pointed out that the Fetterman campaign hasn't provided any of his doctors for interviews with the press.



""Well, I mean, if they believed that I was ready to do that, and I've been able to successfully do that kind of campaigning, I think that demonstrates what they said and their opinions were pretty accurate,"" Fetterman said. He insisted that he's been transparent by presenting himself on the campaign trail, where voters can see him and decide for themselves whether he is fit to serve.

"'We're not doing that, crooked cop': Woman holding terrified Walmart employee at gunpoint is put down","Holiday merriment quickly dissipated in a Mississippi Walmart on Wednesday when an armed woman took an employee hostage. On account of the quick thinking and good marksmanship of Richland police, that employee will get to see Christmas day.

What are the details?

Police initially responded to an incident involving a weapon around 5:45 p.m. at a Walmart in Richland off U.S. 49, reported WJTV. The matter soon devolved into a hostage situation.

Witnesses told WAPT that an agitated customer got into a confrontation with an employee in the customer services department.

The suspect, identified as 21-year-old Corlunda McGinister of West Helena, Arkansas, can be seen in footage of the incident pressing a handgun to a female Walmart employee, who appears wide-eyed and petrified.

Between semi-coherent outbursts, the suspect yanked the employee around by her uniform, with gun in hand.

In a longer version of the video, the suspect can be heard yelling, ""Everybody do what I say"" and repeatedly asking for a news anchor.

The individual who captured the ordeal on camera yelled out, ""Let her go.""

""We're not doing that, crooked cop,"" the suspect answered back.

Police appear towards the end of the longer video with their guns drawn. They calmly asked the suspect to put her hands up and her gun down.



Refusing to do either, the suspect then claimed, ""They trying to kill me.""

Although officers reassured her they had no such intention, the suspect neither released her hostage nor surrendered her weapon.



One shopper noted that as she tried to enter the Walmart, a mass of people began rushing out, some instructing others to leave.

""Of course we ran out. And it was just horrifying and then we heard the gunshot,"" said the witness.

Police fired on the suspect, thereby killing McGinister, restoring order, and saving the hostage. No one else was injured.

Around 9:20 p.m., the Richland Police Department issued a statement on Facebook indicating that ""all of our officers are safe! Walmart is secure and closed at this time. [The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation] will be conducting an independent investigation.""



While the Walmart employee got out with her life, RPD Chief Nick McLendon said, ""It's devastating for all parties involved — the officers, everybody that was involved in this situation. ... You know, with the Christmas season coming, mental health is a big deal because of the stress involved in the Christmas season.""

Walmart employees have suffered a bad turn of luck in recent weeks.

On Nov. 22, a manager at a Walmart store in Chesapeake, Virginia, went on a shooting spree, killing six people in the breakroom and then turning the gun on himself.

This story has been updated to reflect that the suspect said, ""We're not doing that, crooked cop."" The suspect was incorrectly quoted as saying, ""We're not doing this, good cop,"" in the original story.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-john-fetterman-stroke-nbc-news,2022-12-22
CBS News reporter frustrates Jean-Pierre for exposing hole in excuse for hiding details about Biden classified docs,"CBS News correspondent Weijia Jiang called out White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday for not being forthcoming with details about President Joe Biden's improper retention of classified documents.

The press secretary has claimed she is not divulging details about the discoveries of classified documents to avoid interfering with the Justice Department's investigation. But Jiang quickly exposed the hole in that claim.

""Why, then, did the White House Counsel go to Wilmington to facilitate the handing over of documents to the DOJ?"" Jiang asked. ""How is that separating the White House from the DOJ?""

Jean-Pierre did not answer. Instead, she deferred to the White House counsel's office.

""But it's related to something that you keep telling us, which is how much it is important to this White House to separate the White House from the DOJ’s investigation,"" Jiang pushed back. ""But the White House counsel was the one to go and facilitate the documents, to look for the documents.""

In response, Jean-Pierre admitted that she is not going to provide substantive answers.

""Look, guys, you guys can ask me this 100 times, 200 times, if you wish,"" she said responded. ""I'm going to keep saying the same thing.""

Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

Earlier in the briefing, NBC News reporter Peter Alexander called out the White House for attacking Republicans over concerns about Biden's actions.



""Why shouldn’t Americans be outraged about classified documents being found in a garage?"" Alexander asked Jean-Pierre.

After she dodged the question and regurgitated the Biden administration's narrative that absolves Biden of wrongdoing, Alexander pressed further.

""Why shouldn’t Americans be upset about documents found in a garage?"" he asked again.

But instead of answering the question, Jean-Pierre tried to shift away from the classified documents by downplaying how concerned Americans are with Biden's mishandling of them. Instead, she said, Americans care about the economy.

What is the WH saying?

On Monday, the White House went on the offensive and attacked House Republicans for vowing to investigate Biden.

""House Republicans are playing politics in a shamelessly hypocritical attempt to attack President Biden,"" said Ian Sams, a spokesman for the White House counsel's office.

Sams doubled down on Tuesday, accusing Republicans of ""political stunts and theater."" He also charged that Republicans are ""faking outrage"" because ""they defended the former president’s actions.""

Sams, however, did not cite any Republican lawmaker who defended Trump's improper retention of classified documents and his alleged refusal to return the documents.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/we-re-not-doing-this-good-cop-woman-holding-terrified-walmart-employee-at-gunpoint-is-put-down,2023-01-18
‘We’re going RINO hunting’: GOP candidate Eric Greitens’ ad gets banned on Facebook and violates Twitter rules,"Missouri Senate candidate Eric Greitens stirred controversy Monday after releasing a new campaign ad telling supporters to go ""RINO hunting.""

In the ad Greitens, the Republican former governor who resigned from office in 2018 amid sexual misconduct allegations, announced his Navy SEAL background and cocked a shotgun before declaring, ""We're going RINO hunting.""

RINO is an acronym that stands for ""Republican in name only."" It's used by conservatives and GOP activists to deride Republican elected officials they perceive as being too friendly with Democrats or insufficiently conservative.



""The RINO feeds on corruption and is marked by the stripes of cowardice,"" Greitens tells the camera before a Navy SEAL team breaches a house.



Urging his supporters to get a ""RINO hunting permit,"" Greitens says, ""there’s no bagging limit, no tagging limit, and it doesn’t expire until we save our country.""

""We are sick and tired of the Republicans in Name Only surrendering to Joe Biden & the radical Left,"" Greitens tweeted. ""Order your RINO Hunting Permit today!""

The ad was immediately controversial. Twitter assigned a notice to Greitens' tweet explaining that it violates Twitter Rules about ""abusive behavior."" But the tweet was not taken down because ""Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.""

Users can still find and quote the tweet, but commenting, retweeting, and liking have all been disabled to limit the post's reach.

Facebook took more drastic action and removed Greitens' video, according to CNN correspondent Donie O'Sullivan.

""We removed this video for violating our policies prohibiting violence and incitement,"" a Meta spokesman said. Meta is Facebook's parent company.

The ad prompted visceral reactions from the left on Twitter, which accused Greitens of inciting violence against members of his own party.

""This is sociopathic. You're going to get someone killed,"" Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) tweeted.

""Radical.. extreme… unhinged… today’s MAGA Republicans are a cancer to American democracy,"" said DNC chairman Jaime Harrison.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) blamed Republican leaders Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell for enabling ""MAGA radicals"" to run as Republicans.

""Now it's out of control & threatens everyone's freedom,"" Swalwell tweeted.

CNN anchor Jake Tapper observed that Greitens' ex-wife has accused him of physically abusing her and their children in legal filings for their ongoing custody battle.

But some conservative commentators were upset with Greitens' ad as well. Many pointed out that the video seemed intentionally designed to provoke outrage, which some cynically suggested Greitens might use to distract from his flaws as a Senate candidate or boost his media attention in the crowded Republican primary.

""A man with a history of domestic violence and abuse is trying to win by trolling his opponents in this way. Wow,"" said conservative radio host Erick Erickson.

""Reminder: this guy bound & blindfolded his hairdresser and took nude blackmail photos of her without her knowledge,"" noted ""Political Beats"" podcast co-host Jeff Blehar, referring to the allegations against Greitens that prompted him to leave office.



""All this? that's to distract you from the fact that this guy bound & blindfolded his hairdresser and took nude blackmail photos of her without her knowledge.""

Blehar also pointed out that Greitens was a lifelong Democrat who joined the Republican Party in 2015 when he first ran for office.

Conservative radio host Dana Loesch pointed out Greitens' hypocrisy on guns, calling him out for waving a gun around in his ad after he refused to support so-called ""constitutional carry"" laws and criticized the Second Amendment Preservation Act — dubbed SAPA — as governor.

Constitutional carry laws permit gun owners to carry their firearms without a license, while SAPA would have invalidated federal firearm restrictions on lawful gun owners.

The controversial ad follows a bipartisan deal in the U.S. Senate on a framework for gun control legislation. Twenty senators — 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats — have agreed in principle on a series of measures including incentives for states to adopt red-flag laws, expanded background checks for gun purchases, and funding for mental health and safety programs.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/weijia-jiang-jean-pierre-classified-docs,2022-06-20
"'We're in dangerous times': After 'terroristic threat' shuts down her HQ, Kari Lake remains steadfast, notes media's role","Kari Lake's campaign headquarters was targeted over the weekend by what her team reckoned to be a ""terroristic attack."" Lake noted that the alleged threat wasn't the first her team has had to deal with, but that it would be dealt with and the person responsible identified.

Dangerous times

On Sunday, Republican nominee for Arizona governor Kari Lake spoke to reporters in Queen Creek, Arizona, about her campaign headquarter's weekend encounter with suspicious packages, which allegedly contained white powder and threats.

Concerning the Oct. 5 discovery of the threats, Lake said, ""We're in dangerous times. ... This is not the first time we've been threatened. I've been threatened many times. Our tires have been slashed. We've had screws drilled into our tires so that our tires would blow out while we're on the road.""

Reiterating that these are dangerous times, Lake suggested ""that's why we need to elect somebody who's strong and a fighter and not a coward. We'll get to the bottom of this. I really don't want to get too far ahead of it.""

Katie Hobbs, the Democrat gubernatorial candidate who refuses to debate Lake, wrote in an op-ed on Saturday, ""The new GOP is led by extremist, radical stone throwers like Kari Lake.""



Hobbs, who has not recused herself from official duties overseeing the midterm election, also claimed, ""We can't risk Kari Lake.""

Arizona state Senator Wendy Rogers suggested that the potential risk to Lake's life must be addressed, demanding that the gubernatorial candidate be protected by the Arizona Department of Public Safety to ""err on the side of caution.""



What happened in Phoenix?

Around 10 p.m. on Saturday, two envelopes allegedly containing a ""suspicious white powder"" and ""abusive messages"" were discovered at Lake's campaign headquarters in Phoenix.

Just days after former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton stressed that Lake should not be elected, one of Lake's staffers reportedly opened one of the suspicious envelopes and was exposed to the powder.

A source told the DailyMail.com that in addition to the white substance, the envelope contained a letter with ""a bunch of vulgarities and ranting and raving about Kari.""

Having noticed that the second package resembled the first one, the young employee reported it.

The FBI, Phoenix Police, Phoenix firefighters, bomb squad units, and hazmat crews were dispatched to the scene



""When officers arrived, they learned there were suspicious items located inside the mail. Additional resources responded to collect the items and secure the area,"" said Sgt. Phil Krynsky.

Lake told reporters that ""a couple"" of staffers had been exposed, but that ""so far they're doing okay.""

""We're monitoring them,"" said Lake, ""and we want to make sure that everything's okay.""

Krynsky confirmed that there had been no reports of injury, but that the investigation was ongoing.

Although Colton Duncan, spokesman for the Lake campaign, indicated on Sunday that the powder was initially headed to Quantico for testing, Lake confirmed later in the day that it was now being tested at a local lab.

Lake said, ""We're going to find out what it was.""

Duncan emphasized that the Lake campaign's ""resolve has never been higher, and we cannot be intimidated. We continue to push full speed ahead to win this election on Tuesday.""

Media myopia, polarization



The alleged ""terroristic act"" that targeted the Lake campaign has not been met with the kind of media attention that the alleged attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband garnered in recent days.

GOP Chairman Ronna McDaniel tweeted, ""More violent threats against Republicans that most of the media refuses to cover - the same media that has attacked @KariLake relentlessly. This is completely unacceptable.""

Lake, who previously was a TV news anchor, has long criticized the mainstream news media and its bias.

Fox News Digital reported that Lake emphasized that the ""fake news media"" has been a big part of political polarization in the nation and ramping up tensions.

""We are in such polarized times, and this is one of the reasons I walked away from the fake news media, because I realized that the media is a big part of it, pitting people against one another,"" said Lake.

Referencing the threats her campaign has faced from anti-conservative, anti-Republican forces, she posed the question to reporters, ""You guys want us like this?""

Republican Senate nominee Don Bolduc was reportedly attacked before his New Hampshire debate last Wednesday.



Earlier this month, a Chicago man allegedly left a terrorizing voicemail threatening to assassinate the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Illinois, Darren Bailey.

On Oct. 18, the home of Republican congressional candidate Pat Harrigan's parents was reportedly riddled with bullets with his children sleeping inside.

In June, 26-year-old California resident Nicholas John Roske, who identified himself as a ""trans gamer girl,"" allegedly attempted to assassinate Supreme Court Justice Bret Kavanaugh. Roske was armed with a Glock 17 pistol and had in his possession a tactical knife, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, screwdriver, nail punch, crowbar, and duct tape.

Hundreds of pro-life pregnancy centers, pro-lifers, and churches were targeted in a series of attacks by pro-abortion terrorists in the lead up to and following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade.

WH press sec left silenced when reporter corrects her for claiming migrants are not walking across border: 'That’s exactly what’s happening!',"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was silenced on Monday when confronted over the Biden administration's contradictory COVID-19 vaccine policies.

What is the background?

Tennis superstar Novak Djokovic announced last week that he would not compete in this year's U.S. Open because he is not vaccinated for COVID-19.

Currently, the U.S. prohibits non-U.S. citizens from flying into the U.S. if they are not vaccinated for COVID.

""Non-U.S. citizen, non-U.S. immigrants: You must show proof of being fully vaccinated with the primary series of an accepted COVID-19 vaccine before you board your flight to the United States. Only limited exceptions apply,"" read guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

What happened with KJP?

At the White House press briefing, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked the obvious question: Why is Djokovic prohibited from briefly entering the U.S. to play in a tennis tournament, but unvaccinated migrants are allowed to enter the U.S. at the southern border?

""How come migrants are allowed to come into this country unvaccinated, but world-class tennis players are not?"" he asked.

At first, Jean-Pierre deflected and referred Doocy to question the CDC, absolving the White House — which runs the executive branch, under which the CDC falls — of responsibility, but Doocy pressed harder.

""They’re two different things,"" Jean-Pierre claimed.

""How is it two different things?"" Doocy pressed. ""Somebody unvaccinated comes over on a plane; you say that’s not okay. Somebody walks into Texas or Arizona unvaccinated; they’re allowed to stay. Why?""

08/29/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

The press secretary proceeded to claim ""that’s not how it works"" and that migrants are not pouring into the U.S. through the southern border.

""It’s not like somebody walks over and — that’s not — that’s not how —"" Jean-Pierre said before Doocy interjected.

""That’s exactly what’s happening!"" Doocy fired back. ""Thousands of people are walking in a day. Some of them turn themselves over. Some of them are caught; tens of thousands a week are not. That is what is happening.""

Doocy's sharp response left Jean-Pierre in silence. When she finally responded, she dodged the premise of Doocy's question altogether and instead praised President Joe Biden for the actions he has allegedly taken to address the border crisis.

When Doocy asked one final time about the CDC vaccine requirement for people who fly to the U.S., as opposed to entering on foot, Jean-Pierre steered the exchange toward Title 42 before turning to the next reporter.

For what it is worth, Title 42 does not mandate that migrants be vaccinated for COVID, but it permits the government to refuse migrants entry to stop the spread of disease.

Anything else?

Bill Melugin, a Fox News reporter who has spent considerable time reporting on the border crisis, confirmed that people do, in fact, freely walk across the border.

""Colleague @pdoocy is 100% correct. That is exactly what is happening at the border,"" Melguin wrote on Twitter. ""Not sure how many more videos we have to show, multiple times a day, to get this point across. And that doesn’t even account for the more than half a million gotaways who slipped thru since 10/1.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/were-in-dangerous-times-after-terroristic-threat-shuts-down-her-hq-kari-lake-remains-steadfast-notes-medias-role,2022-08-30
'What will you do for me?' Renowned Juilliard composer accused of soliciting sexual 'favors' from female students,"The Juilliard School, perhaps the most prestigious fine arts conservatory in the world, is currently facing a long list of sexual misconduct accusations leveled at several high-profile faculty members, both past and present. One particular professor has since been placed on leave while an outside law firm investigates allegations of ""decades-long abuse of women and power.""

On Friday, Robert Beaser, 68, a current faculty member and former chair of the musical composition department at Julliard, was placed on leave after the school received an open letter, signed by 500 musicians and other artists, which claimed that Beaser solicited female students for sex throughout his lengthy career.

Beaser first joined the Juilliard faculty in 1993. According to the accusations, Beaser regularly hosted female students for private lessons at his residence. One former composition student, whose name has not been disclosed, claimed that Beaser made ""repeated"" sexual advances towards her. In one particular instance, Beaser offered her a promising career opportunity on the condition that she provide him sexual ""favors"" in return.

""What will you do for me?"" he supposedly asked the student at the time.

""I knew that composition was a man’s field—I never had any allusions to it being different—and I knew how to play,"" the student wrote in a statement draft sent to the school. ""So I sucked it up, and dealt with the reality as best as I could.""

Other allegations against Beaser include repeated sexual advances and sexual relationships with students during the 1990s and early 2000s. As Julliard is an institution which serves mainly college-level and graduate-level students, romantic relationships between faculty and students would not necessarily be criminal in nature or even prohibited. However, pressure on students to offer sexual favors would likely be considered sexual harassment or sexual misconduct.

Beaser has agreed to ""step away from his teaching duties"" while the investigation unfolds, and on Sunday, Beaser told the Washington Post that he was ""more than willing to participate in Juilliard's outside investigation in order to protect and defend [his] reputation.""

Beaser is not the only Juilliard faculty member accused of sexual impropriety. Fellow composer John Corigliano has been accused of refusing to work with female students so that he might surround himself with more male students, ostensibly for romantic relationships. Corigliano denies the allegations.

""Such a position was neither my preference nor my policy,"" he stated. ""I have taken great joy in working with many very gifted young women and men in my long teaching career.""

Other former students have pointed fingers at late composer Christopher Rouse, who died in 2019. One female doctoral applicant claimed that Rouse attempted to kiss her after having dinner with her. The woman said her application to the school was rejected the day after she rebuffed him.

Juilliard spokesperson Rosalie Contreras confirmed that the school has hired an outside law firm to investigate the allegations. ""Sexual discrimination and sexual harassment have no place in our school community,"" she said in a statement. ""We take all such allegations extremely seriously.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wh-press-secretary-migrants-border-unvaccinated,2022-12-21
Press sec asked direct question about 'MAGA Republicans.' Her response — or lack thereof — speaks volumes.,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked Wednesday if the Biden administration considers ""MAGA Republicans"" a greater threat to the United States than individuals determined to be national security threats.

But she refused to provide a straightforward answer.

What is the background?

The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General released an alarming report this week disclosing that refugee vetting methods used during the withdrawal from Afghanistan were less than satisfactory.

The report said Customs and Border Protection ""did not always have critical data to properly screen, vet, or inspect the evacuees.""

""We determined some information used to vet evacuees through U.S. Government databases, such as name, date of birth, identification number, and travel document data, was inaccurate, incomplete, or missing. We also determined CBP admitted or paroled evacuees who were not fully vetted into the United States,"" the report explained.

""As a result, DHS may have admitted or paroled individuals into the United States who pose a risk to national security and the safety of local communities,"" it continued.

What did KJP say?

President Joe Biden has sharpened his partisan rhetoric in recent weeks, ramping up attacks on ""MAGA Republicans."" That is: Americans who support Trump but, in the eyes of Biden, threaten democracy.

In light of the DHS OIG report, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked Jean-Pierre a simple question: Who does the Biden administration believe is a bigger threat?

""In the last week or so, we've heard the president calling elected Republicans a threat to the country. Does he think MAGA Republicans are more of a threat to the country than people DHS says may pose a risk to national security and the safety of local communities?"" Doocy asked.

09/07/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

Jean-Pierre's response — or lack thereof — was telling.

Not only did she not answer Doocy's question, but she instead disputed the DHS OIG report and referred Doocy to question the DHS instead.

""DHS has disputed this report,"" Jean-Pierre responded. ""And it said it didn't take into account the key steps that we have taken as a U.S. government, the rigorous, multi-layered screening and vetting process that we take as a government, that was not part of the report.""

""Again, this report is not accurate. I know that our team has spoken to your team about this, and the DHS has provided a comment saying just that,"" she added. ""So again, I refer you to DHS.""

Anything else?

Exactly as Jean-Pierre said, the DHS disputes the findings of the OIG report. The agency claims that ""all Afghan nationals were screened, vetted and inspected prior to parole into the United States.""

However, the inspector general said that is not true.

""Although the Department asserted it provided sufficient evidence that all individuals were properly screened, vetted, and inspected, we could not confirm this assertion and reported data inaccuracies,"" the OIG report explained.

""DHS explained that recurrent vetting processes were established for all paroled Afghan evacuees for the duration of their parole period,"" the report added. ""However, we did not receive supporting data or other evidence to validate these assertions.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/what-will-you-do-for-me-renowned-juilliard-composer-accused-of-soliciting-sexual-favors-from-female-students,2022-09-08
WH takes coward's way out when confronted over Biden's praise of Coast Guard hero facing discharge due to COVID vaccine mandate,"The White House is refusing to answer questions about President Joe Biden's praise for a Coast Guard rescue swimmer who faces termination for not getting the COVID-19 vaccine.

What is the background?

After Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida last week, U.S. Coast Guard rescue swimmers traversed the dangerous floodwaters to rescue more than a dozen people.

After the rescues, President Joe Biden personally thanked one of the rescue swimmers, Aviation Survival Technician Second Class Zach Loesch. Despite his valorous service, Loesch is reportedly on track to be discharged from the Coast Guard because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19.

Loesch applied for a religious exception, but he was denied; his appeal of that decision was also denied.

""If I had asked any of the people I saved yesterday if they wanted to come with me even though I am unvaccinated, every single one of them would have said 'yes,'"" Loesch told journalist Kristina Wong. ""It just sucks that he thanked me yet his vaccine mandate is what's kicking me out.""

What did the WH say?

On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked whether President Joe Biden will reconsider his administration's vaccine mandate for military members after praising Loesch's heroism.

After saying Biden has the ""deepest respect"" for the U.S. Coast Guard ""heroes,"" Jean-Pierre refused to answer the question.

Instead, Jean-Pierre suggested the question is beyond her work purview even though it focuses on Biden, who is under her purview as the president's chief spokeswoman.

""I would refer you specifically to the U.S. Coast Guard on this issue, on this individual question,"" she said. ""It's not something that I would comment from here.""

""But, you know, there, of course, have been multiple vaccination requirements, as you know, in place for quite some time,"" she added. ""Again, I'm not going to comment from here on an individual case.""

10/04/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

What about the vaccine mandate?

The Biden administration mandated the COVID-19 vaccine for all service members last August.

But despite vaccine mandates being rolled back across the country, the military has retained it and is enforcing it against otherwise upstanding service members.

The decision to discharge members of the Coast Guard has become quite controversial, earning scorn from lawmakers and retired admirals alike.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-asked-maga-republicans-afghan-refugee,2022-10-05
"WH asked for evidence of voter suppression in Georgia, but press sec refuses 'to get into specifics'","The White House refused on Tuesday to provide evidence to verify its claim that voter suppression is happening in Georgia.

What is the background?

After early voting began in Georgia last week, the Peach State has experienced record turnout for early voting in a midterm election. Turnout, in fact, has almost eclipsed record levels for a presidential election.

Georgians are thus quickly dismantling Democrats' narrative that claims the election integrity law passed last year ushered in modern-day Jim Crow, seeking to restrict voting access in a discriminatory manner.

What did the WH say?

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked Tuesday whether President Joe Biden stands by his claim that Georgia's law is akin to Jim Crow laws.

After dancing around a direct answer, she indicated that Biden has not changed his position.

""High turnout and voter suppression can take place at the same time,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""One doesn’t have to happen on its own. They could be happening at the same time.""

When asked directly whether the White House believes voter suppression is in fact taking place in Georgia, Jean-Pierre said she did not ""want to get into specifics of what is currently happening in one race.""

""But doesn’t that record turnout show that Georgia voters are finding ways to vote, even amid the —"" the reporter followed up before Jean-Pierre interrupted.

""Look, again, I’m not going to get into specifics of what Georgia voters are doing,"" the press secretary interjected. ""What I am saying is that, you know, generally speaking, again — more broadly speaking, of course — high turnout and voter suppression can take place at the same time.""

10/25/22: Press Briefing by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre youtu.be

Anything else?

The response — that voter suppression still happens despite high voter turnout — is a narrative being parroted by Democrats and the media.

For example, the campaign of Democrat Stacey Abrams told Fox News high voter turnout in Georgia is a result of Democratic mobilization and voters who are enthusiastic to remove Gov. Brian Kemp (R).

""High turnout is not synonymous to voter access—rather the power of organizing and the urgency of voters to remove Brian Kemp and his allies’ far-right extremism from their communities,"" said press secretary Jaylen Black.

Meanwhile, Jonathan Chait wrote in New York magazine, ""The early results in Georgia are consistent with the outcomes of other voting restrictions. Evidence suggests voter suppression has little effect on turnout, because Democrats mobilize in response to restrictions, canceling out much or all of the suppressive effect.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-coast-guard-vaccine-manadte,2022-10-26
'View' panel explodes as Whoopi Goldberg insists each woman should be able to decide when unborn children begin to have rights,"Whoopi Goldberg, co-host of ""The View,"" loudly insisted that each individual woman ought to be able to decide at which point unborn children have rights.

Her remarks came during a heated panel discussion about the Women's Health Protection Act, a bill that would have codified federal abortion rights established by Roe v. Wade, overriding state pro-life laws.

The bill, however, failed to clear the Senate during a Wednesday night vote.

What are the details?

Guest co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, one-time press secretary for former Vice President Mike Pence, addressed the act and said that a majority share of Americans supports limiting abortion.

Griffin's fellow co-host immediately appeared to bristle at her remarks, and Goldberg in particular immediately went on the offensive.

“This is an uncomfortable conversation we have to have, at what point does a baby in the womb have rights separate from its mother?” Griffin asked before an irate-looking Goldberg interrupted.

She thundered, “Listen, it doesn’t matter what you think — when you think it is. If I don't think that that's when it is —""

Griffin interrupted, “Is that in, is it the ninth month? Is it the third trimester?”

Through the crosstalk — in which co-host Joy Behar insisted that it's ""none of your business"" — Goldberg fired back, “Listen, I don’t have to tell you — it’s your decision. What you do with your body and how your family works, and for me, I don’t care what your religious beliefs are.”

Griffin pointed out that she wasn't addressing it from a religious standpoint, and instead, was speaking from the point of view of having an ""important philosophical debate.""

“When does the baby in the womb have rights?” she demanded, but Goldberg refused to bend and instead, went to break rather than have to defend her stance.

"Wife of FBI-arrested pro-life activist tells Tucker Carlson her 7 children have been 'scared,' 'crying' since 25 agents with guns drawn showed up at their home","Ryan-Marie Houck — wife of Mark Houck, the pro-life activist who was arrested by 25 FBI agents with guns drawn last week — told Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Wednesday night that her seven children have been ""scared"" and ""crying"" since their father was taken from them.

“My entire front yard, you could barely see it,"" she explained. ""It was covered with at least 15 big trucks and cars, and there were ... 20, 25, 30, men, women ... in jackets with shields and helmets and guns ... they were behind cars. It was something I would never expect to see on my front lawn. It was crazy.""

She added that the experience was ""devastating"" and that ""it’s hard to even express the victimization and how traumatized we all are due to this unnecessary thing that happened to us.”

As for her children, she said ""the older ones, we can talk, we can cry. We’ve had some counseling, we have more counseling to do. And the little ones, they’re scared. ... There’s a lot of crying and a lot of unrestful sleep. A lot of kids in our bed at night and in the morning.”

What's the background?

Mark Houck faces up to 11 years in federal prison after he allegedly pushed Bruce Love to the ground outside a Philadelphia abortion clinic about a year ago; Love — a 72-year-old clinic volunteer — allegedly harassed Houck's young son.

Ryan-Marie Houck previously told LifeSiteNews that a ""pro-abortion protester"" would say awful things to her son — who was 12 at the time — such as ""you’re dad’s a fag.""

Houck's wife claimed Love got into ""the son’s personal space"" and refused to stop saying ""crude … inappropriate and disgusting"" things to the father and son.

Mark Houck ""shoved him away from his child, and the guy fell back"" and hit the ground. Love reportedly suffered injuries that required medical attention. But the incident went nowhere until President Joe Biden's Department of Justice charged Houck with a violation of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.

The FACE Act condemns anyone who uses ""force or threat of force or by physical obstruction, intentionally injures, intimidates or interferes with or attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person because that person is or has been, or in order to intimidate such person or any other person or any class of persons from, obtaining or providing reproductive health services.""

Now Houck, 48, faces a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and fines of up to $350,000.

'This was reckless and outrageous'

Peter Breen — Mark Houck’s attorney and senior counsel at the Thomas More Society — told Carlson the federal government is using its power to intimidate pro-life Americans and people of faith.

“This was not a federal crime,"" Breen declared to Carlson. ""We have controlling case law on that, strong defenses, but instead they’ve taken an innocent man and made an example out of him, presumably to send a message to pro-life people and people of faith across this country.""

Breen added, in reference to Houck's arrest: “This was reckless and outrageous. It put the Houck family in unnecessary danger ... We’ve offered to bring him in. Didn’t get a response. ... Even if you’re going to arrest a regular person, you just send a couple of agents, they knock on the door, not dragging the head of the family out, violating the sanctity of the home, pointing guns at them.""

Breen also told Carlson that the Thomas More Society has retained ""one of the best criminal defense attorneys in Philadelphia"" to help — and that those who want to help the Houcks can check out Defend Life Today.

"Wife hires mercenaries to kill her husband, but they refuse after befriending and partying with him","In the southwestern Indian state of Karnataka, a 26-year-old woman named Anupallavi was having an extramarital affair. Anupallavi, her mother, and her lover were keen to get Naveen Kumar, Anupallavi's husband, out of the picture, so they reportedly hired three contract killers to kidnap and murder him. Blood was ultimately spilled — just not Naveen's.

The Times of India reported that Anupallavi and her lover, Himavanth Kumar, reached out to three men named Harish, Magaraju, and Mugilan to kill Naveen. The sum Anupavalli paid to kill her husband, a flour mill owner and cab driver, was the equivalent of $1,126.35. She promised an additional $1,376.65 to the trio upon completion of the deed.

Harish, Magaraju, and Mugilan successfully kidnapped Naveen on July 23. They took him to the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu where, instead of making a corpse, they made a friend.

When the trio determined they couldn't kill Naveen, they took him partying.

Owed an additional $1,376.65 if they demonstrated to Anupallavi, a mother of two, that her husband was dead, the trio sent her a photograph of a drunken Naveen covered in tomato ketchup. The ketchup they hoped to pass off as blood.

It is unclear whether the photograph sent to Anupallavi insinuating Naveen's demise was believable, but it was certainly impactful. Upon seeing it, Himavanth is said to have committed suicide out of fear on August 1.

Naveen's absence became a point of concern for his sister, so she filed a missing persons report with Peenya police on August 2.

Four days later and 15 days after his initial kidnapping, Naveen returned home. When questioned by police, he suggested that Himavanth had been responsible for hiring the contract killers. Investigators reportedly confirmed the involvement of Anupallavi and her mother, Ammojamma, in the plot, both of whom were arrested along with Harish, Magaraju, and Mugilan.

"Wisconsin school board prohibits pride and BLM flags in classrooms, personal pronouns in school emails","One Wisconsin school district has refused to go woke. Both the school board and the superintendent have voted to ban the display of political and religious propaganda in classrooms and the inclusion of preferred pronouns in school-related emails.

On Tuesday, the Kettle Moraine School Board in Wales, Wisconsin, about a half-hour west of Milwaukee, voted unanimously to uphold a policy which prevents employees from displaying partisan political materials — including pride and Black Lives Matter flags and t-shirts — and religious messages for monetary or non-monetary gain. Faculty and staff are also prohibited from including their preferred pronouns in school emails.

""We live in a world where politics are highlighted, and it puts people in uncomfortable positions,"" superintendent Stephen Plum said earlier this month. ""I feel the staff can fully support students. I feel that every staff member, custodian and teacher ought to know that it's really in the best interest of the students to look out for them and to have strong, healthy relationships that develop therefrom.""

The school board came to the same conclusion, despite boisterous opposition from the public at Tuesday's meeting.

""If you have a policy that says 'nothing political,' does that mean you can't have a sign up that says, 'Support our Troops,' or 'Believe Women' or 'Save the Planet?' By some people's definitions, all of those things are political,"" said Christine Donahoe, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin. It is not clear whether Donahoe attended the meeting.

""It really looks like targeted attacks at specific viewpoints, like LGBT communities, or welcome and safe spaces to students of color,"" she added.

An incoming freshman to the district who identifies as transgender likewise opposed the measure.

""I don't want to be misgendered and I want people to know, especially if I'm meeting new people, I want them to know they can feel safe around me,"" said Edith Cramer, who claims to use he/him pronouns.

However, school board president Gary Vose stood by the decision.

""This isn’t a case where we’re trying to discriminate against any group or groups for that matter,"" Vose said, ""but rather just to bring clarity to allow staff to know where the line is drawn on these various things.""

Another parent who attended the meeting likewise expressed support: ""The vast majority of us demand that our schools focus on teaching our kids and not bringing divisive, politically charged issues into the classroom.""

The AP reports that the school district in Waukesha passed a similar policy last fall.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wifes-plot-to-kill-husband-epically-backfires,2022-08-17
Wisconsin school district closes Title IX case against boys who used wrong pronouns,"The Wisconsin school district that opened a Title IX investigation against three middle-school boys accused of sexual harassment for using the wrong pronouns with another student has closed the case.

The Kiel Area School District announced Thursday it had ""issued clear directives and expectations to all students involved in this matter for the purpose of preventing bullying and harassment and ensuring a safe and supportive learning environment for all of our students.""

""Based on these actions, and pursuant to District policies and procedures, the School District considers this matter closed,"" the board of education said in a statement.

Controversy erupted last month when news broke that the school district had filed a Title IX complaint against three eighth grade boys who had not referred to one of their classmates by the student's preferred pronouns of ""they/them."" The district said that by refusing to use the student's preferred pronouns, the boys had sexually harassed their classmate under the Biden administration's interpretation of Title IX rules.

School officials faced several violent threats from people outraged by the investigation, including bomb threats against the school and other local government institutions. A California man was arrested for making a death threat against a school district staff member.



The parents of the accused boys hired the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a conservative legal group, to defend their children against the accusation. The group sent a letter to the district in May arguing that the school had violated the boys' First Amendment rights and that the use of biologically correct pronouns does not constitute sexual harassment under Title IX or school policy.

In a June 2 follow-up letter, attorneys for the parents maintained that a Title IX investigation was inappropriate and that the case should be dismissed. Hours later, the district announced the matter had been ""closed,"" a release from the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty said.

""We are pleased that the Kiel Area School District has finally ended its misguided Title IX investigation,"" said WILL Deputy Counsel Luke Berg. ""While the District’s statement attempts to reframe the investigation, it was always primarily about 'mispronouning.' The District may not be willing to admit it publicly, but it has recognized that it has no legal basis to demand that our clients refrain from 'mispronouning' other students.”

The Kiel school board's announcement defends members of the administration and staff ""who have been criticized simply for carrying out the functions of their job.""

While the school's Title IX investigation is closed, the Kiel Police Department said Friday that law enforcement investigations into the violent threats made against the school are ongoing.

Rose Rabidoux, the mother of one of the accused boys, expressed thankfulness that the matter was settled.

“While we are glad that the District has ended its investigation, this dispute should have never been escalated to this point. We expect the Kiel Area School District to ensure that this Title IX complaint is not on my son’s record,"" she said. ""We are thankful to our friends, family, and community for their support.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/wisconsin-school-board-prohibits-pride-and-blm-flags-in-classrooms-personal-pronouns-in-school-emails,2022-06-06
"Woke hockey reporter suggests NHL player who refused to wear LGBTQ colors should return to Russia, fight Ukraine: 'Go back where you feel more comfortable'","E.J. Hradek, senior reporter for the NHL Network, suggested during a Wednesday broadcast that Philadelphia Flyers player Ivan Provorov should return to Russia and even fight Ukraine after refusing to wear LGBTQ colors during a pregame warm-up this week for religious reasons.

What's the background?

Provorov declined to skate before Tuesday's ""Pride Night"" game since his teammates were wearing rainbow colors for their warm-up, ESPN reported. The 26-year-old defenseman told reporters after the Flyers' 5-2 home win over the Anaheim Ducks that he intended ""to stay true to myself and my religion,"" the sports network said.

""I respect everyone,"" he told reporters, adding that he's Russian Orthodox. ""I respect everybody's choices.""

What did Hradek have to say about Provorov?

During an ""NHL Now!"" broadcast, Hradek had a few ideas about what Provorov could do if he doesn't want to take woke marching orders here in the U.S., including returning to Russia.

“Ivan Provorov can get on a plane any day he wants and go back to a place where he feels more comfortable, take less money, and get on with his life that way if it’s that problematic for him,” Hradek said.

The NHL Network reporter noted that Provorov ""has been in North America for a long time"" after having played two seasons in Manitoba, Canada, in the Western Hockey League and now playing in his seventh season for the Flyers.

“If this is that much of a problem for him to maybe assimilate into his group of teammates and in the community and here in this country, that’s okay — listen, you can feel any way you want. But the beauty is, if it bothers you that much, there’s always a chance to leave. Go back where you feel more comfortable,"" Hradek continued, before suggesting that Provorov join in the Russian war against Ukraine. ""I understand there’s a conflict of sorts going on over there; maybe get involved.”

OutKick said it reached out to the National Hockey League for comment regarding Hradek’s statements about Provorov but didn't hear back.



How are folks reacting?

A number of Twitter commenters have more or less declared war against Hradek and his ideas. Some examples:

""'Assimilate' is a terrible choice of words. No one should be forced into wearing gay pride gear. Sounds a bit authoritarian, no?"" one user said. ""Coming from someone who is all for gay marriage.""

""You are such a douche for criticizing someone for sticking by their beliefs,"" another commenter said. ""It’s called being honorable; you should try it sometime.""

""Telling him to go back if he can’t assimilate into the USA? Do you feel same about those who come to the USA but never learn English? Should they go back to their county of origin?"" another user wondered.

""The minute you punish/cancel those of differing viewpoints, you lose all credibility because when you take that step, it [shows] that your idea/concept is failing, and you can only 'win' by force,"" another commenter said.

""Yes...berate others until they behave how you want. They can't have an opinion. That's the leftist way,"" another user sarcastically pointed out.

Anything else?

ESPN writer Greg Wyshynski — who penned the sports network's initial story about the controversy and also blastedProvorov on Twitter — wrote a follow-up piece about the NHL's ""social activism partner"" You Can Play, which wants to ""work with"" Provorov after he ""negatively impacted"" Pride Night.

You Can Play COO Kurt Weaver told ESPN he's disappointed by how the Flyers and coach John Tortorella handled Provorov's refusal to wear the LGBTQ colors. Tortorella said he didn't consider benching Provorov and respected his personal beliefs.

""The concept of 'team' can mean a lot of things. I think more coaches have to ask what that cohesion of a team means to them,"" Weaver told the sports network. ""At what point does a decision like this that a player wants to make cross over into basically not showing up for your job? I think [Tortorella] did what a coach needs to do, which is support his player's decision. But I would hope that, behind the scenes, there's some more direct conversations around what it means to be a teammate.""

Weaver also weighed in on Provorov's faith as his reason for not visibly supporting the LGBTQ community.

""Players who do this sort of thing have a very short perspective on what it means. For me, religion is about charity and inclusion,"" Weaver added to ESPN. ""This wasn't just about a player and a jersey on a patch of ice. What else was affected by this? Visibility and proximity is what breeds understanding and inclusion, and those things were negatively impacted by this. It's disappointing to see that's the outcome from this.""

74-year-old woman brutally sucker-punched in face by much larger female during stroll down Manhattan sidewalk,"An elderly woman was brutally sucker-punched by a much larger female in a broad daylight attack in New York City last week.

What are the details?

The unprovoked punch was captured on surveillance video as the 74-year-old victim was strolling down Madison Avenue near East 52nd Street in midtown Manhattan around 11 a.m. Wednesday, the New York Post reported.

Video shows the suspect standing near a building, bending down to pick up a duffle bag, and then suddenly punching the victim in the side of her face as she walked by, the paper said.

Image source: New York Post video screenshot

The elderly victim stumbled and fell on the sidewalk several feet away as the suspect casually walked away in the opposite direction of where the victim had been walking, video shows.

Image source: New York Post video screenshot

A bystander appeared to come to the victim's aid, the Post said.

Video also shows the suspect – who was still at large Friday, the Post said – looking over her right shoulder toward the scene of the crime while lifting up her left hand apparently as if to blow off what she did.

Image source: New York Post video screenshot

The victim was taken to NYU Langone Hospital-Manhattan in stable condition, the paper said.

The suspect was wearing her hair up, was dressed in a white hoodie and black shorts, and was carrying a black duffel bag, the Post added.

Anything else?

A felon accused of sucker-punching a man in New York City earlier this month — fracturing the victim's skull and leaving him in coma — was released with no bail after charges against him were downgraded from attempted murder to assault and harassment.

The suspect was arrested a day later for a parole violation, the New York Post reported, adding that Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul claimed credit despite her refusal to roll back New York state’s controversial bail-reform law.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woke-hockey-reporter-suggests-nhl-player-who-refused-to-wear-lgbtq-colors-should-return-to-russia,2022-08-29
"Woman allegedly used 'large butcher knives' to dismember Chicago landlord, then placed body parts in freezer. Tenant charged with first-degree murder.","Earlier this week, Chicago police discovered the body of a missing landlord inside a freezer. On Wednesday, a female tenant renting a room at the residence was charged with the landlord's gruesome murder.



Police alleged that the woman, now identified as 36-year-old Sandra Kolalou, used ""large butcher knives"" to dismember the victim's body before placing the body parts in a freezer at the residence.

The landlord, 63-year-old Frances Walker, was reported missing Monday evening by another tenant residing in the home.

Police stated that a possible motive for the suspect to murder her landlord was that Walker had recently served Kolalou an eviction notice.

The other tenants in the home told authorities that they heard screaming around 2:30 a.m. on Monday. Concerned, they tried calling and texting Walker. Their phone calls went unanswered, but some received text message replies.

""The residents were very cooperative,"" said Chicago Police Chief of Detectives Brendan Deenihan. ""When they heard the scream, when they woke up in the morning, they immediately started texting the victim … started calling the victim. The victim didn't answer. There were some texts that were sent back from the victim's phone. It appears from what we know now that the defendant was sending texts from the victim's phone and not answering it.""

Authorities reported that tenants and the landlord had called 911 on Kolalou regarding past incidents. They also stated that the suspect has a criminal history of some misdemeanor offenses.

""Many of the tenants who lived in this house were afraid of this individual,"" stated Deenihan.

Kolalou was at the home when officers arrived to conduct a wellness check, but she refused to speak with them. The suspect left in a tow truck that, authorities later discovered, was allegedly paid for using Walker's credit card.

The tenants warned the tow truck driver about their housemate and, concerned for his safety, decided to exchange phone numbers with him.

The driver notified the tenants that he witnessed Kolalou throw a trash bag into a garbage can by the beach. Some tenants followed the driver to the location and looked inside the bag, where they discovered bloody rags and linens.

Police searched the home while Kolalou was still with the tow truck driver. When she learned that the driver communicated with her housemates, she allegedly pulled a knife on him. Officers arrived on the scene and took the suspect into custody.

During their initial search, authorities did not find evidence of foul play. However, after collecting the bloody rags from the trash bag, law enforcement returned to the home to search the premises again. They discovered blood inside Kolalou's room and the landlord's dismembered body shoved into a freezer.

When brought it for questioning, Kolalou chose to remain silent. She has been charged with first-degree murder and concealment of a homicide.

Police said, based on the preliminary evidence, they believe Walker was murdered in her bedroom and dismembered on the residence's first floor. Detective Deenihan explained that, with the setup of the home, it would have been possible for no other tenants to witness the crime.

""The way the residence is set up, there's a couple apartments on the top floor – call it the second floor – and then on the floor where the victim lived, that is the same floor that Sandra resided on as well. And then there was a tenant in the basement. And there were deadbolts so people had privacy,"" said Deenihan.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-74-sucker-punched-in-face,2022-10-14
Woman and her 2 sons found dead in Michigan field following 'mental health crisis',"A 10-year-old Michigan girl has tragically lost her mother and her two brothers after her mother experienced what officials have called ""a mental health crisis.""

For the past few weeks, 35-year-old Monica Cannady of Pontiac, Michigan, had been acting strangely. Relatives living in the area claimed that she had become ""extremely paranoid"" and that they had tried to intervene, but Cannady had ignored them. Neighbors had also reported seeing a woman and her children severely underdressed for the Michigan winter weather, but when officers went to the area to investigate, they could not find anyone who fit that description.

Sometime last week, Cannady took her three children — 3-year-old Malik Milton, 9-year-old Kyle Milton, and 10-year-old Lilly — out into the elements. Though the family still lived in the same Pontiac apartment where they had been for six years, they wandered about the city, knocking on doors and asking strangers for food. One man claimed he had offered Cannady money, but that she had refused it.

After being outdoors for perhaps as long as three days, Cannady and her children came to a field near the former Lakeside Housing Projects at Crystal Lake. Cannady then told them all to lie down and go to sleep. On January 15, Lilly woke up in the field and discovered that her mom and two brothers were unresponsive. She then walked to a nearby residence and told the inhabitants that her family was ""dead.""

When police arrived at the scene, the found the dead bodies of Cannady, Malik, and Kyle. Autopsy reports indicated that all three had died of hypothermia. Lilly is currently receiving treatment for hypothermia symptoms at a local hospital. She is expected to survive and to live with relatives. A GoFundMe account has been established on her behalf.



""The girl that survived woke up. No one else did,"" said Sheriff Michael Bouchard.

Bouchard also added context to the story: ""This tragedy was based in a mental health crisis. The woman, mom, was having a mental health crisis. She believes someone was trying to kill her and that everybody was in on it.""

He then claimed that Cannady had told her children to run and hide if anyone ever approached them, which may explain why officers were unable to locate any underdressed persons, as had been reported to them.

The children's paternal step-grandmother said she had no idea that Cannady was in such a troubling mental state. ""She was a good mama,"" Theresa Milton claimed. ""She took care of her babies. They were dressed warm, they had clothes always matching, hair done. They were clean.""

Cannady’s brother, Andre Harsten, is heartbroken about the death of his nephews. ""They was amazing, so smart,"" Harsten said. ""And it’s just so sad that they were so young, didn’t even get to experience life yet.""

Harsten also claimed that he had never seen his sister behave that way. ""I just want to know what happened,"" he stated. ""What was in her system? I need answers to that so I can know what type of state of mind she was in. This never, ever has been her.""

The children's father, Kyle Milton, was murdered in November 2021, and a suspect in the case is currently standing trial.

Woman falls headfirst into the toilet of an outhouse while trying to recover her cellphone with a dog leash,"A woman had to be rescued by firefighters after she fell through the toilet of an outhouse in Washington state while trying to recover her cellphone that she had dropped.

The Brinnon Fire Department said in a Facebook post on Apr. 19 that it was called to Mt. Walker by a report of a woman falling into a vault toilet.

They discovered a woman in her 40s who said that she had fallen into the toilet well after she dismantled a portion of the toilet and tried to use her dog leash to try to reach her cellphone. She then used the dog leash to lower herself into the toilet well, but it broke, and she fell headlong into it.

She told them she tried to get out by herself for about 20 minutes before calling emergency services.

Firefighters said they lowered some blocks that she used as a platform so that they could help her climb out with a harness. They said they recommended the woman seek medical attention after being exposed to human waste but that she refused and only wanted to leave after being washed down and being given a Tyvek hazmat suit to wear.

She said that she was not injured and that she did not require transport.

""The patient was extremely fortunate not to be overcome by toxic gases or sustain injury,"" said the post.

They posted a photograph of two firefighters smiling in front of the outhouse. The post went viral on Facebook with 4.5k shares and 1.5k comments.

“I’ve been doing this for 40 years, and that was a first,"" said Brinnon Fire Department Chief Tim Manly.

The post said that the woman thanked the firefighters for rescuing her and continued her trip to California.

"Woman in body armor shows up at church, points loaded gun at people walking into service — but detective is in attendance too","A woman wearing body armor and carrying two guns showed up at a Pennsylvania church Sunday morning and threatened people walking into the service, state police told WGAL-TV.

What happened?

Amber Espigh, 31, is accused in the incident at Bethel Assembly of God in the 1400 block of Holly Pike in South Middleton Township, the station said, which is about a half-hour southwest of Harrisburg.

Espigh said she was looking for a priest and intended to hold the person hostage, WGAL reported, citing charging documents.

Cumberland County District Attorney Sean McCormack told the station a county detective who was attending the service asked Espigh to leave, but she refused.

Police said Espigh then loaded a gun and pointed it at the detective and others, WGAL reported, adding that no shots were fired.

The station said the detective eventually convinced her to holster the weapon.

State police on Tuesday told TheBlaze it appears the suspect was outside the church building the entire time but was trying to enter.

State police said they were dispatched to the church just after 10 a.m. and that church attendees ""engaged in conversation"" with the suspect until police arrived and took her into custody ""without incident."" Police added there were no injuries.

""We avoided what could be a very tragic incident,"" McCormack told WGAL. ""We were lucky.""

What happened to the suspect?

The station said Espigh is facing numerous criminal charges, including:

risking catastrophe

unlawful body armor

harassment

simple assault

firearms not to be carried without a license

terroristic threats

She was listed Tuesday morning as an inmate at Cumberland County Prison. Bail is set at $500,000, WGAL reported.

McCormick said given that the suspect showed up at a church with a rifle and handgun, the bail amount is ""appropriate,"" the station said.

Police told WGAL that Espigh was involved in a burglary earlier in the morning in Fairview Township, York County.

Deputies: Woman jumps from moving vehicle to escape knife-wielding kidnapper — then pounds on doors in middle of night until she's rescued,"A woman jumped from a moving vehicle in southwest Washington state to escape from her knife-wielding kidnapper early Saturday morning — and then pounded on doors until a family helped her and contacted authorities, KPTV-TV reported, citing the Clark County sheriff’s office.

What went down?

The woman was in her vehicle in Vancouver, Washington, when a man approached and asked her for water, the sheriff's office told KPTV.

She gave the man water and let him enter her vehicle, and then he threatened her with a knife and took control of her vehicle, authorities told the station.

The suspect then drove to Camas, KPTV said — about 14 miles east of Vancouver. When the suspect slowed down along a dirt road, the victim jumped out and began knocking on doors of homes in the area, the sheriff's office told the station.

Around 4:30 a.m., a 911 caller reported that a woman was banging on the door of the caller's home, saying she had been kidnapped, KPTV reported.

Caitlin Martin and her husband, Jamie Woods, told the station they thought someone was trying to break into their house and hurt them and their children.

What's more, their 12-year-old daughter Addison was sleeping on a couch just feet from the door, the station said.

“I was shocked because I heard, like, banging on the door and the dogs barking,” Addison explained to KPTV. “And scared because I thought someone was trying to break in, and I saw my dad walk out and [talk] to her.""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Woods — who took video of the woman outside his home — told the station he was skeptical about her story at first but soon realized she was afraid and needed help.

Image source: YouTube screenshot

He recounted to KPTV that the alleged kidnapper actually drove by his house when he was talking to the woman.

“A white SUV KIA stopped at the stop sign for a couple of seconds and then took off,” Woods told the station. “She grappled on to me for comfort saying, ‘Oh my God, there he is, he’s gonna kill me!'""

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Deputies arrived at the home to take care of the woman, KPTV said.

“Police told us later on the next day that she was, in fact, kidnapped,"" Martin told the station. ""Then I was fairly happy that my husband was calm in the situation and made sure she was okay. But it was a scary situation.”

Image source: YouTube screenshot

Woods added to KPTV that he's ""just glad that nobody was hurt, nobody was killed. At the end of the day, everybody was safe for the most part.""

The sheriff's office told ABC News the female victim won't be identified at this time.

Captured!

Deputies located the victim’s vehicle after a search, the station said, adding that the suspect initially stopped but then took off to Vancouver, sparking an 11-minute pursuit just after 5 a.m. The pursuit ended when deputies, along with Vancouver police, pinned the vehicle when it came to a stop, KPTV said.

The sheriff’s office told the station the suspect refused to identify himself and that deputies were working on getting his name. The suspect was booked into Clark County jail on charges of first-degree kidnapping, first-degree robbery, attempt to elude, and reckless driving, KPTV said.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-in-body-armor-shows-up-at-church-points-loaded-gun-at-people-walking-into-service-but-detective-is-in-attendance-too,2022-09-06
Woman marries her cat to circumvent rental restrictions,"Deborah Hodge, a 49-year-old mother from London, married her cat India so landlords couldn't evict her for breaking their no-pets rule.

Hodge, according to the New York Post, was previously forced to re-home three other pets due to zero-tolerance regulations.

What are the details?

Hodge told South West News Service that the cat — a 5-year-old female tuxedo cat who lost a leg during a 2020 accident — is ""fundamentally the most important thing in my life after my children.""

“By marrying India, I need any future landlords to know that we come as a package and we cannot be separated under any circumstances as she is as important to me as the children,” Hodge explained.

Hodge and India married on April 19 at a public park.

“I recited vows under the universe that no man will ever tear myself and India apart,” she said of the unorthodox union. “I refuse to be parted with her. I’d rather live on the streets than be without her.”

What else?

Hodge was previously forced to give up three pets in a previous rental — two Huskies and a cat.

“It absolutely broke my heart,” she said. “Your pets become part of your family and it was just absolutely devastating having to say goodbye to them.”

Hodge said that she lost her job in March and is anticipating a new eviction as a result.

“I’m on my last pennies,” she admitted. “I’m terrified of losing India. I can barely leave my house with anxiety over what the future holds and I’m just desperate not to lose my cat.”

She said that the job loss motivated her to marry the feline so that any future landlords know that the two come as a package deal.

“I do not want to lose another beloved pet. I vowed in sickness and in health, in death do us part, and I meant it,” she said. “I don’t believe in organized religion; however, I do have faith,” she claimed. “India always came back, even after losing a leg. I am her universe and that is why I married her.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-jumps-from-moving-vehicle-to-escape-kidnapper,2022-04-26
Woman with blowtorch crashes 'repurposed' school bus on school property,"A woman wielding a blowtorch and driving a ""repurposed"" school bus has been hit with a string of charges after police say she led them on a chase before crashing on the property of a local Catholic high school.

Around 6 a.m. Tuesday morning, a gas station attendant in Mandeville, Louisiana, about 40 minutes north of New Orleans, called 911 and reported that a woman had just entered the store carrying an unlit butane blowtorch and asking the location of a nearby office for the Department of Children and Family Services.

The woman, later identified as 37-year-old Natalie Jade Jarvis, then left, driving away in an old, yellow school bus with a Virginia license plate and the words ""SEX TRAFFICKING AWARENESS"" spray-painted on the side. When police caught up to the bus a few miles north of Mandeville, Jarvis allegedly refused to pull over and instead led them on a chase through downtown Covington, Louisiana.

According to a report from the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office, Jarvis ultimately crashed the bus on the property of St. Scholastica Academy, an all-girl Catholic high school. The incident damaged some fencing on the property as well as a stop sign, and classes at the school had to be delayed several hours. Fortunately, no students were yet on campus, and there were no reported injuries.

Jarvis, the only occupant on the bus, was soon afterward arrested without incident, and a blowtorch was confiscated from the vehicle. According to jail records, she has been charged with a slew of crimes, including fleeing an officer, hit and run, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, terrorizing, and carrying a firearm or weapon by a student. Her bond has been set at $30,000.

A spokesperson for the sheriff's office said that law enforcement was already familiar with Jarvis, who has a Florida driver's license. Officers believe that she has been living in the bus at a nearby state park for about a month.

Last month, officers were called to the state park regarding a domestic violence incident, and a man who was likely living in the bus with Jarvis was arrested. Details about that arrest, including the name of the suspect, have not been released.

Woolworths supermarket chain refers to tampon users as 'people who menstruate',"Woolworths in Australia is accused of ""cancelling women,"" the Daily Mail reported Wednesday, after offering tampons to ""people who menstruate"" instead of to women.

What are the details?

According to the report, the store chain was announcing a partnership with nonprofit organization Share the Dignity, a group that provides free tampons in public vending machines.

In a LinkedIn social media post, the store wrote, ""The 100th Dignity Vending Machine funded by Woolworths has just been installed to help people who menstruate access period care items free of charge.""

""Together with Share the Dignity, we’ve helped more than 56,000 people access these essential products so that regardless of their circumstances, they can be afforded dignity, confidence and mobility during their period,"" the post continued. ""We aim to care for all Australians and are thrilled that the Dignity Vending Machines we've funded will help more people across the country access the products they need.""

What was the response?

Dr. Bella A'Brera, author and director of the Foundations of Western Civilisation Program at the Institute of Public Affairs, said, however, that the company's ""gender-neutral language undermined biological fact.""

""By caving into the extreme views of a vocal minority, Woolworths has decided to cancel women,"" A'Brera said. ""Woolworths needs to remember that it is a supermarket. Its purpose is to sell groceries, not radical gender theory.""

She told radio broadcaster Liam Bartlett that ""radical gender theory has embedded itself into all our institutions.""

“Woolworths refusing to use the word ‘woman,’ they are excluding their entire market because as you and I know, the only people who do menstruate are women,” she told Bartlett.

A spokesperson for the store said that the grocery store chain was not aiming to be political with its Share the Dignity partnership.

""Our partnership with Share the Dignity has helped provide period care products to tens of thousands of women and other people who need them across Australia,"" the spokesperson said, noting that such products are ""available to all women, girls, non-binary, and transgender people"" as well as ""family members collecting them on someone's behalf.""

An opposing viewpoint

In 2021, sexuality education consultant Joanna Anagnostou told Moxie that gendered language when discussing menstruation is damaging to people who identify as transgender and nonbinary.

""It reinforces the false idea that menstruation equals woman,"" Anagnostou said. ""This language implies that some may not be 'real' women if they do not have a period; it implies that trans men and non-binary people are women because they may have periods. It even implies that some cisgender (a person whose sense of personal identity or gender aligns with the biological sex they were assigned at birth) women are not women because they do not experience periods.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/woman-with-blowtorch-crashes-repurposed-school-bus-on-school-property,2022-04-20
Wuhan lab agreement with UTMB allows 'secret files' to be deleted at request,"The Chinese lab at the center of the disputed lab-leak origins theory for COVID-19 had an agreement with a U.S. lab in Texas giving both parties the right to ask their partner to destroy all records of their work, according to a memorandum obtained by the non-profit watchdog group U.S. Right to Know.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch signed a memorandum of understanding in 2017 that states either lab can ask the other to return or ""destroy"" any ""secret files, materials and equipment.""

Both of these labs study the world's most dangerous pathogens, and they have worked together since 2013, making their collaboration formal in 2018. Researchers at UTMB have received federal funding from the National Institutes of Health to conduct bio-safety training with their partners in Wuhan, who operate under the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences. The objective of the partnership was to promote research cooperation between the U.S. and China to control infectious diseases and protect ""laboratory safety and global health security,"" according to the memo.

The document states that either party ""is entitled to ask the other to destroy and/or return the secret files, materials and equipment without any backups.""



This confidentiality clause extends to any communications, documents, data, or equipment resulting from the two labs' collaboration and is retained after the agreement's five year term ends in October 2022.

“All cooperation … shall be treated as confidential information by the parties,” the memo states.

Experts that spoke to USRTK said the agreement contains broad language that should raise red flags, given that the Chinese government has obstructed international investigations into the COVID-19 pandemic's origins and the Wuhan lab has previously been accused of deleting viral sequences from a NIH database that could shed a light on where the virus came from.

“The clause is quite frankly explosive,” said Reuben Guttman, a partner at Guttman, Buschner & Brooks PLLC who specializes in whistleblower cases. “Anytime I see a public entity, I would be very concerned about destroying records.”

Guttman said that as a public university, the UTMB lab faces high standards for record-keeping under state and federal laws.

“You can’t just willy nilly say, ‘well, you know, the Chinese can tell us when to destroy a document.’ It doesn’t work like that,” he said. “There has to be a whole protocol.”

Legal experts interviewed by the Houston Chronicle agreed that records of the university's collaboration with the Wuhan lab would be subject to record-keeping laws and that the university should not be able to delete them because of a contractual agreement.

“You can’t contract away obligations under a statute,” Austin attorney Bill Aleshire, a specialist in public record laws, told the newspaper. ""Those are public records and … Galveston can’t destroy records that are part of a publicly funded document. And Wuhan sure as hell can’t ask Galveston to destroy its records.”

In a statement, UTMB spokesman Chris Smith Gonzalez told the Chronicle that the university ""has not been asked to destroy any documents nor would UTMB follow through with such a request.”

“As a government-funded entity, UTMB complies with all applicable public information law obligations, including the preservation of all documentation of its research and findings,“ he said.

The university added that it does not plan to renew the agreement with the Wuhan lab.

The language of the agreement with the Galveston lab raises questions about the Wuhan Institute of Virology's commitment to transparency and potential willingness to delete data on the orders of Chinese Communist Party authorities.

Chinese government officials removed genetic data from 22,000 virus samples from an internet database in September 2019 and has since refused to turn over data, frustrating scientists and U.S. intelligence officials investigating the origins of the pandemic. In June 2021, an American scientist named Dr. Jesse Bloom published research that showed early COVID-19 virus samples from the Wuhan seafood market — where the first major outbreak of the virus was reported — were not fully representative of the viruses actually present in Wuhan at the time. Scientists said that Bloom's work suggested COVID-19 had been spreading in Wuhan earlier than Chinese officials claimed and called for greater transparency from China.

Bloom also discovered that the Chinese scientists had asked an NIH database to remove viral sequences from its database and that the government complied with their request. NIH later confirmed this to the Telegraph.

Dr. Zhengli Shi, the lead researcher at the Wuhan lab, has previously denied accusations from Western bio-security experts that her lab deleted records relevant to the origins of COVID-19.



“Even if we gave them all the records, they would still say we have hidden something or we have destroyed the evidence,” she told MIT Technology Review in an interview, calling the accusations ""baseless and appalling.""

Scientists are divided on the origins of COVID-19, with most believing that the virus naturally evolved, although a lab-leak origin has not been ruled out. The Chinese government's lack of transparency is obstructing the truth.

"Pennsylvania police say family of three found dead in their backyard had a murder-suicide pact, daughter had posted bizarre videos online","Pennsylvania police say that a family of three people found shot to death had made a suicide pact with each other.

West Manchester Township police said in a press release that they were called at about 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday to a home on Loman Drive in the town of York, which lies south of Harrisburg.

Neighbors called the police after seeing lights at the home left on all night and then seeing what appeared to be bodies under a tarp in the backyard.

On Thursday, the York County Coroner said that the incident had been a planned homicide and suicide. The coroner's report said the three people had pre-planned their deaths.

According to the report, 59-year-old Deborah Daub and her husband 62-year-old James Daub died as a result of homicide, while their 26-year-old daughter Morgan Daub died by suicide.

Police believe Morgan Daub shot each of her parents in the head and then killed herself with a gunshot wound to the head.

""We want to make sure the public knows that there is no present danger,"" police said in a statement.

Neighbors told WHP-TV that the family had recently moved into the home and that they mostly kept to themselves.

WHP reported that a person identifying herself as Morgan Daub posted a bizarre video on social media expressing extreme views. A neighbor confirmed that the woman in the video looked like her deceased neighbor.

Daub says in the video that she is abdicating the throne of England and refused to be crowned the queen. A second video published from the same account on Tuesday read simply, ""Follow me as I follow Christ."" A third video accused former President Donald Trump of spying on her and her family.

Police are still investigating but said no charges will be filed.

Here's a local news report about the incident:

"'You're gonna die': Michigan man threatened to kill FBI director and Dem congressman, feds claim","A Michigan man has been accused of posting messages on social media which threatened the lives of the director of the FBI, a Democratic congressman, and others. He has also been accused of leaving at least one threatening voice mail message.

According to a criminal complaint filed by the FBI, Neil Walter, 32, has been transmitting ""interstate commerce communications containing a threat to injury the person of another"" in Facebook posts he allegedly made regarding FBI Director Christopher Wray, Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.), and others. He also made threats via phone.

On November 3, Walter supposedly called Garamendi’s office in Washington, D.C., and left the following message: ""John. Hey, John. You’re gonna die, John. You’re gonna die.""

On that same day, Walter also reportedly posted a Facebook message which read: ""Same s***, different guy. Also raping an infant to the death of her in an LA sex trafficking rape prison in conjunction with the CIgay and the US embassy.

""Have a nice life John, your gettin put down for life bud.""

Garamendi was also tagged in the post.

Criminal complaint - Walter.pdf

Garamendi is not the only person Walter has supposedly accused of engaging in pedophilia. The criminal complaint alleges that, in various social media posts, Walter has expressed concerns that billionaire Twitter owner Elon Musk; actor Tom Cruise; members of the FBI, CIA, and several police departments; and ""half"" of all U.S. Senators ""are involved in a child slave rape ring.""

Then, during a Facebook Live stream featuring Christopher Wray, Walter supposedly posted a series of threatening comments about the FBI director, including:

""Director Wray is going to die every single day multiple times a day for raping my family over and over.""

""I will kill you i will you I will kill you director Wray you will die I will kill you in self defense.""

""Get prepared for your killings , out of self defense for violating my human rights and my girlfriends.""

Screen shot of federal criminal complaint

On November 8, officers with the Metro Police Authority of Genesee County confronted Walter outside his residence in Grand Blanc, Michigan, about 15 minutes south of Flint. When he answered the door, he reportedly had ""a firearm in his hand"" and refused to cooperate. Eventually, he agreed to put the gun in his pocket, the complaint stated, but he ""kept his hand over the firearm during police contact."" Though he never threatened anyone during the interaction, Walter did insist that he would defend himself against the U.S. government, the complaint added.

Walter's parents, Lloyd and Terri Walter, have informed investigators that their son has evinced mental instability in recent years and that he hasn't been accepting treatment lately. In December 2021, Walter was involuntarily committed to a mental health care facility out of state and diagnosed with an unspecified psychosis, Terri Walter alleged.

His mother also alerted the FBI that her son may have another unregistered revolver in his possession. The firearm he carried during his interaction with police was purchased and registered legally.

The criminal complaint against Walter, filed by FBI agent Sean Thomas and signed by Judge Patricia T. Morris, seeks a warrant for his arrest. The crime of ""transmitted in interstate commerce communications containing a threat to injury the person of another"" carries a sentence of up to five years in federal prison plus fines.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/york-daub-suicide-pact-murder,2022-11-23
Youngkin refuses to buckle when CNN anchor claims pro-parental rights rules are 'excluding' LGBT kids and their affirming parents,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) refused to cave Sunday when CNN anchor Jake Tapper challenged the fairness of a new regulations that protect the rights of parents.



What is the background?

Last month, Youngkin issued new rules mandating that students must use bathrooms and pronouns that correspond to their biological sex. They are also required to play on sports teams with members of their biological sex.

Importantly, the rules do not exclude transgender students — or anyone protected by federal law — from living out their identity. The emphasis of the rules, which overturn progressive regulations enacted by Democrats and former Gov. Ralph Northam (D), is the protection of parental rights. The previous rules, in fact, directed schools to decide on a ""case-by-case"" basis whether to share information with parents regarding this issue.

Under the new rules, transgender students can live out their gender identity at school only if their parents have formally requested it.

Importantly, the rules also emphasize protection of First Amendment rights:

The First Amendment forbids government actors to require individuals to adhere to or adopt any particular ideological beliefs. Practices such as compelling others to use preferred pronouns is premised on the ideological belief that gender is a matter of personal choice or subjective experience, not sex. Many Virginians reject this belief. Additionally, the First Amendment guarantees religious freedom and prohibits compelling others to affirm ideas that may be contrary to their personal religious beliefs.

What happened with Tapper?

Questioning Youngkin on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Tapper advanced a fallacious argument: The new rules excludes people.

After noting that the ""American Academy of Pediatrics says these kinds of laws can increase the risk of depression, anxiety, and even suicide among transgender youth,"" Tapper told Youngkin that ""it sounds like you're excluding parents that might be supportive of their child going to the bathroom or joining a sports team that is in alignment with their gender identity.""

But Youngkin swiftly shot down Tapper's claim.

""Certainly not. If parents actually want their child to be able to change a pronoun or their name or use a bathroom, if parents choose that, then, legally, that's what the schools will do,"" Youngkin explained.

Tapper presses GOP governor on policies for transgender students www.youtube.com

The entire point of the rule change, Youngkin earlier explained, was ""to fix a wrong,"" namely those progressive rules enacted by Virginia Democrats.

""Parents have a fundamental right to be engaged in their children's lives,"" he said.

""And oh, by the way, children have a right to have parents engaged in their life,"" Youngkin continued. ""We needed to fix a wrong. The previous administration had had a policy that excluded parents and, in fact, particularly didn't require the involvement of parents.

""Let's be clear: Parents have this right — and children don't belong to the state,"" the governor declared.

Anything else?

The rules will take effect after a 30-day public commenting period, which opened on Sept. 26.

""It is not under a school’s or the government’s purview to impose a set of particular ideological beliefs on all students,"" said Youngkin press secretary Macaulay Porter last month.

""Key decisions rest, first and foremost, with the parents,"" Porter added. ""The previous policies implemented under the Northam administration did not uphold constitutional principles and parental rights, and will be replaced.""",https://www.theblaze.com/news/you-re-gonna-die-michigan-man-threatened-to-kill-fbi-director-and-dem-congressman-feds-claim,2022-10-10
Zelenskyy rejects the possibility of a Ukrainian ceasefire despite Putin's openness as grain supply issues threaten global food shortages,"This weekend, the leaders of France and Germany pleaded with Russian President Vladimir Putin for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine to no avail as Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy each refused to make concessions to their counterparts and end the fighting in the eastern regions of Ukraine.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pleaded with Putin to begin “serious direct negotiations” with Zelenskyy to reach a “diplomatic solution to the conflict,” the New York Post reported.

In response, Putin said that the West is complicit in perpetuating the violence because of its “dangerous” efforts to supply Ukraine with munitions, military equipment, and financial support. Putin warned Macron and Scholz that the West’s continued support for Ukraine risks “aggravation of the humanitarian crisis.”

Scholz and Macron also sought the release of 2,500 prisoners of war captured by Russian forces and an end to the Russian blockade of the port of Odessa. Ending the blockade of this port is crucial to normalizing global agricultural supply chains as it normally handles millions of tons of grain each year.

Despite Putin’s insistence of “the openness of the Russian side to the resumption of dialogue” with Ukraine, the Russian president moved forward with efforts to expand the size of his military and signed new legislation that will eliminate the upper age limit of the men recruited by the Russian military.

The new law passed the Russian Duma on Wednesday and will allow Russian citizens over the age of 40 to enlist. It also removes restrictions that previously limited the Kremlin’s hiring of foreign mercenary fighters.

Zelenskyy, who spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently, said that the ongoing invasion of Ukraine could cause a global food crisis.

Zelenskyy said, “We must work together to prevent a food crisis and unblock [Ukrainian] ports.”

Nearly 22 million tons of grains are stranded in Ukraine as Russian forces continue to blockade Odessa and other ports, Zelenskyy confirmed.

As fighting continues in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where Russia has claimed victory over Ukrainian cities and continues to advance forces throughout the region, Zelenskyy refused to accept any possible ceasefire that would forefit lands previsouly belonging to Ukraine. Echoing previous statements, Zelenskyy promised that Donbas would be “Ukrainian again.”

Zelenskyy said, “We have to increase our defense, increase our resistance, and Donbas will be Ukrainian again. Even if Russia will bring all suffering and ruination to Donbas, we will rebuild every town, every community. There’s no real alternative.”",https://www.theblaze.com/news/youngkin-tapper-parental-rights,2022-05-28
911 dispatcher charged with involuntary manslaughter after refusing to send ambulance to woman in distress,"Police have arrested 911 dispatcher Leon ""Lee"" Price in connection to the death of Diania Kronk, a Pennsylvania woman who died a day after Price refused to send an ambulance to her home.

According to reports, Kronk's daughter Kelly Titchenell, 38, called 911 in July 2020 as she drove to Kronk's residence. Titchenell was worried because her mother had been drinking heavily lately and demonstrated signs of severe mental impairment. She begged Price to send an ambulance to her mother's home in Sycamore, Pennsylvania, an unincorporated rural area approximately 50 miles south of Pittsburgh.

However, Price repeatedly asked Titchenell to assure him that Kronk would, indeed, ""be willing to go"" to the hospital if an ambulance arrived. Titchenell told him several times that she would.

“She will be, ’cause I’m on my way there,"" Titchenell said on the 911 call. ""So she’s going, or she’s going to die.”

Price then continued to ask for further assurance that Kronk would go to the hospital. “We really need to make sure she’s willing to go,” he told Titchenell.

""Ok, well, can we just try?"" Titchenell replied. Price then asked Titchenell to call 911 back when she arrived at Kronk's home. However, Titchenell said she couldn't locate her mother's landline and that she had no cellphone service in the area. She also added that she thought another 911 call wouldn't do any good.

When Titchenell arrived at Kronk's home, Kronk was sitting on the front porch naked and babbling incoherently. After some coaxing, she agreed to put on a robe, but still adamantly refused to go to the hospital, insisting to her daughter that she was ""fine.""



Kronk's son found her deceased the next day. According to Titchenell, the autopsy states that Kronk died of internal bleeding. She was 54.

“This is unheard of, to me. I mean, they’ll send an ambulance for anything,” Titchenell said. “And here I am telling this guy that my mom’s going to die. It’s, like, her death, and she doesn’t get an ambulance.”

Price, 50, has now been charged with involuntary manslaughter, as well as reckless endangerment, official oppression, and obstruction. He was arraigned on June 29 and released on bail.

Titchenell has also filed a lawsuit against Price, Greene County, and two 911 supervisors, hoping to prevent such a tragedy from befalling another family.

“It has to be very clear throughout the entire state that when you call, it’s not going to be conditioned on somebody on the other end of the phone saying there’s going to be a service provided or not,” said Lawrence E. Bolind Jr., Titchenell's lawyer. “What we’re trying to do here is make this never happen to somebody else.”

Marie Milie Jones, a lawyer representing the county and the two supervisors, called the situation ""unfortunate,"" but claimed that the defendants are not responsible for Kronk's death. She also confirmed that “personnel matters"" regarding Price ""are ongoing” but did not elaborate further.",https://www.theblaze.com/news/zelenskyy-rejects-the-possibility-of-a-ukrainian-ceasefire-despite-putin-s-openness-as-grain-supply-issues-threaten-global-food-shortages,2022-07-12
Rep. Lauren Boebert: Is Becerra the grooming secretary?,"The political left has been talking a lot about gender reassignment surgeries for children, calling it “gender-affirming care.” I call it child abuse.



In a recent document released by Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, his Office of Population Affairs stated, “Gender-affirming care encompasses many facets of healthcare needs and support, [and] it has been shown to increase positive outcomes for transgender and nonbinary children and adolescents.”

Let’s break this down. First, this document is talking about young children — not adults, not just teenagers — but specifically children. Second, the demand of this document is clear: The only “safe” environment is a “gender-affirming” one, which sounds harmless until you learn that means puberty blockers, then cross-sex hormones, and finally mutilation surgeries, including the removal of the breasts of young girls and cutting off the genitalia of young boys.

Most commonsense parents in America can look at this and roll their eyes, knowing a woke administration is pandering to the LGBTQQIP2SAA (yes, that’s a real thing) base of the Democratic Party to actively engage in these very real abuses of children.

A California law passed in 2018 allows children as young as 12 years old to receive taxpayer-funded transgender treatments and services without parental consent.

In a recent House Budget Committee hearing, I asked Secretary Becerra if American tax dollars are funding gender reassignment surgeries on children. He responded, “Americans are entitled to receive health care services. If they are entitled to receive any of the services that you just mentioned, then it would be against the law for us to try and deny them that care.”

In D.C., that is politispeak for yes.

Becerra’s HHS issued another document from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network that threatens parents with the removal of their children if they do not consent to the irreversible mutilation of their children’s bodies. The document, titled, “Gender-Affirming Care Is Trauma-Informed Care,” states, “The decision for the child welfare system to become involved, in the lives of families, potentially to the extent of removing from their families or homes, should be wielded with the utmost care.”

Allow me to translate: Support the mutilation of your child’s body, or we may remove them from your custody. Don’t worry, this is all on a case-by-case basis.

This is not a threat, it’s a warning, and in fact, it’s already happening.

In Hamilton County, Ohio, a teenager was removed from the custody of her parents after they refused to allow their daughter to undergo hormone treatments.

In Los Angles, a 15-year-old girl was removed from her home and placed in foster care after her mother refused to allow testosterone shots. Tragically, the teenager then committed suicide by stepping in front of a moving train.

The truth is this is far worse than politispeak and pandering to the base. This is a concerted effort across the federal government to groom children into woke ideology. The American people deserve to know on what authority the federal government is using their tax dollars to sexualize childhood and ultimately mutilate children. And, exactly how much of our money is going to this abusive behavior? Parents need to be aware of what the Democratic Party is up to.

The border crisis, the energy crisis, and the logistics crisis have all been hallmarks of the Biden regime’s reign. Now we have a new crisis advanced by Biden’s groomer in chief: the sexualization and mutilation of our children. And we cannot afford to lose this one.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/911-dispatcher-manslaughter-refusing-ambulance,2022-04-27
"Commentary: Alleged child sex abuser operated for four years on Twitter. He had 290,000 followers.","It’s not rare for arrests to be made of people distributing child sexual abuse material on Twitter. Evil exists in the world, but it’s great when it’s stopped and not allowed to continue.

A female former child care worker was arrested for trying to sell child sexual abuse material on Twitter. Savannah Noel Hawthorne, 22, was arrested for distribution of child sexual abuse material and possession of child sexual abuse material, according to the Stillwater Police Department in Oklahoma. “On Friday June 3, 2022 SPD detectives, along side with Enid and OSBI, served a warrant in Enid in the Hawthorn residence where Hawthorn was arrested,” said Lt. T.J. Low.

Unfortunately, every single piece of child sexual abuse material imagery includes a minor being sexually abused. It is something stolen from each victim that they can never get back. To make matters worse, it’s been documented and often shared. In some cases, for the child being sexually abused in the imagery, time is of the essence. It can be a matter of life or death to locate them and get them out of an abusive situation as quickly as possible. In 2021, Twitter made 86,666 reports of child sexual abuse material to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

This next case stood out to me right away, because it’s particularly egregious on multiple levels. On June 9, 2022, Nitikorn Manop, 29, was arrested in the Cha-am district, Phetchaburi, of Thailand. The suspect was charged with human trafficking, child exploitation, and production and distribution of child pornography, Pol. Maj. Gen. Wiwat Khamchamnarn, head of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division, said on June 12. What stood out about this story is that this predator operated on Twitter for four years and had 290,000 Twitter followers. He allegedly used Twitter in some cases to lure minors. He would sexually abuse minors, film them without their consent, and often post the abuse on the Twitter main feed. He also reportedly sold links and access to a subscription model for others to have access to view this abuse. Why did it take so long to catch this predator? How much advertising revenue was created for Twitter by this profile, specifically using child sex abuse as the content?

In four years of operating openly on Twitter, there were no reports on this specific account made by concerned Twitter users or survivors? If there were reports made on this account, were they ignored or, worse, reviewed and left up, as we’ve seen in the cases of John Doe #1 and Joe Doe #2 Twitter case?

In a situation where there are no reports, why didn’t Twitter’s proprietary tools catch this predator? The technology that Twitter uses can most certainly scan for keywords, account behaviors, and suspicious activity. We’ve seen very real examples of how advanced this technology is during COVID-19, the Hunter Biden story, and anything to do with election fraud, so why would Twitter fall short in this case?

Those issues would have been classified as “harmful” by Twitter, but isn’t child sexual abuse imagery harmful? It’s harmful to the victims and harmful to people who inadvertently stumble on this content. It’s not as if they didn’t have a heads-up that this type of behavior was a problem. In May 2020, a similar case occurred with Twitter. “The man, Thai media reports as ‘Kittiphong’, uploaded and sold the child pornography on Twitter and the messaging app Line. He had a membership fee of 350 baht, or around $11 USD. Authorities gained information through the online reporting system CyberTip, the Chiang Rai Times reports. Police from immigration, anti-trafficking division and the Thailand Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force raided Kittiphong’s room in Bangkok and found 8 cell phones with photos of children. The background of the photos matched the man’s room. He was arrested and charged with child pornography for financial exploitation. He is also facing charges of sexually abusing children 13 years old and younger.”

I suggest that Twitter stop trying desperately to control the political narrative around the issues of the moment and innovate around these issues that matter. Invest in this issue of detecting, removing, and reporting child sexual abuse material, because it has real-world consequences when platforms fall short in response time. I spoke about these issues and possible solutions in a recent article for TheBlaze.

The children abused often have no voice, so we must speak for them until they have the opportunity to speak for themselves. Speaking about these issues applies pressure on tech companies like Twitter to make changes. Hopefully we can start to prevent these crimes before they happen, and if they do happen, tech companies must act in a timely fashion.

Chip Roy: Not one additional penny for federal tyranny,"America is not right.

America is not right because she is being pulled apart — pulled apart by Democrat politicians intentionally breaking down America’s long-standing norms, her institutions, and her economic and military superiority. Too harsh?

Dangerous cartels are pouring fentanyl and trafficked human beings into our communities and undermining national sovereignty through a purposefully uncontrolled, wide-open southern border. Bureaucrats at the IRS, FBI, and “public health” agencies are running amok, targeting taxpayers and political opponents and firing Americans quite literally for making their own health care decisions.

Our self-inflicted energy crisis is sending prices through the roof, weakening our grid, and sabotaging national security. Health “care” has been handed over to insurance companies and is too expensive and increasingly unattainable for millions because of a politically motivated focus on “coverage.” Our schools are literally teaching children to apologize for their country under the tenets of critical race theory and to reject the “radical” idea that there is a difference between man and woman. And even our military is facing a recruitment crisis in the wake of the incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan because it is increasingly prioritizing wokeness over lethality.

Yet the GOP needs to look in the mirror, too.

Republicans too often join Democrats to write blank check after blank check to fund every last bit of this radicalism, fueling rampant inflation in the process. Worse, they offer only “big talk” political campaign rhetoric and tepid, aging ideas more suited to advancing corporate and defense industry largesse. And big corporations are happy to oblige – profiting off crony capitalism and knowingly advancing an environmental, social, and governance movement that is actively destroying small businesses, free enterprise, and liberty. And all of this is steamrolling a working class who are left to wonder what happened to their country.

Enough.

Republicans must prove to the American people that we will no longer be complicit in this deconstruction of America. But it is simply not good enough to say, ""Trust us and put us back in charge."" We have to mean it. We must stand up. And we must demonstrate that we will fight for the people who sent us to Washington after telling them we would.

We can do just that, one final time before the upcoming election, by pledging to our constituents that we will not provide one more penny to fund the tyranny carried out by the Biden administration.

The tools to take action are readily available to us – it’s just a matter of Republicans finding the collective will to use them. Article I of the Constitution grants Congress absolute authority over federal spending. James Madison, the father of the Constitution, wrote, “This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people …”

Federal funding for fiscal year 2022 expires on September 30, and Congress will have to decide whether to pass either short-term funding with a “continuing resolution” or a full appropriations package for 2023. But neither of these bills can pass without Republicans' votes.

Here’s how this will work. Democrats will say something like, “We can’t pass appropriations by September 30, so we’ll do a short-term continuing resolution until mid-December, throw a little money at Ukraine, etc., and then we can handle this after the election.”

Republicans must loudly and emphatically reject this business-as-usual approach. Don’t hide behind Ukraine or whatever the “emergency” of the day may be, and do not cower in the corner fearing that we may be “blamed” for a government shutdown. Just say no.

Therefore,House and Senate Republicans should pledge to reject any continuing resolution that expires prior to the first day of the next Congress, as well as any appropriations package put forward by Democrats this year, whether it’s before or during the upcoming “lame-duck” session.

This would empower the American people to decide – through the November elections – how taxpayer dollars should be spent by the new Congress that begins in 2023.

Any member of Congress who wrings his hands about this approach should be prepared to explain to the American people why he supports funding a bureaucracy that is fundamentally at odds with their freedom, security, and prosperity.

Republicans should explain why they are willing to give nearly $60 billion to petty tyrants like DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who lied to Congress when he claimed DHS had “operational control” of the border. Border Patrol has apprehended over 3 million illegal migrants since President Biden took office, 1 million of whom have been released into the interior U.S., with roughly 900,000 known “gotaways.” And cartels are trafficking increasing amounts of deadly fentanyl, which caused 71,000 “overdose” deaths in 2021, into our communities and schools.

Perhaps Republicans should explain why they are in favor of providing$13 billion in annualfunding to an IRS that just received an $80 billion windfall to hire 87,000 new agents. Voters also may wonder why Congress continues to give $11 billion to the FBI each year without demanding that it not target parents for voicing concerns about their kids’ schools at the behest of a radical organization that equated them to domestic terrorists.

Speaking of schools, Congress still gives about $80 billion to a Department of Education that pumps money into schools that are failing our children and filling their minds with radical racial and gender ideologies. Not to mention student loans – where we will be giving a middle finger to hard-working Americans who paid off their federal loans or never took them in the first place by forcing them to pay hundreds of billions to pay off other peoples’ debts.

Do Republicans approve of the “public health” agencies – over $6 billionto fund the NIAID run by Tony Fauci – that forced schools to shut down altogether, doing immeasurable harm to children at all age levels? Or the nearly $9 billion given to a CDC that pushed for businesses to close and for masks to be worn at all times, which are just two of the colossal mistakes the agency made in its COVID-19 response?

And do Republicans support giving nearly $10 billion to the EPA to press its regulatory boot on the necks of American energy producers while families are struggling to fill up their gas tanks and pay their power bills? Or the billionsin subsidies to weather-dependent renewable energy sources that make grids – in states like Texas, of all places – less reliable, or the millions in tax credits we provide to rich liberals so they can buy $70,000 electric vehicles and then preach to you about it?

These are just a few ways that federal bureaucrats use bipartisan congressional funding to undermine the well-being of Americans every day. Step one is for Republicans to refuse Democrats the ability to pass another massive appropriations package this Congress. Step two is for Republicans – if Americans grant us the majority in the House next year – to aggressively expose the federal bureaucracy and demand commonsense reforms and policies for the benefit, not the detriment, of the American people.

Not one additional penny for this radical Congress and administration.

"Commentary: Ben Shapiro is entitled to free speech, too — even if it criticizes Candace Owens","Yesterday, Jason Whitlock penned a column attacking Ben Shapiro for a number of things that Ben did not say. The column accused Ben, unfairly, of not supporting free speech — or worse, possibly being more loyal to Israel than to free speech. The criticisms leveled against Shapiro are unfair and unfounded in fact.

To begin with, Shapiro is accused of being ""united in animus"" with a number of other people, including ""ultra-BLM black elites,"" against Kyrie Irving. I confess that I am at a loss to understand what Kyrie Irving has done to deserve being white-knighted by many on the right, other than refusing to take the vaccine. Other than his refusal to take the vaccine, Irving is and always has been a pro-social-justice liberal and an ardent supporter of the very Black Lives Matter movement that Whitlock frequently pans. Irving took the lead in urging NBA players to refuse to return to play in the wake of George Floyd's death and publicly blasted the decision not to charge the officer who shot Jacob Blake, even after enough evidence came out to convince any person who was paying attention that Blake's shooting was thoroughly justified.

I am also at a loss as to why the single fact of Irving's refusal to take the vaccine merits such a vociferous defense of Irving's completely unrelated decision to promote a documentary that is, by his own admission, offensive to Jewish people as a whole and filled with things that are not true. I get the impulse, in the modern times in which we live, to assume that virtually every accusation of racism is false, given how often the accusation is thrown around without merit.

But no matter how many times people falsely cry ""wolf,"" it's dangerous to start believing that there's no such thing as a wolf. Whether the documentary is boring or not has nothing to do with whether it is dangerous. The reality is this: Throughout history, Jewish people have faced persecution that has been justified by a number of oft-repeated and unjustified tropes, one of which is that they are guilty of ""dual loyalty,"" under which they are accused of valuing either their allegiance to Israel or to some hidden Jewish agenda over their loyalty to their home country or its ideals or principles. We are not talking about being overly sensitive about hurt feelings here: Real, actual Jewish people have been killed en masse, displaced from their homes, and removed from their jobs on the basis of this rhetoric. But more on that later.

Returning to Shapiro and the issue at hand, the first fact to note is this: Missing from Whitlock's column is any evidence at all that Shapiro has any animus toward Irving. Nor is there any quoted evidence that Shapiro would ""hate Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali,"" as the column claims. Shapiro is not quoted anywhere in the column displaying animus toward Kyrie Irving, X, or Ali or even saying anything about those men at all. In fact, the column contains an implicit admission that there is no actual evidence that Shapiro has either animus or hatred toward Irving, X, or Ali, as it says, ""Any distaste Ben Shapiro, an orthodox Jew and establishment conservative, might have for X and Ali would make perfect sense"" (emphasis added).

This raises the question: Is there any evidence at all that Shapiro actually hates any of these three individuals, or is the entire column based on distaste that he might or might not have, for all anyone knows? If the evidence does exist, we are left to wonder what it might be, because it isn't even mentioned in passing, which seems like a bizarre omission for a column titled ""Ben Shapiro and ultra-BLM black elites united in animus toward Kyrie Irving, Muhammad Ali, and Malcolm X.""

What the column does provide evidence of is that Shapiro criticized Candace Owens — a television personality who was offered a show at the company Shapiro founded — for retweeting anti-Israel liberal Max Blumenthal. Because he did this, an accusation of dual loyalty is leveled against Shapiro, including the completely unfounded claim that Shapiro ""could very well value Israel above free speech.""

Not only is this claim unfounded, it is contradicted by Shapiro's entire public career. It is a tired and dangerous canard leveled at Jewish people who support the right of the state of Israel to exist. The sole evidence offered in support of the explosive charge that Shapiro has insufficient loyalty to free speech is that he criticized Candace Owens. So, I guess, if Candace Owens tweets her opinion, that constitutes free speech — but if Shapiro tweets that he disagrees with Candace Owens, that constitutes evidence that he does not believe in free speech? What a bizarre point of view.

The way free speech works is that people have the right to express their opinions, and then other people have the right to peacefully express disagreement with those opinions.

Which is exactly what Shapiro did. He didn't call the cops on Candace Owens. He didn't report her to the DHS for ""disinformation."" He didn't seek to make her unemployable. In fact, the company he founded continues to sign her paychecks. He expressed his disagreement with her. That's it. That isn't evidence of disloyalty to free speech; that's an exercise of free speech.

For good measure, Shapiro is accused of engaging in a ""deplatforming strategy"" against Owens and called a ""deplatformer ... on the right."" Again, at the risk of stating the obvious, Candace Owens' current largest platform is at the company founded by Ben Shapiro. She's still there today, tweeting about how everything is still great between her and the Daily Wire. When it comes to Candace Owens, Ben Shapiro is the opposite of a deplatformer.

Words mean things, and the word ""deplatform"" should not be thrown around without justification. The charge is a rhetorical nuclear weapon on the right, where everyone knows someone who has been kicked out of the public square for wrongthink and made unable to make a living on the internet — or sometimes even to interact with family and friends on Facebook or Twitter. That's what being deplatformed means. And Ben Shapiro has in no way done that to Candace Owens. In fact, he's done the opposite. All he's done is criticize her. Throwing the word around and twisting it to mean that everyone who's been criticized by another person has been deplatformed cheapens the very real pain that people who have actually been deplatformed can feel and makes the accusation carry less weight when it is real and true.

Finally, the accusations that Shapiro is an idolator of ""power and money"" who is afraid to get ""crossways with global corporations"" is likewise both unfounded and contradicted by Shapiro's entire public career. A casual perusal of Shapiro's Twitter feed immediately reveals attacks on the Coca-Cola Company, Amazon, Nike, Disney ... the list could go on virtually forever. If Shapiro has cowardice toward large multinational corporations, he sure has picked a bizarre way of displaying it.

The sole evidence offered that Shapiro is afraid of getting crossways with global corporations is, again, that he criticized Candace Owens. However, there exists a different, equally plausible reason that Shapiro criticized Candace Owens: Perhaps, just perhaps, he actually disagreed with her. In the absence of any evidence at all that a person is speaking from ulterior motives or has a habit of speaking from a certain ulterior motive, I find that it's generally best to assume that people say things because they mean them, not because of reasons I have invented in my head, particularly when the reasons I have invented are contrary to all of their public actions.

The same thing could be said about the unjustified accusation that Shapiro got the vaccine and initially refused to support Donald Trump out of fear. I don't know Ben Shapiro personally. We've traded tweets, but beyond that I don't really know him from Adam. I am pretty sure we have never met in person, in spite of the fact that we live in the same metropolitan area. I don't, however, have evidence that he is a pathological liar or a coward, so when he says things, I tend to believe that he says them because he believes them (whether I agree with them or not). I do that because that's how I like to be treated. I seem to recall that being a rather central tenet of the faith in God that Whitlock referred to in his column.

Last week, Jason took exception to people who accused him of anti-Semitism without knowing what was in his heart or his mind when he wrote a particular tweet. On the basis of much less evidence, he has accused Ben Shapiro, on the basis of a tweet, of being disloyal to free speech and a coward.

I don't agree with everything Ben does. But I do know that in general, he is in the same trench with Whitlock, fighting for the same things. He deserves better than the unjustified accusations that were thrown at him — whether he disagrees with Candace Owens or not.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/chip-roy-money-federal-tyranny,2022-11-09
Deace: Time to confront the wolves,"When a Florida state attorney signed a public statement saying he would not enforce prohibitions on sex changes for minors or restrictions on abortion, Gov. Ron DeSantis proved himself worthy yet again, grabbed Thor’s hammer, and suspended the agent of chaos from office.

Complete with a police escort.

When the Tulsa public schools got drunk on BLM propaganda in defiance of state law, the state board of education downgraded the district’s accreditation to “warning” status, and Education Secretary Ryan Walters said it was time to talk about revoking the teaching licenses of those teachers who were more interested in grooming students than educating them.

And when the Linn-Mar public schools in my home state of Iowa approved policies — in the face of extensive public protest — that will allow students and faculty to create ""Gender Support Plans"" without parental knowledge or consent as well as punish students with suspension or expulsion if they do not refer to other students by their preferred pronouns, an organization called Parents Defending Education began helping a group of parents sue the district to remind them who is boss.

This, my friends, is the way. No mercy. Because none will be offered to you, says Nicole Neily, founder and president of Parents Defending Education.

“This is the most egregious policy I’ve seen, from coast to coast,” said Neily, a 42-year-old policy wonk and free speech crusader based in Washington, D.C. “All the conservative ivory tower groups need to understand that this isn’t just a California issue. It’s in Texas, too.”

To flesh out that point, Neily said that since starting her organization in March 2021, the tip line set up to help people report their stories of woke education hellscapes has ranged from 50 to 200 cases a week. One of the most common frustrations among parents is the realization that the system seems to be set up to thwart them the minute their opinion varies from the spirit of the age.

“You say the wrong thing at a school board meeting, and you are the neighborhood bigot the rest of your life,” said Neily, who is Japanese-American and the product of grandparents who met in California internment camps set up during World War II, thus highlighting the genesis of her concern for fundamental human rights. “When I got into this, I figured there were probably a lot of people in education who just didn’t understand they were violating others' rights, but my God, we’ve only seen them dig in when confronted. This is so much more extreme than I thought. Our children are the absolute last priority to these people, and I’m absolutely determined to hold them accountable.”









So far, so good in the two other cases her organization has brought to court in Massachusetts and New York, where policies were either changed or the case was dismissed in their favor. The Iowa case is being argued on behalf of seven parents who will be kept anonymous.

“People credibly fear retaliation against not only themselves and their business, but against their children from these [board members and school officials] who have never been punched in the face before because they are so used to operating behind closed doors,” Neily said. “These policies are unconstitutional. Full stop. It is such a betrayal.”

We need not wait for this case’s verdict, though, to make our own voices heard in our own school districts before things get as bad as they are in Linn-Mar, Iowa. Kids are being abused with your tax money nationwide by cultish enemies of the state who have become convinced that when they tell you 1+1=transgender surgery, you will likely let them get away with it.

Time to prove them wrong. Dead wrong. We do not show mercy to wolves. We cast them out and sleep well at night because of it. Otherwise, we may find ourselves in an internment camp before too long, as our chemically castrated children are stolen from us, body and soul.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-ben-shapiro-is-entitled-to-free-speech-too,2022-08-05
Deace: A time for justice,"My hunger for the sternest forms of justice is nearly insatiable these days. Even to the point of co-authoring a book calling for a new Nuremberg trial. I want justice because it is a testimony to the truth: God’s truth, which is the ultimate truth. Thus, justice properly understood is not only good, but holy.

But there is more. So much more.

Because in God’s glorious, grace-fueled economy, mercy triumphs over judgment, if only we let it. There is no darkness so vast that mercy can’t wash it clean. So even though current events may, in fact, soon warrant the need for the sort of justice once inflicted on Nazis, they make the stories of mercy only more obvious and beautiful to behold.

For example, this is just within the last week:

Comedian JP Sears, who is well known for destroying the lies of Covidstan, testified to how the experience of the last few years has humbled him to accept a glorious reality far beyond his own proud rationalizations of the past. Please watch him give what is a vastly superior sermon compared to much of what is coming from American churches these days.

Former self-described “slut” and Playboy columnist Bridget Phetasy publicly acknowledged the lies she told not only herself, but countless others over the years in the name of feminism and so-called “empowerment.” The end result, though, is not condemnation but true freedom for both men and women alike, as Phetasy bottom-lines her arrival at the truth like this: “Every woman should feel this way: Sleeping w/ me is a privilege. And you have to be worthy.”

The group Gays Against Groomers has so upset the diabolical moral economy of the Twitter-sphere that it was banned by the platform for “reasons” before being later re-instated on the same day. Cults hate it when those who are supposed to drink the deepest from the Kool-Aid cup reject them. And you don’t have to applaud all that Gays Against Groomers represents to accept that when it comes to saving innocent children from the modern-day Mengeles in our midst, they know what time it is and refuse to bring a knife to a gunfight, as they make statements like this: “There needs to be a federal law banning all trans medicalization and surgical mutilation of minors. All of these doctors and surgeons should not only be stripped of their medical licenses, but never be allowed within 500 yards of a child ever again.”

And lastly, the sororities of the University of Alabama who unanimously told a boy in a dress to get the hell out. Nicely done, ladies.

These people, broken as each and every one of them are in their own way, nonetheless became vessels of light in the last week as they accepted, in no uncertain terms, certain truths of God’s creation. None of which is to say they have accepted all of the truth or even the most important parts of it yet. However, they are closer than they once were to the way, the truth, and the life – as are those who heard what they had to say and were similarly awakened by such unambiguous testimony.

Remember, we are all sinners put back together by God. None of us is without cracks, but those cracks aren’t just scars. Because it is when God’s light shines through the cracks that our true destiny unfolds. That’s when others no longer see our cracks, but his light.

With that said, pray for all those above and be grateful for their courage. For thus says the Lord in the Book of Ezekiel 36:23-28:

I will prove the holiness of my great name,

profaned among the nations,

in whose midst you have profaned it.

Thus the nations shall know that I am the LORD, says the Lord GOD,

when in their sight I prove my holiness through you.

For I will take you away from among the nations,

gather you from all the foreign lands,

and bring you back to your own land.

I will sprinkle clean water upon you

to cleanse you from all your impurities,

and from all your idols I will cleanse you.

I will give you a new heart and place a new spirit within you,

taking from your bodies your stony hearts

and giving you natural hearts.

I will put my spirit within you and make you live by my statutes,

careful to observe my decrees.

You shall live in the land I gave your ancestors;

you shall be my people, and I will be your God.

In this passage, God is obviously speaking specifically about his people, the Israelites. Nevertheless, we are all made in his image, Jew and Gentile alike. So, we can take heed that this reflects the overall heart of God – for mercy to triumph over judgment.

But also take heed of this: If we do not seek his mercy, we will face his judgment.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace,2022-08-19
Deace: Mom fights woke school district and the spirit of the age. Where are the dads?,"Even when you catch them red-handed, you’re still the guilty one.

That’s what Erin Jo Chaskey, 37, discovered about how the “education” game was being played in her small Michigan school district, after seeking out some basic accountability in a place where it should have been expected. Four generations of her family had attended this school, and she was a regular volunteer.

But the spirit of the age is a very jealous god.

Chaskey, as many parents have in the last few years, dared to ask some questions about critical race theory being taught in her children’s school back in the spring of 2021. District officials responded by ignoring emails from her and violating freedom of information (FOIA) requests for months. Finally, when a controversial high school teacher told a boy last fall that his “white privilege was showing,” she had had enough and decided to run for an open seat on the school board.

That’s when the cult struck back.

When she showed up as directed to pick up the appropriate paperwork, she overheard a conversation from her position in a public waiting area between the superintendent of schools and a sitting school board member. They were talking about her and their intention to avoid communicating via school email from now on to avoid Chaskey’s attempts to pin them down using FOIA requests. In fact, they were openly plotting against her, so she pulled out her phone and recorded what she heard.

That’s when all hell – literally – broke loose. Like I said, woke education is a very jealous god, and its minions in the Onaway Area Community Schools proceeded to issue a warrant to seize Chaskey’s cellphone, as well as a no-trespass order. According to the spirit of the age, that domestic terrorist formerly known as a ""parent"" would have to pay for her blasphemy.

Not being a coward, though, Chaskey refused to wilt. She filed a civil suit seeking relief from the no-trespass order so she could attend her son’s school events. That was met the very next day by the school administration with felony eavesdropping charges. She was fingerprinted and had her mug shot taken. All for being a mom who wouldn’t drink the Kool-Aid.

This was all about intimidation and vengeance. Obey or be canceled, said the jealous gods. Chaskey’s lawyer, Daren Wisely, said the school district’s attempt to use a law in a way that had no precedent since its passage in the 1960s showed the lengths it was willing to go to so the world could be made flat. You’d expect all this in Ann Arbor, said Wisely, but this was all happening just south of the Upper Peninsula in a place where everyone knows everyone, the entire K-12 student population is in one building, and Chaskey had even previously gone on vacation with the school principal.

“That’s what boggles my mind,” Wisely said. “From the get-go they weren’t trying to work with her. They were trying to gaslight her. But she has the most conviction and perseverance of anyone I’ve ever met in my life.” And because she did, the charges were ultimately dropped earlier this year as completely without merit. However, where are the consequences for the ringleaders in the school district who mercilessly attacked a parent in order to cover their own tracks? So far, nothing.

Even in small-town Michigan, the spirit of the age has a very long reach.

“It’s been a complete nightmare,” said Chaskey. “I never even had a speeding ticket before. You have no idea what it’s been like. I’ve been ostracized. But when I’m ready, I’m going to put out everything that happened.”



Mama Bear is still fighting, while too many around her simply stand by and watch the train wreck pass them by as it steals the very souls of their children. How did it come to such a pass, when a single woman must stand alone against such darkness and chaos? Where are the dads of this district?

The answer to that question will be our everlasting shame, if not our complete undoing as a nation.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/deace-a-time-for-justice,2022-06-20
Deace: Team GOP doesn't want to understand the culture war,"Hi losers.

I’m talking to you ""fiscally conservative but socially liberal"" types, aka ""low-tax degenerates."" I’m also talking to you ""compassionate conservatives,"" aka Jesuit priest Republicans who have turned ""lukewarm"" into a sacrament.

You’re toast in this culture war. You have absolutely no shot with your nicer-than-Jesus pablum. You are doomed.

Other than that, though, you are doing great.

Besides the problem of your fundamental cowardice, your entire act is clearly a de facto apology instead of a premise to those whose demonic side you claim to oppose. “We aren’t really that bad” isn’t a compelling narrative. And as such, the enemy smells weakness that it happily manipulates to its own propagandist advantage, rather than hearing and seeing a lion it risks being devoured by if not properly respected. And let’s face it, Republicans have not been worthy of respect for a while now, nor should they be. That's exactly how we got Trump. Most of the massive presidential field back in 2015 and 2016 were so unworthy of it that a former Democrat from New York, who was on his third wife and never asked for forgiveness from God, proved to be the golden child to a desperate people.

Make no mistake: Trump didn’t hijack a political party. No, that party forfeited its right to govern as it did for far too long, because it became apparent that not only did it never intend to keep its promises, but it actually hated its own base.

But now, in the aftermath of the COVID, 2020 election fraud, and Jan. 6 psyops that plague us still as the Great Reset carries on, we are seeing Team GOP prove the Lord was right when he declared that “the dog returns to its own vomit.” Team GOP’s version of a coming red wave in the midterms is to take us back to the good old days of rhetorically hammering Joe Biden with fake tough-guy majority-speak while doing absolutely nothing substantive or lasting with the actual constitutional power the party has.

Team GOP just doesn’t understand the nature of the enemy, mostly because it doesn’t want to. Here in my fairly red home state of Iowa, the enemy’s zealotry carries on shamelessly regardless of how many readers and elections it loses. The editorial board of the Des Moines Register wrote that it is OK for school districts to withhold information from parents about their children’s sexual confusion, as well as punish students and staff who won't go along with the depraved farce, but then refused to allow Gov. Kim Reynolds to rebut them with an op/ed of her own unless she used their approved Newspeak.

Because they don’t care how nice you are if you disagree with them. Heck, they don’t even care if you agree with them unless you are willing to punish, groom, and pillage like them. They are the total state, and you are meant to believe nothing other than what you are told to believe. And neither low-tax degenerates nor Jesuit priest Republicans have any shot whatsoever up against that level of demonic nihilism.

There are simply no terms you could offer with which the Spirit of the Age will ultimately compromise. So don’t even try with your latest adventures in neo-neo-through-a-certain-point-of-view conservatism. That’s not what time it is.



Here’s what time it is: Thunderdome. As in two worldviews enter, and only one leaves. The Spirit of the Age has declared a zero-sum game here, so to pretend otherwise makes you at best its unintentional collaborator. You have no chance to defeat an enemy you refuse to honestly recognize.

Deace: The fight for COVID freedom isn't over. Our gov't is still trying to ruin the lives of US troops.,"I received a lot of images earlier this week from people giddy to share their mask-free experiences while flying. It's clear that one judge’s Thanos-like snap signaled a new birth of freedom to them, and as someone who has been pointing out how worthless the masks have actually been for the better part of the last two years, I am not without sympathy. But ...

We can’t be like the leftist zombies who believe that whatever emotion they have amounts to a Gospel all others must share regardless of experience. Our lust for freedom can’t intoxicate us to the point that we no longer recognize or even care about someone else’s slavery. Especially when the chains are for those whose very job is to make sure our freedom is preserved at all costs.

Because as some of us race to book our next maskless flight, there are other Americans currently serving in the military for whom COVID and its various oppressions are far from being a thing of the past. One such airman’s wife recently contacted me to make the point that lives and careers are hanging in the balance as we speak.

Her husband is a 16-year decorated veteran of 1,300 combat hours. Yet despite all his selfless dedication, he now awaits the verdict of his appeal of the Air Force’s refusal to grant him a waiver for taking the COVID vaccine. Their nine children await as well. They are in this together, fighting to defend the First Amendment’s right to free speech as a proud military family on the one hand; meanwhile, simultaneously being afraid to openly use the First Amendment themselves, because of how dead-set the military brass has been against individuals who choose not to poison themselves or turn their hearts into ticking myocarditis time bombs.

Does this make her sad? Frustrated? No, she says, while asking me to help her family and others like her draw attention to the ongoing and needless purge of the military’s conscientious vaccine objectors. She calls it “more like rage.”

“Some of my closest friends have told me completely ridiculous things like ‘we signed up for this’ because my husband joined the military,” said the airman’s wife, who herself also happens to be a nurse. “When I go to church, none of the women there even talk to me any more. We have such huge information gaps, and it is scary that our general population thinks this way.”

Sadly, the information gap is often born out of absorbing only the propaganda that makes us feel comfortable, instead of the truths that must nourish us if we are going to be effective in our duties as citizens. And one of those truths should obviously damn well be that those who took an oath to lay down their lives to defend their country didn’t sign up to be lab rats for Big Pharma.

So how about you step up on their behalf, get rid of that worthless Ukrainian flag emoji for a change, and replace it with a genuine concern for the men and women of the red, white, and blue before Biden completely ruins their lives?



“The Department of Defense has worked very hard to keep these individuals isolated and alone,” said the airman’s wife, referring to those who are refusing the jab. “We thought we were just 1-3 percent, but recently realized the numbers are closer to 7 percent for no vaccination and 20 percent or more for incomplete vaccination.”

To get rid of all those enlisted people for a lie is nothing short of an act of war being declared by our own country against reality and decency itself. We can take our own masks off all we want, but if someone else is still being forced to choke on them somewhere else in the form of a needle that offers none of its promised protection, none of us is truly free.

"Deace: The only 'tradition' in marriage is one man, one woman — and leaving it behind got us to today's trans madness","My initial reaction to seeing the group called “Gays Against Groomers” come into existence last year was to pop some popcorn.

Then again, to be fair, you could replace the word “gay” with just about anything else and you would have my attention. Lumberjacks Against Groomers. Sign me up. Bolivia Against Groomers. Love that place. Shrimp Scampi Against Groomers. Delicious.



But with the whole Gays Against Groomers thing, we were in for an extra-special treat. We were going to see just how far self-awareness and critical thinking were prepared to go in reestablishing levels of decency and order that have been so quickly lost via godless propaganda. In other words, would the gays in question truly be willing to go all the way in diagnosing what you and I know to be obviously true about the genesis of the current gender-bending contagion – gay marriage – or would they ultimately plead the fifth and refuse to self-incriminate?



Well, we have our answer. And it is disappointing.



First let me say, though, that such a final verdict doesn’t mean I believe Gays Against Groomers to be a scam, ineffective, or unwelcome. Quite the contrary. The group’s absolute disgust for how children are being sacrificed in the volcano of perverse adult sexual gratification seems utterly genuine, as does their resolve to persist in upsetting the apple cart of the groomer cartel no matter how many names they are called or ways they are canceled. For that I am thankful. Our children need all the allies they can get in that regard.



Yet there has always been an aspect of the group’s advocacy that has stepped away from the defense of innocent children and focuses on a defense of itself instead. We had a great thing going by securing new “rights,” they say, but all this trans stuff is mucking up the works. Then earlier this week, that argument finally jumped the shark.



The Gays Against Groomers Twitter account posted a graphic of the new-style transgender flag and the original rainbow gay pride flag side by side. Under the transgender flag were the words “reject modernity.” Under the rainbow flag were the words “embrace tradition.”



This is the part of our story where self-awareness goes to die.



Let’s check the math, shall we? When people like me told gay marriage advocates that the “traditional” biblical definition of marriage was between one man and one woman, we were called haters, zealots, and bigots. But now that gay marriage has been on the historical scene for all of five seconds, we are meant to assent to it as a tradition as obvious and immortal as the tides or the rising and setting of the sun?



They can’t have it both ways, whether in the philosophical or, maybe even more importantly, the practical sense. For we live in a world where the band formerly known as “Born This Way” — which would infer a relatively static statistical comparison across generations – changed its name to “666 Genders” faster than you can say drag queen story hour.

According to Gallup, the share of American adults who identify as queer doubled from 2012 to 2021, and within Generation Z the LGBTQ population doubled in just four years – from 10.5 to 20.8 percent – between 2017 and 2021.



Hmm ... let's see. What could have happened that may have kick-started this not-remotely-born-this-way trend? Could it be the Varnum v. Brien state supreme court ruling that redefined marriage in my home state of Iowa in 2009? Or the steroid booster that and other state rulings received from the U.S. Supreme Court’s U.S. v. Windsor ruling in 2013?



Probably just a weird coincidence. Or, whether it be Gays Against Groomers or the many churches that now prioritize rainbow flags over the cross, it is the entire fricking point.

Not only does marriage have a very clear definition, but one of such cosmic importance that it simply can’t be compromised on any level. Otherwise you inevitably get what Federalist writer Anna James Zeigler recently observed on Twitter when confronting the latest in sex-based debauchery to cross her path: Sex between siblings.



“People are dunking on this woman who advertised that she is sleeping with her brother, & that's fine, but this is where we are headed,” Zeigler said. “If Love is Love, then Love is Love. Maybe rethink states having the power to make a few marriage laws?”



Exactly right. There is no in-between on this issue. Either we are God’s or completely off the cliff. So be against the groomers by all means. I insist. Just make sure your asterisks or fine print don’t destine all of your hard work to failure in the end. Because the truth is that graphic from Gays Against Groomers is as true as it gets, just not for the reason they're claiming. After all, the gender-bending mouth of madness we are descending into as a society didn't appear out of nowhere via osmosis, but from the “tradition” of the original rainbow flag Gays Against Groomers wants to embrace.



Let us not have trans traditions any more than we have trans genders, for there is but one actual tradition here. One man. One woman. Till death do us part. The end.

Bleu: How Elon Musk's vision for Twitter might solve the platform's most vile problem: Child sexual abuse material,"I believe that Elon Musk's vision for making Twitter a completely free speech-promoting platform could help to solve one of its most egregious problems: the abundance of child sexual exploitation material.

This global issue has been practically ignored by the platform for years. Twitter has done the bare minimum to stay in compliance with government regulations when firmly pressed on the issue, but other than that, the tech giant is behind its competitors regarding the removal and reporting of child pornography at scale. Twitter put a lot of energy behind designing the algorithm to control conservative speech, while failing to prioritize the removal and reporting of child sexual exploitation material. There is a vast difference between mean words, outrageous ideas or misinformation, and an adult raping a child, documenting the crime, and sharing it to the world.

I don’t blame Twitter for the initial assaults against children. Twitter can’t fix all the evil in the world. I do blame Twitter for receiving reports of child sexual abuse material and not addressing the reports in a timely fashion. Time is of the essence when these reports are received. In some circumstances, it can be a matter of life or death for the children being abused in these images and videos.

Typically when I start speaking about these issues, folks think to themselves, “I’ve never seen it, so it must not be that big a deal.”

It is.

Let’s look at the numbers and some examples.

In 2021, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) CyberTipline received 29.3 million reports of suspected child sexual exploitations, an increase of 35% from 2020. In 2021, over 29.1 million of the 29.3 million total reports were from electronic service providers.

In 2021, Twitter reported 86,666 child sexual abuse material images to NCMEC. I believe that number could, and should, be higher.

In Twitter's latest transparency report, including relevant data from January 1, 2021, through June 30, 2021, the platform says, “In these six months, Twitter permanently suspended 453,754 unique accounts for violations of our child sexual exploitation (CSE) policy — 89% of those accounts were proactively identified and removed by deploying a range of internal tools and/or by utilizing the industry hash sharing (e.g., PhotoDNA) prior to any reports filed via the designated CSE reporting channel.”

Whenever discussing this issue on Twitter, one can’t ignore the case of John Doe #1 and John Doe #2. In 2021, Twitter was sued by minor survivors of sexual exploitation. Their sexual exploitation video, which had already racked up over 167,000 views and 2,223 retweets, had been reviewed by Twitter after multiple reports. The platform said that it wouldn’t remove the content, claiming that it “didn’t find a violation” of the company’s “policies.” The minors were both 13 years old in the video. It took the Department of Homeland Security stepping in to get Twitter to remove the content.

A Delaware school custodian was recently charged with dealing in child sexual abuse material on Twitter, according to court documents. These types of individuals need to be apprehended quickly so that they don’t have access to children.

Governments have been pushing back against Twitter about this issue. Child exploitation is an easy excuse for tyrannical governments to clip Twitter's wings (and its potential for supporting free speech) and slow down service or block the platform altogether in the country. Blocking Twitter in any country silences the voices of survivors, activists, political dissidents, journalists, and whistleblowers.

From March to April 2021 Roskomnadzor [the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media] considered a ban and the removal of the IP of Twitter from Russia completely. The government agency was met with denials and lack of urgency from the social network. Roskomnadzor has the necessary 'technical capabilities' to completely remove Twitter from [the] Russian domain. The severity of the situation occurred when over 3,000 posts containing child pornography in violation of Community Guidelines have been detected in 2021 by the agency that was later sent to Twitter regulatory board for verification. However Twitter sent no response back to the agency concerning the illegal content and has thereafter been charged of withholding its duty to maintain the social network's Community Guidelines.



—CBS News

Russia has fined Twitter multiple times over its refusal to remove banned content, threatening to slow down service and/or remove the platform entirely from the country. In 2021, India opened multiple cases against Twitter because of child sexual exploitation material. The country has continuously threatened the platform with action if the platform doesn't clean up its act.

Domestically, Apple could, at any point, remove the platform from the App Store for failure to remove child sexual abuse material content. It has taken a hard-line stance on this issue in the past. In 2018, Apple removed Tumblr from the App Store because of child sexual abuse material. In February 2018, Apple removed Telegram and Telegram X, encrypted messaging applications made by Telegram Messenger LLP, from the App Store due to content it deemed inappropriate. The company specifically cited instances of child pornography that was made available to users and subsequently banned the apps until the situation could be dealt with.

There are some ways that Twitter could address child sexual abuse material that won’t violate digital privacy moving forward. The platform recently made the reporting process for this content slightly easier, but it needs to be made even easier for Twitter users and survivors. When a platform thinks about creating ways to report child sexual exploitation, it needs to think of a very young child in a panic trying to figure out how to report their own exploitation. It should be very clear and easy to report, not a vague labyrinth for the minor to stumble through. When a report is received, the minor should be offered safe, trauma-informed recourse. The platform should prioritize these reports. Innovation will be the key to addressing the reports at scale. As much as I hate to say it, Elon Musk should reach out to Mark Zuckerberg about this.

Meta (Facebook) has implemented proprietary tools to combat the issue of child sexual exploitation material specifically and has amazing proactive detection, removal, and reporting rates. Meta isn’t perfect; it still needs a lot of work, but its latest data collection around this specific issue has been a welcome change.

If a piece of content is flagged on Twitter as child sexual exploitation, the account should be immediately locked with an opportunity for appeal if there was an error. If a user continuously falsely reports child sexual exploitation, the individual making the false reports should have their account locked. We all make mistakes, but false reports can clog up the system, and we need to make sure that the most egregious reports are handled quickly.

I’d also like to see images blurred or grayed out and a warning put on any content that could be child sexual abuse material with an option to appeal the warning. Twitter started offering this for potentially disturbing images of war, and it should expand on that technology.

Twitter flagged all types of content during the pandemic, showing it is capable of locating and identifying text and imagery. If content is flagged as child sexual abuse material, it should not be able to be retweeted, at the very least. This would help to keep the content from spreading. Twitter will need to hire more staff to review the child exploitation material content that the AI doesn’t catch. The staff should be using the latest technology to reduce harm to employees while reviewing content. Terms of service should be clear about content shared by those who mean well but often miss the mark. Sometimes individuals share the content to get folks to report, but that’s spreading the content. Individuals who share the content should not be allowed to remain on the platform regardless of intent. It sounds harsh, but the goal is to minimize the harm to the victims, not perpetuate the crime.

As we move ahead, I’m not really sure whether Elon Musk is the answer to these problems. I know that some love the news of Elon Musk owning Twitter and some hate it, but I believe that we can all agree on one thing: We should be prioritizing the protection of our world’s most vulnerable. When it comes to Twitter, those are the minors being sexually exploited on the platform. We don’t need any government to overreach; neither do we need to violate digital privacy to get there, we just need aggressive innovation and attention on the issue.

Horowitz: It’s time for governments to apologize for COVID response,"As we all watch the horrific images of the Chinese communists torturing their people in Shanghai over a virus, can we really take solace in the hope that it won’t happen here? The first step in repenting for sin is acknowledging that one has committed the sin, apologizing for it, and resolving to establish moral and intellectual barriers around the iniquity, preventing it from being repeated. Yet despite the devastating consequences of lockdown, masks, and mRNA gene therapy laid bare before our eyes, no major body of government has apologized for the “mistake,” much less committed to legally preventing it from happening again.

Colorado state Rep. Stephanie Luck wants to change that by apologizing to state residents for mistakes made during COVID. She introduced (HJR22-1022) Resolution, which asks for forgiveness from Colorado citizens whose lives were impacted due to the COVID-19 restrictions placed on them by Colorado lawmakers.

Specifically, the resolution indicts the government for creating social isolation for seniors, delayed medical care, missed life events for families, masking of children, impediment of educational attainment and language development, and the destruction of businesses and infringement upon religious worship.

“From these mitigation efforts, many Coloradans have endured significant impacts to education, including the disparate impact to students' progress; the cancellation of important and often once-in-a-lifetime student activities such as prom, sports, and other state tournaments; the impact to students, parents, teachers, and administrators from requirements of remote learning; and the overall disruption to students, professors, and other professionals studying, teaching, and supporting students at institutions of higher education.”

Indeed, the refusal of state governments to apologize for shutting down schools and masking children is the most shocking of all. From day one, the colossal damage from these policies was self-evident, while the benefit was clearly lacking and unnecessary given the low risk of coronavirus to children.

A new study from Brown University economics professor Emily Oster shows a strong correlation between the amount of time states suspended in-person instruction and decline in pass rates for math and English. For example, Virginia, which averaged in-person instruction for only 9.7% of the school year last year – the lowest of the 11 states – experienced a 34% decrease in pass rates of math courses. Wyoming, on the other hand, experienced just a 3.7% decline in passage rates after being open for in-person instruction 86.5% of the school year. The generational damage of the school closures will be with us for years to come.

How could governments not issue a formal apology and promise never to do this again? How can we go on with our lives and pretend like this never happened?

The resolution goes on to indict the state medical board for hindering the doctor-patient relationship “by discouraging doctors from providing life-saving treatments to their patients during this pandemic.” It further inveighs against “hospital policies based on government guidelines” that “left many people to die alone, without sufficient representation and advocacy.”

In recognition of these facts, the resolution extends a heartfelt apology and condolences “for those lost and for the significant pain endured by every Coloradan over the last two

years, whether directly from the effects of COVID-19 or indirectly from

the efforts taken by the state in response to it.” On behalf of the legislature, it seeks “forgiveness from every Coloradan negatively impacted by the policies followed and made by the State of Colorado during this pandemic” and resolves “to learn from the mistakes made.”

It is truly hard to overstate the importance of getting every government organ on record asking forgiveness for the recognized mistakes. Two years later, the “flat curvers” are still controlling many positions of power and clearly intend to hold on to this ill-gotten power. If you watch the response of the federal government to the Florida federal judge’s ruling on the travel mask mandate, you will observe that officials not only fail to acknowledge the mistakes in their policies, but fully intend to preserve their prerogative to repeat the same mistakes. From asymptomatic and outdoor transmission to shutting down schools, masking, and mRNA gene therapies, our government has not admitted culpability in a single mistake.

Fauci recently decried the ruling on the airplane mask mandate, “We are concerned about courts getting involved in issues that are unequivocally public health issues. This is a CDC issue, not a court issue.”

In other words, he believes that health departments – federal or state – can still control your lives, property, and bodies without due process, scientific rationale, or legal backing. Which means that now, as the people have soured on these policies, is the time to push back and immunize ourselves from ever catching the tyrannical virus again. Fauci is right. Ideally, this issue is not suited for the courts. But it sure is not suited for unelected bureaucrats either. It’s time for state representatives and the people themselves to enshrine permanent bans on violations of bodily constitutions into state constitutions with no exceptions.

Today, a group of Pennsylvania lawmakers, led by Rep. Russ Diamond, are holding a press conference calling on their leadership to take up a committee-passed constitutional amendment (HB 2013) that would ban all vaccine mandates and prohibit discrimination against those who exercise the right.

It’s shocking that other states have not even passed such a bill out of committee yet and placed it on the ballot for voters this election. It’s time to let the people decide. And that begins with governments admitting they were wrong and begging for forgiveness from those whom they serve. The next step requires a permanent legal barrier to government or other human beings from ever ruling over one’s body in the form of coerced medical treatment, supposed preventives, devices, or injections.



It’s also incumbent upon them to take the billions of federal dollars handed to the departments of health and use them as reparations for people damaged by the shots. These people have nowhere to turn for diagnoses and treatment and are forced to pay for endless care out of pocket.

Remember that the American lockdowns were just a test run for what’s to come. We are getting a glimpse of what the oligarchs have in mind from what we’re witnessing in Shanghai. If your local or state governments have yet to apologize for what they did wrong, much less take corrective action to prevent a relapse into tyranny, just realize that they plan to do it again.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/elon-musk-twitter-child-sexual-abuse,2022-04-27
"Horowitz: Army recruitment down 23% amid mandates, as Army tosses requirement for high school diploma","No high school diploma? Be all you can be in the military. No COVID shot after years of meritorious service? Goodbye, as we ask illegal aliens to take your place. That is the state of play in the U.S. military.



The time has come for Republican “defense hawks” to finally show some concern for the quality, morale, and mission of the military, not just throw endless money at it while the military self-immolates, expels those who don’t get Pfizer’s shot, and then complains that it can’t meet its recruiting goals. Last week, the Military Times reported, “The Army has hit 40% of its recruiting goals this year, with the struggle to fill the ranks seemingly so grim the Defense Department reduced its planned total force size because prior recruiting goals were out of reach.”

Pentagon officials announced that across the military branches, annual target recruitment goals are down 23%. To accommodate growing recruitment problems, the military is offering more financial benefits rather than emphasizing the motivation of patriotism, because clearly, in this environment, it doesn’t work. Now they are abolishing the requirement for a high school diploma or GED as a prerequisite to joining basic training for those who sign up before the end of this fiscal year. That’s how desperate they are to meet recruitment benchmarks.

Here’s a novel idea: Before we lower standards to appalling levels, how about we stop kicking out some of the most seasoned, battle-hardened soldiers for not getting the shots? Up to 40,000 National Guardsmen risk expulsion from the force if they fail to comply with the mandate by tomorrow. That is 13% of the National Guard – and as much as 30% in some states. So, our government would rather recruit those without high school diplomas than relent on a mandate for a shot.

It’s important to remember in the context of recruiting new teenagers that some of the most patriotic military families are those who did not get the shots, especially among teenagers. Those 16- to 18-year-olds who didn’t get the shots in the past year made the right choice, even based on the original risk-benefit analysis. Yet all those young boys who didn’t want to risk myocarditis cannot follow in the footsteps of their fathers or grandparents. Instead of embracing these kids from a pedigree of hundreds of years of U.S. military service, the Pentagon is looking to further reach out to illegal aliens to serve in the military.

Which brings us to the fiscal year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This is considered a must-pass bill because it’s been signed into law every year going back almost to WWII. Republicans have so much leverage to fix this problem and abolish the mandates and other policies that are destroying morale in the military and motivation to join it. Yet all they do is use their leverage to fight for more money to throw at the military rather than change the corrosive policies. After all, an authorization bill is not an appropriations bill and should be more about policy than money.

Last Thursday, every single Republican on the House Armed Services Committee voted for the NDAA, after Democrats and several RINOs voted down an amendment to block the vaccine mandates. Republicans are proud that they tossed another $37 billion into the Pentagon coffers, raising the spending for the national defense budget to an unfathomable $850.4 billion. But to what end? It contains another billion for Ukraine, ironically a country with a low vaccination rate.

Republicans think they are being pro-military and patriotic by passing the NDAA unconditionally and offering a raise to the troops, but the current and potential recruits would much rather join a military that doesn’t mandate every Pfizer product for eternity, groom them into transgenderism, teach them white people are racist, and send them to fight for every other country’s border but our own. They seem more concerned about performing abortions than about combat readiness. Perhaps focusing on those issues instead will solve the recruitment problem among the patriotic families who led our nation in recruitment based on family tradition.

According to the Pentagon’s 2020 propensity report, only 11% of teens and young adults, between 16 and 21 years old, planned on future service in the military. The top three reasons respondents gave for joining the U.S. military were: pay/money, pay for future education, and travel. Defending the country was not among them. And for good reason. Kids who come from the sort of families who would join to defend the country would not exactly be drawn to a military that gives tutorials on how to create safe spaces for pronouns. Thus, bribing people with endless monetary benefits is the only recruitment tool left to “be all that you can be.”

Republicans have the leverage to hold up both the defense appropriations bill and defense authorization bill in the Senate until the mandates are ended. Additionally, Republicans governors should assert their Title 32 control over their respective national guardsmen to prohibit any discharge on account of not getting the shots. They should also use all of the printed federal dollars that are going to fund Pfizer and other illogical COVID policies to create a state-based (non-federalized) guard as a landing place for those discharged from the military, like Gov. Ron DeSantis did in Florida.



At some point, money can’t buy you a moral, competent, and combat-ready military if we are left with a pool of recruits who perhaps need the allure of free castration surgery and hormone therapy to join. The feds can print an unlimited amount of money, but they can’t print warriors.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/governments-apologize-covid-response,2022-06-29
Horowitz: Chicago releases the most violent offenders to commit the exact same crimes,"What happens when you let career violent criminals out on little or no bail with no fear of punishment for violating their terms of release? In a dystopian hell like Chicago, that means an individual released after being charged with punching a woman in the face and kicking a cop in the groin will be rearrested for … punching a woman in the face and kicking a cop in the groin. Oh, and another sex offender released on charges of molesting multiple women will be rearrested for … molesting another woman!



At a time when the FBI and DHS are spying on political opponents with no criminal records as if they are violent criminals, known violent criminals are released to repeat the worst crimes again. Let’s meet James Killingsworth, a career criminal who was arrested right before Christmas 2020 for stealing a woman’s phone on a Chicago street and then kicking the arresting cop in the groin. The prosecution later linked him to a robbery a few days earlier in which he punched a woman in the face in broad daylight and stole her phone. One would think that aggravated battery of a peace officer, theft, attempted robbery, and aggravated battery in a public place would put him away for a while, but when he reported to prison on October 19, 2022, he was released on the same day because of good time credits and time served.

Fast-forward just six days later, and Killingsworth was arrested on October 25 for punching a woman at a transit station and then kicking the arresting officer in the groin, according to CWB Chicago. De ja vu! This case would be one for the books even if the system finally locked him up, but it gets worse. The Illinois Department of Corrections refused to charge him with a parole violation, and the judge released him on just $12,000 bail!

Contrast this with military veterans with no criminal records who are still serving two years pretrial without any chance for bail for charges that don’t even allege touching a police officer or punching someone in the face.

What about sexual assault? Surely the system would give those perps the “January 6 treatment,” right? Wrong! Meet David Buckner, the terror of Chicago transit, courtesy of CWB Chicago reporting:

In June, a prosecutor in the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office refused to file felony charges against Buckner after two women accused him of licking, kissing, squeezing, and groping them on the Magnificent Mile. With felony charges denied, Chicago police had to charge Buckner with misdemeanor battery. He was released from jail a few days later to await trial.



On October 9, while he was still on bail for the June allegations, two more women accused Buckner of touching them inappropriately at the Roosevelt CTA station. He walked out of the local Chicago police station a few hours later on his own recognizance, charged only with misdemeanor battery again. Records that would show if prosecutors rejected felony charges for the new allegations have not been posted in public records.



Then, just before 2 p.m. Wednesday, while still on bail for the June and October cases, he allegedly assaulted an 18-year-old woman on the Loyola campus, not far from the Red Line station.



He grabbed the woman’s body and her left butt cheek, prosecutor Jeff Allen said. Once again, Buckner is only charged with a misdemeanor.



Despite the multiple bail violations and arrests for serious crimes, Judge Kelly McCarthy ordered Buckner to pay just a $5,000 deposit toward bail in the Loyola case and $3,000 in the June case until Buckner sees the judge overseeing that matter on Monday. It turns out that in 2017, he was accused by a list of women for grotesque sexual offenses in the subways. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that prosecutors said Buckner admitted to “probably” molesting 75 women. Yet a week before Thanksgiving of last year, when he was charged for violating the terms of the sex offender registry, he was released on his own recognizance because of an insanity plea.

This is the two-tiered justice we have in America. This is why the streets are full of violent criminals who will commit endless violent crimes for years to come. Think about all the violent criminal who used to be locked up during the “tough on crime” era who are now out. Those people need to be behind bars.

This chart from the New York Times shows the dangers on the streets in one chart:

The Left is celebrating the fact that the black incarceration rate has been nearly cut in half over the past generation and are calling for even more prison releases. However, when you measure the body count of thousands of excess black homicide victims over the past few years, you realize that this is nothing to celebrate. The reality is that among the black population, unfortunately, are a disproportionate share of violent criminals, usually tied to gangs. They are not in prison at higher numbers because of low-level crimes or drug crimes, but for violent crimes. According to the FBI’s crime data explorer, roughly 60% of the homicide offenders in 2021 whose race was known were black.

Any effort to go soft on prison sentences of career criminals out of concern for black prison rates – a sentiment too many Republicans have bought into over the past decade – will necessarily result in harming black victims of crime more than anyone else. Almost 60% of the homicide victims in 2021 were also black.

It’s no longer enough for Republicans to run ads complaining about crime and promising to “fund the police.” They need to promise mandatory minimums for violent and repeat offenders, toughening penalties for bail, parole, and probation violations, targeting gangs, and a legitimate three-strikes-and-you’re-out law.



While one can debate the degree of punishment to mete out to lower-level criminals, the street crimes we are witnessing in America’s major cities are being committed by those whom both parties used to deem a threat and support taking off the streets. Yet now we live in a world where Democrat Governors like Kathy Hochul in New York don’t understand why it’s so important to lock these people up . Hopefully, Republicans have finally learned their lesson and will pursue criminal justice reform in the exact opposite way they did this past decade and save their desire for grace and leniency for those targeted for political crimes.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-army-recruitment-down,2022-11-02
Horowitz: What conservatives must do following the FBI raid on Trump,"Watch out, Democrats, Republicans are about to take over the House. And if we are still free by next January, they will hold hearings and send fundraising emails on how they can’t do anything meaningful to restore democracy until they win the next election in 2025. Or will this time be different?

Watching all the GOP leaders foam at the mouth and sputter with anger over the FBI raid of Trump’s home is hilarious. For the same reason Democrats didn’t feel deterred from taking this action in the first place, they will go undeterred for the next one, which is why the FBI followed up the next day with seizing the phone of Rep. Scott Perry. The GOP simply refuses to do what it takes to harness national attention on the issues that matter and induce an inflection point in society. Not only do they decline to hold up must-pass bills, but they have consistently worked with Democrats on numerous other bills to forge Biden’s legacy for free.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell initially didn’t even make a statement regarding the unprecedented raid and awkwardly declined to comment when first questioned about it. Only later on Tuesday did he meekly call for an explanation for the raid. Presumably, he still thinks Ukraine is the most important issue. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy threatened to subpoena AG Merrick Garland next year when, seemingly, Republicans win back the House.

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise promised to hold the FBI accountable next year.

But how is this going to change anything? We can’t wait until then to restore democracy, and hearings, while useful, will not be a big-enough blunt instrument to arrest the onslaught against human rights. Talk is cheap. Enough about hearings, fundraising emails, and obsessively focusing on the next election. Here are steps that must be taken immediately to deter the federal police state:

States must block the FBI from political persecutions: Republicans like to direct our attention to the next federal election while obfuscating the fact that they already command supermajority control in 20 or so states. For the most part, the federal government is irremediably broken and will not be fixed with an election. States need to interpose against federal tyranny. State legislatures should convene emergency sessions and pass laws barring the FBI from operating within their states to investigate or apprehend political dissidents.

One such bill has been introduced in Oklahoma by state Senator Nathan Dahm. SB 1166, the “Prohibition on Political Prisoners in Oklahoma Act,” would prohibit the federal government from transporting through the state any January 6 prisoner not charged with a felony. Remember, this is not just about Trump. The Biden administration views Trump’s supporters as the #1 terrorist threat and will continue to target them for contrived or nebulous crimes motivated 100% by political persecution.

Creation of state guards: Florida recently created a state guard that cannot be federalized. Other states must follow suit and make it clear they will use the guard to confront any federal officials – be they FBI, DHS, ATF, or IRS – who prima facie target political opponents.

Sheriff’s posses: Connected to the previous point, we must begin declaring sanctuary counties in which sheriffs will work together with the citizenry to form citizen posse units. Their job will be to defend victims of federal persecution within the counties at a moment’s notice.

Block the fiscal year 2023 budget bill: Republicans aren’t even promising to block the budget bills to repeal the 87,000 IRS agents when they win back the House, much less doing so in September, but there is no time like the present. It’s time to force a national inflection point. Democrats still need 10 Senate Republicans to pass a budget bill. Republicans should hold up any budget bill until there are policy riders prohibiting the use of funding for political persecutions, the hiring of new IRS agents, the funding of Pfizer and Moderna, and any COVID mandate.

Slash the budgets of the FBI and ATF: Rather than just holding hearings, Republicans must pledge next year to pass a budget bill slashing the budgets of these rogue agencies and channeling those reduced funds to a very narrow purview of dealing with career violent felons and Islamic terrorists, for example.

In other words, we need a synergistic response from Republicans at both the state and federal levels. In a perfect world, the GOP governors would hold a joint press conference and discuss the trend of FBI raids on ordinary citizens – not just Trump – simply for holding different political views from the regime’s. They would commit to working together to interpose against the federal tyranny, rather than just campaigning on it.

The federal government doesn’t have the authority to violate due process and human rights, as we’ve witnessed for the past two years of COVID fascism. No, we don’t need merely to win federal elections in order to undo that tyranny; states can stop it in its tracks now. The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution (Art. VI, Cl. 2) states that the “Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land,” but only when exercising power “in pursuance” of its Constitution authority.

St. George Tucker explains this clause in his commentaries to clearly infer that “a law not limited to those objects, or not made pursuant to the constitution, would not be the supreme law of the land, but an act of usurpation, and consequently void.” Mind you, this clause was referring to legitimate laws passed by Congress. How much more so it would apply to arbitrary executive edicts.

The notion that we must wait for federal elections to fight back is absurd. Thomas Jefferson, in his Kentucky Resolution of 1798, noted that elections were only reserved as the tool to redress grievances of federal policies within their delegated authority. “That in cases of an abuse of the delegated powers, the members of the general government being chosen by the people, a change by the people would be the constitutional remedy,” writes Jefferson. What if the feds clearly abuse their authority by monitoring, surveilling, and arresting people for political crimes or by making them wear masks on their faces?

“But where powers are assumed which have not been delegated a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy: that every state has a natural right, in cases not within the compact [casus non foederis] to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits: that without this right, they would be under the dominion, absolute and unlimited, of whosoever might exercise this right of judgment for them.”



It’s time for the governors to stand up and teach the Biden administration about the natural right of states to govern most non-foreign-policy issues. We don’t need to wait until 2025 to restore human rights and the rule of law. We live in extraordinary times and face unparalleled threats to our liberty, which require an unprecedented response. If Republicans will just hold hearings and fundraisers, they as may as well combat domestic fascism by sending more money to Ukraine, a move Mitch McConnell would be all too eager to embrace.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-chicago-releases-the-most-violent-offenders-to-commit-the-exact-same-crimes,2022-08-10
Horowitz: Conservatives must finally break free from the stranglehold of fake Republicans,"The problem for conservatives headed forward is not so much mail-in ballots as it is mail-in Republicans.



If Haggai the prophet were around today, he’d likely chastise conservative voters as follows: “Consider your ways: You have sown much and you bring in little. You eat without being satiated. You drink without getting your fill. You dress, and it has no warmth. And he who profits, profits into a bundle with holes.”

No matter how much the Republican Party cheats on its base – committing sins that the eyes cannot unsee – conservatives continue to slavishly genuflect to the party’s every whim and offer to carry water for Republicans. They treat Republican politicians as the masters rather than the servants. They believe we must support them at any cost rather than understanding that they need our support to even exist, because Democrats already locked up the voters they truly desire. Conservative influencers continue to view themselves as loyal Republicans and refuse to explore any blunt force trauma to this perfidious party that would force a cathartic moment when either we finally take over the party or we have a critical mass to either start a new one or use the GOP only for ballot access but form a party within a party.

The scope of the problem is not limited to a few RINOs. In fact, we are the RINOs. With the exception of a handful of Republicans who accidentally win office, almost every elected Republican is either indifferent or downright on the other side of the issues that really matter, in the way they matter, and at the time they matter. Just consider that only one senator and only one governor are fighting the issue of our time – biomedical tyranny. Or the fact that not only did a bunch of Republicans vote with Democrats to codify gay marriage as a right against religious liberty, but not a single leadership member in either party spoke out against it and none whipped against it.

In order to secure our votes, they pretend to be with us on the issues that don’t matter, or in the way and at the time they don’t matter. Then they employ a brilliant tactic to keep us on the plantation – threaten us with the prospect of the Democrat winning, the very same Democrats they work with on the issues that matter.

Cunningly, the Republicans understand that while they have no problem working with the Democrats, their base is truly revolted by and fearful of the Democrats. Hence, the argument of “but the Democrats” resonates the most precisely with those most likely to rebel against the perfidious party leadership. Thus, they have created a never-ending zero-sum game. The more the GOP commits perfidy and works with the Democrats on the issues of the time, the farther the political landscape and Overton window shift to the left. The more disquiet and fear instilled in the base about the Democrats further winning, the more the base is hoodwinked into voting Republican without doing any much-needed political surgery.

If you take this vicious cycle to its logical conclusion … it has no conclusion – other than us inexorably becoming wards of Klaus Schwab’s AI transhumanist kingdom. Because whether the issue is COVID, Ukraine, marriage, immigration, spending, global warming, no matter how much the Republicans screw us, they can always turn around and say, “Well, it’s going to be worse if the Democrats win.” In reality, it’s the GOP that acts as the forward advance guard or the getaway car for the Democrats – it’s a one-two step in which the Democrats could not succeed in what they are doing without a veneer of bipartisanship so that they won’t own the blame or fallout of their destructive policies.

Conservative talk show hosts and news influencers need to be asked: What is their plan to stop this cycle of failure and degeneration? And is there no limit to the perfidy of the GOP or particular Republicans that will finally prompt them to stop voting for them? Until conservatives are willing to shoot the hostage, they will never wield any leverage over the Republicans. McConnell and company rightly wager that Republicans will always come back to them because they have nowhere else to go. Jared Kushner said as much to Trump in advocating that he deviate from the MAGA agenda on certain issues.



As we explore multiple ways to shake up the party, particularly at the state and local levels in solid red states first, we must be willing to make it clear that at some point there is a bridge too far. Remember, the establishment torpedoes our candidates in the rare instance that they win the primaries. They not only refuse to support them but openly undermine them. We must return the favor.

The interesting thing about the Republican Party in the way it’s currently constituted is that it not only hates its base, but it increasingly does not appeal to independent voters, despite the fact that Democrats don’t really appeal to them either. Now is the perfect time to begin running respectable candidates with new ideas on an anti-elitist message but devoid of the typical divisive labels to appeal to a broad subset of the electorate who are deeply dismayed with the status quo of the duopoly. There is no silver bullet, but here is a rough outline of things that must be done concurrently:

A pledge against elite globalist Republicans: We don’t need perfection, but when you have Republicans openly undermining us on the key issues of the time, we need a petition of hundreds of thousands of Republican voters pledging they will never vote for them – primary or general election. A good place to start are the 12 Senate Republicans who voted to force gay marriage and its accompanying rainbow jihad against the church upon our communities. Almost all those 12 Republicans are in solid red states and undermine us on many other issues too. For example, Thom Tillis, who is a liberal pretty much on every issue, is also working on an amnesty bill with Democrats. It needs to be made clear that these people will never have our support.

Run independent candidates in the general election: So does this mean you just “let the Democrat win”? That should not stop us from running truly independent candidates in the general election for statewide office who have a broader message and have not been attached so much (or at all) to the Republican Party. I offered a blueprint for this in the Pennsylvania Senate race, when it became clear that Oz was both a leftist and unelectable, that we should have run someone from the medical freedom movement and strip the labels of “conservative” and “liberal.” We need to break the paradigm of the binary uniparty, and we only need one race to break this impervious monopoly. Also, unlike an official new party, it’s fairly easy to get on the ballot as an independent in most states. And nothing appeals more to swing voters these days than the label “independent,” which is something all of us who hate the status quo – from traditional conservative to populists or disenchanted classical liberal – should embrace.

Continue to run primaries with better focus: Where possible, we should still run in Republican primaries, but focus more on governors than on the House or Senate. The federal government is lost. We need to focus on getting more governors like Ron DeSantis in red states, yet at present we have not even a single one. Our entire primary focus should be on governors for red states like Utah, West Virginia, North Dakota, Indiana, and Missouri, which are all up in 2024 but have lackluster GOP governors. There is an immediate opportunity in Kentucky, which has its election next year and is currently held by a Democrat. So far, Savannah Maddox, the most conservative member of the legislature, appears to be the best candidate. And again, when the result of the primaries is unacceptable to us, we should look for independent candidates with a broad appeal. This strategy has promise not only in solid red states but in swing states as well. As for downballot offices – from state legislature to school board and county positions – it’s hard to have a slate of independent candidates with enough money and name ID. We can probably only target this strategy of running independents initially for statewide office. So, for lower offices we will have to run Republicans; however, we need candidates who don’t consider themselves as Republicans and are merely using the party for ballot access – the same way the party uses us for our votes. For legislative bodies, we should make it clear that these candidates will form their own caucus and use their leverage against GOP leadership when needed, almost rendering it like a parliamentarian system. Once elected and having achieved notoriety, they can consider switching to independent, similar to what Kyrsten Sinema has just done after leaving the Democrat Party.

Switch from popular primaries to state conventions/caucuses: In swing states, the Republican brand is not only fraudulent but also toxic. In red states, the brand is still intact, but most red states are run by perfidious Republicans. I can write an entire book on how it’s nearly impossible to knock off Republicans in a primary without a scandal, and even most open seats are hard to win. They have all the money and use it to fool voters by running on our issues with no intent of fulfilling their promises. There is one way to change this cycle of failure. Rather than forcing candidates to raise millions of dollars, money only the bad guys have, they should go through a caucus or convention system whereby voters in precincts elect a representative to vote for them at a convention. The activists know who the frauds are. If you had a Utah-style convention in a state like Texas, Gregg Abbott would have lost his primary. This is the only way to get in a critical mass of non-Republican Republicans in one election cycle. Several years ago, I wrote an outline explaining how this would work.

Focus activism and pressure over issues, not just elections: The way to create a political environment either for primary challenges or independent runs is for conservative voters – who are busy with life, work, and family – to actually know just how bad their GOP governor and legislators are. We need a focused pressure campaign to expose the issues and personnel during legislative sessions so people realize in their deep red districts just how long their Republican representative has been faking it. Every policy opportunity in every legislative session must be exploited, and every bad policy from executive branches in red states must be pointed out and pressure brought to bear on the two-faced Republicans to “convert or die.” Getting active on the issues, especially at the state and local levels, which are less saturated with activism than Congress, is more impactful than elections.

There is a common denominator to all of these action items. They require a mindset that we are the masters of the GOP, not its servants. We must start holding Republicans’ feet to the fire, not carrying water for them. We have no obligation to them. There is a middle ground between continuing the same failed GOP game for the rest of our lives and immediately starting a new party. We make it clear that the Republican Party as it is currently constituted is dead to us, and we act in our own interests. The above ideas are just the beginning of an outline of what that practically looks like. Some of my colleagues in this business might be content to continue playing the game, but for me, I’m done.

Horowitz: Courts are unilaterally redefining sexuality against legitimate rights,"The government can deny you entry into every public university in New York state for not injecting a private novel product into your body or covering your breathing holes all day with a dirty mask. And now, the government can force a private Jewish college to not only accept you but accept a union dedicated to promoting homosexuality and every other sexual behavior codified by the ever-evolving alphabet soup of Sodom and Gomorrah.



Last week, the Supreme Court rejected a request for stay of a New York court ruling which forced the nation’s oldest Jewish university to allow a “gay pride” group to operate within the campus. The court declined to rule on the merits of the request and legality of the issue, and instead punted based on the premise that the institution has other avenues to pursue appeals in the lower courts. It is very telling how it would hesitate for one minute to rule on an unambiguous and dangerous violation of the First Amendment.

“Does the First Amendment permit a State to force a Jewish school to instruct its students in accordance with an interpretation of Torah that the school, after careful study, has concluded is incorrect? The answer to that question is surely ‘no,’” wrote Justice Alito in his dissent, in which he was joined by Justices Gorsuch, Thomas, and Barrett. “The First Amendment guarantees the right to the free exercise of religion, and if that provision means anything, it prohibits a State from enforcing its own preferred interpretation of Holy Scripture. Yet that is exactly what New York has done in this case, and it is disappointing that a majority of this Court refuses to provide relief.”

Earlier this year, a New York trial court ordered the Manhattan-based college to recognize the LGBT student group’s right to promote anti-Jewish values and to “immediately” grant it “the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges afforded to all other student groups.” Thus far, the other appellate courts have failed to grant an expedited relief. In response, Yeshiva University has firmly put a halt to its sponsorship all student groups until the matter can be resolved.

The necessity of this action means that Justice Kavanaugh declining to involve the Supreme Court essentially green-lit one of the most egregious violations of First Amendment rights in American history. The four judges made it clear in the dissent that the university would win the case if it were judged on the merits.

Broadly speaking, the Supreme Court has allowed lower state and federal courts to trample on religious rights and create novel rights for their favorite sexual “identities” that demand states and religious institutions affirmatively accommodate their bizarre and often dangerous behavior — such as castration operations. It’s not like you could evacuate from blue states like New York and escape this insanity. The courts are pushing it on red states everywhere.









In May, a federal judge in Indiana denied a motion from the Metropolitan School District of Martinsville to allow separate bathrooms for those who are biologically male and female. At the time, the court ruled that keeping separate bathrooms violates Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution written in 1867. Similarly, the Supreme Court has refused to overturn a decision made by the Ninth Circuit, which forced Idaho to treat a male prisoners like females and fund castration surgery.

Last month, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that transgenderism is a right enshrined in the Americans with Disabilities Act, thereby forcing states to house male prisoners who think they are women in female prisons, endangering the safety of the other inmates. The more conservative Eighth Circuit ruled that Arkansas must allow doctors to perform castration on minors.

Thus, it’s become self-evident that the federal courts are going to force every aspect of the transgender/transhumanist agenda upon the states, and the Supreme Court will not be there to defend history and tradition, as well as sanity and religious liberty. The left fears the coming era of a permanent conservative Supreme Court, and too many conservatives are anticipating with glee such an outcome. In reality, we will likely pay for the impending Dobbs ruling on abortion with the non-Thomas/Alito justices taking turns betraying us on other issues in order to “preserve the integrity of the court.” Nowhere is this more evident that with the transgender issue. Based on recent decisions, even the standard “deeply rooted in history and tradition” created by Dobbs to define an unenumerated right should easily contradict all of these rulings.

So, what is the answer? We must remember Abraham Lincoln’s admonition that “we the people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts, not to overthrow the Constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution.” If a court can redefine humanity and block a state from common sense recognition of gender (while green-lighting states to force masks and shots), then there is nothing a court cannot do, and we have ceased being a constitutional republic. At some point, states must begin saying “no thank you” to the courts, and Montana might be in the process of doing just that.

Last week, a Montana judge – in this case, a state judge – ruled that the Department of Public Health and Human Services must allow people to change their birth certificate to reflect their perceived gender, in contravention to SB280, a law that was recently signed which prohibits the department from making such changes. The department issued a regulation to change the word “gender” on the birth certificate to “sex,” which it noted is obviously “immutable.” It appears that for now, the executive branch is asserting its authority over issuing birth certificates, something not in the purview of the courts.

“The Department thoroughly evaluated the judge’s vague April 2022 decision and crafted our final rule to be consistent with the decision. It’s unfortunate that the judge’s ruling today does not square with his vague April decision. The 2022 final rule that the Department issued on September 9 remains in effect, and we are carefully considering next steps,” said Charlie Brereton, director of the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services.

We are going to need more of this throughout the red states. When Alexander Hamilton promised that the courts would wield “neither force nor will,” he certainly never imagined the will to redefine human sexuality, much less the ability to enforce such an absurdity.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-conservatives-must-finally-break-free-from-the-stranglehold-of-fake-republicans,2022-09-19
Horowitz: Elevating homosexuality to a national religion,"Allah forbid that Republicans would ever stand for biblical values. But are they still so dense as not to realize where the effort to redefine marriage – only for one type of sexual behavior – came from and where it is headed? Indeed, this was never about “marriage equality,” but about codifying homosexuality as a national religion in order to uproot all social norms and family structure and trample all other rights at its expense.

On Tuesday, the House passed a bill that not only repeals the federal Defense of Marriage Act, but also bans states from defining marriage as it always has been since the dawn of civilization. Along with every Democrat, 47 Republicans supported the bill. But more telling, GOP leaders refused to whip against it, and even most of those who spoke out against the bill referred to it more as a distraction or claimed the Democrat assertion that the Supreme Court could overturn Obergefell is unfounded. In fact, with ubiquitous redefining of gender and endless child grooming, now is precisely the time they should have defended something “deeply rooted in history and tradition” and the need to reverse Obergefell.

Those “moderate” Republicans who are fine with banning the basic definition of marriage and who thought redefining marriage through the courts would never lead to transgender grooming are deluding themselves. While intellectually, one could obviously support one without the other, practically and politically it was always headed in this direction, for a very simple reason. Regardless of one's values, we cannot forget that gay marriage was never about rights and equality. Same-sex lovers, like anyone else who engages in a form of intimate relations deemed sinful (or otherwise) by the Bible, were fully able, before Obergefell, to indulge their desires unimpeded by government. So what problem were they trying to rectify, if not societal transformation and conformity to their broader cause of decivilization and cultural Marxism?

In fact, for decades before Obergefell, homosexuality was promoted by every cultural elite institution. In 1996, Justice Scalia, in his famous Romer v. Evans dissent, noted how in vogue homosexuality was to the legal profession:

How that class feels about homosexuality will be evident to anyone who wishes to interview job applicants at virtually any of the Nation’s law schools. The interviewer may refuse to offer a job because the applicant is a Republican; because he is an adulterer; because he went to the wrong prep school or belongs to the wrong country club; because he eats snails; because he is a womanizer; because she wears real-animal fur; or even because he hates the Chicago Cubs. But if the interviewer should wish not to be an associate or partner of an applicant because he disapproves of the applicant’s homosexuality, then he will have violated the pledge which the Association of American Law Schools requires all its member schools to exact from job interviewers: “assurance of the employer’s willingness” to hire homosexuals.

Fast-forward to 2015 and the Obergefell decision, and the pendulum had already swung so much in favor of homosexuality over religious liberty that it was religious business owners and institutions who were being persecuted for wanting to abide by their religion – deeply rooted in our history and tradition – with their own property. There was no need for special protections for same-sex relationships, which is exactly what they were asking for by redefining a basic institution in order to accommodate a behavior that was in vogue.

Just how insidious was the Obergefell decision? Just two years before, in Windsor v. U.S., Justice Kennedy made it clear that the federal government has no role in marriage and that it is left to the states to regulate. “By history and tradition the definition and regulation of marriage, as will be discussed in more detail, has been treated as being within the authority and realm of the separate States,” wrote the justice in asserting that the federal government could not define the parameters of marriage, even exclusively for federal benefits. Then two years later, he ruled that even states cannot define marriage as a marriage for themselves. Now Congress wants to codify that ban on states in statute, something DOMA never did to blue states even in its full glory. Indeed, a number of these states recognized gay marriage under its operation. But it was a slow yet unrelenting subterfuge to gradually turn the homosexual marriage agenda from a lamb to a lion, from a shield to a sword.

The question they could never answer, though, is this: If this was all about equality and protection of rights, how is it justified to redefine marriage for two same-sex individuals but not for other relationships? If marriage is no longer limited to one man and one woman, why should it not include polyamory, polygamy, and incestuous relationships? Yet bizarrely, the House bill notes that marriage licenses must be issued to any “2” individuals.

Why two? What happened to the right to love for three people?

In fact, there are three reasons why the aforementioned relationships should have a stronger case in their quest for marriage recognition than same-sex lovers. First, from a natural-law perspective, polygamist, polyamorist, and incestuous marriages can result in procreation, which is what has always distinguished the institution of marriage from other relationships, including loving relationships. And in the case of polygamy, it is certainly more rooted in history than homosexual marriages. While marriage encompasses a lot more than simply having children, procreation has been the hallmark of the institution since its inception, because civilization could not perpetuate itself without it. That is the defining characteristic differentiating a marriage from any other friendship or relationship.

Moreover, so much of Kennedy’s Obergefell opinion was rooted in his fabrication of new constitutional rights – namely, the right to “dignity,” “nobility,” protection against stigmas, and the right to “define and express their identity.” If Kennedy and his disciples, in both political parties today, believe it is their responsibility and prerogative to bestow those new post-constitutional rights upon perhaps the most powerful and trendy class of people in the country, how much more so for a group that is still scorned, stigmatized, and denied their dignity to express their identity? Homosexual marriage is in vogue and glorified by Hollywood, whereas these other relationships are still heavily stigmatized. Don’t they need an even greater degree of protection? Where is their “right to love” if love and equality now encompass redefining fixed institutions, their legal parameters, their technical definitions, and the unambiguous constitutional authority behind their oversight?

The only way to answer these questions is to suggest that homosexuality is so cool that it was able to trump all legal definitions, social norms, and even religious liberty rights of business owners simply because it’s popular. As Chief Justice Roberts noted in his dissent, Kennedy’s insertion of the adjective “two” into his edict redefining marriage as between any two individuals of the same or opposite sex makes it clear that personal social preference now trumps legal consistency.

“Although the majority randomly inserts the adjective “two” in various places, it offers no reason at all why the two-person element of the core definition of marriage may be preserved while the man-woman element may not,” wrote the chief justice in Obergefell v. Hodges. “Indeed, from the standpoint of history and tradition, a leap from opposite-sex marriage to same-sex marriage is much greater than one from a two-person union to plural unions, which have deep roots in some cultures around the world. If the majority is willing to take the big leap, it is hard to see how it can say no to the shorter one.”

At the time, one could forgive Republicans for thinking, “Yes, just give them their papers and be done with it.” But again, this was never about “live and let live.” Never before were basic legal definitions, natural law, and – in the case of Christian bakers – long-standing religious liberty rights trampled in order to accommodate a sexual trend, whether cool or not. In fact, the redefinition of marriage – but only in a very specific culture – was always about grooming a population into submitting to every aspect of that culture, be it adoption into family units without a mother and father, transgenderism, drag queen story hour, and yes, the coming pedophilia trend.

Which raises the question: At what point does homosexuality qualify as a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment on account of establishing a national religion?

During the House floor debate over the First Amendment on August 20, 1789, James Madison explained the purpose of the Establishment Clause as follows: “Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law, nor compel men to worship God in any manner contrary to their conscience” (emphasis added).

If Madison’s primary concern was to ensure that Congress does not compel individuals by the force of law to service a particular religion (as opposed to the innocuous display of religious symbols or public prayer), what would he say about an unelected branch of government compelling individuals to serve paganism in any manner contrary to their conscience? To that end, why won’t Republicans at least demand full religious liberty protections for religious groups and businesses before mandating gay marriage on the states?

Just how sacred is homosexuality in this country? Consider the fact that we were told that out of concern for infectious diseases, the laws of quarantine and social distancing trump all human rights, including the right to worship, open a business, or breathe feely without a mask – regardless of whether you have risk factors, are already immune, or have prima facie symptoms. This was for a respiratory virus that was quite clearly not quarantinable from day one.

Fast-forward to monkeypox, which is the ultimate quarantinable virus. It only spreads by close contact and is almost exclusively associated with homosexual behavior at public bars and other similar venues. 98% of the males outside Africa who have contracted the virus have had intercourse with other men. So much so that the D.C. government is handing out vaccines exclusively to homosexuals.

Now, any epidemiologist would agree that, unlike with COVID, if you simply close the gay bars and houses of orgy for 15 days to flatten the curve, the virus would essentially die out. No need to shut them down for two years, just for two weeks. Yet not only is this untouchable, but the CDC is putting out a guide as to how to engage in gay sex. The WHO would rather declare a global emergency than simply tell people to lay low on the sodomy with random people for a few weeks.

Throughout last week, journalists were noting with shock and surprise how prominent liberal politicians voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, including Joe Biden himself. As if to say, “Wow, look how radical they were back then.” But in fact it demonstrates how radical all of us have become and how quickly the Overton window has shifted. One need not be a frothing-at-the-mouth anti-homosexual to appreciate that you simply don’t change the definition of an obvious institution the same way you wouldn’t do so to accommodate other intimate relationships that might truly involve sincerely held love.

The complete abandonment of basic common sense by both parties has led to the elevation of homosexuality itself as a supremely unequal “right” that is preeminent and trumps all other rights, including personal property and conscience rights. Theoretically, the redefinition of marriage to accommodate homosexuality didn’t need to lead to the trampling of religious liberty rights. But practically, it was inevitable, because it was never about a piece of paper. It was about a piece of your soul. And they will continue to fill up the alphabet with their licentious acronyms until they have it.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-courts-are-unilaterally-redefining-sexuality-against-legitimate-rights,2022-07-25
"Horowitz: Federal judge overseeing J6 cases announces retirement, no interest in presiding over 1,000 more cases","We all knew this was coming, but in our hearts we were praying the persecutions would finally end. Anyone who merely stepped foot into the Capitol (and a few who didn’t) was charged and treated 1,000 times worse than anyone else for commensurate crimes. Now, in a bombshell revelation, Judge Thomas Hogan, one of the main D.C. district judges overseeing the J6 cases, announced in a conference call with defense attorneys that he is suddenly retiring. He further said that there are 1,000 additional cases coming down the pipeline from the DOJ (thanks to McConnell giving the department more funding), and he has no interest in presiding over them for another four to five years.

This is quite the revelation for the two-year anniversary of the event that now appears to be more of an FBI provocation and Capitol police misfiring on crowd control than an insurrection, certainly not a planned one. Oh, and don’t count on one of those thousand being Ray Epps.

But what are we going to do about it? Well, ask yourself the question we should always ponder in these situations: What would the Democrats do were the shoe on the other foot? Imagine if the Trump administration rounded up every person who merely attended a BLM riot. Well, for starters, that would literally rope in several million people. Mind you, these events were often riots from the onset, not protests turned violent by some, and they occurred day after day after day. No conservative, on the other hand, dared follow up on January 6, even with a peaceful protest. But what would Democrats do?

On the federal level, they would have held up the budget bill for as long as it took for the DOJ to stop these political persecutions. Republicans, thanks to McCarthy’s refusal to fight McConnell until it was too late, kicked that leverage until the end of the year. Now Biden can trample civil liberties without any check. And no, weak hearings on the FBI won’t scare them, especially when GOP leaders refuse to even mention the persecution of January 6 protesters specifically.

But more importantly, there is no doubt that blue states would harbor all their defendants accused of a crime, especially if they were peacefully protesting. They would not allow the FBI to come into their states and grab people on nebulous crimes, and they would certainly offer legal defense help. At some point, red-state governors and legislatures will have to step up and say no, or at least assist the defendants and place roadblocks in front of federal agents engaging in Soviet-style persecutions.

Here’s why. While BLM rioters beat thousands of cops, trespassed and looted private property, and destroyed public property with impunity, even those Jan. 6 protesters who never even committed a minor offense are being indicted under 18 U.S.C. 231(a)(3). This is the statute that prescribes up to five years in prison for “Whoever commits or attempts to commit any act to obstruct, impede, or interfere with any fireman or law enforcement officer lawfully engaged in the lawful performance of his official duties incident to and during the commission of a civil disorder …”

Even before roping in the next group of protesters, this statute has already incriminated people for merely engaging in constitutionally protected assembly and speech. The dangerous phrase “incident to and during commission of a civil order” can be used to tag anyone who merely talked to a police officer during an event where other individuals in another part of the Capitol acted violently, thereby distracting them from their duty.

Thus, the plain meaning of this statute was always unconstitutional, and now that officials are applying it even against mere speech or assembly, it must be blocked with the same vigor with which the Sons of Liberty thwarted the Quartering Act.

It’s also a fundamental violation of equality under the law in relation to the right to protest. Think of all the times BLM protesters – even the ones who weren’t violent – taunted, cursed at, and filmed police officers. They could easily have been roped into this statute, because their behavior definitely impeded and interfered with their response to the civil disorder.

Consider how thousands of rioters were allowed to vandalize 1,500 buildings , destroy 700 buildings, and block streets and terrorize motorists with impunity, just in Minneapolis alone. Less than 10% of those arrested during the endless riots in Portland wound up being prosecuted. According to a report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association, more than 2,000 officers were injured in the 574 riots across the U.S. and Canada over the course of two months. Most of those who had a direct hand in those injuries were not punished, must less protesters who were incidental to it. We cannot allow these selective enforcements of an unconstitutional, vague statute that cuts to the heart of fundamental freedoms be used as a tool to round up political opponents.

To that end, state legislatures should direct attorney generals’ offices to inquire into the names of those within the state who are being investigated by the feds for January 6-related activities. Anyone being investigated, charged, or harassed by the feds under 231(a)(3) without any other evidence of having committed a meaningful crime should trigger a set of policies from the executive branch of that state to thwart the persecution at all costs. At a minimum, the states should create a legal defense fund to argue on behalf of those individuals who are clearly being targeted for their political beliefs, not for any violent actions.

Two years into the “Reichstag moment” of the Jan. 6 agent provocateur setup, Republican leaders like McCarthy still refuse to realign their position with the new facts on the ground. Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who just called for more funding to rope in even more Jan. 6 defendants, is slated to be Rules Committee chair. This latest revelation from a straight-shooting judge should be a wake-up call that we need wholesale change among national Republicans.



Even those Republicans who bought into the regime narrative until now must concede that anyone who remotely acted violent has long since been punished and almost assuredly over-punished. Any further effort to seek indictments reeks of the worst power plays in tyrannical countries. We need an effort to call out the immoral and despotic treatment of political protesters and a call for actions that reflect the spirit of how our founders dealt with similar violations of due process, legal norms, and basic human rights. But their ineptitude shouldn’t stop red states from picking up the slack and declaring, “Not in our state.”

Horowitz: Former Trump budget director proposes model balanced budget for GOP to run with,"One of the excuses given for passing an omnibus bill in the lame-duck session is that a new GOP-controlled House won’t have enough time to deal with rewriting the entire fiscal year 2023 budget right when it’s sworn in with so much on its plate. Well, Russ Vought of the Center for Renewing America, who served as director of the Office of Management and Budget under Trump, released a budget blueprint doing all the work for the legislators. It balances the budget in 10 years by focusing mainly on cutting woke and weaponized bureaucracies rather than popular programs, which makes it very hard for Democrats to demagogue. Now it’s time to stand behind this blueprint and begin messaging its key points headed into next year’s budget fight.



For many years, Republicans wrongly communicated the message that the only way to get our fiscal house in order is to focus mainly on cutting entitlements. Because they never really intended to touch that hot potato, they gave up on cutting spending altogether and actually went along with every Democrat spending increase of every harmful bureaucratic agency funded under the annual appropriations process as “discretionary spending.”

However, although the discretionary spending is smaller than the entitlement spending, it is still significant. Moreover, the cost of those agencies and policies is much greater than their appropriations price tag. They destroy the fabric of our country through woke policies and fascistic power grabs that harm life, liberty, and property. For example, the budget authority for the EPA is about $9 billion, sadly considered a paltry sum relative to our $6 trillion annual budget. However, its true cost is in the hundreds of billions it takes out of our economy in terms of lost energy production, defective and junky products, lost jobs, and massive energy-driven inflation. Ditto for so many of the agencies governing land use, minerals, energy, and manufacturing in the Departments of Interior, Commerce, and Labor.

Can one place a price tag on the CDC and NIH and what they have unleashed upon our civilization? Or the FBI surveilling and arresting political opponents?

“Budgeting is too often an exercise in accounting and austerity, where every program takes a hit, rather than an opportunity to examine what in fact the country is spending money on,” wrote Vought in his introduction. “Nor is budgeting typically aimed at maintaining a political coalition necessary to vote for the plan. It should be. The Left has no interest in ever regaining fiscal rationality. Why should their spending priorities be protected? Particularly when such programs are damaging the very communities supporting the government with their taxes. Why should billions be spent on thousands of interwoven nonprofits, all with a vested interest in furthering multiculturalism through an open border strategy and engaging in lawfare against any effort to control the border?”

A perfect example Vought focuses on in his budget is cutting HUD’s Section 8 program. Overall, his proposal cuts HUD’s budget by 43% because the department’s policies “spread crime and dysfunction into safe neighborhoods as part of ‘affordable housing’ activism hostile towards single-family homes.”

Under each section of the budget, the blueprint targets specific legal policies that should be defunded or terminated. Individually, many of them represent only an infinitesimal portion of the national budget, but their impact on our lives, liberty, property, and character as a nation is priceless – not in a good way.

As for the military, unlike every other GOP budget, which indiscriminately throws money at the military, this budget would roughly maintain the status quo on top-line spending ($8.4 trillion as opposed to $8.9 trillion over 10 years). However, the funding would be focused on the hardware and capabilities needed to deter China, while entire woke and broke programs would be cut. Foreign aid would also be dramatically trimmed.

Yet these cuts, and the ensuing growth and unshackling of the economy they would induce (assuming a reasonable 2.7% average GDP growth rate), would result in $12.3 trillion in lower spending over 10 years. The result would be a balanced budget by 2032 rather than a $2.2 trillion deficit, as projected under the current baseline. And again, this is all done without cutting Medicare or Social Security.

Furthermore, by stripping the bureaucracies of the ability to destroy our economy from within, it would preclude things like COVID fascism from ever happening again. Remember, our government spent $5.5 trillion on COVID, not to mention an almost equal sum from Federal Reserve shenanigans. That is money that was never projected in previous budget plans, but it was unleashed upon us. Controlled demolitions, including energy lockdowns, will undoubtedly occur again unless the bureaucracies are cut, their policies banned, and their circuitous collaboration with “private” companies and NGOs neutered. That is where the battle not just for civilization but for fiscal sanity will be won or lost, not with Social Security and Medicare.

Aside from policy riders that would ban unconstitutional, illogical, or immoral government policies and programs, the budget targets some of the woke and weaponized agencies and programs for across-the-board cuts. Here is a snippet from the budget summary:

7% cut to the DOJ, including a 13% cut to the FBI intelligence and counterintelligence programs (while increasing resources for actual crime fighting by 18%).

$22 billion or 20% cut to HHS, including a 37% cut to the CDC to refocus its efforts toward fighting infectious diseases and away from sexually transmitted and chronic diseases, a 50% cut to NIAID (led by Anthony Fauci) because of its commitment to gain-of-function research, and eliminating woke bureaucracy.

$26 billion or 43% cut to HUD, including a three-year phase-out of Section 8 grants that are a magnet for crime and decreased property values and cuts to the fair housing bureaucracy committed to breaking up neighborhoods with single-family homes.

$26 billion or 45% cut to foreign aid, ensuring that State and USAID are no longer funding drag shows in Ecuador, the training of LGBT activists in Senegal, or gay pride parades in Prague.

$18 billion or 26% cut to the Department of Education’s bureaucracy funding CRT and ensuring that states avoid this bureaucracy with a large block grant.

Obviously, once we restore our civilization, we will be in a stronger position to deal with Social Security down the road. As for Medicare and Medicaid, we must first rebuild a parallel health care system built upon freedom, science, direct primary care, and decentralization, in order to transition people into something much better than these ailing socialist programs.

House Republicans must make it clear that the budget deadline should expire early next year and that something akin to this blueprint will be their messaging and red line. They should pass a budget along these lines and refuse to move off it. They should make it clear today that they have zero plans to pass a Democrat budget and will expose the harms of funding a woke and weaponized government every day through briefings, press conferences, and hearings, including through a government shutdown if necessary. Doing this will take Social Security and Medicare off the table as a distraction through which Democrats can obfuscate their harmful and unpopular policies.

Horowitz: It’s time for GOP to shut down the budget process to block ‘Build Back Better’ reconciliation bill,"After agreeing to pass a $280 billion mini “Build Back Better” bill last week, Republicans gave up their leverage to block Democrats from using budget reconciliation to raise $739 billion in taxes and spend $433 billion fundamentally transforming health care, agriculture, and energy. While Republicans are vowing to fight this tax-and-spend bill, they have failed to publicly float the nuclear option, aka blocking the fiscal year 2023 continuing resolution if Democrats pass the reconciliation bill. They need to understand that this bill is much worse than a typical tax-and-spend bill and therefore requires them to proverbially lie down on the tracks to prevent it from passing.



Aside from extending Obamacare itself in this bill (another $100 billion in spending for the health care cartel), the Orwellian-named “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022” will do to agriculture and energy what Obamacare did to health care. The bill will essentially create a government-run monopoly for wind and solar and transform our economy away from energy that works to the sources that don’t work. If you like what you see in Germany, with edicts to take cold showers and turn the lights off because the country went “green,” you will love this new BBB bill.

Despite years of subsidies totaling over $100 billion for green energy that failed to yield a breakout in its utility for consumers, this bill throws $30 billion at the states to transition to green energy. In addition, the bill creates a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, which cost an average of $66,000, a clear handout for the elites. They have not been shy about their desire for us to transition to only purchasing electric vehicles, and this bill will attempt to socially engineer that outcome. The bill also increases subsidies for biofuels, which increase the cost of fuel and food.

And speaking of food prices, this bill increases spending on “conservation programs” by $20 billion over five years. For years, our government has de facto paid farmers not to grow crops by enrolling up to 25 million acres annually in the Conservation Reserve Program. The program has incentivized wealthy landowners to buy up land from real farmers to keep it dormant in order to save the planet from the weather! The program does nothing but enrich wealthy landowners and further inflate the cost of land, just like any subsidized asset bubble, all the while reducing the supply of crops. This bill will further exacerbate the trend of Bill Gates and his ilk buying up land to ensure that American farming as we know it is transformed.

After offering leftists’ prized industries tailwinds in the economy, the bill has headwinds planned for the industries they don’t like, namely oil, gas, and coal. The bill imposes (Sec. 60113) for the first time a methane tax of $1,500 per ton on the oil and gas industry on “excess” methane emissions. In addition, Sec. 50261 of the bill increases royalties for drilling on federal offshore lands from 12.5% to between 16.67% and 18.5%. It contains numerous other fee increases up and down the process of leasing and using the lands, which will collectively make the process more expensive and pass the costs down to consumers at a time when they are suffering from record costs.



As for the coal industry, the bill provides $45 million for the EPA to regulate carbon emissions, which will cost the private economy a lot more than $45 million and shutter the already wounded industry. Even Germany is smart enough to begin jump-starting its coal industry during this energy crisis.

In other words, this is not a typical tax-and-spend bill. This is about fulfilling Biden’s campaign promise to “end fossil fuel.” Typical tax-and-spend bills don’t use a slogan that is being pushed by the communists internationally. Yet “Build Back Better” is a refrain incessantly used by the World Economic Forum, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacenda Ardern, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and even the Ukrainian government.

""Build Back Better"" Compilation - ""The Great Reset"" Montage youtu.be

The bill also allocates $80 billion for empowering the IRS to collect more taxes, a shocking and scary number that is likely about a lot more than raising revenue.

As such, Republicans cannot afford to fake fight this as they do other spending bills; they must lay it all on the line. There are two must-pass bills coming up before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30: the FY 2023 budget bill and the defense authorization bill. Now is the time for them to make a stand and refuse to supply the 60 votes to pass those bills unless Schumer backs down on budget reconciliation. Although the reconciliation bill can be passed with 51 votes, the budget bill is still subject to a filibuster.

If Republicans cannot hold a budget bill hostage in the minority when Democrats are extremely unpopular, nothing will change when they are in the majority.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-former-trump-budget-director-proposes-model-balanced-budget-for-gop-to-run-with,2022-08-03
Horowitz: Gov’t watchdog reports internal allegations of political interference in science at NIH/CDC/FDA,"""Respondents from CDC and FDA told us they did not report potential political interference in scientific decision-making because they feared retaliation."" While these words from a brand-new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report are not earth-shattering to anyone paying attention over the past two years, they are a bombshell coming from a government agency.

The GAO just released a report on political interference in scientific decisions, based on interviews with employees of the four HHS agencies most responsible for the coronavirus response. The findings were derived from personal interviews as well as tips offered to a confidential hotline set up for the investigation. The investigators’ conclusion, which they conveyed in a letter to leaders of the House and Senate judiciary committees and committees overseeing HHS, was that these agencies “do not have procedures that define political interference in scientific decision-making or describe how it should be reported and addressed.”

The four agencies subject to the GAO investigation were the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR).

The GAO investigators revealed to Congress that ""a few respondents from CDC and FDA stated they felt that the potential political interference they observed resulted in the alteration or suppression of scientific findings."" What were the consequences? ""Some of these respondents believed that this potential political interference may have resulted in the politically motivated alteration of public health guidance or delayed publication of COVID-19-related scientific findings.""

Oh, so you mean political science, cronyism, and fear of retaliation explain why dangerous novel vaccines and therapeutics got immediate approval as standard of care (and even used for mandates) despite sketchy data and no established safety profile, while dozens of promising already-FDA-approved off-label drugs were ignored or denigrated – all for politics? Yeah, no kidding.

The reason this is so earth-shattering is not that pay-for-play is new to government agencies, such as the EPA or the DOD, for example, where outside cronies use politics and money to corrupt good public policy all the time. It’s that our very lives, liberty, and bodily integrity have now been pegged to the whims of “science.” Thus, the agencies tasked with studying that science are not only run by political science, but have zero procedures in place to root out the inevitable political control of that science, which results in nothing short of life-and-death decisions.

Moreover, these agencies suffer from a particular moral hazard in the sense that the very corporations most likely to corrupt the science and poison the bodies of the people pay the bills and salaries of these agencies. Prior to 1992, the FDA was prohibited from accepting fees from drug companies. Following the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), which allowed it to collect fees, “user fees have played an important role in expediting the drug approval process,” according to the FDA’s website. How “important” is this role? By 2017, Big Pharma paid 75% of the FDA’s drug review budget. Much of the agency’s funding comes from the “nonprofit” CDC Foundation authorized in that 1992 bill, which is funded by companies like Pfizer and Merck. Science magazine reported in 2018 that nearly half the doctors and scientists on the FDA’s various advisory committees received funding from Big Pharma companies to get their drugs approved.



Private emails released via FOIA revealed several months ago that the CDC Foundation worked with Facebook, Merck, the WHO, and other pharma entities on an “Alliance for Advancing Health Online” initiative to control the narrative. So whether it’s issues of off-label early treatments, vaccine safety and efficacy, science about asymptomatic transmission, or the threat of COVID to children, every morsel of information put out by the HHS agencies is influenced and controlled by pharma and Big Tech to steer a specific outcome that will always benefit Big Pharma.

Gee, is it any wonder why the FDA has just approved a failed and toxic drug like remdesivir even for babies and toddlers as standard of care for $3,000, while refusing to offer even tacit approval for existing, fully approved drugs like fluvoxamine, budesonide, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin? They didn’t even complete the study on remdesivir for babies, and it won’t be finished until next year! In fact, even this week, the FDA continued to horse around with the Nobel Prize-winning ivermectin, while approving Merck’s true horse drug Molnupiravir, which is so dangerous that even the media has attacked it.

Oh, and now HHS can work with the DHS’ new “Disinformation Governing Board” to enforce Big Pharma fascism on behalf of their benefactors.

This is not your grandfather’s bureaucratic pay-for-play scheme. This affects the lives and bodies of hundreds of millions of people. There used to be a limit to how much they were willing to bend life science for political science and greed. Now, there is no limit.

There’s a reason why the pharma fascists and the biomedical tyrants need this degree of control, collusion, subsidization, and censorship to succeed in their plot. At a recent Canadian parliamentary committee hearing, the president of Astra Zeneca Canada could not answer why the company vigorously lobbied governments for complete exemption from all liability.

I think we know the answer. They can’t afford accountability and liability, and they can get away with ensuring they will never be held responsible. The only immunity the shots convey is for the manufacturers. Who is going to hold them responsible? Can you name the number of Republicans running for office this year on the promise to alter the powers of HHS and its relationship with Big Pharma? You won’t need more than one hand to count the names.

Horowitz: How many lives could have been saved by aggressive use of vitamin D alone?,"It has always been an unsettling thought: What if our government, instead of obsessively pushing policies that were all pain and no gain – masks, lockdowns, remdesivir, and mRNA gene therapy – had aggressively promoted daily supplementation with vitamin D? Well, a new study of vitamin D treatment lead by a Johns Hopkins researcher purports to show at least 116,000 people could have been saved, and those numbers are likely a fraction of the overall benefit with a preventive regimen of vitamin D to elevate serum levels above 50, not to mention numerous other safe supplements and therapeutics that could have been used.



To determine the association between vitamin D3 and D2 supplementation and COVID-19 infection and mortality, the U.S.-based researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study identifying 220,265 VA patients supplemented with vitamin D3 , 34,710 supplemented with vitamin D2, and 407,860 untreated patients both before and during the period of the pandemic. The top-line results were that those veterans supplementing with D2 were associated with a 28% lower chance of testing positive for COVID and those supplementing with D3 were 20% less likely to test positive. But the more important results were the reduced mortality from COVID-associated death, with D3, the most common vitamin D supplementation on the market, resulting in a 33% reduction in mortality.

As the authors note, this would have taken a significant chunk out of the COVID death toll. “When we extrapolate our results for vitamin D 3 supplementation to the entire US population in 2020, there would have been approximately 4 million fewer COVID-19 cases and 116,000 deaths avoided,” boldly proclaimed the study authors.

But the numbers are much more poignant than their top-line numbers suggest. While the authors researched both reduced COVID infection and COVID mortality for the top-line numbers, they only published the reduced infection – not reduced mortality data – of the sub-cohorts of levels and cumulative amounts of D supplementation. For example, they found that those who were using 50,000 IUs experienced a 49% reduction in infection rates. One can only imagine that mortality would have been even further reduced with high-dose vitamin D.

We already know that serum levels of D at the time of infection matter to clinical outcomes. An Israeli study showed 25% of hospitalized COVID patients with vitamin D deficiency died, compared to just three percent among those without a deficiency. And those with a deficiency in that Israeli study were also fourteen times more likely to end up with a severe or critical condition. A meta-analysis of 40 pooled studies found that vitamin D supplementation correlated with a 65% reduction of risk for ICU admission. Thus far, there have been 99 treatment and 139 sufficiency studies showing a positive association with COVID outcomes.

This could easily have been the most important early strategy with nursing home patients and is still quite important. Those with absorption problems could have been given the active form of D – either calcifediol or calcitriol – to raise their levels, bypassing the liver’s metabolic process very quickly. Studies have shown that almost anyone hospitalized with low levels but given the active form of D did not progress to the ICU thereafter.

Just consider how safe, cheap, and broadly beneficial vitamin D is for so many other health concerns. This benefit was known from day one, yet it is still being kept quiet, even as concerns grow about a virulent flu and RSV season, and we know vitamin D is an immunomodulator against all respiratory viruses. We know almost half the U.S. population is deficient in D (82% of black people), and many more could probably use a boost. Where are the health department bulletins warning about this, as they do for getting boosters of mRNA gene juice? Where is the obsession to test people’s D levels to ensure they are above 40-50 ngs/mL, just like the obsession about COVID testing? Every pediatrician is being incentivized to shove one vaccine after another on children, but how many even know their patients’ D levels?



While we’ve seen many studies before, this massive sample size has a P value of 0.0001, which makes the likelihood of positive association with vitamin D being due to chance almost nil. It’s also published in Nature’s prestigious-access peer-reviewed journal, Scientific Reports.

To this day, doctors like Eric Nepute are being sued by the Department of Justice for selling supplements they say might be beneficial against COVID. Yet the government refuses to change course based on the evidence. At the same time, the government funds and markets the mRNA vaccines with FDA labels that treat them like perfect, sterilizing vaccines.

All red-state legislatures have an obligation to grill their respective state health directors to see if they are promoting vitamin D with a fraction of the gusto with which they are promoting the mRNA gene therapy.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-govt-watchdog-reports-internal-allegations-of-political-interference-in-science-at-nih-cdc-fda,2022-11-22
Horowitz: Idaho conservatives poised to remake legislature like never before,"Idaho has long suffered a paradox, in that it is so dominated by Republicans that it is not so Republican at all. Because it is a de facto one-party state, many liberals who are well connected to the woke industries and lobbyists choose to run as Republicans and use their superior campaign cash to campaign as conservatives, the exact opposite of what they plan to do in office. This is why, despite a 58-12 majority in the House and a 28-7 majority in the Senate, conservatives rarely enjoy legislative wins that other red states are able to easily secure. Last night’s elections might have changed that in a big way.

Establishment Republican elites are crowing about their apparent victories in both the Pennsylvania Senate race and the Idaho gubernatorial race on Tuesday. Idaho Gov. Brad Little warded off a challenge from Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. However, when you get past the statewide elections, which require tremendous money and organization to make competitive – money true conservatives don’t have – we find a different story.

A total of 20 incumbent Republicans – 11 running for the Senate and nine running for the House – were defeated or poised to lose as of Tuesday night. A big part of these results is thanks to the work of the Idaho Freedom PAC, which actively recruited candidates against incumbents.

It’s truly hard to overstate the significance of this development. Thirteen of the 28 Republican senators didn’t stand for re-election. Out of the 15 remaining, nine were defeated, and several RINO House members seeking a Senate seat lost to conservatives. There is almost no parallel to that in recent history. While some of the races involved other quirks or were due to redistricting, and a few others were conservatives who were defeated by more ideologically ambiguous candidates, for the most part, conservatives downed many liberal Republicans and made gains in open seats.

Among the highlights were conservative Rep. Codi Galloway beating Sen. Fred Martin, the five-term Senate Health and Welfare Committee chair from Boise. Sen. Jim Patrick, who served five terms in the Senate and three in the House, was defeated by a conservative as well. He was chairman of the Senate Commerce & Human Resources Committee. Also, Rep. Greg Chaney, the outgoing chair of Judiciary, Rules & Administration in the House, lost his bid for a Senate seat, and Sen. Carl Crabtree, vice chair of the Joint Finance and Appropriations Committee, lost his seat.

Additionally, two conservatives who moved from California to seek freedom in the Gem State defeated prominent incumbents. Retired California firefighter Carl Bjerke took out Senate Health and Welfare Committee vice chair Sen. Peter Riggs. Joint Finance and Appropriations Committee co-chair Sen. Jeff Agenbroad was defeated by Brian Lenney, who moved his family from California to Nampa in 2010.

Even in a number of instances where the incumbent survived, the challengers came much closer than we usually see in statewide elections. Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Winder only won his race by about 640 votes. Now he will face a brand-new caucus that can possibly vote him out of leadership. Conservatives would have enjoyed an even better night if not for the fact that leadership drew several of them into the same district and forced them to compete with each other. This dynamic made the House results more of a wash, but the House was already fairly conservative. So, the fact that the Senate has caught up to it will give the legislature a lot of clout over Gov. Brad Little.

What this success at the legislative level demonstrates is that for lower offices, where the bar to entry is much lower in terms of financial needs, conservatives are on a much more level playing field.

Even in the statewide elections, there are signs that in the future, conservatives can sweep the state. Former Congressman Raul Labrador defeated a 22-year incumbent for attorney general. Conservatives also came within a hair of winning the office of secretary of state and only lost because of vote-splitting. Even for governor, Brad Little only secured 53% of the total vote. Had there been a runoff option, the race might have picked up more momentum and could have become contested. With less vote-splitting and slightly stronger candidates, conservatives can truly take over the state next time.

In other states, mainly in the South, where there are runoffs, conservatives have a stronger chance to compete statewide. Next week, conservatives have an opportunity to draw Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey into a runoff. One recent poll showed Ivey only garnering 40% of the vote, with socially conservative businessman Tim James in second place for a potential runoff. Vote-splitting has plagued conservatives for decades, and the institution of runoffs in more states would allow them to compete against the establishment without fear of dividing the vote of thinking voters.

The Idaho media cheer for liberal Republicans because they don’t really have Democrat horses to ride, but even they recognize the significance of the Idaho Freedom PAC’s work in changing the state’s politics. A bigger focus on state legislatures will pay great dividends in the future, and other states can mimic the work of the Idaho Freedom PAC.

Indeed, the trend of RINO chairmen losing their seats played out in other states on Tuesday night. Three RINO Kentucky House chairs lost their seats in northern Kentucky. Eight-term incumbent Adam Koenig, chairman of the House Licensing and Occupations Committee, was defeated by Steven Doan, a liberty candidate supported by Congressman Thomas Massie and state Rep. Savannah Maddox, a rising conservative star who might run for governor next year. Rep. Ed Massey, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee from Hebron, and Rep. Sal Santoro, an eight-term incumbent and chairman of the Transportation Budget Committee, were also defeated.

In Pennsylvania, Rep. Stan Saylor of York County and Sen. Pat Browne of Lehigh County, both the House and Senate appropriations committee chairs respectively, were defeated by conservative challengers. Saylor had been in the House for 30 years. Republicans already have strong majorities in both houses, and if they can pick up the governorship with Doug Mastriano, a more conservative legislature can dramatically alter the political trajectory of the state.

So, what gives when it comes to 63% of the Pennsylvania Republicans voting for Mehmet Oz or Dave McCormick over the conservative favorite, Kathy Barnette? Very simple. They each raised close to $16 million and ran as solid conservatives, so the other challengers, including Kathy Barnette, were outgunned. On the other hand, Doug Mastriano, likely the most conservative in the gubernatorial field, won his primary in a landslide. In that case, there was no unified establishment candidate with endless sums of money to fool the voters.



Overall, conservatives would be wise to focus more on state and local races rather than federal races. Making red states red again and state legislatures great again will go a long way in divorcing ourselves from the morass of Washington. The RINOs can have the irremediably broken federal system, while we focus on rebuilding liberty in some of the states.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-how-many-lives-could-have-been-saved-by-aggressive-use-of-vitamin-d-alone,2022-05-19
Horowitz: It’s past time to replace McConnell and McCarthy as leaders,"



It’s deja vu all over again. I have more gray hair and a few more kids, but it’s like nothing has changed since the last big GOP win 12 years ago. My wife made this political cartoon for a column of mine during the “Tea Party wave” election of 2010 to accentuate the point that there is no purpose in winning an election to empower leaders who believe in handing the ball of power to the defeated team on every issue that matters. Here we are 12 years later, and McConnell is still at the helm of the party, even as he stands against conservatives on every issue that matters.

Likewise, Kevin McCarthy was the House GOP whip at the time of the Tea Party, and he has overseen the failed GOP bouts in the majority ever since as both majority leader and whip. Now he wants a promotion after failing to deliver on a “first and goal” play this election. Will conservatives ever learn to clean up their own yard before focusing solely on the Democrats?

While many are relieved election season is over, there is another election right around the corner that will determine whether the GOP’s win of House control (and potentially the Senate) will mean anything in the real world. The Senate and House GOP conferences, the roster of representatives and senators serving next year, will determine who will serve as their leaders. The question is very simple: Do they want the leader who agrees with the morass we find ourselves in or someone who is at least promising to capitalize on the flip in Congress to challenge Biden and promote a very different agenda for the country?

Mitch McConnell is a man who believes that funding the corrupt WEF-backed Ukrainian government is the most important policy issue of our time. He paved the way for the greatest legislative victory of the Biden administration and has agreed to pass an omnibus bill in the lame-duck session, which will undercut the leverage of a new GOP House majority for an entire year. He even voted to give the FBI billions of dollars to “red flag” political opponents in the first gun control bill to pass in years. To top it off, he spent millions of dollars defending Lisa Murkowski against her conservative opponent in Alaska after she voted against Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.

Both McConnell and McCarthy refused to whip against the bill forcing states to elevate homosexual relations as a fundamental right to redefine marriage, and McConnell’s allies plan to pass it in the lame-duck session.

As for McCarthy, while he is trying to reinvent himself, he is the man who oversaw the lamest GOP agenda of all time during the 2017-2018 era, when Republicans enjoyed trifecta control. If Republicans wind up winning both chambers in the end, they will still claim their leverage is limited without the White House. But McCarthy was in power when they had all three branches, and he oversaw a dynamic in which almost every budget bill was passed out of his chamber with minority Republican/majority Democrat support – all with his blessing.

McCarthy was part of the original “young gun” movement within the GOP, along with Eric Cantor and Paul Ryan, whose brand of Republicanism has long since been repudiated. Why is McCarthy somehow the survivor from the old guard to lead us in a new era that requires new thinking to confront a new globalist/corporatist agenda that his donors are largely on board with? McCarthy has been fundraising against conservative candidates in the primaries even in deep red districts for years. Finally, leading into this election, he put out an uninspiring, weak agenda that failed to even recognize that our basic freedoms have been assaulted by the biomedical security state, an omission from the campaign that allowed the leftists to co-opt the issue of saving “democracy” during a time when their party (with the help of McCarthy’s GOP) put us into a state of martial law.

Isn’t it time to nominate party leaders who know what time it is rather than those who fight the members who are speaking to the issues of the time?

Despite the lethargic GOP showing for such an auspicious environment, Republicans will still fully control the House and may possibly still control the Senate. The economy will only get worse, and the policies of the Biden administration will remain unpopular and will get even worse. Biden promised on Wednesday, “I’m not gonna change anything in any fundamental way.” Which means conservatives still have a prime opportunity to check his power through the right hearings, must-pass legislation, and the budget process. The margins might be smaller than hoped, but that shouldn’t fundamentally matter if we have an effective leader.

In fact, the smaller margins will allow the few brave conservatives to announce they will not vote for Kevin McCarthy on the House floor during the January 3 speaker’s election. Although the GOP conference will meet next week to privately vote on the party’s nominee for speaker, along with majority leader, whip, and other positions, the position of speaker requires a second vote from the entire House body. A speaker is only elected if he garners a majority of those present and voting in the chamber.



So if Republicans have an eight-seat majority, for example, nine Republicans voting for someone else could deny McCarthy the speakership. There is no risk of Pelosi or another Democrat winning, because a plurality is not enough. This would trigger a deadlock and force negotiations, which can begin today if McCarthy realizes there are enough votes to deny him the office.

The most influential form of activism at this point would be for conservatives to call their respective representatives-elect and demand that they support a new leader and publicly declare their opposition to McCarthy. Likewise, all GOP senators should be encouraged to vote for someone other than McConnell for Senate majority leader. Although that vote is private and only among the GOP members, there is no reason why senators should not be forced to go on the record to declare their support or opposition to McConnell.

We need leaders who know what time it is, but we also need our voters to understand we are living in a new era of activism, when merely coming out to vote is not enough. We need follow through every day in these two years.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-idaho-legislature-conservatives,2022-11-11
Horowitz: It’s time to strip down the FBI to bare bones,"Our Founders feared the presence of a standing army in our streets, but they never envisioned that one day we’d have an even more powerful force than an army deployed domestically. Rather than calling it a military, we simply call it the FBI. But make no mistake, the bureau has more authority, firepower, resources, and surveillance than any military James Madison could have envisioned. Such amassed power would be frightening enough in the hands of good people, but now that we know the FBI is full of neo-Marxists directing operations against patriot Americans, how is dismantling of the FBI not the biggest priority of Republicans?



“The FBI has been collapsed into nothing more than a police agency for the Democratic Party,” said Terry Turchie, the retired former head of counterterrorism and front-line agent of almost 30 years, in an exclusive interview with the New York Post. “Many of us feel that over the decades [we have seen] the complete compromise of the bureau.” He was one of 30 retired agents who came to the defense of whistleblower Stephen Friend, who is accusing the FBI of essentially becoming the enforcement arm of the Democrat Party.

That would be dangerous for even a non-weaponized agency of the government, but for the FBI, which is armed to the teeth with tactics, technology, manpower, and weapons, it is an existential threat to our liberties the likes of which we’ve never faced before.

Nowhere is this more evident that in the early-morning raid of the home of anti-abortion activist Mark Houck. A father of seven, Houck stands outside a Philly Planned Parenthood counseling those seeking abortions. According to his wife, one day in October 2021, a radical pro-abortion activist got into Mark’s personal space and shouted obscenities at his 12-year-old son. Mark pushed the man back. That is all. The “victim” tried to sue him, but all civil and criminal charges were thrown out. Local law enforcement never saw a need to intervene. Fast-forward almost a year later, and 25-30 FBI agents armed to the teeth raid Mark’s home and kidnap him out of nowhere. He is being charged with breaking the ""Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances,"" which makes it a federal crime to ""injure, intimidate, and interfere with anyone because that person is a provider of reproductive health care."" Houck faces up to 11 years in federal prison if convicted.

Contrast this to the claim by Rev. James Harden that after his pro-life pregnancy center was firebombed, the FBI refused to get involved. There have been over 70 such attacks, yet not a single arrest has been made or an investigation even commenced. Just as with nearly every major terrorist attack or school shooting where the attacker was known to the FBI, they never seem to be there for us when we need them. Oh, and five years later, we still have no report from the FBI on the motive behind the largest mass shooting, which took place in Las Vegas. They are only there to serve as the enforcement tool of Democrat dogma, as the KKK did for southern Democrats during the fight for civil rights.

This is what has been going on for months now with anyone who was within eyeshot of the Capitol and, as the FBI whistleblowing agent is alleging, even those who never went to the Capitol. Between this and the Whitmer kidnapping plot, it is becoming clear that the FBI has been given a green light to go out and commit crimes in order to frame conservatives and persecute them simply for opposing the regime. Yet even after Trump himself was targeted, there is no plan from Republican governors to block FBI tyranny within their states or from federal Republicans to defund, dismantle, or narrow the purview of this rogue agency acting more like a terrorist organization.

This is a red alert moment. We cannot move on as a free people with the most powerful law enforcement agency in the world being turned loose on political opponents – literally the nightmare scenario of our Founders. In opposing a standing army at the Constitutional Convention, James Madison warned, “A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty.” He argued, based on examples from Europe, that “the means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home.”

That was the concern about an army that was mainly directed at external enemies. Could Madison even have imagined an agency with more technology and weaponry directed at domestic affairs and now proven to singularly focus on political opponents?

Establishment Republicans have accused those of us who want to dismantle the FBI as being like leftists who seek to abolish ICE. However, ICE is the antithesis of the FBI. It has a very narrow scope that only enforces one law – the one dealing with national sovereignty and intersecting with foreign nationals who don’t have an affirmative right to be here. The FBI, on the other hand, can commandeer any case from any state or local law enforcement agency, can investigate any crime or non-crime, has endless resources, and has now proven to be irretrievably politically motivated.

The FBI is also notorious for breaking the law – supposedly under the guise of enforcing it. According to documents obtained by USA Today in 2013, the FBI gave its informants permission to break the law at least 5,658 times in a single year. “Agents authorized 15 crimes a day, on average, including everything from buying and selling illegal drugs to bribing government officials and plotting robberies.”

The FBI has virtually unlimited resources. Its appropriations have increased 93%, in inflation-adjusted terms, from 2001 to 2017. The White House is asking nearly $11 billion in appropriations for FY 2023, more than a quarter of the entire Justice Department’s budget. The FBI is staffed with 35,000 people and boasts 56 domestic field offices, 350 resident agencies located in smaller cities, and 50 international offices. The bureau’s spying and hacking capabilities are second to none. After everything we know about the FBI’s behavior, how is it not a greater threat to liberty than any external enemy?

The GOP part of Congress already gave up its leverage over the budget of the FBI until next fiscal year, thanks to Mitch McConnell’s budget betrayal. The congressional hearings they are promising will be meaningless without a promise to slim down the FBI’s budget to bare bones. The FBI will evade every question by asserting the subject is part of an ongoing investigation. The only solution is to cut the FBI’s function to the bare minimum purview of issues that cannot be dealt with by the states or other federal law enforcement, of which there are few categories of crimes that fit the bill.



Moreover, it’s time for Republican governors to fight back against the FBI. The creation of state guards as a deterrent against federal overreach would be a perfect tool. As Eldridge Gerry said during the congressional debate over the Bill of Rights, “What, sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. …Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins.”

It's time to strip the FBI of its monopoly over law, power, morality, trust, and resources.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-its-past-time-to-replace-mcconnell-and-mccarthy-as-leaders,2022-10-03
Horowitz: Martha’s Vineyard affair shows how easily states could fight the border invasion,"We’ve been told for decades that America is different from every other country in human history in that it has no right to jurisdictional sovereignty. Anyone can trespass the country, unilaterally assert domicile in a given locality against the will of the people and its governing authority, and force the people to pay for their medical bills, K-12 education (Plyler v. Doe), make their children citizens, and be counted in the census – and there’s not a darn thing you can do about it. That was until Martha’s Vineyard.



Conservatives often observe the appalling hypocrisy of the left-wing virtue-signalers who publicly advocate for illegal immigration but then refuse to live with the consequences. But rather than just scoring a political talking point, conservatives would be wise to secure political outcomes based on the Martha’s Vineyard affair. If the residents of the opulent island were able to marshal the National Guard to remove 50 illegal aliens within a day, why shouldn’t the red states follow suit immediately?

What we’ve learned from the virtue-signaling at Martha’s Vineyard is that indeed, illegal aliens simply landing on their island doesn’t make them entitled to endless use of the community’s services. Residents, while claiming to have compassion and posting photo ops offering them food and shelter, made it clear that they lack the resources to house them — and therefore it is the compassionate thing, from anyone’s vantage point, to move them somewhere else. Why then should other poorer parts of the country be saddled with a burden on their schools and hospitals that is incalculable?

Consider the plight of Arizona, for a moment. As many as 11% of all school children have at least one parent who is in the country illegally. According to a 2012 study by the Federation for Immigration Reform, “The total education, medical, and incarceration costs in Arizona due to illegal immigration are $2.6 billion a year.” And that is for an entire state. You can imagine that the costs are even more acute in some local cities and towns, many of which are quite poor, such as Yuma. Some estimate that the lifetime cost of just the illegal aliens who have come under Biden so far is upwards of $100 billion. And those numbers are growing every day.

Martha’s Vineyard currently has 165 children in the local public school. Applying the same ratio as Arizona, they could easily afford these families because they likely don’t yet have 18 children among the group of 50 (11% of their native enrollment). If even that is too absurd for them, why should Texas, Arizona, and every other state cater to the invasion instead?

Thus, rather than merely observing the double standard of the left, isn’t it time for red states to begin promoting their own self-survival? Federal courts have forced these states to educate the world’s children, but Martha’s Vineyard wouldn’t be caught dead enrolling them in their schools. And they most certainly wouldn’t put up with the crime.

In 2018, John Lott conducted an analysis of Arizona’s incarcerated population and found that illegal immigrants in Arizona are at least 142% more likely to be convicted of crime than other Arizonans. He also found that they are 45.4% more likely to have been gang members, and “they are 133% more likely to receive sentencing enhancements for being classified as dangerous, and they tend to be released from prison at a younger age despite more serious crimes because they initially go to jail at a younger age.”

The point being that if Martha’s Vineyard could request removal of illegal aliens with no record of their island being overrun with gangs, drugs, and the rampant fiscal cost, then most certainly, those areas suffering its effects for two generations should have the right to use their respective national guards to remove illegal aliens. Ironically, Martha’s Vineyard residents were acting upon their own heritage. In 1700, Massachusetts passed a law denying admission to those deemed a public charge or who forced shipmasters to guarantee their economic security. They forced the ships to transport the inadmissible aliens at their own cost.









Red states have the ability to end this charade tomorrow. They can declare an invasion and invoke Art. I Sec. 10 to repel the invasion by coordinating their respective national guards to remove all large groups of illegal aliens the feds send into their states and return them to Mexico. If Martha’s Vineyard can’t afford them, most others can’t either. The federal government has violated its commitment to the states and the states have the right to step in and end this invasion. The amount of illegal immigration, pursuant to law, that states should tolerate is zero. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 requires the DHS to achieve full operational control over the border, defined as “the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.”

So why haven’t the states stepped up to the plate? Sadly, most Republicans still support the cheap labor-driven open borders agenda. Sure, now, more than ever, they will use the chaos at the border as a cudgel against Biden headed into an election, but do they really want to shut off the flow of illegal aliens? Idaho Republicans Mike Crapo and Mike Simpson are strongly pushing legislation to grant amnesty and a path to citizenship for illegal aliens working in agriculture so they can further drive down wages and bring some of the problems associated with big cities to America’s rural areas.

HR 1603 has 13 Republican House co-sponsors. The bill grants amnesty to every illegal alien in this country who claims to have worked at least part-time for agriculture and creates an unlimited agriculture guest worker program for the future to bring in millions of low-skilled workers. The cultural and fiscal costs are never factored in. It permanently tethers green cards for people coming in on these H-2 visas to the condition of working in agriculture for 10 years, creating an indentured servant model that will prevent farms from ever modernizing and mechanizing their processes because of the boundless flow of cheap labor.

“This is not amnesty,” said Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, using the age-old trick to redefine amnesty. “This is earned citizenship, earned legality in the country, to be able to provide the jobs and do the jobs that are necessary.” The comments were made at the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives in Washington where the American Business Immigration Coalition promised to spend $8 million promoting the amnesty bill.

This, despite the flood of illegals at an unimaginable level.

Just know it doesn’t have to be this way. States can take charge of their own destinies. The problem is that Ron DeSantis is the only GOP governor espousing the view that immigration should be driven by a cost-benefit analysis to the whole of the people, not just to special interests. Most Republicans, as much as they don’t like the chaos at the border, continue to espouse a belief in the corporate cartel’s monopoly on our country in their desire to bring in boundless cheap labor.

“But corporatism is not the same as free enterprise. Too many Republicans have viewed limited government to basically mean whatever is best for corporate America is how we want to do the economy. And my view is, obviously free enterprise is the best economic system,” said DeSantis at a recent National Conservatism Conference.

Focusing on policy both for illegal and legal immigration, DeSantis framed his thought process as follows: “So the issue is, how does immigration serve the people of the United States and the national interest?” he said, adding, “We’re not globalists who believe that foreigners have a right to come into our country whenever they want to.”

At least as it relates to limousine liberals, when they are mugged by reality they will come to their senses. Not so for the globalist “business community” which Republicans slavishly serve. No amount of border chaos will ever move them from their dogmatic support for endless cheap labor.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-its-time-to-strip-down-the-fbi-to-bare-bones,2022-09-20
Horowitz: McCarthy passed budget bills with Dem support during Trump years,"If you don’t support Kevin McCarthy for speaker, you are somehow helping the Democrats because of a phantom concern that for the first time ever, RINOs will get together and elect a Democrat speaker. This is the propaganda being disseminated by McCarthy and his allies in the broken Conservative Inc. media. Aside from the fact that this concern is completely unfounded, they are forgetting the irony that McCarthy himself, on the most important pieces of legislation – budgets and debt ceiling – worked with Democrats as floor leader to squander the golden years of Trump’s presidency with budget bills that Democrats often supported unanimously.



It’s getting old. Republicans work with Democrats on every policy that matters, especially at the time the ball is actually in play, yet every time we seek to do surgery – either through elections, policy fights, or leadership battles – we are told that if we don’t help the Republicans, who work with Democrats … we are helping the Democrats!

There seems to be an epidemic of political amnesia afflicting some in the legacy Conservative Inc. circles, allowing them to propagate a message that McCarthy, unlike McConnell, is somehow a new kid on the block intrepidly representing the interests of conservatives in 2022. In reality, he is a rusted-out fossil from the Boehner-Cantor-Ryan gang that perfidiously betrayed us on every issue, leverage point, and strategy that could have precluded the terrible morass we find ourselves in today. While McCarthy was never speaker, he was the majority leader from 2014 (and whip since 2010), including those critical years – 2017-2018 – when Republicans held all three branches.

The advantage to my long-standing column is that I have now fought every single budget battle since 2010 and have a column from that time period to show the receipts. Hence, I’m grounded in reality and not afflicted by the same political amnesia that others are.

Here’s that reality. Every single major budget bill that passed under McCarthy’s leadership as floor leader of the last GOP House, which was when the GOP controlled the trifecta and commanded full stewardship over the policies, was passed with more Democrat support than Republican support . It was simply unprecedented in modern history. Imagine the Biden-Schumer-Pelosi Congress passing budget bills nearly unanimously pleasing to Republicans but detested by their core base. Never going to happen, because they don’t have Kevin McCarthy equivalents.

The entire sole leverage point and entire purpose of the GOP controlling the House now is to use the must-pass budget bills to fight the most destructive and unpopular policies of the administration. McCarthy not only failed on every single budget bill as floor leader during the era of trifecta control, but he literally passed bills that were so palatable to the Left that nearly every radical Democrat support them, while any semi-conservative Republican opposed them. How can anyone suggest with a straight face that he McCarthy will somehow fight for us now? What about him shows that he is a changed man, and how are conservatives who raise these valid concerns somehow helping Democrats?



If you want to discuss helping Democrats, here is a synopsis of McCarthy’s budget record as majority leader during the Trump golden years.

Thus, who is the one who works with Democrats to pass the most critical bills? McCarthy was part of the leadership team that turned Trump’s critical years into the most Democrat-friendly bipartisan lovefest of any majority-control era ever.

McCarthy’s cheerleaders are trying to make the case that somehow he is a changed man and that somehow because of his oleaginous charm offensive with gullible conservative influencers, he is vastly better than McConnell. However, on the issues that matter, in the way they matter, and at the time they matter, he has not demonstrated even a little bit of a foxhole conversion. He refused to whip against the gay marriage bill in the House and to this day declines to publicly call on McConnell to oppose the omnibus bill in the Senate and give him control over the remainder of the FY 2023 budget process – literally a replica of what he did last time he was in the majority. Politico aptly describes his position as “hope yes, vote no.”

Furthermore, he has failed to even entertain any of the rules changes proposed by the Freedom Caucus, including the “majority of the majority” rule, which would prevent him from passing budgets with Democrat support. Most of these rules are not extreme right-wing demands, but basic ideas to decentralize power that would help augment the voices of Democrats and moderates as well.

Yet Donald Trump Jr. and the establishment are out pimping for McCarthy by accusing the Freedom Caucus members of somehow helping the Democrats by demanding a change in leadership from the man who turned Trump’s presidency into a Democrat lovefest:

The reality is that thanks to Don Jr.’s dad, McConnell, Ryan, and yes, Kevin McCarthy, Schumer bragged about winning every budget battle during Trump’s presidency. The only good outcomes under his presidency were the result of executive actions. The legislative front was a disaster, and McCarthy was in the thick of it.

At some point, Republicans need to earn our votes, not demand them through scaremongering about the Democrats when they are the ones who agree with the Democrats on every issue that matters at the time it actually matters. “But the Democrats” has gotten old, given that echoing every important talking point of the left when the ball is actually in play is the GOP’s favorite pastime.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-marthas-vineyard-affair-shows-how-easy-states-could-fight-the-border-invasion,2022-12-05
Horowitz: McConnell’s ‘wartime’ COVID investments come home to roost,"“Bidenflation” existed before he staggered into office on January 20, 2021. It was catalyzed when nearly every Republican supported the worst piece of legislation in American history on March 25, 2020, which set off a cascade of several other pieces of legislation underwriting, incentivizing, and consummating COVID lockdowns. The chief cheerleader of the bill at the time was none other than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the man whom Republicans are pining to see become floor leader once again next year to solve the inflation crisis. But in order to solve it, don’t we need to first acknowledge the cause and who was responsible?



Last week, Sen. Mitch McConnell tossed out the same tired bromide about Biden causing inflation with his $1.9 trillion reckless spending “on party line” last year.

What he forgets to tell you is that the bulk of the unfathomable levels of spending came from the worst legislation in American history: the $2.2 trillion COVID lockdown/Big Pharma bill that he ardently pushed for in March 2020, which at the time, represented half of the entire federal budget! That bill led to a cascading effect of unconscionable spending and tyranny that, between Congress and the Federal Reserve, unleashed more than $10 trillion on the economy.

At the time, McConnell praised it as “a wartime level of investment into our nation.” “The men and women of the greatest country on Earth are going to defeat this coronavirus and reclaim our future,"" said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when announcing the deal that morning. ""The Senate's going to make sure that they have the ammunition they need to do it.""

Except, it wasn’t a wartime investment in production, it was an investment in lockdown, paying people not to work, imposing tyranny, and inducing a vicious cycle of Big Pharma failure that perpetuated both the pandemic and the economic misery. Milton Friedman famously described inflation as the result of ""too much money chasing too few goods.” Never was there a time in history when Congress voted to spend so much money to simultaneously shut down production and make goods scarce while lining the pockets of individuals and corporations with endless cash. As the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank conceded in March when groping in the dark for the culprit of the history inflation, “In seeking an explanation, we turn to the combination of direct fiscal support introduced to counteract the economic devastation caused by the pandemic.""

Because of the terrible COVID policies Republicans still refuse to acknowledge, the federal reserve went on such a bond buying spree that it literally increased the money supply by 40% and did this all while the same policies were shrinking output.

Hence, a lot of money suddenly chasing diminishing quantities of products.

What’s worse, these same Republicans then immediately jumped on the bandwagon of the “next current thing” by criticizing Biden for not giving enough money to Ukraine. It wasn’t just the over $50 billion we sent there without an understanding of the outcome we hoped to achieve, but it perpetuated a war and sanctions that are crushing supply chains, which further exacerbates the inflation. McConnell famously said in May that “the most important thing going on in the world right now is the war in Ukraine.”

Hence, McConnell carping about inflation now is akin to the arsonist lamenting the heat of the fire and dressing up as the firefighter. Obviously, Biden has done things on the regulatory side and through exacerbating the war on fossil fuels that aggravated this crisis, particularly as it relates to energy. But the foundation for this crisis was set in stone with the bills shepherded by McConnell when he was in the majority. And that date was not January 2021, but March 2020, when Republicans controlled two of the three branches.









Since March 2020, the gross debt has increased by over $7 trillion. It took from George Washington’s day to the first half of 2004 to accrue our first $7 trillion in debt. What is particularly jarring is that $6.5 trillion of that increase is composed of the “public debt,” not the “intragovernmental debt,” which we supposedly owe ourselves (most prominently the Social Security Trust Fund).

Which brings us back to the GOP senators and congressmen. Which programs would they cut or devolve to the state? What exactly would they do to combat the inflation and what systemic governmental reforms will they push that would address the enormity of the crisis? Combatting “waste, fraud, and abuse” or eliminating “pork” won’t cut it.

At least in 2010 during the Tea Party era, they claimed to oppose spending and then betrayed their promise. Today, they are not even acknowledging the issue of our time that caused the inflation. As such, how are we to believe anything would change on the other side of an auspicious election result?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-mccarthy-passed-budget-bills-with-dem-support-during-trump-years,2022-07-19
Horowitz: Most open borders POTUS has worse approval among Hispanics than whites,"It was the blood-letting ritual equivalent of electoral politics. After each election, every GOP consultant for two generations lectured in hushed tones about the need to support some form of amnesty for illegal aliens in order to attract the Hispanic vote. We are suffering from an invasion to this day because of this maniacally false read of the American electorate, which induced Republicans to refrain from shutting down illegal immigration when they were in power. Well, Biden’s presidency has laid waste to this entire narrative which Republicans stupidly adhered to forever.



Following the GOP loss of the presidential election in 2012, the RNC wrote a 100-page ""autopsy"" report attempting to reconstruct the cause of the party's loss in that year's election cycle. Among the many pearls of wisdom was an immortal warning that ""we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,"" which is swamp-speak for amnesty, otherwise ""our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.""

Dick Armey, the GOP House majority leader in the 1990s, was quoted in the autopsy as saying, ""You can't call someone ugly and expect them to go to the prom with you.""

Well, following that line of thinking, that open borders are the love language of Hispanic voters, Joe Biden’s Democrat Party has been telling them they are the most beautiful people of all time, begging them out to the prom. The response from Hispanic voters? Open borders can’t buy you love.

The latest Quinnipiac poll shows Biden has a dangerously negative 33% - 55% job approval rating among Americans. But that’s not the headline number we should focus on. The man who opened the doors to millions of illegal aliens from Latin America and essentially suspended ICE’s operations has garnered just 24% approval among Hispanics, lower than the 32% approval he commands among whites!

This is simply an unprecedented and astounding political transformation for any Democrat to have less support among Hispanics than among whites, especially when his approval is quite dismal among whites as well. Only 11% of Hispanics “strongly” approve of Biden, again, an astounding finding, given that we were told open borders are the key to their hearts. Even more stunning is the fact that when asked which party they would vote for in the midterm elections, slightly more Hispanics chose the Republican Party!

Even the open border GOP consultants of yesteryear only contended that supporting open borders was merely a way to minimize the losses among Hispanics. Yet with Republicans speaking out stronger than ever against illegal immigration and Democrats inviting them more than ever, these voters are practically moving over to the Republican Party.

Take Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, who has been consistently stronger on the issue than Trump. He has constantly called for blocking illegal aliens from the state and punishing those who employ them. Yet even as a Republican governor, polls have shown him above water with Hispanic voters.

One Washington Post columnist warned after Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, ""Donald Trump's 'Mexican rapists' rhetoric will keep the Republican Party out of the White House."" Well, it looks like it is open borders Biden who will keep Democrats out of the White House, particularly as it relates to the Hispanic vote.

Thus, any honest autopsy of GOP failures would note that not only is the open borders agenda a disaster for our country, the ""Hispandering"" of that agenda simply does not elicit love among Hispanic voters. Pandering never works. Voters of all backgrounds want strong leadership on the fundamental issues that affect their lives, not symbolic checkboxes that white liberals artificially draft for them.









More broadly, we see how unpopular Joe Biden and the Democrats are as they are starring down the barrel of historic losses during the midterms. As such, why can’t we actually enjoy a party that boldly and aggressively counters them on every policy?

For years, Republicans allowed themselves to be lied to about the politics of immigration. In recent years, they were convinced that being soft on crime would endear them to black voters. They have been brainwashed into abandoning the fight against licentious sexual values. They refuse to take a bold stance on COVID fascism for fear of appearing to be “anti-vax.” They refuse to fight back against the Jan. 6 political persecution because they don’t want to be labeled “insurrectionists.”

In other words, Republicans are consistently being run over by a parked car. They fear a scarecrow. Voters are clamoring for a strong alternative on every hot button issue, but it is precisely those issues Republicans avoid at all costs or which they downright cater to Democrat premises and policies.

For example, Republicans should embrace a budget battle precisely before the election with this deeply unpopular president. They should craft their own budget bill, cutting funding for all vaccines, banning mask and shot mandates (especially in the military), defunding the Jan. 6 persecutions, thwarting Biden’s restrictions on energy exploration and production, and blocking any resettling or dumping of illegal aliens into the interior of the country. Then they should refuse to supply the votes in the Senate for cloture in order to pass the Democrat budget unless some of those items are included. Now is precisely the time to pick a fight, these are the issues that matter, and this is the president with which to engage such a battle.

If they fail to fight for us now, they sure won’t do so after the election. Biden will still be president and Mitch McConnell will fear a government shutdown even more, so will eschew any brinkmanship over budgets or “must-pass” legislation. We’ll be dead by the term of the next president in 2025, and even then, we still won’t have a trifecta governance with 60 votes in the Senate.

How much longer will we allow Republicans to turn winning issues of the upmost importance into losing battles?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-mcconnells-wartime-covid-investments-come-home-to-roost,2022-06-10
Horowitz: NH Senate passes bill that could empower hospitals to arrest family members who argue with doctors,"One of the most appalling humanitarian emergencies in the country today is the state of care in American hospitals. We have witnessed a shocking disregard for patient care, ignoring of science and basic medical norms, forcible use of toxic drugs like remdesivir, denying family members visitation, and discriminating against people based on medical choices, including denying organs to those who don’t get the shots. Yet rather than redressing the inhumane treatment in the hospitals with a new patient bill of rights, a New Hampshire bill now seeks to criminalize those who dissent and debate doctors when they believe the hospital is mistreating their loved one.

File this under Republicans who don’t know what time it is. On March 31, the New Hampshire Senate passed SB 459, a bill that lowers the threshold needed to arrest someone at a health care facility without a warrant. Dubbed the “Workplace Violence Prevention Program,” this bill defines workplace violence as “any act or threat of physical violence, harassment, intimidation, or other threatening behavior that occurs at a health facility, including verbal abuse , without regard to whether the victim sustains an injury, psychological trauma, or stress.”

What happens to such a person? Section 4 allows arrests without warrant if there is probable cause to believe that the person, among other things, will cause problems or “through actual or threatened violence, interfere in the provision of medically necessary health care services.”

In any other era, I wouldn’t think twice about this bill. After all, none of us believe in violence and certainly not directed toward doctors. But where is this bill coming from, and where is it headed, and in what context? I have been inundated with people in distress after doctors refused to talk to them, threw people on ventilators against scientific rationale, blocked medical records, forcibly confiscated prescriptions and vitamins, and often engaged in medical kidnapping by refusing to release the patient upon his request. In other cases, they have called child protective services if they feel the parent is not going along with their novel treatment ideas for a minor patient.

One such case was from a Michigan woman whose daughter was being denied a kidney transplant for not getting the shot. She joined me on my podcast and divulged that a doctor at Spectrum Health/Helen Devos Children’s Hospital in Grand Rapids filed a form 3200 medical neglect report with Michigan Child Protective Services.

What this all means is that family members are now under a tremendous amount of stress, often dealing with hospitals that will take someone who is nominally sick and then tell them they are on their deathbed a day later. Obviously, patient families will be distraught and have a lot of questions for the doctors. Nobody condones violence, but clearly most of these people have not threatened to engage in violence. Under this bill, medical personnel could easily say they feel “harassed,” “intimidated,” or are a recipient of “verbal abuse.” They can certainly say the spouse is “interfere[ing] in the provision of medically necessary health care services.”

Why would they pass such a bill now if they have nothing to hide and there is no systemic problem with treatment, protocols, and transparency in hospitals today? Just last week, a hospital in Pennsylvania threatened to call security on my cousin for advocating on behalf of his mother, who was being mistreated. No sane person would have perceived a threat of physical violence from him when he was challenging them and asking for medical records.

The medical media is decrying a trend of violence against medical personnel. Republican-controlled legislatures in Wisconsin and Utah even passed bills making violence against medical officials a felony, although those bills didn’t lower the threshold for arrest like the New Hampshire bill does. Let’s just concede for argument’s sake that they are telling the truth and, along with more acrimonious conversations with doctors and nurses, there have been instances of violence. Why isn’t anyone wondering why there is such an increase recently?

This trend runs parallel with the evidence that there is more violence against flight attendants over the past two years. While anyone who actually engages in violence should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, isn’t it obvious that this is one of the many consequences of treating people inhumanely both in hospitals and on airplanes? So rather than further clamp down on people, why don’t we address the root cause of the desperate behavior from people being mistreated?



At a time when we need to strengthen patients’ rights and investigate the behavior of these hospitals, Republican legislators are ignoring the cries of thousands and kowtowing to the hospital lobby juggernaut, possibly the most influential special interest in every state legislature.

The trend of weaponizing health care and medical workers to criminalize dissent, human rights, bodily autonomy, and the right to choose in treatment should disturb everyone. The fact that they want to silence this debate by calling the police is most revealing of all.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-most-open-borders-potus-has-worse-approval-among-hispanics-than-whites,2022-04-13
Horowitz: Oklahoma Gov. Stitt touts Agenda 2030 green energy as ‘where investments are headed’,"If Democrats are akin to voracious wolves seeking to turn the American sheep into a carcass, the Republicans are the vultures seeking to cash in by feasting on that carcass rather than calling in the lions to battle the wolves and protect the American sheep. Nowhere is this more evident than with Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signing on to the green energy “Agenda 2030” plan to replace cars with electric vehicles in supposedly conservative Oklahoma. Except, unlike most other Republicans, he should get points for honesty, providing us with a full understanding of why Republicans will never fight for us on an issue that matters. The reason? The money and “investments” are always on the side of tyranny.

It should now be abundantly obvious to any thinking person that the weather tyranny and green energy agenda aren’t just cute or even annoying; they will quite literally kill millions of people with starvation and lack of access to vital goods and services. They are coming for our food and fuel the same way they came for ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine during the pandemic. Thus, any promotion of green energy, with its officious regime of government mandates and subsidies, will necessarily ease the death of energy that actually works. So we are all on the same page as conservatives that green energy must be shunned, right?

Wrong! When Jennifer Granholm, Biden’s energy secretary, said recently that “California is in the lead” on energy and “can show the rest of the nation how it is done,” she could have said the same thing about Oklahoma. During a confab of the Western Governors Association in Oklahoma City, Governor Stitt bragged about installing carbon-neutral green energy into the Oklahoma electricity grid and how “the number of charging stations spread out along highways can serve thousands of electric vehicles and a plan to create a new hydrogen energy hub will help the nation move away from fossil fuels,” according to the Oklahoman.

In an interview with the prominent local paper after the event, Stitt let the cat out of the bag as to why he is all in on green energy, revealing the likely culprit for why Republicans betray us on almost every other important issue. “Most Republican governors would not tackle that, but as a business person ... you're looking at where the investments are heading,"" said Stitt.

Points for honesty! And Stitt is not wrong. All the money is indeed with the bad guys. The money is with the Great Reset, open borders, pro-criminal policies, corporate welfare, biomedical tyranny, and green energy. Thus, if you ever wondered why Republicans refuse to hold Democrats accountable – even when their policies are so destructive and unpopular – follow the money. Or as Stitt would say, the “investments.”

At a time when we are confronted with an intractable fight for our way of life and need an opposing party to break the paradigm of the federal government working with the ESG “sustainable growth” and “Agenda 2030,” governors like Stitt believe in the old adage “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.” Yet the only reason we can’t beat them is because Stitt and other GOP governors have already decided to join the bad guys.

The Oklahoman explains Stitt’s feelings based on their interview as follows:

For Stitt, the growing electric car market is one he wants Oklahoma to tap into.



“The investments are heading to electric vehicle manufacturing, battery manufacturing technology, alternative (energies),” Stitt said.



Stitt has pushed for the state to spend billions of dollars in tax incentives for the electric vehicle industry, including nearly $700 million the governor got lawmakers to approve this year in hopes that Pansonic would bring an electric vehicle battery plant.



In other words, the very corporate welfare that has allowed government to artificially promote expensive and ineffective energy policies that now leave us with a crisis of our way of life is fully embraced in Oklahoma, just like in California.

Stitt will defend himself by saying that unlike in California, he still supports oil and gas alongside fake energy. But the problem with this “all of the above approach” is that given that Democrats are artificially imposing blocks on oil and gas and spurs on electric cars, wind power, and solar power, any tendentious treatment of green energy by Stitt will only help grease the skids of the “Net Zero” carbon agenda.

Perhaps if Stitt were in charge of the world, the green energy subsidies wouldn’t be as much of a threat to energy that actually works. But given that he is enabling an illusory replacement of fossil fuels, it will allow the globalists to more easily destroy the fossil fuel industry altogether, while making us reliant on wind and solar, which aren’t reliable, and electric cars, which are not only more expensive, but dependent on so many natural resources that have become scarce and expensive as a result of the Great Reset. The shortage of lithium, cobalt, and magnesium will make electric vehicles impractical, and the relative scarcity of copper and aluminum needed for the wind turbines will also make wind an expensive boondoggle for the little energy it produces. Oh, and let’s not forgot all the oil and gas needed to produce the supply chain of most of these “alternative” energy products.

Stitt brags about Oklahoma getting 35% of its electricity from wind, but the free market did not drive that outcome and never would have. Transitioning to green energy will further ease the left’s plan to destroy fossil fuels and leave us with unreliable energy. Would he celebrate a grid built upon 100% wind power? What will that look like when the air is calm, the sun goes down, but the illusion of the transition allowed the left to wipe fossil fuels off the map?

While Stitt brags about wind energy, he refuses to learn the lesson from south of his border when Texas’ grid failed thanks to that transition to “new technology,” as Stitt fondly refers to solar and wind. Rather than spending the money on energy that actually works, “red” Texas invested $66 billion in solar and wind to each compensate for each other’s failures (solar during dead wind and wind during the night). Texas became the leader of green energy long before California. Yet that did nothing for Texans during the Great Texas Blackout of February 2021, which cost billions of dollars and nearly 200 lives. This past summer, according to Bloomberg, the Texas grid had to operate “at a historic pace, often forcing them to put off maintenance to keep cranking out electricity.” Imagine if a fraction of the $66 billion had been invested in energy that actually energizes the world rather than in sources than need help from other energy to produce a fraction of the output at a higher cost.

Thus, boasting about shifting reliance from fossil fuels or nuclear energy to green energy is akin to making someone more reliant on a bike than a car for transportation. Which is exactly what they want to do. The more they use a carrot-and-stick approach to prop up fake energy, the more they box out real energy in a circuitous cycle of failure, dependency, higher prices, and scarcity of product, which feeds on itself in perpetuity.

To add insult to injury, Stitt wants to follow the California example of weakening the grid with ineffective energy sources and then further straining it buy promoting electric vehicles, which drive up the demand for electricity, thereby ensuring that the only cars on the road in his dystopian vision won’t be able to reliably run, even after paying a fortune for the purchase.

There’s a broader lesson not just in the fact that a prominent Republican governor has embraced the green energy Agenda 2030 but in the reason why he has embraced it. Stitt believes that we must “invest” in the strong players on the block. Well, the strong players on the block are not the forces of freedom that respect life, liberty, property, and the continuity of the human species in the way we understand it. The strong players are those who want us without cars, without detached homes, without abundant food and medicine, and completely reliant upon government for basic needs while eating bugs, groveling for rationed food, energy, and medicine, and having our bodies, minds, and souls constantly surveilled, if not downright controlled. This is where the money is. This is the “wave of the future.”



Kevin Stitt reflects the prevailing sentiment among nearly all GOP senators and governors. It’s not so much that all of them are inherent leftists, but that they support whatever the current corporate class does at the given time. We happen to be living in a time when the corporatists are all propped up by government manipulation and support more radical and destructive ideas than the traditional left-wing organizations of yesteryear. So, do the GOP governors ideologically support transhumanism, the biomedical security state, and “sustainable growth” in energy and food? Perhaps not, but the outcome is the same. Rather than confronting the money and power with equal and opposing force, they will seek to co-opt it, leaving us just as disenfranchised as under Democrat control.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-nh-senate-passes-bill-that-could-empower-hospitals-to-arrest-family-members-who-argue-with-doctors,2022-09-15
Horowitz: One of the most powerful Republicans supports expanding funding for FBI J6 witch hunt,"Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) is a top appropriator and is likely going to be the Rules Committee chairman of the next Congress. In other words, he will control the flow to the floor for every bill and has a big say in in the entire budget process. He is also a man who believes we are not spending enough money on Fourth Reich agenda items, including the persecution of Trump supporters on January 6 – and beyond.

No Republican can feign ignorance about the truth of January 6 nearly two years later. It’s not that not a single authentic Trump supporter did anything wrong on that day. But it is abundantly clear that elements of the government had forewarning, there was robust FBI involvement in provoking it, people are being persecuted for peacefully protesting or merely being in the Capitol peacefully, and even the few who engaged in some degree of crime are being punished so disproportionately that if the standard were applied to BLM, there would be 1 million people in jail pretrial indefinitely.

As such, this inquisition needs to be shut down, especially now that we know from whistleblowers that investigators are planning to expand the investigation to anyone supporting the protest who wasn’t even at the Capitol.

Yet the DOJ is now asking Congress for even more funding in the upcoming fiscal year, according to NBC.

The Justice Department has called Jan. 6 “the most wide-ranging investigation” in its history, with more than 870 arrests so far. For 21 months, the investigation, led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, has largely been propped up with help from 93 federal prosecutors' offices from across the country who are volunteering personnel.

Even if you don’t believe the FBI and informants like Ray Epps created a setup and you do believe that somehow this was a legitimate attack, how in the world are there more than 870 people to rope in when most of those 870, at worst, simply walked into a public building or committed a misdemeanor? Yet shockingly, one of the most powerful Republicans is open to giving the bureau more money to investigate people who clearly did nothing wrong or might not even have been in the Capitol.

Some Republicans are open to it. Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a senior GOP appropriator who objected to certifying the election results after the Jan. 6 attack, said he’s open to authorizing more money for the investigation.



“Those people ought to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I don’t have any problem giving the Justice Department the resources it needs to do that,” he said. “I don’t have any problem spending extra money to make sure that anybody that broke into this building is brought to justice.”



More money has already been spent on prosecution than on the damage to the bricks of the building by an exponential factor! Where is the call from Tom Cole to spend money investigating BLM rioters, including thousands upon thousands of people who committed violent crimes, often for weeks on end, including setting up autonomous zones in middle of cities? There was an estimated $2 billion in insurance claims from those riots. What about the hundreds of private businesses that were burned to the ground? Don’t they deserve justice? Then again, even those who attacked police officers were not punished with jail time, while people who put their feet on Pelosi’s desk sit in the gulag pretrial for two years. Meanwhile, judges are now preventing law-and-order prosecutors from pursuing cases against the most violent BLM thugs who surrounded motorists and smashed car windows on highways.

So what exactly would be funded by people like Tom Cole with an expanded investigation? Thanks to FBI Special Agent Steve Friend coming to Senator Grassley as a whistleblower, we know it won’t even be used for January 6. “ FBI domestic terrorism cases are being opened on innocent American citizens who were nowhere near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, based on anonymous tips to an FBI hotline or from Facebook spying on their messages,” reports the New York Post, based on Friend’s complaint. “These tips are turned into investigative tools called ‘guardians,’ after the FBI software that collates them.”



Thus, Cole and the other RINOs literally want to fund the dissolution of the foundation of democracy. And he will essentially be the next chairman of all the chairmen in the upcoming Congress.

Tom Cole exemplifies the GOP old bull leaders who will largely run the GOP-controlled House … into the ground. They accept all the premises of the Left on the major issues of our time – be it political persecution, COVID, or Ukraine. This is why they are in a rush to give Democrats everything they want in the omnibus bill before January rather than extending the stopgap bill into next year so that their own leaders will be able to write the budget and defund tyranny.

But then he turns around and uses broad bromides that the base wants to hear to project the image of a conservative.

However, how does Cole plan to fulfill his promise of fighting on the border or inflation (caused by Cole’s years of big government spending) if he refuses to deny funding to Democrat policies in the budget? Cole has made it clear that without control of 60 seats in the Senate and the presidency, Republicans can’t do anything. In response to calls from Rep. Chip Roy to use the budget bills and debt ceiling to fight for lower spending to reduce inflation, Cole recently told Politico that it’s dead on arrival.

But Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a veteran appropriator, offered conservatives a reality check in advance.



Even with a House majority, “the president is still the president,” Cole said, and “the filibuster is still there” in the Senate.



Cole added that his fiscal-hawk colleagues “don’t vote for the bills anyway, so they’ve sort of dealt themselves out of the game. ... They ask for things that are impossible to achieve in a process that has to be bipartisan.”



However, this is only true for legislation where you need three bodies of government to change a law. But to pass a budget with liberal priorities, the Democrats need all three branches to agree. With GOP control of the House and likely narrow control of the Senate, why should the Republicans be the first to blink on a budget showdown? If you take Cole’s assertion to its logical conclusion, it would mean that even with control of all three branches but one seat shy of a supermajority in the Senate, the GOP could not fight on budget bills. Indeed, this is what happened in 2017-2019, when Republicans controlled all three branches and old bulls like Cole sold us out on every budget bill.

If at this time next year you are just as disgusted with the GOP-controlled Congress as with Pelosi, just know it will be due to the handiwork of Tom Cole and his ilk who lend bipartisan support to every illegal, immoral, and tyrannical policy pursued by this administration.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-oklahoma-stitt-touts-green-agenda,2022-10-25
Horowitz: Ron DeSantis succeeds on education where other Republicans failed for decades,"When was the last time you saw Republicans leading Democrats in any opinion poll on education? Likely never in this generation, not unlike their dismal polling on health care. Education and health care are probably the two most impactful issues on human life, liberty, culture, and economy, yet Republicans have ceded them to the left forever. They tepidly play their “me too” game of acceding to the same socialist policies, merely with less enthusiasm and slightly less funding, rather than offering a new vision altogether. This is where Ron DeSantis has upended the paradigm. He has already offered transformative change on many of the medical freedom issues; now he is doing the same on education.



As he declared Florida the “Education State” at his Monday press conference, DeSantis did something that no other Republican would have had the guts to do: he blocked the implementation of a college AP course on African-American studies.

Just as a farmer erects a scarecrow to protect his produce, the cultural Marxists erect political human shields around their most divisive and destructive agenda items that are usually messaged as “black studies,” “women’s health,” “curing diseases,” or “protecting poor people and puppies.” That immediately scares off all Republican resistance, no matter how pernicious the underlying policy and agenda are.

Undaunted by the scarecrow, DeSantis categorically rejected the program and had no problem articulating how this harms our culture and children and is actually offensive and insulting to Americans who happen to be black. “If you read what’s actually in there, they’re advocating things like abolishing prisons,” said the Florida governor in a press conference.

“Now that’s a radical political position. … It’s also not fair to say that somehow abolishing prisons is somehow linked to black experience. … They want law and order like everyone else wants law and order,” declared DeSantis. “So that is more ideology being used under the guise of history.”

The Florida Department of Education rejected the College Board’s AP African-American studies course because the syllabus contains various critical race theory principles comparing slavery of the past to different political grievances the left has today. Feminism, “queer” theory, and anarchist movements like BLM also wind their way into the syllabus.

DeSantis was undeterred by the race card played against him and turned it right around on detractors in explaining his support for studying impactful black American figures in history, which is a part of Florida’s mandated curriculum. “I view it as American history, not as separate history.”

The point is he refuses to acquiesce to the premise of the left on a single issue, which frees him up to speak directly to the logic and common sense of the actual policy. He did the same when a reporter asked whether his opposition to teaching gender ideology in schools is born out of anti-gay animus.

Notice he never got defensive, nor did he pander. He spoke directly to the policy in a way most parents, except for the blue-haired hippies, would appreciate.

The press conference itself was about his announcement of a “teacher’s bill of rights” in an effort to weaken union monopolies and coercion against teachers, parents, and students.

In the past, Republicans have shied away from leaning in this hard against the state’s public-sector unions out of fear of appearing to be anti-education. Instead, DeSantis announced a set of reforms prohibiting automatic union dues, limiting union boss pay, upending the relationship between the unions and the school boards, and barring all unions in school districts unless they garner 60% support, among other reforms.

And as always, he is willing to use the boot of the government for freedom the way the left uses it for tyranny. “We will be establishing a new process for individuals to notify the state if a teacher’s rights have been violated, and we will ensure that our Florida Department of Education can investigate those complaints very quickly,” DeSantis announced. He was referring to the issue of teachers getting punished for trying to infuse basic discipline and control into the classroom. So not only does DeSantis lean in on the cultural issues, he also makes cultural issues out of simple, traditionally non-political ideas that transcend political lines.

DeSantis, with his strong electoral margins in places like Tampa, Jacksonville, and Palm Beach County, clearly has resonated with many suburban (and even urban) voters who have recently fled the Republican Party. He has largely accomplished this on the education issue by standing up for parental rights, bodily autonomy of students not to be masked, and extirpating grooming and sex studies from the classroom.

Thus, when he announces a massive pay raise for teachers, something indeed other Republican governors often do, he is ensuring that, unlike in other red states, it is actually going to the teachers and not to lining the pockets of those who campaign against our values in the classroom.



Too many red-state governors have been content to cede education to the left. Their own departments of education are indistinguishable from the education officials in California. This is how states like Idaho have sexualized curriculum being taught in their public schools. Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb has been so favorable to union demands that for the first time in recent memory, the Indiana State Teachers Association declined to endorse the Democrat candidate against him during his last election in 2020.

These diffident Republicans feel as if our views are somehow foreign and should be confined to our homes and that somehow the left gets to own public education as its perpetual home-field advantage. But if we believe in the truth of our values, shouldn’t our values be the ones that prevail in our states? Shouldn’t we have the home-field advantage in red states?

The question for other GOP governors is how much of civilization are they willing to cede because they are too scared to stand their ground against the barking dogs of cynical identity politics.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-one-of-the-most-powerful-republicans-supports-expanding-funding-for-fbi-j6-witch-hunt,2023-01-24
"Horowitz: After SCOTUS ruling, states on their own in combatting border invasion","There’s a monthly invasion of hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens, deadly drugs, gang members, and unknowns crossing our border, and it has now become clear that nothing at the federal level will stop it. It’s now or never for the state governments. Waiting for a Republican president two and a half years from now is not the solution. Rather than waiting helplessly until 2025 for someone like a potential President Ron DeSantis to solve the problem, all the GOP governors should follow his example as governor in deterring illegal immigration.

Believe it or not, the president can’t just thwart our sovereignty laws and invite people in to remain in the country indefinitely pending an immigration court hearing. Yet Justice Kavanaugh joined Chief Justice Roberts and the liberals in upholding the Biden administration’s decision to abolish Trump’s policy of making illegal aliens return to Mexico while petitioning for entry into the country.

Biden v. Texas, which involved the state of Texas suing the DHS for flooding the state with illegals, was not just about continuing the policies of a predecessor. Obviously, a president doesn’t have to maintain the executive orders of the prior president – unless your name is Trump and you are actually enforcing immigration law, in which case the same Supreme Court on numerous occasions made him continue Obama’s amnesty programs. This case, however, is about the plain meaning of the law.

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U. S. C. §1225(b)(2)(A)) states plainly that if anyone is caught coming over our border “not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted,” the individual “shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding.” And no, just because the entire world claims bogus asylum, it doesn’t mean they get to remain indefinitely pending the adjudication of their claims. The same statute (§1225(b)(1)(B)(ii)) makes it clear that the asylum petitioner “shall be detained for further consideration of the application for asylum.”

The court majority attempts to get around this by ignoring the main statute and focusing on §1225(b)(2)(C), which deals with returning aliens to their country of origin and states that the DHS “may” return them. As such, the court ruled that clearly Biden doesn’t have to return aliens to Mexico because that Trump-era policy was optional. But there’s one problem: The same law states that the DHS “shall” either not allow them to enter or must detain them. One way of fulfilling that dictate is to return them to Mexico. If Biden doesn’t want to do that, he is welcome to detain them. “But it’s not feasible to detain millions of people,” he will suggest. Exactly! So, then he has no other choice but to return them in order to keep within the letter and spirit of the law, which reflects a core sovereignty interest of the states and the people. Yet he’s released so many that even the detention space we have is empty in some facilities.

Moreover, the fact that there are exponentially more aliens than detention space is prima facie proof that this is not about asylum at all, but a carte blanche invasion. So, the Supreme Court used one word of one statute in isolation to render the entire letter, spirit, and goal of the INA obsolete.

Justice Alito, in his dissent, offered the perfect analogy for what would happen if a private citizen read the law the way the Biden administration is abusing the INA:

Here is one more example. A State that operates its own motor vehicle inspection facilities has a law that says that every vehicle “shall” be inspected every year. The law also says that motorists “may” have their vehicles inspected at a licensed private garage. A motorist fails to have his car inspected because he must work during the time when the state facility is open and would be fired if he took time off. This motorist also declines to have his car inspected at a private garage that is open during his off hours because the law says only that he “may” use such a facility. Would the motorist escape a citation?

Well, the same principle should apply here. How can the federal government get away with violating the core social compact it has with the states and the people? One of the core tenets of just government we celebrate this week by commemorating the signing of the Declaration of Independence is that all government power must flow from the “consent of the governed.” This implies jurisdictional and political sovereignty in the sense that no outside forces not controlled by the members of that society may determine the destiny of the society. Millions of foreign nationals cannot unilaterally assert jurisdiction, drain our resources, obtain citizenship against our will for their children, and then be counted in the census and distort our representation.

All signs point to states taking the lead in the face of the federal betrayal of this contract. Florida Governor DeSantis has taken the lead by, among other ideas, convening a grand jury to investigate who in Florida is involved in the smuggling operations that have brought millions of illegal aliens, along with so much criminal activity, into the country. The Florida Supreme Court recently agreed to impanel a statewide grand jury to investigate the scope of the problem, which could eventually lead to prosecutions of those involved.

Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, who has worked on interior immigration enforcement for over three decades, believes that this example, if followed in other states, could deter the flow of trafficking or at least divert them to blue states.

“This criminal infrastructure includes the coyotes, who bring the illegal migrants over under the protection of the cartels, but also a vast and well-organized network of stash houses, transportation carriers, identity fraud rings, illegal labor contractors, money launderers, and even charities who assist the migrants along the way,” explained Vaughan. “What is happening is not a benign, humanitarian process; it is a dangerous, exploitative system that undermines our sovereignty, not to mention imposes enormous economic and fiscal costs on American communities. This grand jury will be able to expose just how ugly this system is, and it will be in a position to disrupt what is happening, potentially through criminal prosecutions.”

Vaughan notes that obviously Florida can’t single-handedly stop illegal immigration, but it will likely deter smugglers from using Florida to operate. “If the smuggling organizations and their associates are successfully disrupted in Florida, they will decide to work elsewhere. We should all pay attention to how this plays out. Over time this could potentially set a new standard for state action to deflect the impact of federal policies’ failures.”

Then, of course, there are the border states. Arizona and Texas must simply begin removing illegal aliens themselves. Kinney County Sheriff Brad Coe should serve as an example for the state officials in those border states. He caught four illegal aliens in a busy smuggling corridor in the Del Rio Sector, but border agents refused to take custody of them. So he drove them an hour away to the international bridge at Eagle Pass in his own sheriff’s van. “So, I can’t let them walk the streets. I can’t say, ‘Hey, go, be free.’ Because I still have to protect the Constitution and protect the people in the county.”

Now they want to hire foreign workers.,"Republicans are all unanimous in their opposition to the reconciliation “Build Back Better” bill, but Mitch McConnell and 16 other Senate Republicans voted for the mini BBB bill, dumping billions of dollars into companies that have created a brain gain for China’s trade theft to drain our supply chains. Not only did McConnell agree to the bill despite the refusal of Democrats to entertain amendments ensuring that the jobs stay in America, but now these same companies are turning around and demanding more foreign workers to hire.

“In the near-term, the U.S. educational system does not produce enough Americans with the required qualifications to meet the demand of companies, not just in the semiconductor industry, but across the technical sector,” the HR officers of nine semiconductor companies wrote in a letter to congressional leaders. The nine companies were: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.; Ampere Computing; ASML US; Broadcom Inc.; Americas Global Foundries; Infineon Technologies; Americas Corp.; Intel Corporation; Samsung Semiconductor, Inc.; and Texas Instruments Incorporated.

These companies are trying to take our money and pour gasoline on our supply chain fire by hiring more Chinese and Indian nationals. How do you think China has us by the neck when it comes to our industrial base? China flooded our country with foreign students and green card recipients for decades. Some of them were terrific people, but many of them went back and shared the knowledge they learned at our universities and companies and grew China’s industrial base. This is how China has been able to develop an army of people with American expertise to then work for these American or Chinese companies for a cheaper price overseas.

According to a bipartisan Senate Homeland Security subcommittee report, there are 10,000 Chinese nationals conducting research in the Department of Energy’s National Labs. The report found that agencies and departments conducting scientific research like the National Institutes of Health and the State Department do not “systematically track visa applicants linked to China’s talent recruitment plans.”

The report found that foreign-born researchers working for various U.S. scientific research agencies were being paid by China under the Thousand Talents Plan run by the communist government. It concludes, “American taxpayer funded research has contributed to China’s global rise over the last 20 years” because it allowed China to go “from brain drain to brain gain.”

The endless supply of Chinese visa holders has served as this conduit for China’s brain gain. Now, these same companies that lobbied for a bill touted as shoring up America’s control over production of chips are trying to use the money to hire foreign nationals. Given our immigration trends, they will likely be Chinese and Indians.

Massive corporations lobbying for endless corporate welfare along with visa pork is what has demographically gerrymandered the American worker out of entire industries and what has ultimately led to China’s gain and our drain. The pipeline begins with F-1 student visas. In the case of foreign students, it’s really the god of public education, which is being subsidized happily by the Chinese. The universities get cash from the Chinese government, while the Chinese get operatives and intelligence officers into the country to work in academic fields and occupations. The rest of the American people lose. We bring in roughly 369,548 Chinese foreign students a year, together with 80,000 more on immigrant visas. In other words, there are about as many Chinese students in the U.S. as the entire university enrollment in the state of Maryland.

Noted right-wing outlet CNN reported in 2019, ""The sheer size of the Chinese student population at U.S. universities presents a major challenge for law enforcement and intelligence agencies tasked with striking the necessary balance between protecting America's open academic environment and mitigating the risk to national security."" Yet these tech companies think we are not bringing in enough Chinese immigrants. The director of national intelligence warned, ""China's intelligence services will exploit the openness of American society, especially academia and the scientific community, using a variety of means.""

Thus, this chips bill, as predicted, will wind up helping China rather than countering it. McConnell still supported the bill even after Democrats rejected the inclusion of provisions sponsored by Sen. Rob Portman that would have barred the semiconductor companies from manufacturing in China and would have barred entry of those suspected of coming here to spy on our sensitive technology. The lobbyists worked assiduously to block amendments for more security.

These same greedy companies will use the corporate welfare to hire foreign workers who they know will work for lower pay. Democrats already inserted into the bipartisan defense authorization bill a provision that allows 200,000 adult children of visa holders to inherent the residency status of their parents who hold temporary worker visas, which will further drive down wages of entry-level jobs.



Indeed, corporate welfare mixed with endless visa pork has destroyed our sovereignty as citizens and has sold us out to transnational corporations that now have us over the barrel. Naturally, Congress will aggravate the very variables that got us into this mess.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-scotus-immigration-states,2022-08-08
Horowitz: Are the Soros prosecutors finally facing justice?,"In 2018, when even conservatives bought into the de-incarceration agenda of “criminal justice reform,” I lamented to crime expert Heather Mac Donald in a conversation, “What are we going to do about the tsunami of jailbreak bills enjoying bipartisan support?” “It’s going to have to get worse before it gets better,” she replied. “The country has forgotten what it was like before the Giuliani days of tough-on-crime policies, and they will need a reminder.” Well, it appears that the people have now gotten a stark reminder of what ubiquitous crime looks like. The question is whether Republican politicians have finally learned their lesson.



After San Francisco voters tossed out pro-criminal Soros DA Chesa Boudin in a stunning recall election last month, it appears that Los Angeles voters are ready for a repeat performance against DA George Gascón. After turning San Francisco into the needle and homeless capital of the country during his stint as DA last decade, Gascon took his criminal road show down south to L.A. in 2020 and promised ""the lowest level of intervention for the criminal justice system"" if elected. Well, he did not disappoint. He did to L.A. what Boudin did to San Francisco, as crime skyrocketed commensurate with this criminal release policies. Now he appears to be suffering the same fate as his San Franciscan comrade.

On Monday, the organizers of the recall campaign against Gascon turned in to the Los Angeles Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk’s office 715,833 signatures for the recall petition. In order to trigger a recall election, 566,857 valid signatures are required, so the campaign looks like it was a smashing success. The clerk’s office has until August 17 to certify the petitions, and then the recall election will likely be held concurrent with the general election in November.

These results in America’s most liberal cities are astounding and demonstrate that crime transcends ideological divisions. Rather than running away from tough-on-crime policies for over a decade, Republicans should have embraced their Reagan roots and stood with victims of crime.

Gascon instituted numerous dangerous pro-criminal policies that ensured repeat violent offenders avoided most sentencing enhancements, violent juveniles got off with a slap on the wrist, and sentences for murderers were reopened. The recall campaign reached its crescendo last month when two El Monte Police officers – Joseph Santana and Michael Paredes – were allegedly murdered by a repeat violent offender who would have been behind bars but benefited from Gascon’s eschewing of sentencing enhancements. The alleged murderer, Justin Flores, was a gang member with multiple priors. Because of his record, he would have been eligible for a three-year sentence on a 2021 conviction for drug and gun charges, but thanks to Gascon’s policies, he was out after 10 days.

Things are so bad in L.A. now that 7-11 stores are being encouraged to close due to shootings and robberies, even on their celebrated July 11 promotional day.

Bizarrely, rather than hit Democrats for releasing violent gun felons, Republicans decided last month to work with them on red-flag laws to circumvent due process. It appears that L.A. and San Francisco voters understand the crime issue better than elite Republicans, most of whom never have to live in the neighborhoods plagued by “criminal justice reform.” In general, progressive DA and sheriff candidates were defeated throughout California in last month’s primaries.

It has become self-evident that most violent crime could be stopped if we had a true “three strikes and you’re out” law for repeat violent offenders. A remarkable new analysis published by the Maryland Public Policy Institute reveals that most of the recent murder suspects in Baltimore, one of America’s murder capitals, had recent convictions for serious offenses but were out of prison to commit the new crime only because they were released before the statutory sentencing timeframe.

Researchers analyzed 110 homicide suspects between January 2019 and July 2020 and found that 77 had been convicted for a serious crime since 2015 and 90 had committed serious offenses at some point in their careers of crime. “Of those 77 previously convicted, 61 (79%) of them faced statutory jail terms that should have kept them in prison beyond the date that they committed the subsequent alleged homicide,” notes the MPPI.

The report also profiles five homicide defendants who allegedly killed within months of their prior conviction and sentencing. “One suspect, James Dunbar, whose homicide case is still pending, was convicted of a handgun charge, and released for time served less than three months before he is accused of killing a man in 2019. Another repeat drug and gun offender was convicted of dealing drugs and violating his probation six months before he allegedly shot and killed someone in 2020.”

It turns out that 59% of the murder suspects had previously committed a weapons crime or used a firearm in another offense. Thus, for a city that banned right to carry until the recent Supreme Court ruling, they sure didn’t mind violent criminals carrying weapons.



Republicans have mistakenly joined with Democrats in pushing for de-incarceration even as they mindlessly chant “back the blue.” But police are meaningless if we refuse to lock up repeat violent offenders. We need more than election-year talking points; we need commitments to increase – yes, increase – the number of criminals in prison. Three strikes and you’re out should mean you are off the streets forever. Sure, it will land more people in jail, but it would stop most of the murders, robberies, and carjackings. That is what most average Americans care about most.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-semiconductor-companies-foreign-workers,2022-07-13
Horowitz: The need for states to thwart federal persecution of political opponents,"If COVID was the pretext to criminalize our bodies, then January 6 was the ploy to criminalize our social and political views. The regime is now arresting people for merely protesting regime policies without committing an actionable crime simply because they are political opponents. Meanwhile, regime supporters can directly call for violence, have their supporters follow up and attempt to assassinate a Supreme Court justice, and the regime will continue to praise the protesters and even insinuate the coming of a “mini-revolution.” The past week’s events have made it clear we need a national divorce and cannot live harmoniously with these people. As such, it’s time for red-state governors to protect the civil rights of political dissidents with as much vigor as the regime has for violating them.



On Thursday, a team of FBI stormtroopers raided the Michigan home of Ryan Kelley, one of the leading GOP candidates for governor. His crime? Being at the protest outside the Capitol. The Feds accused him of “gesturing” to protesters to storm the Capitol and used some comments he made during the heat of the protest to incriminate him; however, the proof being in the pudding, Kelly never entered the Capitol at all. Using this as the threshold for arrest, millions of BLM protesters should be sitting in jail, when in fact even those who burned, beat, looted, and vandalized were never cited, much less punished. Oh, and he was arrested by the same Michigan FBI office that was engaged in entrapment and basically concocted the kidnapping plot against Governor Whitmer. As Julie Kelly reported, “More than a dozen FBI undercover agents and informants were involved in the kidnapping caper; Dan Chappel, the lead informant, was compensated at least $60,000 by the FBI for six months’ work, paid in cash for services rendered, and reimbursement for expenses.”

Obviously, the arrest of Ryan Kelley coincides with the Hollywood documentary-style January 6 committee hearings and is a day after Biden promised Jimmy Kimmel he would send his political opponents to jail for not playing by the rules. In a sadistic twist of irony, in that same interview, he “predicted’ a “mini-revolution” if Roe is overturned, even though the day before, a young man was arrested for an attempted assassination of Justice Kavanaugh for potentially overturning Roe.

So here are the rules of the game. Democrats can directly call for violence, have their supporters take up the call, and they are not held politically accountable and even double down on their comments. Yet for any individual involved in a protest or – in the case of Peter Navarro and law professor John Eastman – merely giving a legal opinion on something that was associated with violent acts of a selected few individuals (encouraged by FBI agents like Ray Epps) – their legal and political opinions or forms of protest are now deemed criminal acts.

Remember Chuck Schumer’s comments about releasing a “whirlwind” against Gorsuch and Kavanaugh?

""I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price,"" Schumer, who was then minority leader, said at the time. ""You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.""

Keep in mind, there are no elections for Supreme Court, so there is no way he could have meant these words figuratively, about an election, in the heat of political debate. There is only one thing he could have meant, and now we have ubiquitous protests outside their homes and one individual as an alleged assassin. I’m not suggesting we head down the slippery slope of criminalizing Schumer’s words, but the government is criminalizing any opinion even if there is no violence inherent in the words.

We constantly hear the left wax poetic about the degree of violence on January 6, the damage, and the threat to slaughter thousands of people, even though, interestingly enough, all of the videos only seem to show violence outside, but those in the Capitol either did nothing or goofed off. Some even exchanged friendly words with officers in the Senate chamber.

Yet these same people seem to forget that dozens of Secret Service agents were injured in a BLM riot at the White House in May 2020. What about the broader scope of the BLM riots?

According to a report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA):

There were 574 riots in the U.S. and Canada between May 25 and July 31, 2020, stemming from about 8,700 protest events.

More than 2,000 officers were injured in those riots.

72% of major city law enforcement agencies had officers harmed during the protests.

More than half of major city law enforcement agencies (56%) experienced arson incidents.

In Minneapolis alone, rioters burned down more than 1,500 businesses, as well as police stations and schools, and caused over $500 million in damages. Nationwide, there was between $1 and $2 billion in insurance claims for damages from the riots. Yet not only did no Democrat condemn the violence, as every conservative condemned the violence on January 6, Democrats praised it, encouraged it, joined it, declared it a new civil rights movement, and dedicated memorials and ostensibly a new national holiday to it. Across the nation, even those who committed the worst forms of arson got off with a slap on the wrist, and most of the extremely violent rioters in Portland had their charges dropped. Oh, and unlike January 6, they didn’t need FBI agent provocateurs to get violent, they did it on their own.

According to the Oregonian, out of 974 criminal cases stemming from the Portland riots over the past several months, 666 were dropped by Multnomah District Attorney Mike Schmidt. Moreover, only seven out of the 39 arrests for assaulting police officers resulted in charges being filed. The outlet even found 18 individuals who were arrested three or more times throughout the rioting since May. Nearly all the charges have been dropped.

The Oregonian further found that even some of the cases that were initially listed as having criminal charges lodged against the defendant were later dropped. ""But court records show prosecutors have subsequently decided to drop all charges in at least 22 of these cases, some that have included allegations of riot, burglary and unlawful use of a weapon.""

This is not a mere double standard; this is a systematic persecution in the most grotesque form of anarcho-tyranny. It’s quite evident that Democrats will work assiduously to protect their political supporters, even those who commit the most heinous acts. Isn’t it time for Republican governors to protect our political supporters, especially those who never committed a violent act or any criminal act?

Many red states are contemplating a “Second Amendment sanctuary,” but there is an even more urgent need to establish a First Amendment sanctuary. All GOP governors, backed by their respective legislatures, should announce in press conferences that state troopers will prohibit the entry of federal agents to arrest any political opponent where there is no evidence the target has committed an act of violence. They should also refuse to work with the FBI on any other issue until this crisis is resolved.



One such bill has been introduced in Oklahoma by state Senator Nathan Dahm. SB 1166, the “Prohibition on Political Prisoners in Oklahoma Act,” would prohibit the federal government from transporting any January 6 prisoner through the state if they are not being charged with a felony.

If Democrat states can become sanctuaries to protect illegal alien sex offenders from ICE, then you better believe red states should become sanctuaries for Americans targeted by the regime simply because of their political opposition.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-soros-prosecutors-justice,2022-06-13
"Horowitz: Thanks to Trump endorsement, anti-Trump RINO to become top House committee chair","The most important benefit of winning back the House is the ability to write budgets and block Biden’s budget. It all comes down to the power of the purse. Yet thanks to Trump endorsing Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas) over her conservative challenger during a 2020 primary, she remains in Congress and is slated to become the chair of the House Appropriations Committee.

With just a 51% Liberty Score, Granger, a 25-year incumbent from Tarrant County, Texas, is one of the most liberal and out-of-touch Republicans in the House. Her pro-life credentials are dubious, and she called on Trump to drop out of the race in 2016. During Trump’s presidency, she accused the former president of “tear[ing] apart families” at the border, as if the illegal aliens, not the American people, were the victims of the border crisis. She is everything that is wrong with the old GOP, yet now she will become the chief appropriator of the new GOP Congress.

It didn’t have to be this way. Granger was challenged by Colleyville City Councilman Chris Putnam, whom I personally endorsed, in the March 2020 primary. Unlike most primary challengers, Putnam raised a respectable amount of money, and polls showed him leading Granger early on. Yet Donald Trump inexplicably endorsed Granger ahead of the primary, and her fortunes flipped. Trump’s ally, Kevin McCarthy, also spent $1.5 million in negative ads against Putnam. Granger won 58%-42%, and now she remains as one of the most powerful members of the House. With Trump on the ballot in 2020 and endorsing nearly every single incumbent, it was the first cycle in a while in which all incumbents won their primaries.

After Granger stabbed Trump in the back the first time and then received an endorsement, she immediately stabbed him in the back again – just as Mitt Romney did following his Trump endorsement. Granger was the very first person to call for a bipartisan committee on Jan. 6 that has now led to the persecution of people who never committed a crime and merely advocated that state legislatures have the final say in the selection of electors. She was the first Republican to tell Trump to “move on” following the 2020 election. On Jan. 14, 2021, Granger was one of four Republicans who was absent and did not cast a vote on the House impeachment of Trump because she tested positive for COVID. However, the other three clarified that they would have voted no, while Granger conveniently remained silent.

Think about it: One of the most important things the GOP House can do is defund the U.S. attorney’s office in D.C. and the FBI’s persecution of people who never committed violent crimes on Jan. 6., yet the chief appropriator believes in all of the disproven Democrat talking points about what happened that day. In fact, she believes in the Democrat talking points on every issue that matters.

Putnam, her opponent, was an early Trump supporter, but like so many of his most ardent supporters, he was shafted by the man himself, who almost appears to have a Stockholm syndrome for those who hate him. For all the talk about Trump being vindictive toward disloyalty and awarding loyalty, that only seems to apply to conservatives like Ron DeSantis. He had no problem carpet-bombing his own supporters with devastating consequences we are still living with today.

For example, while conservatives worked tirelessly to remove Kevin McCarthy from leadership, Trump endorsed him, and when he did so, many other prominent conservatives who agreed to attack McConnell held their fire on McCarthy. In response, McCarthy reciprocated the kindness by declining to affirm support for Trump’s new bid for the presidency last week.

So here we are, stuck with the same subversive House and Senate leadership people who do not share our values. Most of the committee chairs are also cut from the same cloth. The only Texas Republican with a lower liberty score than Granger is Michael McCaul (47%), who will be the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.



Trump was elevated by the base to drain the swamp, but with the exception of a few individuals who made it a personal vendetta against him, Trump not only declined to go after the swampy Republicans but endorsed against his most ardent supports and is still doing so even to this day. We are now paying for it, because nearly every Republican in power who failed us before and during the Trump presidency is still in control. Perhaps Granger herself was right about moving on from Trump after all.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-states-must-block-political-persecution,2022-11-21
Horowitz: The blueprint for states to protect citizens from FBI and IRS tyranny,"What do you do when the cops become the robbers? When federal law enforcement is now criminalizing conservatives, their existence, and their political beliefs and is willing to use all of its taxpayer-funded resources, technology, and manpower to investigate, entrap, surveil, and infiltrate conservative political activists to the point of criminalizing basic First Amendment rights? These are questions many of us never thought we’d be confronted with in our lifetime, but they are upon us and demand immediate practical answers.

With the FBI raiding people’s homes and infiltrating anti-COVID fascist groups and trying to get them to kidnap the Michigan governor, we cannot simply wait for Republicans to take back the House and possibly hold some hearings. We need to confront power with power. Republicans hold the trifecta of government in nearly half the states, and it’s time they use it in the way Madison envisioned.

It doesn’t take a genius to figure out why the Democrats suddenly authorized the hiring of 87,000 more IRS agents. It’s not to ensure that Pfizer isn’t avoiding tax loopholes. It’s to turn all political opponents of the regime into “J6ers,” and the surest way to find nebulous crimes or entrapment to bring the FBI into their lives is to empower the IRS to use the tax code against small business owners. But of course, only the ones who speak out against the new current hotness of the regime.



Madison made it very clear during the 1798 nullification debate that “the states who are parties therto, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose for arresting the progress of evil.” But decades into the trend of states being obsequious doormats to the federal government, it’s hard for any one individual elected official to take on the feds alone. However, as I’ve explained before, Madison articulated a more comprehensive blueprint for interposition a decade earlier in Federalist #46. He made it clear that it would have to be the governor and the legislature working together, most likely in a large state (think Florida or Texas), and then bind together with other states to do the same, all the while, harnessing the morality, law, and popular sentiment to delegitimize the federal policy.

“The disquietude of the people; their repugnance and, perhaps, refusal to co-operate with the officers of the Union; the frowns of the executive magistracy of the State; the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any State, difficulties not to be despised; would form, in a large State, very serious impediments;” wrote Madison. “[A]nd where the sentiments of several adjoining States happened to be in unison, would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter.”

So, the first step is to build outrage among the people by exposing the repugnance of the federal acts and delegitimizing their policy in the minds of the citizenry. Then, the governor and legislature, preferably working with adjacent states, work to shield the people from the feds so that they could safely refuse to cooperate with “officers of the union.” Madison predicted that interposition across state lines “in unison” would create an insurmountable obstruction against federal tyranny.

Madison also predicted that the states working together and fanning popular sentiment against the feds would create a synergistic momentum of resistance that would leave the feds with few options for enforcement:

But ambitious encroachments of the federal government, on the authority of the State governments, would not excite the opposition of a single State, or of a few States only. They would be signals of general alarm. Every government would espouse the common cause. A correspondence would be opened. Plans of resistance would be concerted. One spirit would animate and conduct the whole.









Florida’s elected Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis has outlined a superlative plan to push back against IRS lawlessness that, if followed by multiple states, would echo Madison’s successful recipe for interposing against federal tyranny.

“The state of Florida can require state chartered banks to generate a regular report on IRS engagement.” Patronis explains that this information will help warn the public and the state about the nature of the IRS targets. This is the first step in interposition, which is building public support and exposing the repugnance of the federal actions. We live in an information war. A big part of the fed’s current success is that it does its work quietly over time and then the first people hear of its investigations is from the vantage point of the smear against the people themselves, typically leaked to their favorite media outlets. Slowly over time, the truth comes out as we have seen with January 6 and the Whitmer kidnapping plot, but the damage of “insurrectionists” had already been done. In this same way, the IRS could be caught in the act before it is ready with its PR machine. The same strategy could be applied against the FBI, ATF, and other agencies by the states working with sheriffs to report and analyze federal actions taken against citizens to see if there is a pattern of political discrimination and even persecution. “Establish a Civil Liability Trust Fund to help small businesses defend themselves, or even sue the IRS in cases of politically motivated audits or federal overreach.” What we’ve learned from Jan. 6 is that political dissidents are on their own and often can’t receive legal help. In this case, the state would actively pay for those targeted by political persecution. “Create a license at the state level so new IRS agents are required to register in order to access account information.” Patronis explains that the process would vet out the backgrounds of the agents to make sure they are not motivated by woke ideology. The names of the operatives in the state would also be made public. This will keep the officers in line and work to delegitimize wayward officers and their actions, further bolstering a scenario of citizens rebuffing “officers of the union” when appropriate. Again, this licensing process could be used for FBI, DHS, and ATF agents as well in some circumstances. “Establish criminal penalties for enforcing laws based on viewpoint or political discrimination.” This is the trigger – where the state can show the feds who is boss. Any IRS, FBI, or ATF agent caught prima facie targeting people for their political beliefs would suffer criminal penalties.

I would add that states need a criminal statute specifically prohibiting federal law enforcement from engaging in conspiracies to entrap citizens in criminal activity. We now know based on the trial in the Whitmer kidnapping plot that the FBI concocted the entire plan and conspired to coerce a few lost souls into joining their plot. The same way it is criminal for citizens to engage in this activity, it should be prohibited for the feds to do the same.

If Republicans are unable or unwilling to push back against such immoral and illegal behavior in GOP supermajority states, do you really have confidence D.C. Republicans will properly deter the political persecutions at a federal level with mere control of the House?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-thanks-to-trump-endorsement-anti-trump-rino-to-become-top-house-committee-chair,2022-08-19
Horowitz: The coming state legislative tsunami: Will Republicans capitalize on it?,"If Republicans adhere to their platform, their coming domination of state governments can put an end to nearly every deleterious policy of the Biden administration. Will they use their power, or will they squander it?



Almost all of the election analysis before and after Nov. 8 will be centered on the number of seats Republicans win in the House and Senate, but it’s really their potential gains in state governments that matters most. We already know the script before it’s written. House Republicans will pass some good stand-alone bills, knowing they won’t pass out of the Senate, and will refuse to stand behind those ideas in the budget bills because “we don’t have 60 votes in the Senate and the presidency.” But the dirty little secret is that most of those ideas to protect the liberty, security, and values of the citizens can be done at the state level, where Republicans are poised to assume full control in states that hold well over half the country’s population.

At present, Republicans hold 23 trifectas (governorship and both chambers of the legislature), Democratic hold 14, and in 13 states there is divided government. Here is the graphic presentation from Ballotpedia:

That is already substantial GOP power that has consistently been underutilized. Also, Republicans have 28 governors while Democrats only have 22. They control both chambers of the legislature in 29 states, with supermajorities (veto-proof) in 16 of those states, as compared to Democrats, who only control eight state legislatures with supermajorities. Republicans have 32 state Senate chambers to Democrats’ 18, and they have 30 state Houses to Democrats’ 18 (Nebraska has no lower House, and Alaska’s House is under shared control).

In total, according to Ballotpedia, Republicans control 54.10% of the nation’s 7,383 legislative seats compared to 44.32% controlled by Democrats. Here is the graphic representation of House and Senate chamber controls, courtesy of Ballotpedia:

This is all following the 2020 GOP election “loss” and before the impending election victory that is trending toward a wave. Republicans have the opportunity to pick up governorships and legislatures around the country. In particular, there is the prospect of acquiring trifecta control in critical swing presidential states while making inroads in blue states with governorships and/or legislative chambers that could, at a minimum, break some of the few remaining Democrat trifectas.

Here’s the breakdown. On the negative side, Republicans are poised to lose the governorship in Maryland and Massachusetts. But it won’t be much of a setback, because Democrats already had veto-proof majorities in both of the states’ legislative chambers. Also, the Republicans there were extremely liberal anyway.

On the positive side, if the current trends holds, Republicans are poised to pick up the governorships in Wisconsin, Nevada, Oregon, and Kansas, and they have the momentum in New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota. Also, if the wave continues to grow and undecided voters continue to break against the incumbents, as the trend is showing, they can still win in Pennsylvania and Maine, where polls currently show the Democrat ahead.

In other words, it’s almost guaranteed they will have more than 30 governorships, with a chance of collecting 35-37 if they run the table. More specifically, by winning the governorships in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Kansas, they automatically would earn four more trifectas, because they already have strong control of those legislative bodies. Also, most analysists believe that Republicans already had a chance to capture the Minnesota House (they currently control the Senate and are only four shy in the House), so now that Scott Jensen appears to be even with the Democrat for governor (and the Republican running for attorney general is ahead of incumbent Democrat Keith Ellison), there is a shocking chance for a GOP trifecta in Minnesota.

As such, if Republicans win all five governorships in the aforementioned states with majorities in the legislatures, that would bring them to 28 trifectas. Then, it is almost a certainty that in this environment, conservatives will be able to pick up enough seats in the Alaska House to break the RINO sharing agreement and restore the trifecta they always should have had. Finally, it’s important to note that Kentucky doesn’t hold a governor’s election this year, but Republicans already have veto-proof majorities in both houses. Plus, Republicans have a very good chance to grow their majorities in North Carolina to veto-proof status against Democrat Governor Roy Cooper. On paper, that would give them 31 states where they can get legislation enacted into law without Democrat obstacles!

Now let’s examine the Democrat trifectas. Here again is the map of existing trifectas:

Let’s add Massachusetts and Maryland to the blue column, since Dems already have super-majorities and now will officially have trifectas. But Republicans, along with the chance of winning the governorship in New Mexico, also have a chance to flip the state House (the Senate is not in cycle). Together with the unprecedented exodus of Hispanic voters from the Democratic Party, a strong gubernatorial candidate at the top, a competitive congressional race in the northern part of the state, and the fact that Democrats did not aggressively gerrymander the House districts as they did in the Senate, there is a very good chance they could flip the House as they did in 2014.

Following the trend of the great Hispanic realignment, Republicans are poised for a revolution in Nevada. They will almost certainly break the Democrat trifecta in Nevada by winning the governorship and stand a very good chance of flipping the state assembly. If the current trend of generational shift among Hispanic voters holds up and they run the table statewide, as some polls are showing, it is also possible that Republicans can flip the Senate too, which would require them to win every competitive race. That would replace a Democrat trifecta with a GOP trifecta.

Likewise, in Oregon, they are now favored to win the governorship, thereby breaking the Democrat trifecta. Despite Oregon’s reputation as a wacko Antifa state, the leftists are confined to certain parts of the state, with large geographic swaths remaining red. Thus, even now, Democrats only have a four-seat majority in the Senate, which can be in play given their problems at the top of the ticket with an unpopular governor who will likely lose and several vacancies among their incumbents. Control of the House is a much tougher hill to climb, requiring them to net at least seven seats, but it should be noted that they will almost certainly pick up two seats, which is enough to break the Democrat three-fifths majority, which is necessary to pass revenue-raising bills.

Moving to the other coast, in Maine, even if Republican Paul LePage comes up short in unseating Democrat Governor Janet Mills, the legislative chambers, especially the Senate, have historically flipped back and forth during bad midterms for both parties. Since 2008, the president’s party has lost the Maine Senate during each midterm election. This year, Republicans must net five seats. There’s also a slightly less likely but plausible chance they will win the more historically Democrat-controlled lower chamber if LePage does win at the top (or possibly even if he doesn’t, because of the culture of split-ticket voting), because Democrats were not able to gerrymander the districts thanks to an independent redistricting commission. So, there is a decent chance of breaking the Democrat trifecta in one of three ways.

Elsewhere in the deep blue Northeast, if Lee Zeldin wins in New York, that would automatically deny Democrats the trifecta, and at a minimum, Democrats shouldn’t have a veto-proof majority in the upper chamber. While flipping 12 seats to downright control the Senate is tough, if there really is a revolution brewing in the Empire State enough to propel Zeldin into the governor’s mansion, it’s very reasonable that Republicans would reclaim the Senate, which was historically in GOP hands until 2018.

Next door in Connecticut, it’s unlikely that Republicans can win statewide races, but polls show the Republican leading in the northwestern congressional district. The state House is out of reach, but the state Senate is conceivably in play if Republicans overperform and run the table on the competitive seats. Democrats currently control the upper chamber 24-12. In 2016, when Trump overperformed at the top of the ticket, Republicans actually tied the Democrats at 18 seats apiece, but Democrats maintained control because of the Democrat lieutenant governor. Dems are definitely poised to lose a few seats.

In Colorado, it would take another level of a red wave for Republicans to win statewide, but they do appear to be overperforming. Even after the state went blue, the state Senate has flipped to Republicans in good years. They need to pick up three seats in the upper chamber to break the Democrat trifecta, which is very achievable, especially because an independent commission drew the new maps.



Thus, in a wave scenario, Democrats could potentially be reduced to 9 or 10 trifectas, essentially the West Coast, Hawaii, Illinois, and only some of the Northeastern states. And even at that, they are poised to lose seats in nearly all of those states. Republicans could wind up with 31 trifectas, 35 governors, and 34 states with both chambers of the legislature. Next year, Kentucky and Louisiana hold statewide elections, and it’s hard to see how Republicans don’t pick up the governorships along with supermajority legislative control. It’s also conceivable for the GOP to add to its supermajority status among the trifectas Republicans already control, such as in Montana, Florida, South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Texas, which often has ramifications for passing constitutional amendments and ballot referendums.

This, of course, is the wave scenario. If the election is more in line with a more modest midterm win for the party out of the White House, you can add a few governors and trifectas to the D column and take a few away from the GOP column. But either way you slice it, Republicans will likely achieve historic control of state governments. What will they do with that power?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-blueprint-for-states-to-protect-citizens-from-fbi-and-irs-tyranny,2022-10-28
Horowitz: The problem with the GOP legislative agenda,"So, you’ve been locked out of power completely for two years, and specifically in the House of Representatives for four years. What are your first-priority bills out of the gate to respond to what has occurred under Biden and the Great Reset?

Well, for starters, the world was destroyed under the COVID regime. You’d expect Republicans to address that in their first act, right? At least their second or third priority?

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise released a list of the first 11 bills and resolutions scheduled for the floor vote, and you’d think COVID fascism – the seminal issue of our time – never occurred. Not only is there no mention of the vaccines or terminating pharma’s immunity to liability, but no legislation even on the consensus issues of masks and lockdowns.

In a sane world, the first bill, “H.R. 1,” would involve Congress reasserting legislative authority and banning all emergency public health declarations beyond seven days unless Congress passes the measures. After all, this is not the 1800s anymore, and Congress can convene at any moment. It’s precisely the most impactful decisions of our country that require congressional buy-in, not governance by administrative fiat. The bill would ban the CDC from ever requiring shots, masks, or social distancing and from recommending shutting down schools.

Have we learned nothing from the past few years? How is this not on the agenda? I’ve offered dozens of ideas that red states must implement and that should be implemented on the federal level, beginning with ending the Prep Act and liability exemption for pharmaceutical companies.

But if you look at the GOP agenda in general, all the items are designed to be nuanced and very specific in order to elicit a “gotcha” talking point against Democrats rather than to usher in civilization-changing ideas.

Let’s be honest: With Republicans giving up their budget leverage until later in the year, all they are left with are “messaging bills” that won’t go beyond passage in the House. So the only purpose is to stimulate debate, change hearts and minds and culture, and motivate states to act on some of these items. The goal would also be to expose just how bad things are under the current system and demonstrate extremely bold contrast. Here are examples of bills that will plow new ground:

No indemnity from liability for greedy and criminal pharma companies and repeal of the Prep Act, which gives immunity to any pandemic-related decision or authorization.

No global warming regulations and green subsidies that lie at the heart of inflation, supply chain problems, and diminished quality of life.

No releasing anyone at our border; a complete ban on all benefits for illegal aliens.

Clarifying that states can enforce any immigration law and go beyond federal enforcement.

According states standing to sue in court when harmed by federal policies releasing illegal aliens.

An end to Chinese foreign student visas en masse.

Selling off federal lands to Western states so that the feds can’t lock up food, energy, and natural resource development.

No spying, surveilling, or monitoring any American with any agency program unless there is probable cause the individual committed a crime. This would include repeal of the Patriot Act. Any agent caught violating civil rights would be on the hook for a private cause of action in federal court.

A complete abolition of race education in the Department of Education.

A complete extirpation of any reference to, much less support for, castration throughout all federal agencies. Abolish all sexuality programs in the Department of Education.

An increase in mandatory minimums for violent felons caught illegally possessing a gun or using a gun thereafter in a crime, not just the small-ball crime bills they have planned.

Ban all woke, green, and biomedical policies in the military.

Audit not just Fauci’s NIAID, but also DARPA and BARDA and the entire biomedical security state.

Ban Biden’s executive order on transhumanist biotech, which calls for the “genetic engineering technologies and techniques to be able to write circuitry for cells and predictably program biology in the same way in which we write software and program computers.”

Pull out of the U.N., or at least the WHO and other onerous international agencies.

Abolish the TSA and revert back to private airport screening. This affects most Americans, and everyone hates the way they are treated. The tyranny began in airports.

There are countless more examples on critical issues of our time.

In other words, we need to be discussing categorical, big-picture demands that would help facilitate a broad debate on the anarcho-tyranny that has taken hold of the country under Biden. The messaging bills, because they have no chance of passing, must be oriented toward shifting the Overton window and plowing new ground on ideas. So yes, it’s great to vote on defunding the new IRS agents, but while you’re doing it, let’s sow new ideas like creating a legal defense fund for victims of IRS political targeting and then addressing the bigger fish: the FBI. One of the first bills should be barring all federal law enforcement agents from monitoring political opponents and creating a private cause of action in court against the specific agents caught engaging in those activities.

For example, whistleblower FBI agent Steve Friend told members of Congress that the FBI is targeting people who weren’t even at the Capitol just because of their political activities and statements. We need legislation that goes big, not because any of this will be enacted now, but because it accentuates the magnitude of the tyrannical government.

As for illegal immigration, all benefits to illegal aliens should be banned, and all catch-and-release should be prohibited, again, with a cause of action for states to sue DHS for violations. Instead, they have a random bill scheduled forcing the DOJ to notify ICE when an illegal alien attempts to buy a gun and is pinged in NICS. Great idea and great talking point to get Democrats on record as against it, but that bill is good as a side dish, not the main course. The main course is that the American people should not be on the hook for an invasion, and those perpetrating it must be liable for civil and criminal penalties. Go big or go home.

On energy, Republicans are planning a pair of bills preventing Biden from drawing down the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and selling the petroleum to China. We obviously all support these ideas, but again, they are nuanced “one-off” ideas to embarrass Biden, not to address the root of our regression in energy, food, and vital goods and services, along with supply chain shortages and inflation. Instead, they should be offering a more categorical bill ending all global warming mandates and subsidies that diminish our quality of life, make vital goods expensive and scarce, and ensure that our products and appliances don’t work.



Republicans have a resolution prepared to declare their appreciation for law enforcement. Nice touch, but that will not move civilization. How about a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that every American has the right to refuse any medical procedure, treatment, injection, device, vaccine, or prophylactic on or in his body and that mask and vaccine mandates violate the most fundamental rights of bodily autonomy?

Instead it’s all theater designed to give the Republican lapdogs on radio and Fox News endless fodder of “but the Democrats” and “Biden crime family” rather than demonstrating how we will actually make people’s lives better and change the corrupt system in reality. If running and governing purely as the anti-Democrat didn’t work in the 2022 political environment, it will never work any other time.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-coming-state-legislative-tsunami-will-republicans-capitalize-on-it,2023-01-05
Horowitz: The real reason Western leaders are silent about Chinese protests,"Typically, when we watch human rights violations across the globe from the comfort of our American homes, we are overcome with a sense of relief that we live in freedom. However, as we ominously watch the protests over lockdowns in China, let’s not forget that a large degree of this particular tyranny was implemented in America for months and that there is nothing in place to stop it from happening again. In fact, what starts in China clearly gets imported to the United States, because our elite overlords are impressed rather than horrified with the behavior of the CCP.



If the response from our government officials, celebrities, and media to the repression taking place in China appears to be muted, it’s likely because these same people had no problem with implementing some of these very policies in the supposed land of the free. In fact, according to revelations from Dr. Fauci himself during a seven-hour deposition with Missouri and Louisiana Attorneys General Eric Schmitt and Jeff Landry, Fauci himself imported the idea of inhumane lockdowns because officials were so impressed with China.

Thanks to a federal judge’s order in a lawsuit in which these two AGs are suing the Biden administration for collaborating with social media to censor opposition to the regime’s COVID policies, Fauci was forced to answer questions during a deposition with the attorneys for the censored plaintiffs last week. One of the plaintiffs, Dr. Aaron Kheriaty, released key details from Fauci’s testimony. Fauci supposedly divulged that he dispatched his deputy at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Clifford Lane, to China in Feb. 2020. They were so impressed with China’s “success” that they decided to emulate the policy in the West.

“Dr. Lane was very impressed about how, from a clinical public health standpoint, the Chinese were handling the isolation, the contact tracing, the building of facilities to take care of people, and that’s what I believed he meant when he said [they] were managing this in a very structured, organized way,” said Fauci in response to a question from one of the lawyers.

So, what was the lesson he took from Dr. Lane in applying China’s policy to the West? “I believe Dr. Lane came to the conclusion that when you have a widespread respiratory disease that a very common and effective way to curtail the rapid spread of the disease is by implementing social distancing measures. … Dr. Lane is a very astute clinician, and I have every reason to believe that his evaluation of the situation was accurate and correct.”

There you have it. Not only weren’t they horrified by Chinese authorities welding people into their homes and tracking every move of every citizen, they found it to be “effective” and “very structured.” Yeah, presumably the Nazi concentration camps were quite structured and organized too.

In other words, our political elites still find nothing fundamentally wrong with what China did and have not repudiated the actions they mimicked here. We must remember that although people weren’t welded into their homes, the stay-at-home orders, masks, massive surveillance, use of AI, transhumanism, and biomedical tyranny were all made in China. And unlike everything else made there, these appear to have staying power.

Rather than engaging in an arms race with the Chinese to see who can excel more at tyranny, we need to destroy the tyranny and plow the salt of freedom into it forever.



Ironically, masks are still being shoved on rape and trauma victims or on the elderly and seriously ill in health care settings, masks made by slave labor in China. AG Schmitt reports that Fauci clearly knew that masks don’t work but promoted them anyway:

Remember people like hair salon owner Shelly Luther being jailed in Texas (of all places) for opening her business? To this day, Gov. Greg Abbott has still not apologized for his COVID policies. We still have Texas doctors being punished for not having worn masks during Abbott’s mask orders. We still have universities, law schools, and medical schools in red states pushing these illogical, inhumane, immoral, and disproven mandates on the human body.

In another rich irony, the Chinese protesters were chanting “we don’t want testing, we want freedom,” yet in the U.S. we still have these mandates for many. They are on our own military.

In other words, we have still not inoculated ourselves against this sort of tyranny at home. Republicans barely even mentioned it during either the 2020 or 2022 elections. One would think House Republicans would make their “HR1” legislation all about banning emergency powers, the Prep Act, lockdowns, masks, and vaccine mandates. Yet we barely hear a peep from them. Indeed, as Chinese citizens risk their lives to protest the CCP, we still have not rid ourselves of our own Chinese demons in the supposed land of the free and the home of the brave.

"Horowitz: Understanding DeSantis, shocking election results, and the red-state revolution we need","There are three political parties in America: Republicans, Democrats, and Ron DeSantis. Democrats are extremely unpopular but were somehow, nonetheless, able to defeat Republicans (morally, if not tactically), who are essentially a controlled opposition. Democrats won big given the circumstances, but at the same time, Ron DeSantis, who is the most antithetical to what Democrats stand for, won big as well. What gives?



There is no way to sugarcoat the GOP crap show in this election. Republicans began this election season with first and goal at the Democrat end zone, with a 50-50 Senate and 212 seats in the House. Even a traditional modest midterm gain against the incumbent president – even with a good economy – should have been enough to flip both chambers. Add to it the fact that the economy, crime, tyranny, border invasion, and inflation have never been worse, there was so much malaise in America, and all the polls showed the GOP winning on every major issue, and we had the makings of a wave that should have swamped the GOP waves of 2010 and 1994.

Oh, and back then you had Democrat presidents who were charismatic and personally popular, as opposed to the deeply unpopular Joe Biden. Yet Republicans were essentially beaten by Joe Biden and John Fetterman to a draw, even though, thanks to reapportionment, Republicans might narrowly control the House.

When the historic results came pouring in from Florida quicker than any other state, showing a Democrat bloodbath, we all thought it was a harbinger of what was to come for the rest of the night. But that bloodbath never came, and to the extent it did, it was the other way around, when Republicans lost legislative chambers in Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Michigan. While the polls undersold the Democrat performance in almost every other state, they also undersold DeSantis’ already dominant position headed into Election Day in Florida. DeSantis successfully made himself almost like a new political party. And indeed, if you follow his views on the issues, there is a greater gulf between him and most prominent Republicans than between Republicans and Democrats.

Therein lies the problem. While it is puzzling that voters would choose Democrats given the state of the economy and security, let’s face it: Republicans barely disagree with Democrats on the issues. For most Republicans, it’s as if COVID never happened. Aside from a few throwaway lines, most Republicans never ran on the full extent of the problems with biomedical tyranny. Instead, they allowed Democrats to outflank them on “my body, my choice,” which should have been our message for the taking in a post-COVID world.

On Ukraine and foreign policy in general, there is barely any difference between the parties. Even as they ran strong on crime and illegal immigration, for most of recent history Republicans were for “comprehensive immigration reform” and “criminal justice reform,” only opting to superficially take the other side as an easy election talking point. They have no vision, and they stood for nothing. They produced nothing of the quality of Newt Gingrich’s Contract with America.

Yes, a few candidates here and there did run on something other than the weak GOP-controlled messaging, but they get swept away in the negative perception voters have of the party. Only DeSantis, with four years of internationally recognized, distinctly effective governance – particularly on the issue of our time – did the voters treat as a stand-alone entity. He was able to win the suburbs and even some urban areas.

In other words, Ron DeSantis is the control group that exposes the GOP as a controlled opposition. He demonstrated – not in Wyoming or Idaho but in a former swing state – that you can win over a supermajority governing coalition with sincere America-first policy that speaks to the people’s concerns and even changes their preexisting views by offering them something different from what the two pathetic parties are offering. This is how Republicans were able to lose the legislature in Michigan for the first time since 1983 but pick up supermajorities in Florida.

The problem with the Republican Party is not Trump per se, although it’s hard to see his mix of style, inconsistent messaging, and weak policies and personnel being the winning formula going forward. The conservative movement has a Republican Party and Fox News problem. Conservatives incur all the liabilities of those institutions without any policy or civilization benefit. How much longer are we going to be conservative souls trapped in the contaminated GOP body, servicing Republicans’ WWE-style fake fights with Democrats as they ensure the latter come out victorious on policy – and now even electorally?

So, the answer is to have DeSantis run for president, right?

While it’s hard to stand opposed to that proposition, and there is certainly nobody else on the horizon who sports this mix of policy benefits and electoral appeal, focusing on the presidential election is the wrong takeaway from DeSantis’ stunning victory. It’s the “Fox News mindset” of soap opera politicking as an end to itself. It’s not even clear that anyone can win with the country so brainwashed and the elections designed for Democrat mail-in shenanigans in all the right states. Moreover, the blue states have become like France, and the federal government is irremediably broken. Is it even worth trying to fix it and trying to govern over people who will never accept us in the long run?

The question everyone should be asking, however, is if half the states are as reliably red as the blue ones are blue, how come we don’t have leaders who govern like DeSantis in every one of those states? What would the country look like if the governors of Oklahoma, North Dakota, Alabama, Wyoming, Arkansas, Missouri, and Idaho governed like DeSantis rather than a bunch of WEF-inspired technocrats? What would happen if every supermajority red-state governor used the machinery of state government to change the economies, culture, legal structure, and policies of the states the way Florida has done? What if every red-county government, school board, and health department reflected the values of the locals rather than the elites, as they currently do in most states aside from Florida?

The bad news is that the electorate is confused, angry, aimless, and divided. But that is also the good news. The same way we will never be able to crack the blue states, Democrats can’t crack the reliably red states. But almost all of them aren’t red in its pure sense, because the Republicans are frauds. So, before we ask how to beat the Democrats’ growing juggernaut in the formerly swing states, why are we not asking why we don’t have a DeSantis in every state with GOP supermajorities in the legislatures?



The answer will bring us back to the same point we’ve refused to confront for too long. The Republican Party, with few exceptions, is a controlled opposition. DeSantis accomplishing what he did in the third largest state with multiple urban centers demonstrates that we are being sold out in the R+20-30 rural states and have been for years. The soul-searching needs to examine more than what is wrong with the Republican Party: that the party itself is wrong.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-the-real-reason-western-leaders-are-silent-about-chinese-protests,2022-11-09
Horowitz: What Republican Party? Senate GOP prepares to codify gay marriage,"At least we can now stop scratching our heads wondering why the Republicans failed to be a viable party. Conservatives were pining for the GOP to hold 53-54 Senate seats, but this week the Senate GOP Conference, led by Mitch McConnell, is demonstrating that Democrats really have a supermajority in the upper chamber anyway, at least as it relates to the most important civilization issues.



Take a hard look at this Gallup survey of Americans who identify as the sexual alphabet soup by generation. Anyone with a modicum of common sense will realize that one need not be a Bible thumper (Allah forbid) to understand the harm that the virulent promotion of the homosexual agenda has wreaked upon this nation. There is nothing natural going on here, as when people are born with brown eyes or green eyes. How on earth have we descended so quickly to a generation that now identifies with an ever-growing number of alphabet soup sexual identities that have led to the destruction of civilization, which is built upon marriage, family, and procreation?

Have we ever considered the consequences of grooming 20% of an entire generation – and rapidly increasing every year – to behave and identity in a way that will not lead to normal family structure or even human procreation?

Again, from a purely secular standpoint, even if one has no problem with these particular behaviors and even if one thinks society needs to protect and recognize them in some way, we have long since accommodated that. The pendulum has swung so far in the other direction that children being raised today are literally convinced that it’s like a 50-50 proposition. You can either marry a man or a woman – that’s just how it is. Given the fact that Obergefell already forces states, at least for the time being, to offer marriage licenses to same-sex couples, why on earth would there be a need to codify it into law even further and place our thumbs on the scale?

Yet this is exactly what Republicans have agreed to do. Later this week, the Senate will vote on HR 8404, which will force red states to recognize any form of marriage adopted in any other state. “We look forward to this legislation coming to the floor and are confident that this amendment has helped earn the broad, bipartisan support needed to pass our commonsense legislation into law,” Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said in a statement.

Schumer has given the impression that they will get well over 10 Republican votes to avoid the filibuster, and there is no evidence that McConnell and other prominent GOP leaders are even speaking out against the bill, much less whipping against it. In fact, House GOP leaders already declined to whip against the even stronger bill in July, which downright forced red states to recognize gay marriage even among residents within the state. Even the amended bill with the supposed religious liberty protection only protects nonprofit organizations, essentially codifying “bake the cake” as the law.

Whatever the final vote is this week, it is quite evident that the entire GOP establishment sees no problem with what is going on here.

Is it their position that not enough people are identifying as something that will ensure there is no procreation? When will they be happy? When that number is at 40% of the population? A majority? According to Gallup, the number of people identifying as one of the glorified letters in the alphabet has doubled as a share of the population in just nine years. The number spiked 27% just in one year since last year’s survey!

Why would something that is so glorified by every aspect of culture, law, and policy suddenly need a reaffirmation from federal law? After all, under Obergefell, red states have to grant same-sex couples licenses anyway. Clearly, this is designed to further promote the broader grooming agenda. It’s no longer just the absence of Judeo-Christian ethos, but the adoption of a new rigid and stoic adherence to paganism, which is rooted in transhumanism and is rooting for depopulation.

Are Republicans absolutely blind to what is going on in society and how this is part of the broader transhumanist and depopulation agendas that seek to deracinate familiar ties, procreation, and traditional stable family structure and turn everyone into androgynous artificial intelligence bots controlled by global governments?

Again, this is no longer just a social or biblical values issue. Gone are the days when gay people were the underdog and it was just a matter of supposedly promoting acceptance for what was thought to be a tiny population and, by some, as a natural phenomenon. Nobody can look at society today and suggest that this trend is natural, nor can one suggest it is helpful to the healthy growth of any civilization, even a secular one.

This is no longer a proposition of “Hey, just give them a marriage license and it will be over.” With the growth of the sexual alphabet acronym every few years, it is shocking how Republicans refuse to recognize where this is coming from and where it is headed. The mantra of “this is not the hill to die on” rings hollow as an entire generation of children are being groomed into a dystopian transhumanist environment of never understanding the basic meaning of marriage, life, sexuality, and even humanity itself.



While conservatives lament the problem with mail-in ballots and possible ballot fraud, we have mail-in Republicans who commit the ultimate election fraud. Chuck Schumer was quite prescient when he said that gay marriage is “precisely the kind of bill that Democrats and Republicans can rally around together."" After all, amid all the WWE-style fighting in Washington, it’s on the issues that matter, in the way they matter, at the time they matter that both sides are as thick as thieves in their war on civilization.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-understanding-desantis-shocking-election-results-and-the-red-state-revolution-we-need,2022-11-16
MacIntyre: Cultural neutrality is a dangerous lie — and it never existed,"One of the more encouraging phenomena over the last few years has been the growing awareness around the radical progressive indoctrination of children and young people in the United States. In some ways it was impossible to avoid, as woke propaganda became the default message of every movie, television show, book, and video game. When every corporation and sports team is wrapping its logo in a rainbow flag, the message is not exactly subtle.

Individuals like Chris Rufo or Chaya Raichik, owner of the Libs of Tik Tok Twitter account, have also done the Lord’s work in exposing the obscene, vile, and hateful nature of the material that the left is exposing children to.

The call to end progressive indoctrination is both understandable and justifiable, but many of those who oppose wokeness have made the error of suggesting a return to the era of cultural neutrality and an unbiased public square. This mythical era never existed, and the delusion of cultural neutrality is a dangerous one that leaves a society defenseless against ideologies that seek to destroy it from within.

It has become common practice for LGBTQ advocates to point at church services or videos of children learning to responsibly handle firearms and allege that these activities are more akin to indoctrination than any drag queen performance. I wish that were true. We would be in much better shape if church services did a better job of instilling the doctrines of their faith in children, but there is some truth to the point. Things that seem obviously wholesome and healthy to conservatives are scary and threatening to progressive activists. The difference between moral visions is so radical that what seems only natural to one is completely abhorrent to another.

Conservatives are becoming more comfortable with pushing back against an ideology that is hostile to their values and to their children’s well-being, but they still fail to grasp how that ideology was allowed to take hold in the first place. When conservatives argue against woke cultural indoctrination, they generally appeal to the idea of value-neutral institutions that do their job without advancing any worldview, but this concept is itself a liberal fiction. When I say liberal, I do not mean progressive or woke; I mean classically liberal, a tradition of thought that many conservatives will actively identify with today.

Too many on the right have bought into the notion that many social institutions, like government and corporations, exist in a secular space where decisions are made independent of any moral or ideological framework. Small-government conservatives just want to be left alone, and they were convinced to abandon the representation of their own values in the public square by an argument of mutual disarmament. This notion is also very appealing to disaffected centrists — former progressives who find the current revolution too radical for their own tastes. The centrists still consider conservative values backward and dangerous, but they do seek a return to the liberalism of the 1990s, the sort that still made arguments about free speech. They would balk at reintroduction of Christianity into public life, but they are willing to make common cause with conservatives if they stick to the notion of institutional neutrality. The centrists do not want their kids learning gender theory in third grade, but they would be just as outraged if it were the Ten Commandments.

The ideological disarmament promised to conservatives never came, and they quickly found themselves the target of cultural persecution with no defense other than an appeal to the neutrality by which the left never intended to abide. Former NFL coach Tony Dungy and NHL player Ivan Provorov both became targets of the woke mob due to their Christian faith last week. Dungy attended the March For Life, and Provorov refused to wear the pride jersey mandated by the Philadelphia Flyers. Sports commentators attacked both men as intolerant bigots, and some went so far as to suggest that Provorov should be deported back to his native Russia for heresy against the new state religion. Many Christians quickly responded by asking for tolerance of their beliefs, the same tolerance that they had been commanded to extend to others, but the left is not as foolish.

A political movement that is willing to mutilate children in the name of gender ideology does not care about appeals to cultural neutrality. Progressives understand that their religion is incompatible with Christianity and always has been. Calls for mandatory toleration were always just points of entry into American institutions, never a shared principle to be extended to Christians or any other belief system that would compete with progressivism.

The evidence of this is very clear, as the left has now made it all but impossible for those who hold to orthodox Christian doctrine to interact with public institutions. Holding basic beliefs about the definition of marriage will get you fired from most corporate employment, chased out of a sports league, and disqualified from holding most government positions. For progressives, tolerance means their views reign supreme without question, and they feel no shame in destroying the lives of anyone willing to challenge their dominance.

Liberalism offered Americans a vision of neutral institutions that would allow for a society free of competing moral visions. All the conflict around essential questions about religion or ultimate meaning could be put aside as everyone operated on a minimum acceptable morality that would allow for different groups to work together in the marketplace. Neutral institutions would eschew ideology in favor of objective and expert management that would improve the lives of society as a whole.

This was always a lie. There is no such thing as a neutral institution. Governments, corporations, and media are constantly making decisions of value, and those decisions will be made based on a moral framework. The moral framework on which social institutions make decisions will be transmitted through everything they do. There is no way of avoiding this truth.

A religion that believes drag shows are good for children but church services are bad for them will not share institutions with Christians; it will expel them or it will be expelled. Liberalism cannot mediate this conflict of moral visions; someone wins and someone loses. There is no third option.



This does not mean that America must become some cartoonish liberal notion of a theocracy like ""The Handmaid’s Tale,"" but it does mean that conservatives need to assert a competing vision. Even if the right could strip wokeness out of every American institution, attempting to return to a value-neutral space simply invites the next predatory ideology to take hold. James Burnham called liberalism the ideology of Western suicide, because it made a society incapable of defending its own values and culture.

The question is not: Should your society transmit values through its institutions? The question is: What values will your society transmit through its institutions? A positive vision is the only thing that will protect American institutions from hostile ideology, and conservatives must provide one if they intend to retake their country.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-what-republican-party-senate-gop-prepares-to-codify-gay-marriage,2023-01-24
MacIntyre: Twitter clearly demonstrates why political power ratchets only toward the left,"Blue-check journalists entered an uncontrolled spiral of self-righteous victimhood over the weekend after several of their colleagues were issued temporary bans on Twitter. Reporters from a number of outlets including the Washington Post, CNN, and the New York Times were suspended from the social media platform for doxxing after linking to an account posting the real-time location of Twitter’s new owner, Elon Musk. Taylor Lorenz of the Washington Post was later added to the list of bans for previous doxxing behavior.

Apoplectic journalists reacted predictably, shrieking about how the suspensions constituted an attack on freedom of the press, referring to the event as a massacre, and generally acting like they just witnessed their best friend getting gunned down in Vietnam. As ridiculous as the hyperbolic and narcissistic display might seem, it was, sadly, not confined to the left. Many conservative columnists and commentators rushed to condemn the temporary bans, asserting that the suspension of any journalist was a violation of freedom of speech. This dangerous and one-dimensional understanding of conservative principles has infected the right for far too long and all but ensures its defeat.



Elon Musk has stated that these suspensions were issued not just because the actions already violated existing Twitter policy on doxxing, but because they revealed the real-time location of his children. The tech mogul, whose son was followed by an alleged stalker last week, described the doxxing as “basically assassination coordinates,” which is of course exactly what they were. These journalists hate Musk and understand that posting the constantly updated real-time position of his children online is an invitation for violence.

Journalists are more than happy to engineer situations that are likely to end in left-wing violence in order to intimidate their targets. One only has to look at the behavior of the press during the riots of 2020 or the media's encouragement of illegal mobs at the homes of Supreme Court justices to understand the game these journalists are playing. Conservatives should understand that a father’s first principle must be that the safety of his children is paramount, but unfortunately many commentators believed that playing into the left-wing narrative due to some mistaken notion of consistency was more important.

The concept of small-government conservatism has, rather disastrously, become a core part of the right-wing identity. Unfortunately, this principle has metastasized into the idea that the right should never seek or use power, especially if doing so could be viewed as punishing one’s enemies. This ideological version of unilateral disarmament has created a political ratchet, ensuring that the growth of power always moves only leftward. This structural advantage not only ensures that conservatives always lose but also tricks them into believing that they must lose unless they want to violate their principles and become as ugly and hypocritical as those they oppose.

To better understand the problem, we must first look at how the ratchet works. The left believes in the acquisition and use of both state and corporate power, so when the left is in charge of a branch of government or private organization, using the might of that organization to reward friends and punish enemies is aligned with the left's principles. Leftists believe that conservatives are an existential threat to their way of life, and so their highest principle is to stay in power in order to defend against the right. Progressives have not only the right, but the duty to crush conservatives and reshape the world in their own image. They are always justified in bending or completely rewriting the rules if it means advancing their agenda.

Conversely, when conservatives are in control of an institution, their first priority is to follow the rules and provide a neutral playing field. Conservatives have been convinced that their name means conserving the system rather than a specific nation of people with a specific culture. Many on the right now value the system over the well-being of the people that system was created to serve. This makes them extremely vulnerable to the manipulation of that system and warps their understanding of their own principles.

When conservatives are in charge, they believe it is their duty to avoid doing anything their opponents would call into question, be above reproach, and wait patiently until progressives return to power so that they can resume banning and punishing their enemies.

Not only does this asymmetrical design allow the left to make sure that politics only ever advances in one direction, it also allows progressives to provide the illusion of legitimate opposition. Conservatives can be allowed to occupy important institutions for a time because their principles ensure that they will never use them to acquire more power or advance their agenda, that they will never really take control. Progressives get to complain about how an insufficient number of illegal immigrants are being given amnesty, or that children aren’t being indoctrinated into gender ideology at a young enough age, without ever worrying about the GOP actually using power to permanently alter the immigration system or outlaw the teaching of gender ideology. The left can rile up its base, play the victim, and provide the illusion of opposition, safe in the knowledge that there will never be real consequences for being out of power, because the leftists are never truly out of power.

People respond to incentives. If one side rewards its clients and punishes its enemies, while the other side refuses to use even the mildest deterrents to punish abusive behavior, it is not hard to figure out whose team you want to be on. People like Taylor Lorenz are professional doxxers. They destroy the lives of innocent people because doing so allows them to acquire money and status. Not only are these “journalists"" not ashamed of their behavior, they see themselves as righteous crusaders holding the hateful and bigoted red-state masses accountable. They are inquisitors purging the sinful and unclean, and they will not be persuaded to abandon their holy mission by weak appeals to some common ideal of journalistic neutrality. These zealots will stop when the incentives are removed and the consequences are too much to bear, and not one minute before.

Some have made the case that running all the progressive journalists off of Twitter is a mistake, and I agree. The magic of Twitter is that it serves as the digital public square where the average person can interact directly with the powerful and influential. Destroying that dynamic would be foolish, but sending a clear message to journalists that the rules apply to them and that inciting the mob will have consequences is still valuable.

Others are skeptical of Musk and his intentions. He is not a traditional conservative and is prone to eccentric behavior. On Sunday the billionaire posted a Twitter poll asking if he should step down as head of the social media company, stating that he would abide by the decision, and the vote came down in favor of his replacement. I do not believe that Musk puts out polls like this unless he has already decided to act and knows the results will support his decision, but I understand conservatives who are hesitant to put all their trust in the billionaire. Unfortunately, there is a critical truth emerging out of this Twitter saga that those on the right must understand.

Many conservatives still believe, despite all of the malicious bias against the right revealed by the Twitter Files, that if there are simply clear moderation policies in place, users will not be subject to the judgment of those who decide how those policies are applied, but that is foolish. The lesson of the Twitter Files is not that if only the social media company had applied its own policies correctly, everything would have been fine. The lesson is that someone always decides, and what matters is who decides.



The decision can be made by a nameless, faceless bureaucratic swarm that is impossible to hold accountable, or it can be made by a single man who can be asked to explain his actions to the public. The one truth that is inescapable is that someone always decides. When Musk decides to send a message that journalists do not get a free pass on doxxing, even if he is not the perfect conservative ally, there is no need to dive in front of these smear-merchants on principle. If a leader is using the authority of an institution to hold malicious actors accountable, that is a just exercise of power. Conservatives can never hope to win any meaningful victories if they are unwilling to support even the most basic consequences for those who wish to profit from harming the public.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/macintyre-cultural-neutrality-is-a-dangerous-lie-and-it-never-existed,2022-12-20
What Pelosi's Taiwan Visit Means for American Grand Strategy,"At just after 10:40 p.m. local time, on Tuesday night, US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi landed at Taipei’s Songshan Airport.

Pelosi’s touchdown marked the highest level American visit to the Island since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich traveled to Taiwan in 1997. Though many comparisons can certainly be made, much has changed surrounding the geopolitical circumstances in East Asia.

Gingrich’s visit came just over a year after the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, so to say the political environment at the time was tranquil would no doubt be an overstatement. However, when compared to current circumstances one would have to say the stakes of the Pelosi visit are markedly higher.

One notable reason for this is the increased strength of Beijing over the preceding 25 years. In 1997, China’s GDP was $961B, it’s now nearly $15T. Its military spending was $15.7B, today it’s more than $250B. In 1997, China possessed zero aircraft carriers, and today, it fields two combat-ready carriers with a third on the way.

Perhaps more telling of the changing landscape is Chinese rhetoric. In the late 1990s, China was still operating from former Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping’s famous dictum, “Hide one’s capabilities, and bide one’s time” (tao guang yang hui). Deng’s belief essentially advocated for China to hide in the background while it amassed power, and only when the level of power was sufficient should Beijing look to take a leadership role.

Well, under Xi Jinping that time has arrived, at least as far as the current leadership in Beijing is concerned. According to internal documents, China seeks regional and then global domination, and it sees the US as the biggest hurdle in its way. However, it doesn’t take access to classified documents to understand China’s intentions. Its leaders and diplomats are more than comfortable with being publicly aggressive and antagonistic towards the US.

And, on top of the rhetoric, China continues to try to expand its influence abroad via Xi’s keystone policy: the Belt and Road Initiative--which promises infrastructure and economic growth in developing economies, but more often results in high-interest debts that recipient countries can’t pay back. This means that China is able to take over projects and land in these countries, as it did in Sri Lanka when it was granted a 99-year lease on the Port of Hambantota after Colombo defaulted on its payments.

In short, America is dealing with a much stronger, more ambitious, and increasingly more aggressive China than it was in 1997.

Given the circumstances then, what does Pelosi’s visit signal regarding America’s overall strategy? Why would she choose now to go, and what will change now that her trip has concluded?

The skeptic would say that Pelosi’s trip was born out of her own political calculation. Her party is floundering, and her position as Speaker will almost certainly come to an end in November, so it wouldn’t be particularly out of the realm of likelihood that she saw a trip to Taiwan as a chance to lionize herself. In fact, these considerations are almost certainly at the forefront of Pelosi’s motivation.

This becomes even more likely when one considers that President Biden was initially not too fond of the idea. Given his atrocious approval rating, it definitely doesn’t hurt Pelosi to move against his wishes.

Anyway, answering this question would require getting inside Pelosi’s head, and that seems like it might be a confusing place to wind up. But the fact remains, she did make the trip, and regardless of her individual intent, it does signal to both our allies and enemies in the region.

Since the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, Washington has practiced strategic ambiguity. While it refuses to commit to Taiwan’s defense in the event of a Chinese invasion, it also has left that option in play. The goal, of course, is to deter Beijing while also discouraging Taipei from formally declaring independence, which would almost certainly trigger immediate retaliation from China and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

While Biden’s national security spokesman John Kirby insisted that Pelosi’s trip was actually upholding the status quo, you’d be hard pressed to find anyone in Zhongnanhai that agrees. And the evidence in this case, as exemplified by the trip itself, leans in the direction of Beijing’s interpretation.

Pelosi’s trip included meetings with the foreign ministry, leaders in the semiconductor industry, and a press conference with Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen.

The joint press conference was filled with political speak regarding economic exchange and budding relationships, very par-for-the-course type of stuff. But in her opening remarks, Pelosi did, perhaps subconsciously, point out the contradiction in America’s Taiwan policy.

""Let's just put it in perspective. Four decades ago, the Taiwan Relations Act was built–in building a strong bond between our two countries: advancing our shared interests of governance, economy, and security, while respecting the ""One China"" policy. Our solidarity with you is more important than ever, as you defend Taiwan and their freedom.”

Well, which is it? Does America support the ""One China"" policy or Taiwan’s right to self-determination? Because those positions are increasingly mutually exclusive.

When Pelosi notes that American solidarity with Taiwan is more important than ever, she’s absolutely correct. But substantively, what is America doing to address this need?

For all the reasons this article has addressed already, coupled with CCP’s long-held belief that China’s rejuvenation will only be complete after the absorption of Taiwan, it’s imperative that the US change its strategy vis-a-vis Taiwan and East Asia in general.

As Elbridge Colby points out in his newest book, America’s top foreign policy goal should be preventing another state from gaining regional hegemony, most chiefly China in Asia. This is due to a combination of China’s power in comparison to other potential regional threats like Russia, as well as Asia’s overall importance. For instance, when it comes to global GDP, Asia’s share trumps that of Europe’s, and the gap is only growing.

In short, Colby’s well-substantiated claim is that once China achieves hegemony in Asia, it will have the ability to drastically manipulate the American way of life and potentially seek to project its domain across other regions.

While China is busy in a multitude of theaters in its attempt to achieve hegemony, the most important and crucial prize in Beijing’s eyes is Taiwan. A Chinese takeover of Taiwan, while not sufficient, is absolutely necessary to achieve this goal. Therefore, it’s imperative that America prevent this from happening.

While Speaker Pelosi’s trip is undoubtedly symbolic, it does nothing to actually address the systemic problems that are developing in the region.

What is required of Washington to protect Taiwan and deny China’s bid for hegemony goes far beyond official visits and political posturing. It requires concrete change in the way America conducts foreign policy.

Understanding then, that Asia is the most important theater in the world, it would behoove decision makers in Washington to make choices that reflect this reality. However, instead of consolidating more resources in the Pacific, the US is increasing its commitments to Ukraine and Europe.

At a June NATO summit in Madrid, Biden committed to the Ukraine effort for “as long as it takes,” and on Tuesday, John Kirby announced the US would send an additional $550 million in military aid to Kyiv. This brings the figure to more than $8 billion in total aid since Russia launched its invasion. The US has also increased its troop deployment in Europe to 100,000, up from 80,000 pre-invasion.

As admirable as the Ukrainians are and as noble as it might be to want to support their cause indefinitely, the truth is that these moves are counterproductive. They pull resources and focus that should be concentrated in Asia.

By effectively concentrating military resources in Asia, the US will signal to China that it is committed to the region and denying Beijing’s ambitions. In the same breath, Washington should also change its Taiwan policy, and officially discard any adherence to the ""One China"" policy.

Strategic ambiguity served a purpose for much of the Cold War era, and it was even understandable in the 1990s when there was at least a hope that China would reform and Westernize. However, with the Soviet threat long gone and the theory of a liberal China thoroughly dispelled, the ""One China"" policy serves no purpose. It merely handicaps potential cooperation between Taipei and Washington.

A continuing insistence on refusing to commit to the Asian theater, and the perpetuation of word games to appease Beijing will only lead to confusion and uncertainty in the Taiwan Strait and all of East Asia. This confusion will not reduce, but significantly increase the likelihood of conflict with an increasingly emboldened China.

America should take a note from China and develop a grand strategy focused on broad horizons, not merely political considerations of the day. The first step in doing so is realizing that Asia, and not Europe, will dominate the 21st century and China is the main threat to the order America has sacrificed so much to build.

By accepting this premise, one can’t reasonably argue defending Taiwan isn’t of paramount concern to the American people.

While Pelosi’s trip in itself doesn’t solve or even address these issues in a meaningful way, it does provide the opportunity for the US to seriously consider what its relationship with Taiwan should be and what its overall strategy should look like.

China has certainly taken note of the visit and responded in bombastic fashion.

Shortly after Pelosi departed Taipei en route to Seoul, China’s Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, tweeted, “The US is the provocateur, and China is the victim. The US side colluded with Taiwan and made provocations first, whereas China has been compelled to act in self-defense.”

And, the spokesman for the State Council’s Taiwan Affairs Office, Ma Xiaoguang, exclaimed that Tsai and her ruling party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) were “pushing the island into the abyss of disaster.”

The Chinese response hasn’t just been talk, either. According to the South China Morning Post, China announced starting Thursday it would begin live-fire drills in seven locations surrounding Taiwan’s coastline, effectively blockading the island.

Pelosi’s visit provides much-needed momentum and reflection for policymakers in Washington, and it mustn’t be squandered. There are only so many more opportunities for America to come to terms with its geopolitical reality. China already has, and the clock is ticking.

Roth: The Fed is going to #*$! it up,"On the back of the August CPI report, the hotter-than-expected headline inflation and core inflation (without food and gas) numbers are being perceived as bad news for Federal Reserve policymakers. While investor expectations for next week’s meeting were that the Fed would hike the target interest rate by 75 basis points (three-quarters of a percent), there were hopes that a more positive inflation report would give the Fed cover to raise its target rate only by 50 basis points (half a percent). Now, while the 75 basis-point hike is still the expectation, there is concern the Fed may raise by a full percent.



At issue is what that means for the broader economy. The hopes that the Fed could achieve what investors call a “soft landing” — bringing down inflation without tanking the economy in the process — were never realistic and now are broadly waning. Even Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who spins every bad piece of news (and also told us inflation was going to be “transitory” and not a problem), said in an interview this weekend, ""The Fed is going to need great skill and also some good luck to achieve what we sometimes call a soft landing.""

Well, it’s hard to say the Fed has a lot of skill. After years of artificially suppressing interest rates and loading up the balance sheet with trillions of dollars in assets, in March 2020 the Fed said it needed to take swift action to save the economy. Officials' ensuing actions instead helped to destroy the economy, including enabling historic inflation.

They also told us the “transitory” inflation lie, while refusing to stop their damaging policy. In fact, they didn’t officially reverse course until after inflation had reached a 40-year high. So depending on their skill is like depending on me not to eat a slice of pizza if it is in front of me — that is, not a high dependability rate.

The luck factor isn’t on their side, either. The Fed’s tool kit of increasing the interest rates and reducing the balance sheet (if officials ever get around to the latter) are demand-side tools. They are meant to quell consumer purchasing, reduce business investment, and slow down the economy. However, we have massive undersupply broadly throughout the economy: an undersupply of workers, food, energy, housing, and other commodities. The Fed can “print” money, but it can’t print people, food, or oil. So the only way officials can slow things down is by substantially slowing economic activity.

We already have had two quarters of negative real GDP, so aggressively trying to slow things further isn’t the luck a soft landing needs. Add on to that the global recessionary pressure, from those self-inflicted energy issues in Europe to the real estate bubble popping and other issues in China, and the macro backdrop doesn’t present as very “lucky” for the economy, either.

The Fed, along with its government cronies, has made a deliberate mess of the economy. Don’t count on skill and luck to fix it any time soon.",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/pelosi-taiwan-means-for-america,2022-09-14
Horowitz: States must revisit the Commerce Clause to combat the feds' controlled demolition of the economy,"If the Biden administration appears apathetic to the crushing price of fuel, it’s actually because it relishes this an opportunity for fundamental transformation. As Biden said during one of the presidential debates, he would ensure there is “no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period.” Thus, the reason Biden has refused to improve on drilling, refining capabilities, and transportation of fuel throughout the country is because he doesn’t believe in fossil fuels. High costs are a feature of, not a bug in his plan.



If you remember, the one action taken by the administration to ""combat"" rising gas prices was to release fuel from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). 30 million barrels were released on March 1, and on March 31, the White House announced the release of 180 million barrels beginning in April and lasting through September. So far, there is no evidence it has changed the trajectory of the price of fuel, and Biden knows this. Below is a chart from Gas Buddy with a red line marking the date of the second SPR release announcement.

As you can see, the SPR release was a complete bust, as gas prices hit $5 nationwide for the first time. Diesel prices are approaching $6 a gallon, and this is exploding the costs of pretty much every good and service imaginable.

So, what is the long-term plan? As Biden promised, no more oil. In the ultimate “let them eat cake moment,” Michigan Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow bragged during a hearing about how she passed ""every single gas station"" in her brand new electric vehicle on the way to D.C., ""and it didn't matter how high [gas] was.""

You see, they expect everyone to be able to afford a $56,000 vehicle and the inevitable massive spikes in the cost of electric vehicle batteries. And knowing that most people can’t afford one, along with the record cost of food and homes, they will be forced into mass transit and will lose the great American freedom of automobile and home ownership. This is why Democrats, unlike during any other era where lawmakers from an incumbent party were facing an economic collapse of this magnitude on their watch, don’t seem to be too concerned. Sure, they might lose the midterms, but they are thinking long-term, and they realize Republicans don’t have what it takes to change the regulatory structure of our food and fuel supply on their own by forcing their leverage through federal budgets and through state’s rebelling against the federal malfeasance.









What we have occurring in this country for the first time is a controlled demolition. This is not a situation in which both sides genuinely care about the plight of the common man but simply disagree over the means of redress. We have an entire governing class that wants to make basic goods and services so prohibitively costly that no American can live in dignity independent of government control. Biden has even referred to the crisis as “an incredible transition,” that he hoped would, “god willing,” make us less “reliant” on fossil fuels.

Remember, we still to this day don’t know where COVID came from, but it is quite clear it was not natural. It is also quite evident that the powers that be were awfully prepared for its emergence with an unprecedented and cataclysmic response. Now, we suddenly face numerous other crises that just happen to destroy the ability of Americans to live independently. Whether it’s our government perpetuating the Ukrainian war without an end-game as it causes supply chain shortages, the avian-flu that forced the slaughter of millions of chickens and turkeys at a time when the price of chicken was already at record highs, or the sudden rash of fires on large farms and agro-processing centers, somehow every world event seems to exacerbate the unprecedented fallout from the previous event – all negatively affecting consumers on the most vital products. Then there is the baby formula recall, the peanut butter recall, and the chocolate recall. What is going on here?

While we can’t yet prove who or what is responsible for all of these unprecedented events that affect our bodies, health, food, fuel, and ability to live the American dream more than at any time in our lifetime, it is quite evident that if the federal government is not behind it, they certainly don’t seem too concerned with ascertaining who is and properly redressing it.

This is the uncomfortable discussion red state governors must commence in the coming days. What do you do when the federal government not only vitiates the Constitution, but purposely works against the interests of its own citizens – up to and including inducing waves of millions of invaders at our border?

The Constitution is not a suicide pact. The country was formed by states and they ceded some authority to the federal government through interstate commerce to “establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty.” If the federal government is engaged in a controlled demolition of our way of life, states have an obligation to collaborate and interpose the tyranny and destruction.

Even though the federal government regulates interstate commerce, states should look at forming pacts to more easily skirt federal regulations concerning the transportation and flow of fuel, construction of refineries, production of coal, and use of lands for exploration and drilling. We will also need new food regulations as well. While certainly we have a national and international economy that will inevitably affect the price of food and fuel, states should warn the feds that they will act if our overlords in Washington continue to ignore the plight of the American people.

We are already the world’s largest producer and exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG), and we have enough to supply the world for 100 years at the 2020 rate of production. Yet it is worthless without more pipelines to deliver the gas domestically and export terminals to get the gas to the Russian-dependent Europeans. These pipelines have been regulated to death by the feds and in the blue states. We still can’t benefit from the enormous reserves in the Marcellus and Utica shale deposits in Appalachia. Now, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has added greenhouse gas emissions as part of its assessment to approve gas pipelines and export terminals. It has also banned transporting LNG via railways.

As such, states should work together to formulate a plan to get around the de facto embargo on our God-given resources. As time goes on, states will need to interpose tyrannical regulations as they relate to health emergencies, natural resources, the agriculture industry, the use of land, and the regulation of the financial sector as it relates to environmental, social, or governance standards. The Constitution is not a suicide pact that only must be followed by one party where the feds can flood the states with illegal aliens while crushing Americans, but states must uphold their side of the bargain ceding interstate commerce power.

Perfectly embodying the view of the Biden regime, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre commented that ""the economy is in a better place than it has been historically.""

She is right. For people of her ilk who benefit from the controlled demolition of America as we know it and are outside the area of impact, it is a great time to be alive, perhaps better than ever. But who is going to represent the other 99%?",https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/roth-fed-is-going-to-it-up,2022-06-08
Here's what's REALLY responsible for drag queen events for kids,"In this episode of ""Fearless,"" Jason Whitlock and Shemeka Michelle discussed the topic of grooming and who is responsible for weaponizing sex and forcing it upon kids.

Whitlock explained how he was recently met with a perplexing question on Twitter about the difference between a cheerleader twerking on the sidelines at an NFL game and a drag queen dancing at a bar.

Without hesitation, Shemeka embraced her hypocrisy and refused to accept Jason's line of thinking. Instead, she redirected her focus to her childhood. She recalled how her mother used to cover her eyes and shield Shemeka from seeing inappropriate images or adult behavior unfit for children. Shemeka's story raised a broader question. When did parents stop censoring their children from adult behavior?

Perhaps our ""do as you please"" and Godless culture has desensitized society and paved the way for this emboldened grooming mentality that harms children?

"Kyrie Irving SUSPENDED after brutal DUNKING from Shaq, Charles Barkley","On Thursday evening, the Brooklyn Nets suspended Kyrie Irving without pay for a minimum of five games after the NBA star refused, for the second time, to apologize for a tweet that many saw as a form of anti-Semitic hate speech.

Irving posted a link to the 2018 movie ""Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America,” last week, then twice refused to ""unequivocally say he has no antisemitic beliefs,"" according to a Thursday night statement from the Nets.

""We were dismayed today, when given an opportunity in a media session, that Kyrie refused to unequivocally say he has no antisemitic beliefs, nor acknowledge specific hateful material in the film. This was not the first time he had the opportunity — but failed — to clarify,"" the statement read.

""Such failure to disavow antisemitism when given a clear opportunity to do so is deeply disturbing, is against the values of our organization, and constitutes conduct detrimental to the team. Accordingly, we are of the view that he is currently unfit to be associated with the Brooklyn Nets.""

Just hours after the Nets announced his suspension, Irving apologized in an Instagram post.

""To All Jewish families and Communities that are hurt and affected from my post, I am deeply sorry to have caused you pain, and I apologize,"" Irving wrote.





On a recent episode of ""Fearless,"" BlazeTV host Jason Whitlock said he believes Irving has been unfairly vilified and demonized over a ""sentence-less"" tweet about ""a documentary that no one is watching."" He compared Irving's tweet to HBO host Bill Maher's ""anti-Christian"" documentary “Religulous,” pointing out that no one called for HBO or corporations to discipline Maher.

""Fourteen years ago, you could write and star in a documentary with the expressed intention to offend, mock, and challenge conventional wisdom without people demanding that you lose your job,"" Whitlock stated.

Tuesday on “Inside the NBA,” Charles Barkley called for Irving's suspension, saying the “NBA dropped the ball” and ""I can't believe we're talking about this idiot.""

Shaquille O’Neal also called Irving an ""idiot.""

Whitlock, however, suggested there just might be another reason why Barkley and Shaq were really so outraged about Kyrie’s off-hours musings that they called for the NBA to suspend him.

""One tweet about a documentary no one is watching sparked this much outrage? I don’t think so,"" he said.

Unsolved mysteries: 7 Deep-State SECRETS Biden wants buried,"The Biden administration has weaponized the federal government against the American people. But officials have hidden most of their attacks behind a secretive and cavernous bureaucracy.

Glenn Beck's 'out of this world' auction win would make even Elon Musk jealous,"Today, we have satellites helping us do everything from watching TV to navigating to the grocery store. But back in 1957, Americans were sent into a panic because there was only one satellite in space — and it wasn't ours. The Sputnik satellite marked the beginning of the space race and, in many ways, the modern era. Four Sputniks were made: One burned up in our atmosphere, one is in Russia, one is in the Smithsonian, and one recently came up for auction ... and just guess who bought it.

Thanks to Heritage Auctions, Glenn Beck had the chance to go behind the scenes to get an exclusive look at all kinds of incredible items going up for a high-stakes auction. The auction was mostly themed around the JFK era and the space race, but there’s something for everybody — ""Game of Thrones"" fans, space nerds, U.S. presidency buffs, Texas die-hards, and more.

In the video below, Glenn takes a look at the speech inside Teddy Roosevelt’s jacket pocket that saved his life — complete with bullet hole and blood. The typewriter of John F. Kennedy’s secretary, a secret hotline phone likely used to dial Marilyn Monroe, JFK’s bloodstained limo seat, and the TV news camera that captured Lee Harvey Oswald’s death live. And, of course, the satellite that helped spark the U.S.-Soviet Union space race.

With each artifact, you’ll learn a new story. Which White House employee warned JFK not to go to Dallas? Which president refused to wear hats? And what does Nikola Tesla have to do with the U.S.-Soviet Union space race? It’s history like you’ve never seen it before.

American children are a primary target of far-Left indoctrination,"We are surrounded by chaos. When children are assaulting police officers, something is very much broken in society. This chaos is spillover from the BLM riots in 2020 that were allowed to run rampant. The legacy of those riots is skyrocketing violence, rampant crime, and an insane George Soros-led crusade against enforcing laws.

On ""Glenn TV"" Wednesday, Glenn Beck says another aspect of America’s chaos is driven by the active campaign to destroy the traditional family and Judeo-Christian morality. This campaign is most obvious in the gender and sexuality confusion raging across America. It’s a campaign fully endorsed and promoted by the Biden administration.

The fact that American children are a primary target of this indoctrination is disgusting evidence of a dying culture. All this chaos is the Marxist playbook in action – destabilization to usher in a new system. Glenn reveals the decades of painstaking work by devoted Marxists to organize and indoctrinate. As of now, their plan is working. Will law-abiding and God-fearing Americans refuse the planned takeover?

Jeff Younger speaks out to save son James,"A judge has banned Texas father Jeff Younger from speaking about his son, James, who was taken from him by our courts after he refused to call his son a girl. But Jeff said he'd rather go to jail than comply: ""I'll appear in handcuffs ... but I'm not taking this tyranny.""

Jeff joined Glenn Beck on ""Targets of Tyranny"" to tell James' story and explain the biggest lessons he's learned while battling our legal system.

""This interview is illegal in the state of Texas,"" Jeff told Glenn. ""I was banned from publishing any blog posts, social media post, publishing a newspaper article, doing any writing at all about my situation. I was also permanently banned from doing interviews, doing podcasts, appearing on television interviews, and these are all specifically laid out,"" he explained.

""I was also banned from speaking on three political topics. I'm not allowed to talk about anything about transgender issues, gender expansiveness, or whether my son is a boy or a girl. And I have told this judge — and I tell this judge every time I do an interview — I will never follow your illegal and unconstitutional order. I have contempt for her as a judge issuing the order. I have maximum contempt for the tyrannical language of the order, and I will never follow the order,"" Jeff continued.

""I'm guilty of maximum criminal contempt in the 301st District Court of the state of Texas, and [the judge] is obligated to put me in jail for the maximum sentence, which is 180 days in the jail in Dallas County. Four days later, I'll be in the jail library with the writ of habeas corpus that I've already prepared. We will go to the 5th District, and we will see who's right. I'll appear in handcuffs, her in the judge's robe, but I'm not taking this tyranny. And I'm not going to stop speaking out about my son.""

President Joe Biden’s mental fitness,"Joe Biden is the oldest man ever to be inaugurated as president. When he was sworn in, he was older than Ronald Reagan was when Reagan LEFT office. Throughout his political career, Biden has always been known for his verbal gaffes. But repeated “gaffes” are a lot more concerning when coming from the president of the United States. They can no longer be laughed off as “silly Uncle Joe” antics. As we saw from Biden’s speech in Poland, the president misspeaking in a moment of international crisis is a serious, and potentially deadly, problem.

It’s clear to anyone paying attention that the Democrat machine shielded him from the public as much as possible while he was running for president in 2020, and that has largely continued in the White House. With America and the world on edge, it’s fair to question Biden’s cognitive health. His decline and struggles are plain to see, yet Democrats and Big Media refuse to ask the uncomfortable, legitimate questions about his fitness for office. Americans deserve to know whether their president is mentally up to the job, but should we consider invoking the 25th Amendment to protect the country?

On ""Glenn TV"" Wednesday, Constitutional expert and Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, who shut down Democrat demands to remove Trump from office, joins Glenn Beck to outline the very high litmus test for invoking the 25th Amendment: “It was designed so a president isn’t ousted in a partisan, adversarial manner.”

THIS is how conservatives stop LOSING in 2023,"We're only four days into the new year, and the Republican Party is not off to a good start. House Republicans have now held six votes for the speakership position with no clear winner selected. But with party leadership — like House speaker frontrunner Kevin McCarthy — refusing to stray from the status quo, this inter-party turmoil may be what’s ultimately needed for America.

This week, during his ""GlennTV"" Wednesday Night Special, Glenn Beck is joined by Daniel Horowitz, Blaze Media senior editor, and Harmeet Dhillon, who is currently challenging Ronna McDaniel for leadership of the RNC. The three explore what’s next for the GOP, what conservative Congress members’ end goal should be regarding the House speaker vote, and how Republicans can begin to regain trust with the American voter. Because without regaining that trust, Dhillon explains, ""We’re done as a party. And that’s terrible for America.""

Fed Up Yankee Stadium worker sues NYC Mayor over COVID tyranny,"Virginia Alleyne worked as a waitress at Yankee Stadium for 17 years until she was placed on unpaid leave due to her non-compliance with the New York City COVID-19 vaccination mandate — the same mandate NYC Mayor Eric Adams recently exempted athletes and performers from, leaving behind the rest of the city’s workers with his astounding hypocrisy on full display.

“Being healthy is not just about being physically healthy, but being economically healthy,” Adams said at Citi Field last month where he announced the signing of his exemption order.

This last move by the mayor to allow the wealthy and famous to earn a living while completely ignoring workers like herself was the final injustice for Alleyne, who took action by filing a lawsuit. “For him to allow millionaires to work and to punish the workers who are the lifeblood of this city is just horrendous,” Alleyne explained in the New York Post.

Glenn Beck invited Alleyne to “Glenn TV” to get the full scope of her story, including her lawsuit. She explained to Glenn that she refrained from getting vaccinated because of religious reasons and filed a religious exemption with her employers at Yankee Stadium. Her employers, however, refused to allow her to continue waitressing in the Legends Suite Club, where she held seniority.

“I’ve been working for the Yankees for 17 years, so it is atrocious,” Alleyne told Glenn. “I know Mayor Adams inherited the situation, but the first thing he should have done is repeal the mandates. Let’s get people back to work, let’s get the city back.”

Alleyne described New York City like “the wild wild West,” noting how excruciatingly dangerous the city has grown alongside the increase in the homeless population she fears she’s on the brink of joining herself. Keeping her spirit alive to fight the good fight are her faith and her 15-year-old autistic son.



Alleyne added that she’s doing this for the others like her who have been kicked to the curb by the city. “This is for the nurses, who are on the front line. The police, the firefighters, the stadium workers, the servers, the security guards. … I’m fighting for everyone who was fired unjustly for these draconian mandates.”

Watch Glenn Beck's full interview with Virginia Alleyne below to get the full story.

Left's rabid war on babies threatens collapse of Supreme Court,"The attack on our culture continues as we watch the firestorm rage over a leaked Supreme Court draft decision that could overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade case.

Politico — a left-wing website set up by a former Washington Post reporter and a mostly left-wing operation in Washington DC — ran the story that caused an explosion of speculation from armchair constitutional ""experts.""

In this clip, Mark takes you inside the unprecedented leak of a confidential Supreme Court document regarding Roe v. Wade and illustrates how it threatens to permanently cripple the Supreme Court. In the battle for the unborn, the left has stooped to a new low.

The leaker is likely someone who wants the Supreme Court's authority to be an election issue in November, but Mark says ""there's a bigger picture here.""

Remember when the New York Post ran the Hunter Biden story just before the 2020 election? Where was Politico's coverage there? The media dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop story and had dozens of intelligence officials dismiss the story as ""Russian disinformation.""

Why was the Biden laptop story dismissed? Mark speculated that the media likely covered up for Joe Biden by refusing to report accurately and substantively on Hunter's laptop. Instead, Politico attacked the New York Post, Fox News, and conservative talk radio hosts for reporting the story.

""Politico did everything it could to cover it up and censor it. Then, this leak happens, and Politico didn't censor it at all,"" Mark said.

Wimpy WaPo journalist ROASTED for confusing doxxing with journalism,"The left-wing mafia dares common sense voices to speak out and be heard. This group of thin-skinned, principle-less freaks is nothing, if not hypocrites, willing to go to great lengths to push their illogical agenda on the masses. The left refuses to live in reality because they cannot function in an environment that makes them feel uncomfortable. And so, they go out of their way to make everyone else feel uncomfortable so they can feel in control of their pointless existence.

So, when professional useless person and Washington Post journalist Taylor Lorenz doxes a person who makes her uncomfortable, we get the opportunity to point out what is wrong with her. Lorenz, a self-proclaimed smear campaign ""victim,"" gets roasted by Steven Crowder after she doxed the Libs of Tik Tok account. Lorenzo has built her career by sifting through social media posts, looking for anything she can twist into a racist, sexist, homophobic thought she can market as a career-ending attack on her people.

Crowder takes a hard stance in defense of Libs of Tik Tok after Lorenzo accused the account of leaning hard into groomer discourse. Lorenzo's accusation is ridiculous, considering the Libs of Tik Tok account posts unedited videos from left-wing individuals without any spin. Lorenzo's perma-victim mentality renders her a victim of the same views and beliefs she claims to hold.

In this video, Crowder shares insight from his own experience with being the target of leftwing cancel culture. Watch the clip for Crowder's breakdown of the problem and how to fix it.

Trans inmate who was moved after impregnating 2 women is not happy with new prison,"A transgender inmate has been moved to a new facility after impregnating two women while incarcerated at a New Jersey women’s prison, according to a local report.

Demi Minor, who is serving a 30-year sentence for manslaughter, was transferred from Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women to a prison for young adults last month after two women in the facility became pregnant from “consensual sexual relationships with another incarcerated person,” according to the DOC’s external affairs executive director Dan Sperrazza.

Minor was one of at least 27 prisoners who identify as transgender housed at the women only prison before being transferred to the Garden State Youth Correctional Facility — and she's not happy at all about the ""psychological damage"" caused by the move.

On the Justice 4 Demi website, Demi wrote about her terrible experience of ""being forced to live in a male prison"" where she ""was called he and him well over 30 times.""

""This is the hell that NJDOC wants to put me through, this is my punishment for what occurs over 2 months ago, they have violated my right to be safe and free from sexual harassment,"" Demi complained. ""While living here at GYSC, I have found my self under attack by young inmates who are immature and just plain ignorant towards a person like me. On Saturday I was in medication line when a inmate cut in front of me, and said “I am not standing behind no fag” the inmate than spit directly in my direction, I came back and washed my clothing’s knowing deep down, that I can not and will not live like this!! I don’t think DOC realizes the psychological damage that has been done from moving me out of a womens prison to a male facility, its harsh and, I don’t know what its like to live as a man, and In refuse to ever revert back to such habits or behavior.""

Demi said she was placed on suicide watch “due to the fact that [she] had hung [herself] in the van” but ""was placed in a dark cell within Detention housing, as inmates who are on watch are placed in the detention unit and not the infirmary!""

She also claimed guards denied her request to be strip-searched by a female officer, saying “everyone here is man including you.”

""The fact that this prison does not have air [conditioning], does not have cable, does not allow video visits, does not have an[y] LGBT groups is mind blowing, yet they said that I am here for safety no please understand that I am here for punishment, just the sad part is this punishment may kill me. Mentally I have not been myself and I am losing my essence. The Demi, who wants to wear make-up and hangout with her friends is not permitted here. They have said that I can have my make-up but the truth is we know its a death wish, its literally going to cause more harassment,"" Demi wrote.

A lot of people reacted to Demi's story with what might have been considered rationality or common sense just a few years ago:





But these days, we seem to live in a society that is devoid of common sense. Case in point, just last week Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) was accused of inciting violence against transgender people because he doesn't think men can get pregnant.





Lib Professor Has MELTDOWN When Hawley Asks If Men Can Get Pregnant youtu.be





Also, transgender swimmer Lia Thomas was nominated for the 2022 NCAA Woman of the Year award. Singer Macy Gray apologized to the outrage mob for daring to define a woman during an interview with Piers Morgan. And BlazeTV's Dave Rubin of ""The Rubin Report"" was suspended from Twitter after tweeting about Dr. Jordan Peterson's suspension from Twitter for using transgender actor Elliot Page's former name: Ellen Page.

Oh, and apparently teachers are now coming out as trans to their students, some as young as pre-school age, because providing this information will really help with the child's learning experience — right?

Allie Beth Stuckey heroicly protests like AOC,"BlazeTV's Allie Beth Stuckey, a hero, was ""violently arrested"" (not really) for protesting low-rise jeans on Wednesday, just one day after the brave and stunning Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York was handcuffed (also not really) as she was escorted from a pro-abortion protest at the U.S. Capitol.

On Tuesday, Capitol police arrested several Democratic lawmakers for refusing to comply with law enforcement orders to stop obstructing traffic outside the Supreme Court. Video of actresses Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) being led away peacefully but holding their hands behind their backs as if handcuffed (except when AOC raised her fist for a shackle-free communist salute) went viral.

'You are obligated to follow God's truth': A powerful message for Christian teachers in public schools,"On a recent episode of ""Relatable,"" BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey had a powerful message for Christian teachers who are working in public schools.

""I am so thankful for Christian teachers who are in public schools,"" Allie began. ""I say that a lot, and still sometimes I get messages saying that I have like demonized public school teachers, which is not true at all.""

""You are light in the darkness. Unfortunately, you are kind of bound to the curriculum that you have to teach. You are kind of bound to the secular anti-God worldview of public education, which is anti-Christian by law. So, that is difficult, but it doesn't mean that you can't make a difference,"" she added.

Allie encouraged Christian teachers to always show students kindness — because ""you might be the only source of kindness and stability that some of these kids ever see"" — and to be a source of truth no matter how difficult that might become.

""You are bound to something that's higher than your curriculum, that's higher than the school board, that's higher than your administration, that's higher than the teachers' unions — and that is to the law of God,"" Allie stated.

""You are obligated to follow God's truth first and foremost. And so, that means that if you are told that you have to teach that there is no God, if you have to teach that America has exclusively been a place of oppression — that white kids are oppressors because of their skin color, black and brown kids are oppressed because of their skin color — if you have to teach that girls can be boys and boys can be girls, you are obligated not to do that. And I understand that there is risk that comes with that. There's a cost that comes with that. That it's easier said than done. Absolutely. But that is the cost of being a Christian in an anti-Christian world,"" she continued.

""The least that we can do, and have to do, as Christians is not to lie in a culture that is so inundated with and characterized by lies. So, you be a beacon of truth in every possible way that you can, and I promise God will use you to glorify him. And that's what we're all trying to do.""

Unvaccinated child denied lifesaving care,"Doctors at Duke University Hospital in Durham, North Carolina, have refused a teenage girl from Ukraine a kidney transplant because she's not vaccinated against COVID-19, say her adoptive parents.

Lee and Chrissy Hicks, the adoptive parents of 14-year-old Yulia, joined BlazeTV host Allie Beth Stuckey on ""Relatable"" this week to explain how doctors have refused to move forward with the kidney transplant their daughter desperately needs.

""Chrissy and Lee are Christians. They're an Army family. They adopted Yulia and her brother from Ukraine early last year and love her as their own flesh and blood. And they are begging for help for their daughter,"" Allie began. ""Yulia ... has a genetic kidney disorder. She needs surgery, and the hospital is saying she cannot get this surgery without getting the COVID vaccine.""

""The hospital actually played semantics with us,"" Lee explained. ""When we probed them on the requirement to have the vaccine shot, they said it's not a requirement. It's actually a recommendation. But if you don't follow their 'recommendation,' then [Yulia] won't get the kidney transplant. So that makes it a requirement.""



The Hickses — who have eight biological children and three adopted children — knew that Yulia suffered from a rare kidney disorder that would eventually require a transplant when they adopted her in 2021.



""We took [Yulia] to Duke immediately because we didn't know how long it had been since she had been seen,"" Chrissy said. ""She needed to go on dialysis basically immediately. Her kidneys, I think, were at 13% function or something when we got her.""

Chrissy explained that Yulia started dialysis at home in August 2021 and that most of her care is done at home. She also noted that Yulia has had the coronavirus, which she was ""completely, 100% over"" in less than 24 hours, but that when she and her husband asked to have their daughter's natural antibody level tested, they were ""shut down.""

The couple explained that doctors at the hospital dismissed their questions and concerns about the COVID vaccine.

""[Doctors] were almost draconian about the whole thing ... basically, what they said [was] 'if you're not going to follow our recommendation, then you're not gonna get a kidney,'"" Lee said.

""This child ... her and her brother have been through so much lately, in the last few years. I mean, a family adopted them in 2018, and that didn't work out. After about a year, they sent the boy back to Ukraine to just go away. And then they sent [Yulia] to Arizona to another family to kind of go away. And then, that family kept her for about four months and sent her back, after they got her brother back, after about a month,"" he continued.

""So then we got a phone call ... from someone who knew we were close to Raleigh, and they said, 'Hey, can you go pick these two up because they're going to be arriving in about three hours and no one's going to come to get them except for the police.' So, sure, I said absolutely, we'll go get them. And so we did,"" Lee explained. ""We were just going to keep them for the weekend to try to figure out what was going to happen. We rearranged our lives a little bit to kind of help rectify the situation that [the children] were in. Then we, of course, adopted them without hesitation, really, because we just said, 'Hey, this is what God wants us to do.' And now we're at this point of getting a kidney because she needs it, and these doctors are saying no because you won't get this vaccine, which has been known to hurt children.""

A GiveSendGo fundraiser has been set up to help Yulia's family with expenses associated with out-of-state medical care and transplant surgery.

Woke company tells white employees to sign INSANELY racist 'contract' — one refuses and pays the price,"Attorney Nicole Levitt loves her job — representing victims of domestic violence. But she started to notice a change after the horrific killing of George Floyd: The agency she works for started embracing an anti-racist ""ideology"" that didn't tolerate dissent. Eventually, she was asked to sign a contract that included the statement, ""All white people are racist and I am not the exception."" Instead, she knew someone had to speak out — and it would have to be her.

Levitt joined Glenn Beck on the radio program to explain why she decided to take a stand, whether she regrets doing so, and what may be coming next.



""At first everyone did unite around what happened to George Floyd. It was horrible, and I don't think any thinking, feeling person could see that and not be moved against it,"" Levitt began. ""The problem came when that empathy was hijacked for what I'd say was an ideological cause. It got to the point where if you didn't agree with that ideology, if you dissented one step away from it, then you were an outcast.""

Levitt explained how her company separated staff into ""affinity groups"" according to skin color, which she found ""so regressive and so offensive"" that she eventually said she could no longer participate.

""The language that I heard used against white people mirrored what was said against Jews in the 1930s, and I wholeheartedly reject that kind of dehumanizing language against any race or any group. And anyone with a sense of history can tell you that things don't go well when that happens,"" stated Levitt, who is Jewish.

""As an agency, we were bombarded with messages of anti-racism. We were asked to attend a lot of different trainings and read a lot of different materials on like the [Ibram X.] Kendian sense of anti-racism,"" she explained.

After telling the company she could no longer attend the ""white affinity group meetings,"" Levitt was asked to agree to a ""Full Value Contract."" She said most of this contract was ""fine"" until she came to the fifth line.

""Number five said 'own that all white people are racist and I am not the exception,'"" she told Glenn. ""I immediately objected to that. ... I'm not going to pretend to agree with it, it's just not possible.""

Levitt was eventually told she had to attend a meeting with a DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) consultant, the purpose of which was to assess if she was ""safe to be around your black and brown colleagues and clients.""

""This is really about dividing us,"" Glenn asserted. ""This is about control, power, politics, money. It's not actually about bringing people together and seeing beyond race.""

""This kind of division is not going to serve us as an organization, and it's not going to serve us as a country. And someone had to be willing to stand up and say 'no.' And right now, that's me,"" Levitt added. ""It's not the position I wanted to find myself in, believe me. But it's the position I'm in, and I'm committed to it.""

""I've learned that it's worth it to stand up for your ideals, but that you will pay the price,"" she wrote in Newsweek. ""I think you're going to pay a bigger price if you don't do it, in terms of your integrity.""

"Biden blames high prices on COVID, Putin, no ... gas companies","The Biden administration has been accusing oil producers of refusing to expand operations to help offset skyrocketing gas prices. On Wednesday, President Joe Biden even wrote a letter to seven major U.S. oil refiners, essentially saying that the administration is prepared to use emergency orders to force companies into compliance if their ""greed"" just doesn't stop.

""Your companies need to work with my Administration to bring forward concrete, near-term solutions that address the crisis,” Biden wrote. The letter went on to accuse refineries of capitalizing on the war between Russia and Ukraine, gleaning record-high profits while Americans suffer record-high pain at the pump.

But no matter how he tries to convince you otherwise, President Joe Biden isn't trying to bring down gas prices. In fact, he's doing just the opposite, Glenn Beck said on the radio program Thursday.

""Why aren't the oil companies putting more oil out? Well, they're a couple of reasons. And none of those have to do with Joe Biden. None of them, even though it was Joe Biden that said, when he was running [for president] that he was going to put oil out of business.""

Glenn first played a clip of then-candidate Biden saying, ""No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period.""

The next clip had White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre shifting the blame for high gas prices from Russia's war with Ukraine to U.S. oil refineries.

""We want you to act. It's time to act,"" Jean-Pierre said, addressing U.S. oil companies. ""We have done our part, with the strategic oil reserve. We are calling on them to do the right thing, to be patriots here. And to not use the war as an excuse or as a reason to not put -- to not put out a production, to not do the capacity that is needed there.""

A third clip showed Biden’s climate envoy John Kerry saying in no uncertain terms that the U.S. “absolutely"" does not need to drill for more oil and gas, during a talk with the USC Center for Public Diplomacy

The Biden administration has made it clear that insanely high gas prices are all part of the plan to eliminate fossil fuels. But the problem doesn't stop there. The ESG war against oil industries is being waged across the world.

Glenn read an op-ed from Vivek Ramaswamy that explains how BlackRock is manipulating corporations like Exxon to decrease oil production, while Americans continue to suffer majorly at the pump.

Why this attack PROVES the left's losing the abortion debate,"A pro-life pregnancy center in Buffalo, New York, that was ""fire-bombed"" last week became just the latest of many increasingly violent incidents and threats against the anti-abortion movement ahead of the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade. But, as CompassCare president Jim Harden said on ""The Glenn Beck Program,"" a strike like this may be proof the far-left is fully aware that the pro-life movement is working.

""Glass was broken and fires lit because we do not comply with the ruling elites' position that we should be referring and providing for abortion,"" Harden told Glenn.

""Women do not feel like they have a choice when they're facing an unplanned pregnancy. They feel stuck, trapped like they've got no choice, like they need to have an abortion. What we do is erase the need for abortion by transforming a woman's fear into confidence with ethical medical care and comprehensive community support throughout the pregnancy and beyond. So, [the activists] targeted women that night,"" he continued.

Harden added that CompassCare, which continued to operate in an undisclosed location following the attack, provides all medical care and comprehensive community support ""for free,"" and compared his organization with certain so-called women's health centers that provide only ""what they get paid for, and that's abortion.""

He went on to call out political leaders, namely, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-N.Y.) for refusing to denounce violence against pro-life pregnancy centers.



""They're refusing to say, 'Hey this is wrong. Violence is wrong everywhere, all the time.' This is not how you solve problems and their silence can only be interpreted as complicity,"" Harden asserted. ""It's emboldening these terrorists.""

Photos posted online showed the damage at the CompassCare office, with broken windows, fire and smoke damage, and graffiti that reads, ""Jane was here,"" which Harden explained is a reference to the ""terrorist organization Jane’s Revenge.""



Glenn credited Harden with coming up with ""the first measurable and repeatable medical model in the pregnancy center movement, which has helped hundreds of centers nationwide become more effective at reaching more women and saving more babies from abortion.""

""There's a reason that ... the Buffalo office was the one that was hit [by activists],"" Glenn noted.

""We have a national strategy and our strategy is working, and that's why we've been attacked,"" Harden said ""We know that the abortion battle lines are shifting, and the abortion industry is scrambling. And the reason why they attacked us is because, what we're doing to reduce abortion is working.""

FBI whistleblower calls out 'UNUSUAL' Jan. 6 investigations — and pays the price,"FBI whistleblower Steve Friend exposed the FBI for its handling of the investigation into the January 6 riot — and paid the price. Friend joined ""The Glenn Beck Program"" to describe the series of events that eventually led him not only to leave the FBI, but to speak out against potential abuses within the department as well. The crux of his story began with cases concerning the January 6, 2021, riot and one arrest warrant that he refused to take part in.





Friend also joined Glenn on his ""Targets of Tyranny"" special to explain why he believed the January 6 cases were run by Washington, D.C., and how the agency's handling of the ""J6"" investigations has been so ""unusual"" that he says he's ""never"" seen anything even close to this before.

New details emerge about Trump raid — and 'it doesn't look good for the FBI',"New, alleged details about the raid of former President Donald Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago hint that it's ""not looking good for the FBI,"" said BlazeTV host Glenn Beck on the radio program Thursday.

Trump has faced attacks from every direction, but despite all of it, he has ""not been found guilty or had any kind of real, solid evidence against him,"" Glenn pointed out.

Glenn detailed a long list of investigations, accusations, and lawsuits against Trump, and the latest puzzling revelations about the FBI's raid of Mar-a-Lago, which only seem to raise even more questions. For example, did agents truly refuse to give Trump's lawyer a copy of the warrant upon arriving at the home? Because sources have alleged that his attorney was kept ""10 feet away from the warrant"" and was not allowed to actually read it. If that's true, then it was absolutely against the law.

Then there was the inordinate amount of time spent going through Melania Trump's closet. And did they have the proper authority to break into Trump's safe?

""That warrant had better damn well say that they can break into that safe because the law is, you can't go into somebody's house and ... just tear it all apart,"" Glenn said. ""You have to have a pretty good idea of where things might be located, and you ask for permission for those areas. And you have to know exactly what you're looking for, and if it's in a safe, you need to specifically say, 'it's in a safe and we're having a safe cracker come in.' If they didn't say in the warrant that they could crack his safe, it's the fruit of the poisoned tree. By the way, there was nothing in the safe.""

Glenn also explained that the FBI broke into a specific ""safe room"" that contained national archives, which Trump was allegedly told by investigators to keep in a locked room.

""[Trump] made a safe room, and put two locks on it, at their request. And that's what they broke into,"" Glenn said. ""This doesn't look good for the FBI,"" he added.

Prof who called Hawley 'transphobic' refuses to talk about babies in abortion hearing,"A heated debate during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on abortion has gone viral after Berkeley Law Professor Khiara Bridges accused Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) of asking ""transphobic"" questions that could ""open up trans people to violence."" While multiple prominent media figures jumped to join Bridges in labeling the GOP senator as ""transphobic"" for preferring the word ""women"" over ""people with a capacity for pregnancy,"" very few are willing to discuss the actual topic of the hearing, and this includes the liberal professor herself.

Asked by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas ) if she thinks ""a baby that is not yet born has value,"" Bridges flat out refused to answer, saying instead, ""I believe that a person with a capacity for pregnancy has value. They have intelligence. They have agency. They have abilities.""



""I said the baby,"" Cornyn stated.

""And I'm talking about the person with the capacity for pregnancy,"" Bridges repeated.

""You're not answering the question I'm asking,"" said Cornyn.

""I'm answering a more interesting question to me,"" came Bridges' completely ludicrous reply.

On the radio program Wednesday, Glenn Beck, Stu Burguiere, and Pat Gray all agreed that the progressive left has completely abandoned reality, and Professor Bridges' outlandish performance just proved it. But the worst part of the exchange is Bridges' arrogance throughout it all — which, Glenn explained, actually may be the flaw that ultimately causes its own defeat.

How Yen's plummet impacts US,"We now know why Japan said it wants to be the first full adopter of the Great Reset: It's about to enter an inflation ""death spiral."" But because of how connected Japan's economy is to America, the crash of the yen could easily lead to a crash of U.S. treasury bonds, i.e. our debt. That alone is terrifying, but it's not the full story: What happened to the Japanese market sounds eerily similar to what's happening now in America, and China is all too aware.

On the radio program, Glenn Beck detailed why our biggest ally in Asia may be on the brink of financial collapse and what it means for America’s economy.

""The Japanese yen has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in more than 20 years,"" Glenn began. ""The why behind the crash is what you need to care about, because it could very easily lead to the crash of our treasury bonds ... our debt. The the Japanese are the largest holder of U.S. treasury bonds in the world. They hold more than China, more than any European country, more than any other entity except the U.S. Federal Reserve. ... Japan holds $2 trillion dollars of our debt.""

Glenn went on to explain how U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the Biden administration refused Japan’s Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki's request for financial intervention as the yen falters, thus forcing Japan to sell its U.S. treasury bonds to shore up its currency. As a result, the Fed would print more money in order to put trillions of dollars into buying the bonds that would now be on the market, causing another spike in inflation.

""That's the story you'll hear if you pay attention to Bloomberg. But that's just a small part of what's going on,"" Glenn warned.

""Right now, [Japan] is at the beginning of the inflation death spiral,"" he continued. ""If they collapse, I mean really collapse, who can bail them out? We can't. We're close to a death spiral. So who bails them out? And what happens when next September, President Xi goes in front of his people's Congress and says, 'Okay, everybody vote. I am dictator for life'? When that happens, if Japan is out, we are so weak, with everything else that is going on, do you think we're going to save Taiwan? How would we even do that? How would the West protect Australia?""

""Prepare for impact,"" Glenn concluded. ""Prepare for impact, because it is happening.""

GOP Rep leaves Aimee Arrambide SPEECHLESS,"During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Republican Rep. Dan Bishop of North Carolina asked abortion rights advocate Aimee Arrambide if she supports any restrictions on abortion at all, even at the moment of birth.

""You testified that you are, quote, unapologetic and seeking unrestricted abortion access. So, I'm wondering, at what point is it not okay to abort a child, what age of gestation?"" Bishop asked Arrambide.

""I trust all people to determine what they can and can't do with their bodies. Full stop,"" Arrambide responded.

""Okay, so you support late-term abortion?"" the congressman asked.

""I support all people and trust people,"" Arrambide repeated.

""Do you support partial-birth abortion? In other words, the child is half delivered and then the woman says, 'my right. I want to take that one out.' Do you support that?"" Bishop asked.

""I trust people to make decisions about their bodies,"" Arrambide said again.

Bishop then inquired if Arrambide would at least agree that taking the life of a two-year-old child would be morally wrong. When she hesitantly agreed, he asked her to explain the principle distinction between a human being that is ""two years old, or nine months old, or one week old, or an hour old"" and one that is ""eight inches farther up the birth canal.""

""What's the difference? Why is it okay in the latter case and not the former?"" he asked.

After several seconds of open-mouthed astonishment, Arrambide repeated, ""I trust people to determine what to do with their own bodies. Full stop.""

""Wow. Full stop indeed,"" exclaimed Bishop. ""And that describes, right there exactly, what this is about. There's a legal issue here when underneath it's a moral issue. It's about reality. It's about science and the advancement of medical technology. You're talking about unborn children, and your 'full stop' is that you will support the termination of a child at any time and that is frightening. And that is why this decision should be turned to the popular will of people and hopefully they'll protect the sanctity of every single human life and live up to the standards of our Declaration of Independence.""





Sadly, Arrambide isn't the only abortion extremist who supports the ""right"" to choose abortion up until the moment of birth. Democratic Texas gubernatorial candidate Robert ""Beto"" Francis O'Rourke recently refused to support any restrictions at all on abortion, during an interview on “The View.""

Sara Gonzales was joined by fellow BlazeTV hosts Chad Prather and Elijah Schaffer on a recent episode of ""The News & Why It Matters"" to talk about Beto's lacking moral compass and the continuing outrage from the Left over the increasingly likely possibility that Roe v. Wade will be overturned.

2nd-graders told to 'send picture of you in bathtub',"An 8-year-old student at Victory Christian Academy in Jacksonville, Florida, was ""administratively withdrawn"" from school after her parents objected to a homework assignment instructing second-graders to “send picture of you doing reading homework in bathtub,” reported parents Misty and Christopher Dunham.

Christopher told CBS-47 that he and his wife were shocked when their 8-year-old said she needed to send a picture of herself in the bathtub doing her reading homework to her second-grade teacher.

""I emailed the teacher [to say] 'Hey, you may want to explain that. Send something out to the parents. Let them know what the intentions are.' This just does not sound OK,"" Misty explained.

Though the teacher responded by adding that students could ""be in pajamas, be in your uniform, have fun with it,"" something about the assignment still ""didn’t sit right,"" Misty explained. So she reached out to the school administrators, who claimed that “we have been sending this homework assignment for years, and you’re the only one complaining about it.""

Soon after, a school administrator called to encourage the Dunhams to ""do a parental withdrawal for the child."" When Misty refused to withdraw her daughter, the administrator said the school was ""going to proceed with an administration withdraw.""

CBS-47 reported that school documentation indicates that the Dunhams' daughter is ""no longer a student at Victory Christian Academy.""

On ""The News & Why It Matters,"" BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales and guests Matthew Marsden, Tayler Hansen, and John Doyle discussed the strange homework assignment and the Christian school's draconian reaction when parents raised objections.

""Just because they say it's a Christian academy doesn't mean that it is,"" Marsden warned. ""You don't do this ... the internet is forever. You take a picture like that, it's out there forever. This is just so weird ... it's just a head-scratcher. Is this where we are in America? This is, it's evil,"" he added.

Beto O'Rourke okays abortion at 9 months on The View,"Democratic Texas gubernatorial candidate Robert Francis O'Rourke (fake Latino name ""Beto"") joined the gaggle of fawning fangirls on “The View"" this week where he ducked and dodged questions and flat out refused to support any restrictions on abortion at all — even up to ""nine months.""

""You're a progressive hero. There are so many people around the country who admire you and your leadership. Do you believe in any limitations on abortion, whether it's the third trimester, or up until even the final months, nine months?"" asked guest co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin.

""I think Roe v. Wade, which we should remind ourselves is still the law of the land today, is the- the- the reference point that I would look to, and the- the- way I think I can best express this is that I trust women,"" stammered O'Rourke.

""We should all trust women to make their own decisions that are in their best interest for themselves, for their health care, and for their future,"" he continued, gaining confidence from the wave of applause. ""That's the way it's been literally my entire life. I'm 49 years old. I'll be 50 this year, but that- that's the way it should be going forward.""

BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales of ""The News & Why It Matters,"" who in March reported being attacked by a campaign staffer and ""manhandled"" while attending a town hall event for O'Rourke, was disgusted by the shameless flattery and fakery between the hosts of ""The View"" and their ""progressive hero.""

""I can't get past this woman calling him a 'progressive hero.' Why? Because he keeps losing elections?"" Sara said to fellow BlazeTV hosts Chad Prather of ""The Chad Prather Show"" and Elijah Schaffer of ""Slightly Offens*ve.""

""Notice he never answered the question,"" Chad commented. ""And talk about cultural appropriation, why is nobody pissed off at Bobby O'Rourke? Why is nobody pissed off at him for using the name 'Beto', to call himself that? I mean, shouldn't the left, by [its] own standards, just be absolutely livid with this guy?""

Emails reveal collusion between Big Tech and Biden admin,"On ""The News & Why It Matters"" Monday, BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales and guests Jaco Booyens, Stu Burguiere, and Dr. Mark Huffman discussed newly released emails obtained by Republican attorneys general that show the Biden administration and Big Tech giants arranged weekly and monthly calls to discuss what to censor on their platforms.

The new discoveries are the result of a ""landmark lawsuit"" filed by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry in May against top-ranking Biden administration officials for allegedly colluding with Big Tech companies to censor free speech on a number of critical topics, all under the pretense of stopping the spread of “misinformation.”

In July, the court required the Biden administration to turn over communications between federal officials and social media giants. While the Department of Justice has turned over some communications, Schmitt says officials have refused to ""produce communications between the most senior officials and social media companies.""

Schmitt took to Twitter on Thursday to share some of the stunning revelations the lawsuit has produced so far:





On Thursday, the two attorneys general filed a joint petition demanding that the DOJ produce those documents.

Elon Musk finds out HALF of Biden's Twitter followers are fake,"Almost half of President Joe Biden's 22.2 million followers on Twitter are fake, according to a recent audit, and Elon Musk — who has put his deal to purchase Twitter on hold over the number of spam accounts on the platform — isn't surprised.

Newsweek reported Tuesday that a SparkToro audit tool found that 49.3% of followers on Biden's official @POTUS account are “fake followers based on analysis of a number of factors, including location issues, default profile images and new users.""

The number of spam and fake accounts on Twitter prompted Musk to put his deal to purchase Twitter on hold last week. The billionaire Tesla CEO discussed the future of Twitter with Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks, and David Friedberg on an episode of the ""All-In"" podcast.

Musk also got into a debate with Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal on Monday over the alleged number of spam accounts on the platform, with Agrawal insisting that bots compose only about 5% of active accounts.

Musk reacted to Newsweek's claim that half of the president's Twitter followers are fake by tweeting: ""So … [checks calculator] … that would be like 10 times more than 5%"".



On BlazeTV's ""News and Why it Matters,"" host Sara Gonzales was joined by Sydney Watson and Alex Stein to talk about why Musk's Twitter buyout has been put on hold and whether he still intends to proceed with the takeover.

'You're SCREWED': Fetterman can’t even convince CNN's Don Lemon that he's 'fit to serve',"On ""The News & Why It Matters,"" BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales and guests Jaco Booyens and Grant Stinchfield discussed Pennsylvania Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman's disastrous interview with CNN host Don Lemon on Tuesday.

During ""CNN This Morning,"" Lemon repeatedly questioned Fetterman, who suffered a stroke in May, on whether he intends to let his doctors take questions from the press before the election. But Fetterman's answers could be described as the very definition of ""word salad.""



""Do you think it would help if you let your doctors brief the press before election night?"" Lemon asked.

""I think we've been pretty transparent. You know, we've had our doctors just be very clear that they're here, that we're able to, and fit to to to serve,"" Fetterman responded. ""From my point, you know, we've been, also been very transparent in terms of showing up at the debate. And very transparent about, you know, having events in front of thousands and thousands of Pennsylvanians for months, and I was again no, it was no secret that I was going to miss some words. I was going to mush some words together, and, as we've been very clear, in the debate and during this interview, I'm, I've been using captioning as well, too. I believe we've been pretty transparent to give all the voters to make it their choice.""

""I'm asking the question for the voters, because the voters may ask, may wonder, is there a reason that you don't want your doctors to take questions? That's why I keep asking,"" Lemon said.

After a lengthy pause, Fetterman added, ""I just believe that we have our doctors just weigh in on that, and they believe that I'm fit, uh, fit to serve.""

Sara questioned Fetterman's claims of transparency, pointing out that the Democratic candidate has refused requests to release his full medical records, and added, ""You know, when you have this guy [Lemon], this CNN hack, who is actually pressing you in this manner and you are a Democrat, you're screwed.""

Why did Kanye REALLY storm out of BIZARRE Tim Pool interview?,"On ""The News & Why It Matters,"" BlazeTV hosts Sara Gonzales and Alex Stein, along with John Doyle, discussed Kanye West’s bizarre interview with podcaster Tim Pool, which ended with West (who now goes by Ye) storming out after a roughly 20-minute unhinged rant about Jewish people.



During a livestream episode of ""Timcast IRL,"" West, joined by Nick Fuentes and Milo Yiannopoulos, unloaded on certain Jewish people — including Obama administration chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and special adviser to former President Donald Trump Jared Kushner — who he claims have conspired to sabotage his career.

West warned Pool that he would ""walk the 'eff' off the show"" if he was asked to defend his claims and promptly followed through with his threat when Pool refused to agree that Jewish people control the media.

""When I found out they were trying to put me in jail, it was like a dog was biting my arm, and I almost shed a tear. Almost. But I still walked in stride through it,"" West complained during a long-winded, meandering rant about his Mar-a-Lago meeting with Donald Trump, anti-Semitism charges against him, and how he believes a Jewish cabal is out to get him.

""I think they've been extremely unfair to you,” Pool conceded, thinking West was referring to the media.

""Who is 'they,' though? We can’t say who 'they' is,” West replied.

""The corporate press,"" Pool clarified. ""I don’t use the word as the way, I guess, you guys use.""

Pool disagreed when Fuentes jumped in to add, ""It is them, though, isn’t it?"" apparently meaning Jewish people.

""What do you mean it’s not?"" West demanded before storming out of the studio, followed by Fuentes and Yiannopoulos.

""You guys want to bring that stuff up and then think we’re not gonna have a conversation?” Pool asked as the three departed.



Sara, Alex, and John talked about the awkward interview, the lead-up to West's sudden departure, and the rapper's recently announced 2024 presidential bid.

Matt Gaetz refuses to apologize to offended pro-abortion protesters,"When asked what he would say to those who are offended by his comments regarding the physical appearances of certain female abortion advocates, Florida congressman Matt Gaetz (R) simply responded with ""be offended.""



Speaking at Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit 2022, Gaetz called ""pro-abortion, pro-murder"" protesters at rallies ""odious on the inside and out.""

""Why is it that the women with the least likelihood of getting pregnant are the ones most worried about having abortions? Nobody wants to impregnate you if you look like a thumb,"" Gaetz asked in a video clip that has been viewed more than 7 million times since Saturday.

Gaetz was asked to clarify his controversial comments on Monday after speaking at a nursing home in Pensacola.

""I'm very pro-life and I make no apology for it. I'm grateful that Roe has been overturned and that Dobbs is now the jurisprudence on abortion. I find these people that go out in these pro-abortion, pro-murder rallies odious and just, like, ugly on the inside and out. I make no apology for it. I don't believe that every person who disagrees with my perspective on life is an ugly person, but the ones that are out there protesting and marching on Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh's home, trying to threaten the court, trying to impose a 'night of rage' on our nation's Capitol, which us what they advertised, that's just pure ugliness. I see that ugliness on the inside, I see it on the outside. Even in the horrible circumstance where an abortion may happen, it is nothing to celebrate and it is nothing to cheer,"" Gaetz stated.

""You're suggesting that these women at these abortion rallies are ugly and overweight?"" asked an ABC reporter.

""Yes,"" Gaetz answered unapologetically.

""What do you say to people who think those comments are offensive?"" the reporter asked.

""Be offended,"" Gaetz shot back.

On ""The News & Why It Matters"" Tuesday, BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales, along with guests John Doyle and Tayler Hansen, discussed the pro-life congressman's controversial comments and asked: Do we need more of this from our political leaders?

WaPo: Stacey Abrams 'repeatedly' denied election results,"The Washington Post's illustrious fact-checker Glenn Kessler debunked current Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams' recent claim that she ""never denied"" the results of the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia when she lost to Republican Governor Brian Kemp.

Kessler listed numerous instances of Abrams claiming that she ""won"" in 2018 and that the election was “stolen"" or “rigged"" and admitted that Abrams ""refused to concede"" to Kemp following the election. He even acknowledged that ""a review of numerous interviews shows that Abrams subsequently used language denying the outcome of the election that she now appears to be trying to play down.""

However, Kessler was also quick to dismiss comparisons between Abrams' version of election denial and that of former President Donald Trump.

""Abrams repeatedly questioned the integrity of Kemp’s victory ... but what might have appeared at the time as a savvy appeal to voters who felt disenfranchised looks different now that Trump and his GOP allies have taken election denialism to a dangerous new level,"" Kessler wrote.

""Moreover, unlike Trump, Abrams has not attempted to rile supporters to violence or call into question the outcome of the election before it takes place,"" he added.

Kessler noted Abrams' recent appearance on ABC's ""The View,"" during which she claimed ""I have never denied that I lost"" after host Sunny Hostin actually praised her for not conceding the 2016 election.

""When you lost in 2018, you didn’t traditionally concede, which I appreciated because you cited voter suppression. Are you confident that this will be a free and fair ... election, and not a repeat performance of what happened before?"" Hostin asked Abrams.



""I have never denied that I lost. I don’t live in the governor’s mansion. I would have noticed,"" Abrams responded.





Watch the latest video at <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com"">foxnews.com</a>





""Now, Abrams is in a rematch with Kemp, fending off questions from reporters that she’s little different from former president Donald Trump, who has falsely claimed election fraud led to his defeat by Joe Biden. In recent weeks she has subtly adjusted [her] language to argue that, unlike Trump, she 'never denied the election' and 'never denied that I lost,'"" Kessler wrote.

""Abrams played up claims the election was stolen until such tactics became untenable for anyone who claims to be an advocate for American democratic norms and values,"" Kessler admitted before launching into a detailed litany of Abrams' election-denial rhetoric.



Abrams recently made headlines for a different batch of bizarre claims about Georgia's six-week abortion ban.

“There is no such thing as a heartbeat at six weeks,” Abrams said at a student forum in Atlanta last week. ""It is a manufactured sound designed to convince people that men have a right to take control of a woman’s body.""

On ""The News & Why It Matters,"" BlazeTV host Sara Gonzales and guests Stu Burguiere and Alex Stein discussed Abrams' extraordinary claims and how the Left has quickly jumped to defend them.

Jean-Pierre refuses to answer Doocy's questions on Biden voicemail,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to answer Fox News reporter Peter Doocy's question about certain ""alleged materials"" on the president's son's now-infamous laptop.



According to a Daily Mail report last week, a 2018 voicemail was discovered on a cellphone backup on Hunter Biden’s laptop that reveals that Joe Biden knew about his son's dubious business dealings in China. The president has repeatedly denied that he ever spoke with Hunter about any of his overseas business dealings.

""Why is there a voicemail of the president talking to his son about his overseas business dealings if the president has said he's never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings?"" Doocy asked Jean-Pierre.

""Well, first I will say that what the president said stands. So, if that's what the president said, that is what stands,"" Jean-Pierre responded. ""And secondly ... from this podium, I'm not going to talk about alleged materials from the laptop.""

Philip Wegmann from RealClearNews wasn't about to let Jean-Pierre off the hook.

Neither were the people on Twitter:

On “The Rubin Report” Wednesday, BlazeTV host Dave Rubin shared the audio recording of Biden's ""alleged"" voicemail and discussed Jean-Pierre's telling reaction when Doocy brought it up on Tuesday.

Aaron Rodgers tells Maher what 'f***ing ruined this country',"Bill Maher sat down with Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers on Sunday on his podcast “Club Random"" to talk about everything from COVID-19 mandates to abortion to former president Donald Trump.

Throughout the podcast, Rodgers repeatedly condemned partisan politics, saying, ""I don’t wanna be part of any politics at all. I believe what I believe. Most of it I based on my own personal version of common sense and I don’t believe in partisanship. Partisanship – two-party system has f***ing ruined this country.”

He and Maher also agreed that the debate surrounding COVID-19 vaccines, mandates, and lockdowns had become ridiculously politicized.

""This is ideology. This is not medicine, this is indoctrination,"" Maher said. ""And to me, the frightening thing was never the disease itself. The frightening thing was how much you could get people so quickly to change their way of life.""



""It was altruistic at first ... like, all right, take two weeks to flatten the curve, right? But then, just about every conspiracy theory came true. Vaccine mandates, vaccine passports ... lockdowns. And that's my whole problem. You know, I grew up in a small town, very little cases up in Chico, California, but all the small businesses? F***ing gone,"" Rodgers said. ""What are we doing for them? What are we doing for the small businesses?""

""We passed out six trillion dollars, but the sad fact about that is that a very big, big, big chunk of it was just flat-out stolen,"" Maher added. ""I mean, we spent more to keep people hiding under the bed than we did for World War II. World war II cost $4 trillion and we passed out almost $6 trillion for this. I mean, wow, talk about a country that's gone a little soft.""

A video clip from the podcast shared on Twitter predictably drew the immediate ire of those who prefer political outrage to the open exchange of individual thoughts and ideas.

On “The Rubin Report” Tuesday, BlazeTV host Dave Rubin — who will be joining Maher's ""Club Random"" podcast for a two-hour uncensored conversation on September 21 — talked about why he respects Maher and considers him to be the ""last sane liberal.""

Elon Musk says that 'it’s time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset' — then Trump fires back,"Elon Musk said that ""it’s time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset"" after the former president called him ""another bullshit artist” during a weekend rally in Alaska.

""I don’t hate the man, but it’s time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset. Dems should also call off the attack – don’t make it so that Trump’s only way to survive is to regain the Presidency,"" Musk tweeted.

Musk recently said he voted Republican for the first time when he voted for Texas Rep. Mayra Flores — who last month flipped a seat in a historically Democrat region along the southern border. But Trump said that Musk ""told me he voted for me, so he’s another bullshit artist.”



Musk also noted that ""Trump would be 82 at end of term, which is too old to be chief executive of anything, let alone the United States of America,"" and added, ""If [Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R)] runs against Biden in 2024, then DeSantis will easily win – he doesn’t even need to campaign.""

In response, Trump took to Truth Social to blast the Tesla CEO and his ""many subsidized projects, whether it’s electric cars that don’t drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere.""

""I could have said, ‘drop to your knees and beg,’ and he would have done it,” Trump wrote.

Musk appeared to laugh off the former president's dig:

Trump next pivoted to Twitter's lawsuit against Musk filed Tuesday to force the billionaire entrepreneur to follow through on his $44 billion deal to acquire the platform. “Now Elon should focus on getting himself out of the Twitter mess because he could owe $44 billion for something that’s perhaps worthless,” he wrote. “Also, lots of competition for electric cars!”

Musk responded to the controversy over his decision to pull out of his Twitter deal on Monday by tweeting a meme with himself laughing about the platform's refusal to disclose ""bot info"" and how the company will be now forced to do so by its own lawsuit.

""They said I couldn’t buy Twitter. Then they wouldn’t disclose bot info. Now they want to force me to buy Twitter in court. Now they have to disclose bot info in court,"" the meme says.

On “The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin talked about Musk's convoluted plan to buy Twitter and Trump’s correct prediction about the deal. Watch the video clip below. Can't watch? Download the podcast here.

CNN’s Jim Acosta lectures Trump’s former DHS chief about 'integrity' — IMMEDIATELY regrets it,"CNN's Jim Acosta invited former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf onto his show recently to talk about a certain controversial topic that was okay to discuss until right around November 2020. This topic, which has repeatedly been voiced by failed 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams to name a few, can no longer be questioned, scrutinized, or even mentioned by anyone on the right, at least according to corporate media lackeys like Acosta.

Wolf, who served under former President Trump, told Acosta that confidence in our election system could be restored if we addressed known ""irregularities"" instead of refusing to acknowledge that there are any problems.

""Our elections are fine,"" Acosta interrupted, but moments later conceded that ""of course, there are some episodes"" of fraud.

""Even if there's a small amount, that is worth coming together and trying to solve that at a national level and at a state level so that we can get past this, so that we have some integrity in our elections,"" Wolf argued.



Acosta accused Wolf of ""spreading doubt and fear about our election process.""

""These are simply facts,"" Wolf calmly responded.

At this point, Acosta jumped up on his high horse and started to preach. ""We need to have integrity among officials who work in the government and who have left the government, uh, who will tell the American people the truth that the election was decided fair and square.""

""We certainly need to have integrity by those reporting the news as well,"" Wolf stated.



""We do have that integrity,"" Acosta claimed. ""But we expect that of our elected leaders and people who work under them because you can't continue to sow these seeds of doubt about American democracy. It's simply failing the American people to continue to lead them down this path of lies.""

""It's not lies, Jim. I'm happy to go through everything that I just said and to go into detail,"" Wolf said.



""It sounds, it sounds, it sounds like you've watched one too many conspiracy films about the 2020 election,"" Acosta stammered.

""No, I'm actually reading the news,"" said Wolf.

On “The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin shared a clip of the exchange and came to the obvious conclusion: ""CNN is still a propaganda network."" Watch the video clip below. Can't watch? Download the podcast here.

Joe Rogan RIPS Biden admin for 'gaslighting' about the economy,"On “The Joe Rogan Experience,” popular Spotify podcaster Joe Rogan ripped into the Biden administration for refusing to admit that the economy is in a recession.

Rogan's guest and fellow podcaster Chris Williamson brought up how the Biden administration is saying that the economy is not in a recession after two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, which until ""very, very, very recently"" was the ""accepted definition"" of a recession.

“Well, that’s gaslighting,” Rogan responded.

“People would think that it’s trivial because they are talking about this economic downturn, but it’s not trivial because we’ve always used that term ‘recession'. And we’ve always used that term to define whether or not the economic policies that are currently in place, and whether or not the management and the government, has done a good job of making sure that the economy stays in a good place. They definitely haven’t done that. So in order to escape that ... they’re literally changing the definition, which is terrible,"" he added.

Rogan asserted that the administration's gaslighting “should be pushed back against in a big way. It should be something that people get angry about, like, ‘Hey, you’re f***ing with definitions in order to pretend that you’re doing a good job.''""

Williamson agreed, adding ""You don't change reality by changing what those words actually mean. But if you can’t control the economy, you might as well just control the language.""

“What a bunch of weasels,"" Rogan replied.

"Kamala Harris refuses to answer, STORMS OFF when asked about migrants bused to her home","On “The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin and guests Viva Frei, Libby Emmons, and Sara Gonzales react to a video clip showing an angry Vice President Kamala Harris refusing to address a reporter's question about the busload of illegal immigrants who arrived near her Washington, D.C., residence just days after insisting the U.S.-Mexico border is ""secure"" during an interview with NBC's Chuck Todd.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) bused approximately 100 migrants from the border town of Eagle Pass to a location near the official residence of the vice president at the Naval Observatory in D.C. last week. Originally from Venezuela, Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico, the migrants were reportedly heading to a local church to receive further assistance getting to their final destinations.

Harris recently went on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and insisted that ""the border is secure"" even after Todd pointed out that nearly ""2 million people [have] cross[ed] this border for the first time ever."" But when she was asked about the 100 illegal immigrants who were dropped off at her doorstep, Harris had nothing to say.

""She's better when she's not talking,"" Rubin said in response to the video.



""They can't keep up with their own rubbish,"" Frei commented. ""They can't keep up with their own lies. They can't keep up with the falsehoods that people are seeing in real-time ... they don't think two steps ahead in terms of consequences of policies, and I'm saying the political left here. [They want] open borders but they're not migrant towns, so long as it stays in someone else's backyard.""

Chris rufo leaves marc lamont hill speechless with response to racist question,"On “The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin sat down for a ""roundtable"" discussion with Manhattan Institute senior fellow Christopher Rufo, Claremont Institute associate editor Spencer Klavan, and Newsweek opinion editor Josh Hammer about how the left tries to reduce people to racial or other ""metaphysical"" categories in order to pit them against each other and fuel ""eternal conflict.""

Dave brought up Rufo's interview with former CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill last year, in which the black TV host repeatedly tried to bait his white guest into making racist generalizations. Rufo argued against categorizing people based on racial identity, saying we should judge each other as individuals regardless of race. Obviously unsatisfied with his guest's refusal to take the bait, Hill repeatedly asked Rufo to ""name something you like about being white.""

A video clip from the interview began with Hill demanding, ""Name something positive that you like about being white.""

""There [are] a lot of documents that are floating around public schools that say things like timeliness, showing up on time, is a white supremacist value or a white-dominant value. Things like rationality, things like the enlightenment, things like objectivity — these are very strange things to be ascribed to a racial identity. My view is that these actually should be ascribed to every individual human being, every individual human being regardless of whatever racial category we impose on them,"" Rufo answered.

""That doesn't answer the question though,"" Hill interrupted. ""You're making strawmen about things that are ascribed to whiteness, that you think are wrongfully ascribed to whiteness. I'm saying if whiteness isn't a negative thing and there's something that you actually, and that whiteness actually shouldn't be constructed as all negative, name something ... that you believe is positive about being white.""

""Again, I don't buy into the framework that the world can be reduced into these metaphysical categories of whiteness and blackness. I think that's wrong. I think we should look at people as individuals. I think we should celebrate different people's accomplishments ... I think of myself as an individual human being with my own capabilities, and I would hope that we could both judge each other as individuals and come to common values on that basis,"" said Rufo.

After a moment of stunned silence, Hill conceded, ""Fair enough.""

Rufo told Dave that reducing people into categories and pitting them against one another is ""how the world has worked for most of its history"" and that ""it's actually a magical thing that we've been able to transcend it as much as we have.""

""I think we still have a way to go,"" he added. ""We need to kind of depolarize and rise above some of these divisions in this country. But I think we can do it, and I think that we have done it and we shouldn't let people like Mark Lamont Hill drag us back down. Whoever you are, if you are black, white, Asian, Latino, straight, or gay, let's treat each other equally and respectfully and give each other a sense of dignity as individuals. Because what we learned in the 20th century, just like the centuries before, is that when you provide people with totalizing identity categories, things can get very ugly and very destructive in a very quick manner.""

Rep Mayra Flores hits back at NYT hit piece,"Texas Republican U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores — who last month flipped a seat in a historically Democrat region along the southern border — hit back at a New York Times hit piece, which ominously warned, ""The Trump age has given rise to a new brand of Texas Republicans, one of whom is already walking the halls of Congress: the far-right Latina.""

The newly elected congresswoman told Newsmax host Chris Salcedo that the Times labeled her and other Hispanic conservatives as ''far right"" because the outlet is ''anti-God, anti-family values, and anti-job opportunities.""

''They don't know us. They have no idea who we are ... they just do not represent our community,"" Flores stated.



'""I feel that nobody really cares about the New York Times, especially in my district, where we're worried about health care. We're worried about the cost of gas, the cost of food. That's what we're worried about, not the New York Times. None of this nonsense that's happening in Washington, not 'Latinx,' none of that. [...] We're focused on the issues that really matter to the American people,"" she continued.

Flores made it clear she does not consider the New York Times to be ""a legitimate news organization"" and said she refuses to ""give them any attention.""

''They claim that they're for immigrants. I'm an immigrant. I'm from Mexico. And yet, all they do is hate me,"" she added.

On ""The Rubin Report,” BlazeTV host Dave Rubin and panelists Sara Gonzales, Nick Searcy, and Rebel News’ Ezra Levant discussed the New York Times' racist hit piece and how Democrats and the mainstream media — who continue to ignore the real issues facing Hispanic voters like inflation and the Texas border crisis — demonize conservative minority leaders when the Hispanic community abandons the left and votes Republican.

Psaki's wild excuse for Harris mask hypocrisy,"On “The Rubin Report” Monday, BlazeTV host Dave Rubin shared a clip of White House press secretary Jen Psaki making outlandish excuses for Vice President Kamala Harris not wearing a face mask on the Senate floor during Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation vote on Wednesday and then again while indoors during Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation to the Supreme Court on Friday.

Psaki first told Fox News' Peter Doocy last week that the vice president wore a face mask before she ""went out"" to the Rose Garden. When Doocy pointed out that Harris was seen giving Jackson a hug without a mask, even after learning that she had come into close contact with her communications director Jamal Simmons who tested positive for COVID-19, Psaki said Harris was having an ""emotional moment"" while ""playing an important role in confirming or overseeing the confirmation of the first Black woman to the Supreme Court.""

The CDC recommends that anyone who is ""up to date"" on vaccines but is exposed to an individual with COVID should wear a mask for ""10 full days"" when in public.

On Monday, Psaki was asked about a video that was shared to Biden's Twitter account, which clearly showed the vice president, along with first lady Jill Biden and others, gathered around President Biden in the Oval Office — all without masks.

""It was an emotional day. It was a historic day,"" Psaki said in Harris' defense. ""There were moments when she was not wearing a mask inside, including in a photo, but she was wearing it 99.9% of the time.""

Dave also shared a clip of Psaki refusing to give a straight answer to Fox News' Dana Perino about when and if the Biden administration’s mandate requiring masks on airplanes will expire or be renewed on April 18.

School head shocks with callous plan for kids who refuse masks,"A San Diego school district has reimposed indoor mask mandates in response to the BA.5 COVID-19 subvariant, and the district's board president has a harsh message for kids that don't comply.

Board President Sharon Whitehurst-Payne for the San Diego Unified School District, the second largest K-12 system in the state of California, said during an interview with KUSI News that currently enrolled students who don't feel comfortable wearing a mask should ""just not return.""

Whitehurst-Payne first addressed students who would be returning in the fall by saying anyone who didn't want to wear a mask ""can go to our school that's online. They can opt not to return to the regular school but to go to the school where they don't have to go to school at all other than via zoom.""

""What about summer school? What if they're already enrolled in summer school and now they get this mask mandate and they're not comfortable with wearing a mask?"" asked the interviewer.

""They should just ... make it known that they don't feel comfortable and at that point, just not return,"" Whitehurst-Payne responded.





""If you live in San Diego and you've got kids in that school, get your kids out,"" said BlazeTV host Dave Rubin.

First bus of illegal immigrants from Texas arrives in DC,"A bus from Texas carrying dozens of illegal immigrants arrived in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday morning, allowing passengers to disembark just blocks away from the U.S. Capitol, according to a Fox News report.

Governor Greg Abbott (R-Texas) announced last week that he directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) to ""charter buses and flights to transport migrants who have been processed and released from federal custody to Washington, D.C.,"" in response to the Biden administration's plan to rescind Title 42.

But critics on both the left and right were quick to slam the Texas governor's plan as a ""publicity stunt"" and ""gimmick"" when they found out that illegal immigrants ""must volunteer"" and ""show documentation from DHS"" to be transported to the Capitol.

Press secretary Jen Psaki said ""I think it’s pretty clear this is a publicity stunt” when asked what the Biden administration planned to do in response to Gov. Abbott's initiative. “His own office admits that a migrant would need to voluntarily be transported, and then he can’t compel them to because, again, enforcement of our country’s immigration laws lies with the federal government and not a state,” she added.

Even Republican state Rep. Matt Schaefer called the plan a ""gimmick"" in a tweet shortly after Abbott's press conference announcing his plan.

Nevertheless, a bus from the Del Rio sector in Texas reportedly pulled up just blocks away from the U.S. Capitol building around 8 a.m. local time on Wednesday, to drop off dozens of immigrants said to be from Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.

""In the last 24 hours, TDEM has dispatched buses to areas where communities have expressed concerns about the federal government dropping off migrants and has the capability to send as many as is necessary to fulfill the requests from mayors and county judges,"" Seth Christensen, chief of media and communications for TDEM, told Fox News.

“From the [Rio Grande Valley] to Terrell County, a large majority of the communities that originally reached out for support through this operation have now said that the federal government has stopped dropping migrants in their towns since the governor’s announcement on Wednesday,” Christensen added.

A tweet from Gov. Abbott's account on Wednesday boasted, ""First Texas bus drops off illegal immigrants blocks from US Capitol in Washington, DC. Biden refuses to come see the mess he’s made at the border. So Texas is bringing the border to him.""

Naturally, the reception on social media was mixed:

Was pushback from critics of gender-affirming apparel the cause? It is hard to tell, but Allie encourages her audience to continue speaking out when corporations cross the line by making harmful products available for sale to the public.

Wokeness can get you fired In this clip, Stu Burguiere covers a story about a man who challenged Black Lives Matter using nothing but data and was fired. Here's the story: ""I had been at Thomson Reuters for over six years—most recently, leading a team of data scientists applying new machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to our legal, tax and news data. We advised any number of divisions inside the company, including Westlaw, an online legal research service used by most every law firm in the country, and the newsroom, which reaches an audience of one billion every day around the globe. I briefed the Chief Technology Officer regularly. My total annual compensation package exceeded $350,000."" Read more ""We live in the era of woke religion,"" says Stu. Listen to the podcast here.

Coca-Cola circumvents Constitution with TERRIFYING mandates on diversity Glenn Beck loves Coca-Cola. So much so, in fact, that he refuses to drink Pepsi if Coke isn't available. But ... he says the time has come for him to give up his favorite soda. Why? Because Coca-Cola just announced some terrifying new company policies on diversity and equity. It sent out notices to all partnered law firms, demanding a required percentage of diverse attorneys on any legal team working for the corporation. The notice says all legal teams also must report these numbers quarterly and they will lose Coca-Cola's business if they do not comply. ""Equity is not the same thing as equality,"" Glenn said, adding that equality means we all have an equal chance, while equality means we all have the same outcome. Glenn explains how mandates like this could affect everybody — even the guy working on the factory line or the truck driver delivering the drinks. Glenn also explains how Coke's new move is nothing less than a circumvention of the Constitution, and he predicts more companies (especially those in support of the Great Reset) will follow with similar policies, too.

Calvin Klein's gender blender ruins sex and Mothers' Day Chad Prather reflected back to the Great Depression era of enticing photographic entertainment, otherwise known as the callow and deprived years of his youth, when a Calvin Klein pictorial of old would have represented something exciting, something to, say, think about at the end of the day. Had he run across this present weird concept at that age, he would have either been disgusted on sight … or possibly really disgusted when his dumb a** put two and two together the next day. Anyway, his point is: Has the whole world gone crazy? Do we really need this? At this inclusive embracing point in our recent history, what in the world makes Calvin Klein feel the need to be the standard-bearer for a lifestyle screamed largely into existence by a very vocal minority?
